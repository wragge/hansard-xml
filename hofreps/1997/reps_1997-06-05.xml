<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent a minister making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of the Aged Care Bill 1997, the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 and the Aged Care (Compensation Amendments) Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I move this motion to suspend standing orders so as to facilitate the House's consideration of this important package of bills which is currently before the House. By moving this suspension and the guillotine motion, we will set up a situation so that we can finish the House's consideration of this legislation today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason there is some urgency about this matter is that this is important legislation and the government is keen to see the passage of the legislation through the House and into the Senate by the conclusion of today's business. I can only conclude that the Labor Party has little desire to see the passage of this legislation in a timely manner. I think all honourable members would be disappointed that, in particular, the shadow minister for social security, the aged and family services, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), sees this as an opportunity to run a scare campaign rather than to contribute in a constructive way to reforming the aged care system for the benefit of senior citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot afford to accommodate a tactic of delay. The Senate's timetable is tight and it is important that this legislation be presented to the Senate without further delay. For any possible outcome that would see this legislation come back to the House to consider amendments following debate in the Senate, the legislation has to go to the Senate this week.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for urgency is that this legislation needs to be passed through both houses before 1 July to enable a full implementation of the total reform package by 1 October. I do not need to remind members that we are in the first week of June, the scheme, in part, is to commence on 1 July and, naturally, with the long delays in the Senate, we cannot afford to dillydally any further. The legislation will enable the income testing component of the legislation to begin on 1 July.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been the end of a long fortnight for the Labor Party. The Manager of Opposition Business has just come in from a crisis meeting with the leader about divisions in the Labor Party. He is worried about the credibility of the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). He is worried about the credibility
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5034"> of  the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). He does not like being accused of walking down memory lane with Pauline Hanson. No wonder he is a bit edgy as he walks in late this morning, knowing full well that this motion was being moved this morning. In fact, I rang his office 15 minutes ago as a final and last&hyphen;ditch attempt to see if we could talk some sense into them, but of course he was not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always indicated that this particular component of the legislation&mdash;namely, the income testing component&mdash;would have to commence three months prior to the start&hyphen;up date of the complete reform package, which is 1 October. The bottom line is that the government has to do all it can to guarantee the legislation's passage through both houses in the month of June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allowing the legislation to stay in the House beyond this week would have placed in jeopardy the start&hyphen;up date of the income testing as well as the general start&hyphen;up date of 1 October. The aged care reform package needs to be implemented by 1 October so that we can start delivering better care to elderly Australians, something that this opposition never did when they were in government and something which they now want to stop when they are in opposition&mdash;even though in terms of the general thrusts, directions and principles of this legislation, it mirrors legislation and they general direction of reforms that they themselves introduced when they were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last guillotine we had in this place, on my quick assessment of the records, was back in 1996. We do not lightly move a guillotine motion. But in circumstances where there is real urgency and where we have been unable to obtain any cooperation from the opposition, we have but no choice in the interests of older Australians to proceed and ensure that this package is dealt with in a timely way by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More generally, I think it is fair to say that both the government and the opposition have benefited from the cooperation which from time to time we have been able to achieve in the management of the business of the House. Whilst today I think does reflect a return to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more base elements within the opposition, I would hope that once this issue is out of the way and properly dealt with we can resume a cooperative and sensible approach to the debating and management of bills before the House.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FILING" NAMEID="QT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr Filing</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is this the new warm and fuzzy leadership?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not new, warm or fuzzy. For example, we were prepared to support a member of the opposition frontbench raising a matter of privilege before the House. Where it is fair and reasonable that the opposition have matters that they want to bring before the House, we are happy to facilitate them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, on Monday we raised the issue of the handling of this Aged Care Bill and the need to have it through by the end of this week. We did say on Monday that we wanted to avoid the guillotine. The opposition's main concern was to ensure that there was adequate time for consideration in detail of this bill, and our response to that concern was to say that we would allow as much time as the opposition basically wanted for consideration in detail. It is fair enough that they should have the opportunity to raise issues in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, quite frankly, done all that we reasonably can to facilitate the debate. We have had 19 speakers so far. We would have at least seven today but for the fact that we are now going to spend an hour on a guillotine motion, which is only depriving people of the opportunity to speak. I think that is unfortunate, but for some sort of tactical reason on the opposition side they have decided that, instead of facilitating the sensible management of this bill through the House, they would prefer to spend an hour on a debate over a guillotine, which I think is a complete nonsense&mdash;but that is the choice that they make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As recently as Tuesday night we have facilitated the reasonable management of the House, for example, on the appropriations bill, where we facilitated 26 opposition speakers in the chamber against 25 government speakers, with nine of those restricting themselves to approximately 10 minutes as
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5035"> against the norm of 20 minutes enjoyed by opposition speakers. I think we were fair in our dealing with that. We have basically twice as many as you people and yet you are getting twice as much time to speak as some of our people. We are prepared to do that in consideration of the cooperative attitude that we take to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under all of these circumstances, we obviously have absolutely no choice. I dare say that the Manager of Opposition Business will tell us that it is jackboots democracy and all the like, and we will be entertained by his fulminations about management of the House. But, in all reality, this bill needs to go through today. It needs to get up to the Senate so that the component parts which start on 1 July can do so. It is a very important part of the reform approach being adopted by the excellent minister that we have in charge of this legislation, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). I compliment her on the work that she is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that, both on the substance of this issue and in the management of the consideration of this bill, the opposition only want to score a few political points. But I think most Australians will appreciate that we have bent over backwards. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What bill? I thought you were moving a motion, Minister. Given that you do not know what else is going on in this place, it is little wonder that you get flummoxed. Let me say this: we are opposing this proposal before the House at the moment because of the lack of process by this oil slick over here, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). He has had the gall to come into this chamber and say we were told about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just say what happened to put this process into perspective: we got a call at 20 past nine or thereabouts to say a guillotine would be moved but it would be moved at 12 o'clock. And here he is, sliding his way into this place at 9.30&mdash;</PARA>

Here is the man trying to get a few more little magazine clips for his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program cameos.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There they are, cheering him on. How many can you count on today? Can I say this to the backbench: I hope he treats you more honestly than he treats us. This is a person whom we have cooperated with in the management of this House. In terms of the appropriation bills, we agreed to the 26 speakers coming into the main chamber on the basis that there would be unlimited time in the Main Committee. There was never any talk there of the guillotine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a bill that ought to be delayed because the community affected by it is calling for its delay. There is so much uncertainty associated with the proposition. The churches and the private providers are saying that the prudential requirements are not known. How are they expected to function in the context of this thing that you are steamrolling through the parliament without allowing due process? The fact of the matter is we always know when you are in strife with your bills: because you come in with the guillotine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the only issue before the House in relation to which they have been in trouble. They want to steamroll this through the House because they know they need legislation. Let me just say this: another piece of legislation which they will not bring into this House quickly is the one that deals with their decision to cut car industry tariffs. The reported story today is the wisdom of Solomon approach&mdash;halfway between&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is not irrelevant because this is a process demonstrating the contempt they are showing for the parliament. They want to steamroll through legislation that they have to bring in, they want to hide other pieces of legislation which they know eventually they will have to bring in and they have to try to placate the backbench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the car industry, the decision today, if it is adopted, will result in not all of the workers of the car industry being sacked but only half of them. That is the wisdom of Solomon. In reality, it is the stupidity of Howard&mdash;the belief that you can have a compromise proposal and the belief that you can ignore what the industry is saying to you and ignore what the rest of the world is doing in terms of their levels of support for the industry. If this decision has been taken by the cabinet, announce it and bring the legislation into this parliament forthwith. Make our day, because this legislation will not pass the Senate. Mark my words: you introduce the legislation to reduce the car tariffs and we will block it in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. So bereft is the Manager of Opposition Business in outlining any objections to what we are doing on the guillotine that he is now talking about something totally and completely unrelated. Its only relationship, even of passing interest, is his leadership ambitions within the Labor Party. It is a bit of a song and dance for the backbench on the Labor side, but it certainly has nothing to do with the matter before the House.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am talking about the way the Leader of the House cannot manage this House and the way
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he is treating this place with contempt by not bringing important decisions before it. That is what I am talking about. This guillotine is but one example of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned this matter in terms of the car industry. The reason you will not bring the car legislation into the parliament is that your backbench is divided on it, and so is your frontbench. The other day the preferred option of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on car tariff reform was reported. Do you know what it was? It was to actually increase car tariffs. This is the first minister to have proposed an increase in tariffs since Black Jack McEwen. No wonder the minister is called `Black Jack'. Members should understand that John Moore is the first industry minister to have proposed an increase in tariffs since Black Jack McEwen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he has been done by the Treasurer, as has been the Prime Minister. The Treasurer was dudding him last night on the importance of tax reform to employment, after the Prime Minister was holding up three fingers. I really reckon that yesterday the Prime Minister had two fingers up in terms of the electorate. This is the person that will not go to Newcastle. This is the person that told the people of Newcastle that he would be there soon. Five weeks have passed and he is still not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where can he go before going to Newcastle? He is going via Lord's. He is going to see the cricket match. He is going to see the Australian cricket team play. But he cannot go to Newcastle. Prime Minister, I just remind you that Newcastle is that place with the smokestacks and is on the way to Hawks Nest. Why don't you go there? Why don't you go and talk to the constituents in the Hunter and in Newcastle about their future? Why wouldn't you meet the delegation from Geelong until you were forced to yesterday, when my colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) has been supporting their call to keep the car industry intact?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got the decision today. What did he tell them yesterday? Did he look that delegation in the eye and say, `Have I got a plan for you on cars'? He said, `I'm going to sack only half of the workers in the car industry. Our approach to restructuring the car
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5037"> industry is to sack half of them, not all of them.' This is the Prime Minister in action, the Prime Minister who will not go to address these issues first hand, and the Leader of the House is incapable of managing the affairs of the place so that we can have decent, open debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply say to you: we will oppose this guillotine motion because this particular bill ought to be delayed. There is so much uncertainty and confusion about it that the whole of the industry is calling for delay and for further consideration. We sought to move a motion in the parliament yesterday to get that delay. We were denied it because the government used its numbers again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government without vision and without compassion. This is a government that has an inability to manage its own affairs. This is a government that is divided in its position on car tariffs. This is a government that has no idea as to how to get industry going and this is a government that has presided over a recession in the manufacturing sector. This was the government that was going to get the economy going. This was the government that was going to create jobs.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the Labor Party at its very worst, full of rhetoric and no substance: rhetoric about their commitment to aged care, a commitment that they did not demonstrate in real terms over 13 years of government. They allowed the nursing home sector to fall into a parlous state and failed to address the urgent needs of the most frail aged people in our community. They have no commitment and they have demonstrated that lack of commitment. Many
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of their speakers have come in here to debate this bill without any commitment to the real substance of the bill and it has been evident in some of the speeches that they have not even bothered to read the bill itself. Clearly they have it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that we do examine the issues and have a wide&hyphen;ranging debate on this issue of importance and substance. What we need is genuine debate on the substance of the bill. We do not need the shadow minister for scare constantly scaremongering and misrepresenting the content of the bill and the substance of the reforms that we are to put into place. Their commitment to genuine debate is appallingly not there. It is just not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government cannot afford to accommodate such delaying and disruptive tactics. The Senate's timetable, we know, is tight and it is important to the most frail citizens in our community that we get on and actually address the failings of 13 years of Labor's mismanagement and neglect in the aged care system. They are living in the past, they talk about all the things they did do&mdash;and they did do some things&mdash;but they started their reform process 10 years ago and then it totally stalled. This is while the shadow minister was in fact advising the then government.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What does the Alzheimers Association want? They are urging you to delay the bill. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association calls the bill `discriminatory and ill prepared'. As it stands, it cannot be supported by the Australian Catholic Health Care Association or by the federal parliament. That is the view of an organisation that represents so many nursing homes around this country. They want this bill delayed; they do not want this bill debated in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Uniting Church, represented by Community Services Australia, says that the government's offer of $5 a day is an insult to the elderly and a slap in the face for charitable service providers. That is what this minister is doing. She is slapping the faces of charitable service providers. This minister treats this nursing home industry with abso

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Community Services Australia, what the Uniting Church homes, are saying is that you have slapped them in the face. Over Fifties Focus are saying that this bill must be delayed. They state in their press release, `The Aged Care Bill to be debated in parliament tomorrow should be immediately withdrawn.' They go even further and say that it should be immediately withdrawn. What should happen, of course, is that it should be withdrawn and we should not be debating it in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do the private nursing homes say? The minister does not have the support of the private nursing homes either. What they are saying is that two&hyphen;tiered aged care seems inevitable. Even the private sector, Minister, is saying two&hyphen;tiered aged care is inevitable. Because of your miserly $5 a day they know that they are going to be providing second&hyphen;rate care for those who cannot afford to pay your disgusting accommodation bonds. That is what they say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do the Anglicans say? Anglican agencies say that the standard of care for the aged is at risk&mdash;because of this minister's disgusting policies, because all of these agencies know that they will not have the money to care for people who are poor. They will not have the money to look after people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at another press release, Minister. I am sure you have seen all of them and you have ignored every single one of them. You have ignored the call from every agency in this country. `Aged care subsidy a poisoned chalice'. You can insult me as much as you like. It does not matter because you are the minister and you are the one who is giving this aged care industry the poisoned chalice&mdash;not me. You are not giving them anything like Labor gave them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am deeply concerned by the disastrous consequences of the Aged Care Bill, which is before the House. I am deeply concerned for the people I represent, particularly the elderly people who face great uncertainty as a result of this legislation. I am deeply concerned for elderly people with special needs. I am deeply concerned for elderly people who have no savings. This bill provides a clear example of the vast difference in ideology which underpins the Liberal and Labor parties. The Liberal Party believes that the individual should be allowed to look after themselves and that market forces will sort it out. We believe the government has a responsibility to look after people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for the people of Australia, the Aged Care Bill was drafted on these laissez faire principles. Up to now, the aged care industry has not been a big money&hyphen;spinner, and in the main nursing homes have been run on a modest profit margin or not for profit. But all this is about to change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people require nursing care, they and their families are often in a state of great emotional upheaval. Time is usually something they do not have. They are in a weak bargaining position. But this bill would have them in a situation reminiscent of the government's individual workplace contracts. The elderly people will have to negotiate with nursing home owners. Mr Howard's advice to younger and more vulnerable employees was that they could always take their mums along with them to negotiate an individual work contract. Elderly Australians wanting to go into nursing homes cannot use this advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who up to this point have been independent must adjust to their loss of independence and privacy when they enter nursing homes. The reality for most people is that, once they enter a nursing home, they are unlikely to return to their own home. However, for many people the fact that their home is still there to return to gives them some hope. If they have to sell their home, as they will under this bill, I really fear for their longevity. Selling the family's home is a final act. The government may as well be putting the nails in the coffins of elderly Australians because that is exactly what this bill will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) again has been quite enthusiastic today to talk about the shadow minister and her past career and activities. Perhaps we need to take a look at the minister's past. As I recall, in her life before she entered parliament the minister was a real estate agent. I stress that what I am about to say is in no way intended to reflect upon the minister's propriety or the standard of her behaviour on the bill. I merely point out to the minister that, if she lives in a house of glass, she should not throw rocks at the shadow minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that, as a former real estate agent, the minister has lots of mates who are still real estate agents. They are the big winners from this bill as elderly Australians are forced to sell their homes, a situation over which they have no power and are not in a position to act in a manner which is appropriate. As people are forced to sell their homes to get nursing home care, there will be more house
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5043"> sales and more commission for the minister's mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that it was not the minister's intention to enrich real estate agents with this legislation, but she should be fully aware of what more scurrilous types will be up to in exploiting elderly Australians. The minister should also avoid trying to pretend that people will not have to sell their houses to get into a nursing home as a result of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an old saying&mdash;and I might distort Shakespeare a little bit by saying it&mdash;`Methinks that the minister protesteth too much.' If the representatives of older Australians, pensioners, providers of aged care, the churches and even private nursing homes are against this legislation, you might ask, `Who is in favour of it, and why is the government crunching it through this morning and restricting debate?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems quite reasonable to have a system of aged care where every older Australian was guaranteed a nursing home bed if they became too frail to care for themselves and their families could no longer cope. Now if you are in this situation, all you have to do is sell your home, pay the bulk of the proceeds over to a nursing home and pay an extra daily fee of $63.30 a day for the first two months, and maybe indefinitely, and then and only then can you have a bed. This is the sort of reform which makes a farce of the government's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seriously, is there anyone in favour? As it turns out, I found one group that is in favour of this proposal: Doug Moran, owner of the Moran Health Care Group, which is Australia's biggest operator of nursing homes. Dougie also happens to be listed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> top 200 wealthy Australians. In fact, Dougie has risen to No. 40 on the list and is worth $250 million&mdash;a quarter of a billion dollars. How did Doug make this quarter of a billion dollars? He made it by charging people for health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have nothing against people making a quid. But, when you are talking about someone with this level of money and when you are talking about someone who has already exerted substantial influence on this government's policy being able to charge people the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> value of their homes less $22,500 to get into homes, I think there is a prospect that Doug Moran will be rising up that list with a bullet in future years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doug's main operations are in Sydney, and we all know the value of Sydney properties, even pensioners' cottages, but Doug has now moved into Melbourne. According to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS>, his `public advocacy of the positives of private health has not harmed his cause with the Kennett government in Victoria'. And we all know how Jeffrey likes to help a mate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is rumoured that Doug was none too impressed by this government's sensible decision to delay implementation of the bill. In fact, the same rumour has it that he was on the phone to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) letting him know just how much that delay would affect his cashflow. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying that Doug has exercised overly undue influence. He said it himself. The disturbing thing is that Doug Moran claims to be the architect of the bill and the adviser to the government on aged care policy. Talk about the letting the fox guard the chickens!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence was given to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee's inquiry into aged care by Reverend Harry Herbert, who is the Chair of Community Services Australia, the national Uniting Church community service organisation. Reverend Herbert said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  interview in which I participated, a private operator, Mr Doug Moran, after having boasted that he was the government's main adviser in this area, was then asked what he thought about the creation of a two&hyphen;tier system. He stated, `Indeed, this will be the case; it will be a two&hyphen;tier system.' He stated further, `This is normal because people in the eastern suburbs drive cars worth three times as much as the cars of people in western Sydney.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is all rather blatant and shocking. I am a bit amazed that Doug Moran can be so brazen, but when you are No. 40 in the top 200 I guess you can put your position quite forcefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doug certainly has taken his bits of the Liberal Party. We would all remember that he warehoused Bob Woods in between being the member for Lowe and being a senator. Appar
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5044"> ently, now he also has former leader Dr John Hewson on the payroll, working as a consultant, particularly in relation to the Victorian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) made a very positive reference in parliament to Doug Moran and the Moran Group. The member for Lindsay said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Groups like the Moran Group are gearing up to take advantage of what can be done in the industry and to start providing some competition, some choice, some diversity and some varied standards of accommodation to meet the increasingly particular needs of the generation of the baby boomers, who tend to be more demanding in terms of services offered and accommodation type.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Lindsay has clearly hitched her wagon to the Moran Group, as have Dr Woods and Dr Hewson. The Moran Group, it can be seen, do not just run private nursing homes; they also run a retirement home for failed Liberal politicians. Perhaps the member for Lindsay is taking out a bit of insurance in case she loses her seat, as I am sure will occur after the next election. Then we can have a troika: Woods, Hewson and Kelly all on the payroll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to what the future brings. This bill really is back to the future in its setting back of aged care. In 1984, the then government brought down a report on private nursing homes in Australia, the Giles report. That report outlined a series of horrific activities run by private health care, activities such as patients being showered at 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. to reduce the strain on daytime staff, patients left shivering naked outside showers waiting for nursing staff to return with towels and patients left for long periods of time in wet or soiled linen. There was a terminally ill patient who suffered a broken humerus when untrained nurse assistants threw him onto a bed. A patient had been tied in a chair and not showered as punishment after she had defecated on the floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the reality of the system this government would introduce. The sorts of photos produced in the Giles report really go to the sort of future we would see if this legislation is allowed to pass. I urge all members to reject this bill. I condemn the government for

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maureen Lister is somebody I know well. I have known Maureen for a long time and I know in this particular instance she is justifying herself, like many lobbyists do on behalf of their organisations. This is her chance and her only chance to put herself on the map, when she could not put herself on the map as a health minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why am I saddened? I am particularly grieved and angry at Aged Care Australia, for instance, which does represent most organisations. Today I have actually heard my own church&mdash;the Anglican Church&mdash;bandied around this place as one of those in opposition to this health care reform bill. I wonder whether the leaders of the Anglican Church know they are being used in such a way in this debate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Aged Care Australia actually say? They said, `Aged Care Australia have supported the general direction of changes.' That is what they said: `We have supported the general direction of these changes.' In fact, the whole industry, all of those people, support the general direction the government is taking. All they are dilly&hyphen;dallying about is some of the finer details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the speakers in this debate have gone through those finer details, and they have been answered by the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan. I have to say that Minister Moylan has given information on a grand scale to everybody who has asked for it. We have Aged Care Australia saying, `We actually support these changes,' yet they have come along and they sent faxes out yesterday saying, `But there are parts of it we don't support.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this one of the worst days I have had? Back in the late 1960s, I was coopted on to a committee to raise funds for a local nursing home. In around 1969 I was first confronted with those people in our community&mdash;outside my own family&mdash;who were particularly aged and in need of care, those people who did not actually have the money to look after themselves when they were aged.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Communities right across Australia recognised that. We need to come into this parliament and think about who we are here for&mdash;the very young, the very old, the vulnerable. We have put this aged care package together on behalf of those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been saddened by the front pages I have seen in my own local newspapers where decent people have been rolled out in wheelchairs and photographed for the front pages. Aged Care Australia have put out a general kit for communities to use with their local newspapers. They have taken a photograph of some vulnerable, elderly person, whacked it on the front page of a newspaper and said, `Here we are. We're opposed to what you're doing on aged care because it may upset our pyramid of what we are doing locally.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of bills is about looking after older Australians. This is about addressing the issues of concern to all people, to every family. If you are like me and you have been through it with your own father, you know that we have to put extra effort and extra care into an ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot as a government walk away from these reforms. These are the things the former Keating and Hawke governments wanted to do but never implemented. These are the changes that need to be made on behalf of the frail, aged Australians so everybody gets a fair go, so there is some equity in the system and so everybody gets fair access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in my electorate these changes will benefit all in the long term. Yes, there are some areas that need to be monitored, and the minister has said, `The areas you're concerned about we are prepared to monitor. We're prepared to relook at them. We're prepared to see how the accommodation bond progresses.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day I was with a group of ethnic elderly in my community, and it was really worth meeting with them. Do you know what they were mainly concerned about? They were mainly concerned about this issue, because they had just been told a whole string of mistruths about what the government was doing in aged care.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5046">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have said is, `We're trying to introduce here the same system&mdash;a similar system&mdash;that has been in place for hostels into nursing homes.' To do that and to match them, there are some difficulties because we have a system currently that needs to be changed. Any time you introduce reform and there is a political process to be carried out in this country&mdash;which, I remind you again, is what I am seriously disappointed about today on this issue, and I do not think I will forget it for a long, long time&mdash;there is always people who are concerned about the process. I think I understand that better than most. But we have to work on behalf of the people whom we serve, on behalf of the clients in the nursing homes and on behalf of all of those people who work within them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate all those workers within my electorate. I have the best people working at an administrative level and at a committee level and the best people doing the direct caring for those people who are older and frail and for those who have dementia. We have more people with dementia in our system now than we have previously had. The ageing population is causing the need to address that issue. These bills do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have worked gradually through this. We have given extra time. We have grandfathered those areas that need to be grandfathered and we have explained that. Where there needs to be slow adjustment and slow change, we are quite prepared to do that on variable fees. Where did that come from? That came from Aged Care Australia. They said, `We're happy with most of the changes, but we would like you to grandfather variable fees.' So we did that. Throughout the whole of Australia, people have been given time to change. There are issues to work through, but I know that the community as a whole will back the changes that we are making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speakers in this debate have been right. When it comes to your family and you are looking for care for your elderly parents, you do not want to be travelling. It is difficult in the region where we are, especially in Gippsland&mdash;and a number of speakers who come from regions have mentioned this&mdash;to have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> your elderly parents split up or to be 100 miles away from care and attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, when I hear words like `nails in coffins' on an issue like aged care, I say that we are not actually looking at and caring for those people who we are directly responsible for. This government and the opposition have a responsibility not to frighten elderly people but to send a message out into the Australian community that we are concerned and that these changes will be beneficial to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sending a message now to Maureen Lister. If she continues with this program&mdash;I will send this message to you, Maureen, because you know that I have worked with you for a long time on issues such as this&mdash;it will be a great sadness that elderly people are threatened for party political purposes. This is unfair. It is not right. It does not edify this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is wrong for a failed health minister to be running the program and for the shadow minister to be the parrot for Maureen Lister on this issue. Aged care is very important to all Australians. With this bill we will make sure that older Australians are cared for, that they get equity, that they get opportunity and that they get the sort of care we would want our own parents to have.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5047">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate it is fair to say that I very rarely receive correspondence about matters of national importance. There have been major debates in the New South Wales and federal parliaments on moral issues about which very few of my constituents corresponded with me. I cannot think of many issues which have caused a thousand voters to sign a petition, as in this case, against these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is so constant in their criticism of the shadow minister because they know the arguments advanced are having an effect out there in middle Australia. When the shadow minister visited my electorate, we had probably the largest public meeting on any issue since the Vietnam War and conscription. The people who attended that meeting came away not scared or overwhelmed by terror but facing realities about where this government is going with regard to home care. As a result of that, a significant number of people signed this petition of their own initiative&mdash;not on street corners by the Labor Party or the unions or some pensioner group, but off their own bat from that meeting and from ringing up our office. That is why we have this constant bemoaning of the need for groups like the Anglican Church to take up this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Typical of the way this issue is penetrating middle Australia is the Ukrainian community in my electorate. That is interesting because we all know that, until the last three or four years and the collapse of the Cold War, that community have been archetypal supporters of the current government. I had approaches from the Ukrainian Welfare Association and from individual Ukrainians in my electorate, a very significant electoral force. They want to be organised. They want to be involved. They are requesting it. They want to fight this campaign very strongly. That is the reality out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the reality of John Howard, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 5 December 1996 said with a bold headline `Howard endorses plan for elderly to go into debt'. It was all right to hear the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) talking a few nights ago about how the government's paltry savings proposal is something at last for those people who have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saved and those people who have purchased a home. Well, she should use the same rhetoric with regard to this bill because, quite frankly, those people are under a major assault as a result of the changes the government is suggesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer to two pieces of correspondence I received on this matter. Once again, I absolutely repudiate and reject the notion that everyone who opposes this government's policy&mdash;whether it be particular nursing homes, individuals, elderly people, veterans groups or, as in this case, the Bankstown Frail Aged Persons Home Trust&mdash;is a moron, does not understand what is going on, is manipulated or is stupid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, this Bankstown Frail Aged Persons Home Trust, predominantly in the electorates of the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), which I had dealings with as a former state member, are not stupid. They were one of the first councils in this country to establish their own network of elderly people's homes. They have been in the marketplace. They know the industry. They have been active for decades. These people, at the conclusion of a long letter which very strongly criticised the costing process and the assistance for those people that are basically concessionals, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for any residents in excess of 20%, regardless of what socio&hyphen;economic area they came from the Government should pay the same rate per day the organisation would get if the person was a full accommodation bond paying resident. That is $19.18 per day. This would be equitable, it would not be discriminatory and would be uniform across all socio&hyphen;economic areas. An organisation would not be penalised because it is trying to provide care in a poorer area compared to another charity trying to provide the same accommodation to the same standard in a more wealthy area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are making a very fundamental point that in the area they represent they will be forced to basically go into bankruptcy, to go into a period of not being able to maintain their premises, because of the high number of concessional people they will take. I will read into the record what I regard as a fairly articulate explanation from one of my constituents about this matter. She states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5048">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government did not inform the public during their election campaign of their intention to foist this iniquitous impost on the people, and therefore they have no mandate to do so!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any vague references they may have made to means tests were inadequately explained and lacking in detail. Indeed they actively sought to avoid giving the voters any specific details on most issues . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the support that the coalition gained at the expense of the A.L.P. would certainly have come from elderly people who would become potential nursing home entrants in the relatively near future. Now the coalition is betraying those people in the most callous, cowardly and cynical manner possible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Furthermore:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of all of Australia's frail and elderly battlers, I ask you Mr. Ferguson, to please spare no effort in having this iniquitous, cowardly and completely un-Australian attack on those least able to defend themselves overturned.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This letter was from Ruby Gibbons of Berala. I do not think, from the three&hyphen;page letter this woman has written me, which covers the issues very broadly and which asks me to fight the legislation very strongly, that she is under any misapprehension about the kinds of serious changes this is going to cause in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a complaint from the previous speaker, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent), about the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) quoting a survey of the inhumane treatment people receive in nursing homes in this country. As the member for Grayndler pointed out, it was clearly under the previous government. I want to refer to that. In one of the more impressive and more aggressive contributions from those opposite, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus)&mdash;who should be in the place of the current minister but who unfortunately had the unpalatable task of trying to defend this government's previous Aboriginal policies in opposition&mdash;bemoaned the question of bureaucrats running around the place requiring standards. In a fairly longbow approach, she complained about people supposedly having to write down every five minutes how much they were scrubbing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the thin edge of the wedge of the government's complaint essentially about the previous government. We have seen exposes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of the kinds of conditions people live in and the chains that operate in this field which are basically out there for the big dollar. The previous government, quite clearly, quite strongly, intervened to make sure there were standards in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When those opposite complain about bureaucrats interfering too much in nursing homes, what they are essentially saying is that they do not want standards. They want them undermined. They do not want people like me, as a federal member, to be able to say to the local papers in my area that this nursing home met this standard and that one met that standard. They do not want that kind of thing. Despite all the rhetoric about how the nursing homes are a shambles and how maintenance has fallen, this policy is essentially driven by the private operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three main issues to be covered are the introduction of entry charges to nursing homes, arrangements for concessional residents who cannot pay entry fees and the move to a uniform system of income related fees for both nursing homes and hostels. Until now, access to nursing homes has been based on assessed medical need, not on capacity to pay or entry contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the bill, the government will force people who enter nursing homes after October to pay what they euphemistically call an accommodation bond. There is no upper limit proposed for the entry charge, provided that the resident is left with assets of at least $22,500. The industry claims the average entry fee could be $40,000 and over $100,000 in some cases. The value of the intending resident's home is taken into account in calculating this asset level, except where a partner or dependent child still lives there or a close relative or carer who has lived there for at least five years and is eligible for a social security pension or benefit still lives there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, under these arrangements many senior citizens whose health is deteriorating, particularly those who are single or widowed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5049"> and who own their home, will be required to sell their home or take out a loan to raise the coalition's nursing home entry fee. Their assets, chiefly their home, will be considered too high for them to get an exemption from the entry fee. This category would doubtless include a considerable number of war widows because DVA data shows that, out of the 97,000 war widow pensioners, some 78,000 or over 85 per cent are aged 70 years of age or older and are thus in the group most at risk of needing residential care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than 60 per cent of those entering nursing homes come straight from hospital after serious illness, such as a stroke, or suffering from dementia. It would be hard to imagine a more vulnerable starting point for bargaining about entry fees. In contrast, most people entering hostels have time to look for the hostel of their choice, taking into account the quality of facilities, entry charges, et cetera. The minister says that the so&hyphen;called accommodation bond:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will operate as a capital deposit which the provider holds while the resident is in the facility. When they leave it is refunded, less a modest contribution of up to $2,600 indexed per year for up to five years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This means that the nursing home owner will pocket $13,000 over five years plus any interest that accrues out of the entry fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the intention of the entry fee is to shift the capital cost of upgrading aged care facilities from the government and operators to the frail aged and their families. Under the bill, the government will all but cease providing capital funding for residential care, saving for themselves $244 million for further headlines over four years. The government retains capital funding for a mere $10 million for special purposes mainly in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill's provisions are consistent with the ideological agenda of Treasurer Costello's National Commission of Audit, which is the coalition's social policy road map for the future. Based on DSS and Taxation Office data which suggests that just over 30 per cent of Australians over 60 have assets worth $50,000 or more, excluding the home equity,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the commission&mdash;as I say, the guiding force, the ideological bent of the government&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a high proportion of our retired population are in a position to meet at least a significant share of the costs of their own health and care needs. The Commission is not questioning the policy objective of providing nursing home assistance to those in need but is questioning whether the preservation of clients' wealth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as we know in this case, not too much wealth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at the expense of the rest of the community, should be part of that policy objective . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst the government did not directly accept the commission's specific recommendation that it recover from estates the full cost of nursing home benefits provided to asset&hyphen;rich senior citizens, this bill seeks to achieve much the same outcome via a different method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As confirmation of this, I quote from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who said last December that it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . fair and reasonable to say to that person you should borrow some money against that [home] and, if it is not paid before you die, it will be paid out of your estate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said that on 5 December in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> . As shadow minister for veterans' affairs, I am particularly concerned at the likely impact of these measures on the ex&hyphen;service community. It should be remembered that some 85 per cent of those who are under the protection of the veterans' affairs portfolio fall into this age category. As the ageing process and the strains of their war service take their toll, a growing number face the need for residential care in the very near future and will be slugged by the coalition's nursing home entry charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In lieu of the entry fee, nursing home operators receive a mere $5 a day of extra government subsidy for concessional residents whom the government assesses as being unable to pay an entry fee. This means that the annual subsidy for concessional residents is $1,725 a year. By contrast, a nursing home can draw down $2,600 a year plus interest from a better off resident's entry fee. This will create an obvious incentive for operators to minimise the number of concessional residents in their facility and favour the wealthy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5050">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says that every nursing home will have to set aside 27 per cent of its places for concessional residents, who will not have to pay an entry fee. She claims that this will ensure that access is based on needs, not means. This claim is clearly untenable if, as predicted, concessional people represent more than 27 per cent of applicants for care. The nursing home industry has predicted that up to 55 per cent of applicants will be in the concessional category, more than twice the number of the reserved places they are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must also be doubt about the minister's ability to guarantee observance of the 27 per cent quota, quite frankly. The outcome is likely to be a two-tier system where concessional nursing home places, on the one hand, will be in extremely short supply, but where the better off, on the other hand, can afford to be choosy. This offends against the basic principle that nursing homes should be part of society's health safety net, with admission rationed according to assessed medical need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the likelihood that older people with assets just above the cut-off point for the concessional resident definition will face particular dilemmas. They will have neither the guarantee of the reserved concessional places, no matter how inadequate these will be in number or quality, nor sufficient savings to pay the going rate in their area for the entry fee that the better off can afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter is of particular concern to the veteran community. Quite frankly, the minister concerned should be in there batting for the 85 per cent of affected veterans in this country. To my mind this portfolio is far more crucial than his new occupation as a film critic. It is far more crucial than press releases about everything under the sun, except the crucial social security problems that this community faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the member for Lilley said&mdash;admittedly in a different context, in defence of their savings policy&mdash;that many of these people have struggled and worked hard. Quite frankly, as this government well knows, if there is one issue that has them on the back foot, it is this. There is anger out in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian community. There is anger from middle Australia about the way in which they have been misled over these matters.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="5050" TIME="11.01 a.m." SPEAKER="Marek, Paul, MP" NAMEID="LK6" ELECTORATE="Capricornia" PARTY="NP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LK6">Mr MAREK</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Capricornia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.01 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to talk on an issue that is most important to my electorate and one which I feel very passionate about. The debate on the Aged Care Bill 1997 and two cognate bills provides me with an opportunity to make people aware of the burning need not only to address the administrative and operational structure within aged care but also discuss the present lack of government funded beds and pass on to everyone what I am doing to address this very problem in Capricornia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, let us look into the operational side of the debate which this legislation effectively works to put right. This legislation will bring about significant structural reform to the way aged care works and make it more viable and sustainable. It will ensure fairer access to higher quality standards of care and accommodation. I also strives to address the problem of trauma which is caused by relocation to alternative facilities to get appropriate care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation introduces strong protections for consumers and creates incentives for providers to invest in maintenance and improvements to buildings. It means that people who can afford to pay more towards the cost of their care and accommodation will do so, at the same time securing equal rights of entry to residential aged care for those who cannot afford to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at that previous statement and compare it with what the opposition is rumbling on about, it makes you ask a question about commonsense. Sometimes you must wonder whether commonsense is really common. I say this with regard to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), the shadow minister for social security, the aged and family services, whose argument is that she wants to put all the money into the pockets of future beneficiaries and to place all the burden of aged care on to the taxpayers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have a problem with people handing on family wealth, but let us be frank: the people in my electorate tell me that they do not begrudge anyone a fair go; in fact, many  people say that we should put more money
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5051"> aside to help the elderly, like increasing the Medicare levy, and that money be focused directly to aged care. The reason for this is that the elderly have worked hard in the past for the betterment of this country and they should be able to spend the latter years of their lives without stress and in a serene environment. But someone requiring nursing home care or the like who has sufficient wealth should pay and contribute to their care. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party argues, with the socialist welfare mentality, that the government pays for everything, thus driving the country into severe debt, like we were in after 13 years of the past Labor government. Do not forget the Australian Labor Party government's welfare mentality of spending the government's funds. But I say that it is not the government's money; it belongs to the taxpayers of Australia and this spendthrift mentality of the ALP is what lost them government in March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on, I now have the pleasure of putting a Labor Party lie to bed. It is in relation to the grubby picture that the Labor Party is painting in Rockhampton about the number of beds being funded at the Eventide Nursing Home facility. It was of interest to see that Gareth Evans, the member for Holt, took time in the past week to visit Rockhampton in my electorate of Capricornia&mdash;nice of you to look me up. While in Rockhampton, Mr Evans visited Eventide Nursing Home. How appropriate that he should see first&hyphen;hand the problems that are being experienced at Eventide with reduced bed numbers. This is a sad case of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some might ask why we have reduced bed numbers at Eventide Nursing Home in Rockhampton. Mr Robert Swarten, the Labor Party state member for Rockhampton, the then state Minister for Health, Mr Beattie, and Carmen Lawrence, the member for Fremantle and the then minister for health, know why. In fact, Mr Swarten and Mr Evans appear to have been telling a few pork pies here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now back to Gareth Evans, the federal member for Holt. I hate to be the giver of bad news, my friend, but it would appear that your state colleague has dropped you right in it, old chap. We do not have to wait for the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> answers with regard to the reduced bed numbers at Eventide; I have the answer right here. The previous Labor government signed off to reduce bed numbers. Yes, that is right&mdash;cuts. The Australian Labor Party cut the funding to the Queensland public nursing home beds, in particular, Eventide Nursing Home at Rockhampton, while they were in government in October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland state Goss government notified the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence, in November 1995 that they would accept the federal plan. In January 1996 the program started. What is more, under the plan the numbers would be cut to 60 rather than 80 at Eventide. It was interesting that Mr Robert Swarten dropped this in the media the other day. You can see why he knew all about it&mdash;because he was involved in it. Thankfully for a coalition state government in Queensland, they have funded the additional 20 beds to ensure that the facility will have 80 beds at Eventide in Rockhampton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Gareth Evans has had the audacity to say in Capricornia media that the reduction in beds from 129 to 80 is a matter which should be taken up with Mr Paul Marek, the federal member for Capricornia. Mr Evans, you are a hypocrite. How does it feel to be a member of a party that sets you up and is responsible for putting so many elderly electors in the community out of nursing home beds? So much for Labor government nursing home reforms! It makes you wonder where they are going to stop. It was the Labor government's so-called nursing home reform funding cuts which caused the lack of nursing home bed numbers in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing on this grubby affair and putting to bed once and for all the issue of bed numbers at Eventide and who cut them, I say to the people of Rockhampton and Capricornia: I condemn the Labor Party for their gross continuation of innuendo and lies. The Labor Party should remember this issue at the next election. I know the people who need beds in Capricornia will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has no clothes and cannot be trusted. It is funny that the Australian Labor Party here are trying to cast off the  perception of old Labor and they want to be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5052"> known as new Labor. The problem here is that you cannot change your name and expect the public to change their perception of you, because you are all just a bunch of hangers&hyphen;on from a failed, distrusted, conceited Keating Labor government. The future of Labor members will be judged at the next election, and their actions and statements should be treated with the contempt they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a more positive note, I am happy to be part of a government which has devised reforms which will do what Mr Gareth Evans, Dr Lawrence and their Labor colleagues have failed to do: increase bed numbers and provide quality facilities to our aged. Nursing homes, hostels, carers et cetera are sick and tired of being pushed from pillar to post in trying to get government assistance to meet the demand being placed upon them for additional bed places, care packages et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From day one as the federal member for Capricornia, I have received submission after submission from nursing homes and hostels seeking funding for more bed places. Bureaucrats say we are over the benchmark. If that is the case, why do nursing homes and hostels continually ask to have the problem with placement fixed and why are waiting lists so long?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was time to find out for myself, so I commissioned a study within the electorate of Capricornia in response to aged care related concerns expressed by constituents. The survey is being undertaken at this very moment by Mrs Ashley Reid. She comes very highly recommended from all sectors of nursing and aged care, and brings with her a wealth of knowledge and expertise in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The study will be conducted without prejudice and in a competent and professional manner, ensuring fairness and equity for all. Even though the study is in its infancy, it has identified many things so far, including the concerns of non-government nursing home/hostel administrators with regard to the speed of the introduction&mdash;on 1 July&mdash;of the Aged Care Bill 1997. Once again, this government has listened to the people of Australia, and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has announced that the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> implementation of the entire aged care reform package will commence on 1 October 1997. What more can people ask for than a government that is listening to the people of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this government has&mdash;unlike the previous government, which sat on their hands and watched the standard of nursing homes decline&mdash;introduced reforms which will provide certainty and flexibility for our aged. I welcome these changes, and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), referred to the Aged Care Bill as the aged care reform package. That is obviously the line the government is using for this piece of legislation. I have to say that it always worries me when particularly conservative governments talk about reform because we know someone is about to get it in the neck. With this cost&hyphen;cutting measure&mdash;and that is all this is&mdash;the people who are going to get it in the neck are the pensioners and the old people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill unfortunately shows that the government does not understand what is happening in this area of aged care. The government is mixing apples with oranges. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said in her rather puerile  speeches that all the government is doing is applying the same rules to nursing homes that the government applies to hostels. That is ridiculous because nursing homes and hostels are not the same. Anyone who has taken an interest in this issue over the years knows they are not the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the dramatic differences between hostels and nursing homes were introduced in the early 1980s. Before the Labor government changed the rules then, people were able to sign themselves into a nursing home. We stopped that. The only way people can get into a nursing home now is if they are put there by a doctor or an assessment team. To say that hostels and nursing homes are the same is as ridiculous as saying that going to the chemist for some cold tablets is the same as being admitted by a doctor to a hospital for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5053"> pneumonia. One is a lifestyle problem; the other is life threatening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people make lifestyle changes during their life. People might sell their family home when they are in their 50s or early 60s, when their children have grown up, to go into a townhouse. Some time later on, perhaps in their late 60s or early 70s, they might sell their townhouse to go into a retirement village or a hostel. These are lifestyle changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But people being put into a nursing home is a change decided by their doctors and an assessment team. Sixty per cent of people who go into nursing homes are admitted straight from hospital.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, come back and listen to this, Bronny. It is important. The government are vacating the chamber. The government will not even have a minister stay here and listen to this debate. That shows how uninterested they are. We just heard the shadow minister for veterans' affairs speak on this bill, but the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel was probably busy leaving the chamber to try to get another set of medals minted which she cannot give to anybody, while at the same time the government are trying to take money off pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to hostels and nursing homes, the government does not understand the issue, the government does not know the difference between the lifestyle change of going into a hostel or a retirement village and the life threatening change of going from, usually, hospital into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) does not understand the issue. During her contribution to the debate she asked what was wrong with people having to sell their home and said that the government was trying to be equitable in making the rich pay. This bill is not an attack on the rich. If it were an attack on only the rich, the opposition would be supporting it. But this bill is an attack on the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not admit that this bill imposes an effective 91 per cent tax rate on part pensioners. If you impose a 91 per cent
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effective tax rate on part pensioners, how can that be an attack on the rich? There are not too many part pensioners that I know who are rich. Certainly in my electorate of Watson, which has a lot of nursing homes in it, the people who are in those nursing homes are invariably poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, in relation to the people of my electorate who unfortunately have reached a stage in their life and health that they have to go into a nursing home, will result in such people having to sell their house to gain entry. We have heard a whole range of people in the industry say that the amount of money the government talks about as the up-front fee is a fiction. The Benevolent Society of New South Wales, who are decent, honest people who would not lie to the Australian community, have said that an up&hyphen;front fee will cost $88,000. Where does a pensioner who lives in a small semi-detached house in my electorate, after working most of their life on the council or in a shop, get $88,000 from, apart from selling their house, to go into a nursing home if they have got sick?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is trying to attack these people during probably the most traumatic time in their lives. As I said, 60 per cent of people who go into nursing homes go there straight from hospital. Under the regime that we ran, if a person went from hospital into a nursing home or they were admitted into a nursing home by their doctor and the assessment team, for the purpose of the assets test, the house that they owned was not considered as an asset for a couple of years. So people could go into a nursing home and still have the hope that ultimately they would get better and be able to return to their home. At that very traumatic time in their life when either they are going from hospital into a nursing home or their doctor has told them they cannot cope anymore at home with their family or relations, the government is now saying to them, `And, at the same time, you've got to sell your house to get the $88,000 to get in.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot of trite discussion by the government about the people of Australia and how much they mean to it. But let us look at who these people are that the government is  attacking in this bill. This is a generation of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5054"> Australians who have made this country what it is. This generation of Australians, who are in their 70s and 80s and are now going into nursing homes, went through the Depression, went through the Second World War, went through the hard times after the war and made this country what it is today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this government say to them? It says, `When you get old, and when you get sick when you get old and you are so sick that you need to go into a nursing home, we're going to make your life even more difficult. We're going to make you decide whether you're going to sell your house.' Imagine the situation where some poor old lady or poor old man in their 80s has just come out of the hospital after having had a heart attack or something and is put into a nursing home, and then the real estate agent comes around&mdash;the profession that the current minister worked for before she got into this parliament. All the real estate agents will be very happy about this new policy; they will love this. When these old people are ill and have just been put into a nursing home, the real estate agent will come around and say, `Have I got a deal for you to sell your house.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can people at that time in their lives make a decision about selling the asset they have spent their lives accumulating? If this bill attacked only the rich, it would not be a problem. The rich old person does not worry about this; they just gasp out, `See the accountant, see the lawyer,' because they have a phalanx of them there. But the fanciful idea of the poor people in my electorate who have to go into a nursing home having to deal with this sort of thing at that age and stage of their lives is appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand how a government that says that it has any thought for these people wants to do this. Kind and decent people, like the Benevolent Society and a very large charity in my electorate called Saint Basil's Homes, which is a very large group charity, write to me and tell me that this bill is terrible. Saint Basil's Homes wrote to me and said, `We consider the following issues about this bill to be of the greatest concern.' They say there is an unrealistic time line to implement reforms effectively by 1 July, given the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lack of current detail in the bill. They say there is incompatibility between the Commonwealth legislation and state and territory legislation and that there are risks of further inefficiencies and duplication of monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They say that the prudential arrangements worry them, that it is vital for the credibility of the new system, and they have not yet been finalised. They say there is a lack of detail about funding levels and that this poses the dilemma for adequate financial planning in preparation for the new financial year together with the uncertainty over whether the new levels will be adequate to meet the care needs of residents. Saint Basil's Homes are also concerned about the inadequate indexation and growth of funding levels. They are also concerned about the lack of clarity and unnecessary complexity in the Aged Care Bill. They are also concerned about the lack of provisions for any external complaints handling process. So you will put these people in there now and they will not have any chance to complain. They are also most concerned about the confusion and rhetoric applying to the policy objective of `ageing in place', which is the government's sham proposal in this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will take another line to save the honourable member for Watson getting his daily exercise jumping up and down. Everything that has been contributed by the opposition to the debate has simply been untrue. The member for Watson just spent 10 minutes running the line that we have heard time and time again that is intended to frighten people. He went down the track of dragging out a very emotional and correct issue, and I acknowledge the fact that the people we are talking about are vulnerable. The people we are talking about are at the stage of their lives when they are entitled to enjoy security and a quiet retirement. This legislation aims to allow that to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Watson comes in here talking about this being an attack on the poor. He admitted that `I can't understand.' The fact is he does not understand. If he did understand then he would not have made the sorts of outrageous statements that he made in his contribution. That is why the government has taken the step of bringing this debate to some conclusion&mdash;to prevent that sort of approach being taken. It does no credit to the member for Watson, nor has it done any credit to the shadow minister, to keep raising day after day in this place the same issues&mdash;which are absolutely untrue&mdash;about this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged care is a big issue in Australia. With our ageing population we obviously have to  do something to address the problems. What
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5056"> did the former government do about the problem of nursing home bed shortages?&mdash;nothing. I have raised with previous ministers on occasion after occasion the fact that there is in my electorate, as there is in many electorates, a chronic shortage of nursing home beds. What was done by the former government?&mdash;absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was done by the former government about standards in nursing homes? Whilst the system which they introduced of charging accommodation bonds for entry to hostels was in place we had a rapid improvement in the standards of hostel accommodation. We have a lot of very fine hostels now. What was happening to the nursing home sector while all this was going on? Standards were running down. What did the former government do about that?&mdash;nothing. They stood by and allowed our elderly people in a lot of cases to live in nursing homes that were almost of Third World standard. I hate to say it, but I have been to some of those nursing homes and I have heard complaints about some of those nursing homes and, frankly, I would not want any of my aged relatives to live in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation represents an attempt by this government to do something about the problem, where nothing was done about it by the previous government. Dementia is a major health problem for our elderly citizens. What was done about dementia care by the former government? Nothing. This government comes to office and goes about addressing that problem by putting additional funding into place to address that issue and what do we get for it? We do not necessarily want thanks but we want an honest representation; we want the truth told in this place about what this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On coming to government we inherited a mess in the nursing home industry. I defy the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who will speak after me, to deny that the nursing home sector was and is, or at least will be until we have introduced these changes, in a mess. There were shortages and there were poor standards. At the time we came to government, 11 per cent of nursing homes did not even meet Australian fire standards; 15 per cent of nursing homes did not meet state
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> health standards, and 40 per cent of nursing home patients were in  wards with four or more people. The sector was in an absolute mess. So we set about attempting to fix it in a very reasonable way with wide consultation going on over many months, and what does the opposition do? It sees an opportunity to come in here and gain a few political points at the expense of a very vulnerable group of elderly citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plain fact is that these changes were foreshadowed in the parliament in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, more than 12 months ago. Prior to that budget there was consultation; since that budget there has been extensive consultation and, broadly speaking, there has been very wide acclaim and acceptance of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that we are proposing not just a change in the nursing home sector; we are proposing a revolution. We are proposing some very extensive changes, but in the end those changes are being brought in to address the problems that we inherited and the problems that everyone recognised existed in the system. There has been some confusion about those changes because of their extent. We have acknowledged that. The minister has acknowledged that and reacted by pushing back the implementation date for these changes by a number of months. That was a recognition of the fact that the nursing home sector was not yet ready. The principles have been widely acclaimed. There cannot be any debate about that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the highest proportion of over&hyphen;60s in my electorate than in any other electorate in Australia. I have followed this issue very closely and have spoken to my nursing home proprietors about it at length. Without exception&mdash;but with some reservations which have been and are being looked at by the government in this legislation&mdash;this approach has been broadly supported. Let us not forget that Professor Bob Gregory, back in 1995, produced a report to the former government on Australia's aged care sector. At that time he recommended that $125 million per annum needed to be spent to bring nursing home infrastructure costs up to an acceptable level.  What was the former government's response to that recommendation? It was to allocate
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5057"> $10 million a year on what it called its tiered system standard aggregated model. In other words, the Labor Party's commitment to reforming the aged sector was a paltry $3 per day per resident for capital upgrade or $10 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply abhor the sort of debate we have heard from the opposition. It is only a base political attempt to frighten my constituents, many of whom are old people. I have taken an interest in this. I accept the criticism that there were times when perhaps the government's intentions were not as clear as they might have been, but there has been extensive consultation. I hope that the debate in the remaining time might be constructive. Let us not do what the member for Watson is best at coming in here and doing&mdash;rhetoric, and so on. He is very good at that. He fell exactly into that trap. He did not make a positive contribution. He simply came in here and took a few paltry and base political points at the expense of my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am confident that this legislation is good legislation. It will address the problems and I can assure the parliament that this government is concerned for elderly people in our population and is going about looking after their interests as best it can in a difficult financial environment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major fault of this legislation is the manner in which it fails to protect elderly Australians from having to sell their homes should they require nursing home care. The longer the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has refused to admit what is plainly obvious to everyone else, the longer she has remained silent on the ramifications of nursing home entry fees, the more the clamour of concern has grown within our communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really quite simple, and I understand the reticence of the minister and of the members opposite to face up to these facts because we all know they are really quite shameful. It all comes down to one question: where does it say in the Aged Care Bill 1997 that all people will be exempt from having to sell their home to gain a bed in a nursing home? The answer is quite simply, `Nowhere,' and I have read the bill cover to cover. The only
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exemption offered is for persons entering a nursing home when that person shares their house with a spouse or a family member who is on a carer's pension&mdash;that's it, close the book. That is the limit of this government's generosity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the legislation does say&mdash;and it is there in black and white for the members opposite to read&mdash;is that a person with assets of over $22,500 will have to pay to get a nursing home bed. For those people not covered by the exemption, their home is included in that assets test. Forget the fact that you may be a Second World War veteran who shares his home with his son, and I know such a gentleman in my electorate&mdash;he contacted my electoral office last week. They are not exempt. Forget the fact that you may share your family home with your elderly sibling, and I have several people in my electorate, who have been to my electoral office, who do. They are not exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the majority of these people, the only reason they enjoy assets of over $22,500 is because they own a home. It does not take Einstein to realise that, in order to pay the fees demanded of them, many old people will now have to sell their house in order to get their nursing home bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and members on the opposite side continue to play with semantics. They keep saying, `Show us in the bill where it says people will have to sell their homes,' and yet all the time they know that this bill cynically manoeuvres many people into doing nothing less if they want to get a nursing home bed. A document from the minister's department states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of long&hyphen;stay residents to pay an entry contribution will depend upon the size of their asset holdings. In particular, the people who are most likely to be capable of paying an entry contribution are those who either own a saleable house or have other assets above about $60,000. About 63 per cent of residents could have a saleable home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So much for the minister's `absolute guarantee' of saving people from selling their homes. For an elderly person living in their own home, especially one facing the uncertainty of life in a nursing home, that person's  home is the very essence of comfort and security. Norah McGuire, the National Treas
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5058"> urer of the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuant's Federation, said on this very subject:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No&hyphen;one wants to go in&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, into a nursing home&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but some feel that as long as they have got that house out there, when or if they leave, then they can keep going. They really do know that they are not going to leave, but it is a part of trying to keep going.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mrs McGuire also said that her organisation is receiving regular calls from members of Australia's aged community who are even contemplating suicide rather than giving up their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet we have a minister who wants to rob the elderly of Australia of this very sliver of hope in their latter years of life. This is a minister who does not believe that the sick and the frail elderly of Australia deserve to hold on to that last ray of hope connected to their house as they enter a nursing home. But the problem runs deeper than that. It is not just the emotional torment this legislation will put our elderly through; it is to do with the two&hyphen;tiered aged care system which will develop should we allow this legislation to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us all understand that the legislation places no cap on the size of the entry fee which is to be paid. There is no mechanism in this legislation which stops nursing home operators from charging like wounded bulls should they consider that they can get away with it. All the operator has to do is leave the patient with $22,500. If a person's home is worth $122,500, the nursing home, under this legislation, can charge $100,000 for a bed and simply leave the client with the remainder. Indeed, the most recent industry estimates have put the average expected fee at $88,000, with luxury nursing homes charging as much as $150,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have the seeds of a two&hyphen;tier system. It is pretty obvious that an elderly person with a more expensive house to sell immediately becomes a more attractive prospect to a nursing home operator than a person with a less expensive home or a person with no home to sell at all. Such a situation will be compounded by the government's plans to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide a measly $5 subsidy for concessional nursing home residents. If a nursing home operator has to choose between a financially disadvantaged person with no house or assets who attracts that measly $5 a day subsidy and an individual with a three&hyphen;bedroom house to sell, who will they choose? Who do you think?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The derisory $5 subsidy for concessional nursing home residents signals a new low in this government's treatment of our elderly and our disadvantaged. It means, for example, that church based care facilities&mdash;the section of the nursing home industry which caters for the majority of concessional residents in Australia&mdash;will not receive the benefits afforded to private nursing homes simply because of the financial status of their residents. Churches and charities are currently running approximately 70 per cent of Australia's nursing homes. These are homes which reserve at least 55 per cent of their places for financially disadvantaged people. Obviously we are talking about developing a system with a considerable number of have nots as opposed to haves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So say the rest of the nursing home care industry, so says Aged Care Australia and so says Graeme Croft, Federal President of the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association. The Reverend Harry Herbert, National Chairperson of the Uniting Church's Community Services Australia, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's offer of $5 a day is an insult . . . and would in fact exacerbate the two&hyphen;tiered system of residential care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These people are not mouthpieces for the Labor Party. They bear no longstanding animosity towards the minister or the coalition government. These people are nursing home professionals. These people run the organisations which care for the sick and the elderly in our society on a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A two&hyphen;tiered system of nursing home care is about to become an awful reality in Australia if these changes take place. What can we expect from such a system? Those who can afford it, of course, will get the best. And for those who cannot, what are they going to  end up with? I remember the old Lidcombe men's home, with 50 men to a ward, where
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5059"> my grandfather went in the 1950s because he required nursing. I can see the residents again now in this bill, lined up against the wall&mdash;bed, chest of drawers, bed, chest of drawers, bed, chest of drawers. Is that the sort of system that the disadvantaged in our community are going to be subjected to by this government? Is that the type of system that the church and charity organisations will be forced into delivering, starved of the funds they require for capital infrastructure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What of the minister's tired argument about nursing homes being the same as aged hostels? It is an argument as spurious as it is offensive. It is quite clear that people choose to go into hostels&mdash;they do not choose to go into nursing homes. People go into nursing homes because they offer the care and medication their illness or frailty demands. People choose to go into hostels because they offer increased comfort and security&mdash;not because that person cannot function anymore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the fact that we are considering this bill in the absence of any information on the prudential arrangements which guarantee the safety of residents' accommodation bonds? What about the fact that there is no requirement in this legislation for the interest that a nursing home earns from a resident's entry fee to be channelled back into that nursing home? For all this government cares, certainly by the look of this legislation, the interest may well straight back into beefing up the nursing home operator's profit margin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The haphazard manner in which this bill was quite obviously put together speaks volumes for the minister's concern and for this government's concern for the elderly in our communities. I am amazed that we have a government that is willing to bring such a flawed piece of legislation into this House knowing full well its implications for the health and the wellbeing of thousands of sick and elderly Australians. What a reckless and arrogant attitude to adopt. This government is, I believe, using the Goebbels technique&mdash;the big lie becomes the truth. They are saying, `We'll ram this bill through because it's becoming increasingly embarrassing for us not to do so. Any problems we come across later we'll do something about then.'I fear for the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people requiring nursing home care in this country if that is the attitude of the government they rely upon to govern the security and equity of their care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a lifetime of contributing to their communities and to our society, bringing up their children, working tirelessly in their jobs and in their homes and making countless numbers of sacrifices to make ends meet, few Australians deserve to live more comfortably and relaxed than our senior citizens. Thanks to this legislation, comfortable and relaxed they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Strange as it may seem to the members opposite, running a government is not like running a business or a stockbroking firm or a lawyer's chambers or a cattle property. You must govern with an eye to maintaining the spirit and the hope of the people whom you are supposed to represent. You must govern with a generous heart and make sure that your greatest resource, the people of this country, do not become divided or suffer due to neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state of a person's bank balance should never dictate the state of the health care that they receive in this country and likewise the standard of nursing home care that is available to them. Nursing home care is merely an extension of our health care system. Access to nursing home care, as with the general medical system, should be based on need and not on a person's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I too have a lot more to say. I find it offensive to have been gagged on a bill as important as this and, for the first time in my federal parliamentary career, to be removed from this House because I objected to the way the minister was arrogantly handling this bill. The people whom I represent find it offensive as well. I condemn this bill before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable member: what did you do for 13 years? You sat by and watched our nursing homes deteriorate. You ripped the guts out of the industry and left our older generation on the scrap heap. These are the people who have spent a lifetime serving their community&mdash;the frail and incapacitated; those who have worked all their lives and are now looking for some form of reprieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did you get from the Labor Party? More of the same&mdash;an irresponsible scare campaign. No policy&mdash;well, not of any substance. Labor's policy on aged care consisted of eight paragraphs. That is something to crow about! Why are we not hearing more about Labor's achievements on the issue? I will tell you why: because they have not got any more achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what Labor managed to do in 13 years of government. There were reforms over a decade ago which they have tinkered with from time to time. They restructured the funding system in hostels and nursing homes, introducing the CAM and SAM funding system. And what was the crowning achievement? They introduced accommodation bonds in hostels to provide capital funds and an incentive for providers to invest in upgrading facilities in that sector. Let me repeat that: Labor introduced accommodation bonds in hostels to provide for capital funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that we want to introduce accommodation bonds into nursing homes as well, all of a sudden it is a bad idea. Does that mean you introduced a bad policy? If you compare the standard of hostels to the standard of nursing homes, you would have to say that the idea was not bad at all. But why did you stop at hostels? Why did you let nursing homes deteriorate? Even after receiving advice from Professor Gregory, you buried your heads in the sand and denied that there was a problem.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just revisit the findings of the Gregory report. I realise I am not the first to do this and I certainly will not be the last, but until the members opposite admit that there is a problem we will not be able to convince them of the benefits of this bill. Professor Gregory found that over 40 per cent of residents in nursing homes share rooms with three or more people. Eleven per cent of facilities do not meet fire standards and 15 per cent do not meet health standards. The direct result of this gross neglect is: accommodation is cramped with beds less than a metre apart; people with dementia are housed in inadequate accommodation; toilets are not large enough for walking frames or wheelchairs; there are too few toilets; and there are rooms with no external view. The list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In total, Professor Gregory said that there was a need for $125 million annually to make substantial improvements. What was Labor's response? A paltry $36 million over four years. They then went on a slash and burn exercise with capital funding. In 1992&hyphen;93, $45 million was available for nursing home capital purposes. Within three years this was slashed to just over $10 million&mdash;a 75 per cent cut. Worse still, only $2,700,000 was for the upgrading of old and substandard services. The rest was for building new services. So you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, why I have been left scratching my head. With such a poor track record and virtually no policy statement, how can Labor sit back and attack our proposals? Surely, by this stage, they can see the need for reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But just in case the members opposite are still having trouble, I will quickly run through it again. The aged care system, as it stands, is unsustainable. Many homes are in urgent need of repair and upgrading; the funding system is inadequate; the aged care system has too much unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy; and we have a rapidly ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has proposed will go a long way to solving these problems. On behalf of the aged population in my electorate  of Bowman, I thank her for having the cou
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5061"> rage and the conviction to see this matter through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is the case with many electorates, Bowman is faced with the problem of an ageing population. In the past month I have had three constituents approach me with an urgent need to find nursing home accommodation. One of these people was in the all too familiar predicament of being perfectly healthy one day and totally incapacitated the next. Fortunately, I was able to help this person and she found a place, close to her family, in a short period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I shudder to think what would happen if a dozen people came to me with similar problems, yet this is a very real possibility. The projected population of people over 70 years of age in my electorate is well over the 7,000 mark. Many of these people will require care in the near future. Without proper planning and adequate funding, they will go without. The reforms put forward in this bill will provide those places through better funding, better buildings, better consumer protections and better training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Labor, the government's plan for funding is based on the needs of the people, not the bean counters. This means a person will be funded according to the care they need, no matter where they live. One of the essential elements of our package is that it will allow people to remain in familiar surroundings as their care needs change. There is nothing more distressing for the frail and aged than to be shifted from pillar to post every time they need a greater level of care. They should be able to stay close to their family and friends, regardless of the level of care required. Our reforms provide for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will honour our election commitment to deliver proper support for dementia care. Under our plan, the average hostel resident with dementia will receive an increase in funding of over 30 per cent. Our improved funding measures will mean improved buildings&mdash;buildings that have been largely neglected by Labor. Instead of just pouring money into the system, as Labor did with hostels, this bill sets a benchmark for building quality. To be able to charge a bond, a facility must be certified and conform to a national
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standard. This means that, no matter where a resident goes, they can be assured that their building will meet the standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also built in better protection&mdash;protection for people on low incomes, protection for the family, protection on the bond, protection on fees and, most importantly, protection on quality of life. Consumer protection is of utmost importance to the coalition government. With protection comes confidence, and with confidence comes peace of mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is not easy to build confidence in the system when the members opposite are hell&hyphen;bent on scaring the population. If they really cared, they would be putting forward alternative solutions, not a scare campaign aimed squarely at the elderly and their families. Do not be fooled by this campaign by Labor. This bill does provide protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who cannot afford to contribute more than the basic fee will not be asked to. This protects those on a full pension and guarantees them a place. Likewise, people who cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond will not be asked to pay one. Every facility will be required to set aside a minimum number of places for those who cannot pay, again, guaranteeing a place for these people. As an added incentive to providers, they will receive a higher government subsidy for these people. This subsidy will also apply to those who can pay only a small bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also provide protection for the families of those requiring care, for both the spouses and dependent children. The family home will be protected where a spouse or dependent child remains there. There is also special protection for long-term carers and close family members, particularly those on low incomes. There is also built&hyphen;in protection for those who do pay a bond. People cannot be charged a bond that will leave them with less than 2&half; times the single pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a cooling&hyphen;off period of seven days after entry before they have to sign a bond agreement. Residents will have the option of paying a lump sum bond or a higher fortnightly or monthly amount. Those who
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5062"> choose to pay a lump sum will have six months to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Protection will be given to those who have assets on paper but who cannot access them to pay a bond, and the bonds themselves will be protected. Bonds must be refunded promptly when people leave&mdash;generally within two months, or within seven days if the resident transfers to another facility. This bill also provides protection on fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in stark contrast to Labor's system. The income test takes only 25c in the dollar above the pension free area, which is half what Labor's system took. A single person can earn up to $49 a week and still pay only the base fee. The comparisons are endless. Labor's system was harsh, unfair and unworkable. It lacked protection. It did not provide a quality of life for aged care residents. Essentially, that is what this bill is all about&mdash;quality of life for those in our community who have reached a stage where they need help and deserve help. The reforms put forward by the minister mean older people will get the care, dignity and security they deserve. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the very brief time available to me, I want to make a couple of comments. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), indicated that she was going to deal with the facts and then proceeded to abuse members on this side, which rather undermined her argument. I want to make it very clear that this legislation will not do what it claims it will do, that is, provide adequate funding. There is a range of reasons for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first want to address very briefly the reasons why Labor undertook a major reform of the program, which are unlike what the previous speaker was claiming. There was a series of reports in the late 1970s and 1980s which clearly outlined the very significant deficiencies in aged care at that time. Amongst those deficiencies was the fact that there were far too many nursing home beds and far too many elderly people in institutions getting inappropriate care. Yes, the balance shifted during Labor's time, and we make no apology for that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The findings that were outlined in the series of reports in the 1980s, particularly the joint review of nursing homes and hostels in 1986, which effectively had bipartisan support, argued that there was a need for coordinated and comprehensive reform of the aged care sector. In particular, it pointed to the following: the haphazard nature of program development, which we are seeing again; the excessive concentration on institutional care, and we may be seeing that again; the failure to develop adequate assessment procedures, and it appears that they may well be in jeopardy; the lack of coordination between various levels of government&mdash;there are signs that this government wants to hand a great deal more of aged care responsibility back to the states, which was a problem 20 years ago; and the inefficiency of the prevailing funding mechanisms. Because of all of those reasons, there was a major change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) claimed in her second reading speech that the bill represents `the most significant reform of aged care services in Australia for over a decade' which will involve what she calls `major structural reform'. In my view, the minister confuses change with reform because this is a very significant backward step, not a forward step. In her second reading speech, she made a gratuitous insult to the previous government by claiming that Labor&mdash;and the previous speaker reiterated this&mdash;had wilfully ignored the sector for 13 years. Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last decade we have seen a major reform which decreased, quite deliberately, the number of nursing home beds per capita. It was inappropriate care for people who did not need it. Most of them wanted then, and want now, to be in their homes&mdash;not in institutions, not in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw an increase in the number of hostel beds&mdash;deliberately. Remember, these are voluntary; they are not based on need to the same extent as nursing homes are. We saw a dramatic expansion in home based care. This is what the people of Australia told us they wanted. This was based on what people
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5063"> wanted; it was not imposed on them as this bill is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw&mdash;unlike what this government's proposals will provide for&mdash;significant increases in overall expenditure on all those components, from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion. What have we seen in comparison from this government over the last two budgets? We have seen the successive withdrawal of over $500 million. Who pays? It is the user. It is the same old philosophy: the government withdraws its efforts and the funds are now being provided by those who can afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very few in this community who can afford the sorts of costs that will be imposed on them. They will have to sell their homes and their assets. That is absolutely clear, even from the minister's own statements. What we saw were quality improvements and monitoring which seemed likely to be abandoned. We saw access to nursing home care on the basis of need after careful assessment and, again, that is likely to be abandoned.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will just make some remarks about the importance of this amendment. This amendment seeks to give the Aged Care Bill some certainty. This amendment seeks to actually put a date into this legislation that will enable nursing homes and hostels to know when in fact these changes will come to pass. The government has just moved an amendment to ensure that nursing homes and hostels have no idea when this bill will come into law. It gives the sector no capacity to plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has announced that these changes will come into operation on 1 October, why is it that she will not move to have that date inserted? The reason the opposition does not agree to October is, after advice from the sector, we are of the view that the minister in fact will not be ready by that time. She might just let the House know if that is the reason she will not put October in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason for seeking to delay this bill past the October date that has been publicly announced is that there are a number of very important pieces of information that still have not been released. Could the minister inform the House and inform the aged care sector when the principles will be released that contain all the regulations that go with this bill? It would be helpful if we could know when they will be released publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been asked by the sector when they will know. It is very important that we understand that there are large pieces of very important information that are still not available to the nursing home and hostel sector about how this legislation will actually work. Minister, when will the sector be told how the resident classification scale will be applied? It would be helpful if she could let us know that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5064">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next series of questions relates to a range of things which the nursing homes and hostels themselves are going to have to pay for, the government is not going to pay for them. This legislation actually requires that these changes be put into place, but the sector has no idea how much it is going to cost. For example, one of the important changes in this legislation is a new accreditation agency that will be written up in the principles when we finally get to see them. We have no idea how much that will cost the sector, so it would be helpful if the minister could let the House know what that cost will be and when the details of the accreditation agency will be made public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would also be very helpful, I am sure, to all older Australians who are going to have to put large sums of money into paying for a nursing home bed if they could know when they will be told that there is an agreement between the private and the church based nursing homes and hostels on the new prudential arrangements and what the costs of those prudential arrangements will be. Given that, as I said before, all the nursing homes and hostels have to pay for all of these things themselves&mdash;in other words, residents will have to pay for them, it will not be paid for anymore by subsidies from the government&mdash;it would be very helpful if we could know when all these things will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just go back to the main point. Is it in fact in the government's mind to delay this bill past October? Is that why we have an open-ended starting date?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments proposed by the shadow minister. Aged care in Australia is really at the cross&hyphen;roads. Where once there was certainty, there is now real uncertainty and apprehension in the aged and ageing community in Australia. Contrary to what the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) would have you believe, this uncertainty is a result not of the wilful obstruction and scaremongering that she has mentioned but of this government's inability to effectively enunciate what their aged care policy means for the elderly in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The elderly thrive on certainty. As the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) said in his speech, having gone through the traumas of the depression and the Second World War, they see certainty as the key to their very existence. It dominates their life and, in many cases, enables them to live a little longer in their own surroundings

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have an 80&hyphen;year&hyphen;old mother living in rural Victoria. In fact, she resides in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). I am only too aware of the needs of the aged in the rural and remote areas of mainland Australia. I am determined to ensure that an effective national aged care strategy is put in place and that the needs of the people from all over my electorate and in other members' electorates are addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister is saying that we should have these clearly defined so that people know that there is some certainty&mdash;that the aged care provided is of a high quality, is of a type and level appropriate to the needs of the people who require care, is available to the people who require care irrespective of their capacity to pay for that care and results in appropriate outcomes for the people receiving the care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that gets up my nose and really irritates me is the way the minister carries on as though we did nothing about aged care in our 13 years in office. That is an absolute and wilful distortion of the facts. What also worries me is what this government is going to do for the financially disadvantaged people in the nursing home complexes. There are four or five nursing homes in my electorate: Queen Victoria at Lindisfarne, Saint Anne's at Compton Downs, the Freemason's home at Lindisfarne and the Lillian Martin Home at Mornington.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, I have a lovely 64&hyphen;bed nursing home called Elder Care in Franklin in a rural and remote part of Tasmania, in Tasmanian terms, but not when the department sits down and works it out in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane Adelaide and Perth terms. Of those 64 people, 36 of them&mdash;close to 60 per cent&mdash;are classified as FDPs. I just got off the phone to David Beck, the general manager down there, and he said the $5 a day subsidy is an absolute cruel joke. It is totally unbelievable. Sixty per cent of them are FDPs.</PARA>

Surely some of your backbenchers&mdash;the John Forrests, the Barry Wakelins&mdash;are dealing with the same problem. What is wrong with the shadow minister's requirement to modify the bill by putting those things in? I cannot believe that you are going to play the numbers game and steamroll us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments moved by the shadow minister. The dire need for appropriate objects in this legislation is brought about by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the government moving towards a discriminatory two-tiered system. The government's concessional supplement of $5 per bed per day is clearly not enough. It will threaten the viability of nursing homes in our community. Income from accommodation bonds will range between $10 and $19 per day, and we need to make sure that that is available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 500 million reasons why this minister is wrong: $500 million was cut from the 1996-97 budget for aged care. There are 500 million reasons why old people have cause to be disappointed in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a letter sent to the minister and me from the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, a joint paper that was presented by eight organisations representing the major churches was cited. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we fear is that some areas will become known for their ability to meet quality standards, while others, in low income/asset areas, will struggle to provide a service which works in the interests of the residents, regardless of the good intentions of the proprietors.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what eight churches are saying in this country. That is what the care providers are saying. Quite regrettably, the moves by the government to introduce a class based system of care&mdash;a discriminatory two&hyphen;tiered basis of care&mdash;has generated some fear and concern in the aged community. That is understandable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the government can do is turn around to the individual who is valiantly trying to defend the aged in our community, the shadow minister, and attack her, not defend and debate the legislation they are presenting to this House. No, they put a guillotine on the debate. They put a guillotine on the debate because their movement in introducing a discriminatory two-tiered system is absolutely indefensible. It is absolutely reprehensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some speakers have suggested that one of the organisations seeking to criticise the government's legislation is a Labor front organisation. I would suggest that the eight churches in this country could hardly be described as Labor front organisations. Indeed, I would suggest that they have independently and reasonably come to the conclusion that there is very serious cause for concern over the government's move. They say that the supplement level of $5 per day or $1,825 per year threatens this ethos and tradition and seems to be predicated on the concept of cross-subsidisation with facilities where organisations will be required merely to meet the mandated proportion of residents classed as concessional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, service providers in this country are concerned about the government's proposals. They are calling for this bill to be put on the backburner. It is a reasonable proposition that the government take a very cautious and slow approach in the consideration of changes to this legislation. But what does the government do? It guillotines the debate and it seeks to steamroll and ramrod through dangerous changes which will, I fear, build on other more destructive changes for aged care in this country. It will build upon the $500 million worth of cuts that it ripped out of aged care in this country. It is ill prepared. It does not give the detail required for people to feel  comfortable and relaxed&mdash;far from it&mdash;about the options in their old age.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been an avalanche of concern in opposition to the proposals that the government is advancing in the Aged Care Bill 1997. That avalanche of concern has been ignored by the government in its desire to push through this legislation. In its intent in pushing through this legislation, it has gagged debate on this bill, denying many members of parliament on the speakers list the opportunity to present more fully the concerns of their electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to take the opportunity that the consideration in detail presents in a couple of minutes to make some points about this. The organisations that are actually involved in having to deal with the effects of this bill&mdash;the people who administer the aged care services, many of whom are charitable and church organisations&mdash;have made their views well known. Aged Care Queensland Inc., an organisation representing those various church and charitable organisations, has written to all federal members from Queensland this week expressing their serious concerns about what the government is doing. I just want to quote very quickly from one part of that letter. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People in hostels who are financially disadvantaged currently receive a supplement of $3.50 per day. Many of the church and charitable hostels care for more than 60 per cent of those people and can therefore expect a loss of $2 per day for each. For every 100-bed hostel in this situation, the minister is taking away $43,800, which is not replaced by other income. That represents more than one job in every 100 beds and there are over 10,000 hostel beds in our membership in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), should contemplate their plea to her to reconsider this folly. You are stripping away $43,800 from those charitable organisations and church groups who seek to provide a service to some of the most disadvantaged people in this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community who are without the strength to stand up and fight you politically. You use your numbers in this parliament to gag the opposition in this debate and to steamroll over the care for those people. That is an outrageous position for any government to adopt against any group in the community, but to do it against the aged and the frail is one of the most repugnant things this government has managed to do in its sorry 14 or 15 months in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the debate I have listened to members of the government stand up and defend the proposition and particularly seek to refute the view that there is any income barrier, that you will not need to sell your house or you will not be put in a position where the family assets will have to be sold in order for the aged and the family to be cared for. We on this side of the House know that that is exactly what is going to happen in many cases. People will be confronted with very substantial bills. The estimates are not unrealistically now placed in the $80,000 range. What do members of the government say in support of that? I have heard member after member say, `Oh, yes, but they don't have to pay unless they are there for more than six months.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know why people go into nursing homes. They do not go there for a holiday. Nursing homes are not somewhere where people go for respite for two or three weeks. People go into nursing homes because their medical condition demands that care. It is not by choice. It is not something over which they have any control. They are placed there by virtue of their need for health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens to people who go into nursing homes? Where do they go after they leave nursing homes? The sad fact is that most people leave in a box. They do not leave nursing homes to go back home or to go to a hostel. Either they go from a nursing home to intensive care in a hospital or, sadly, they pass away in a nursing home. That is the cold, hard truth of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members stand up in this debate and say, `But you don't have to pay as
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5071"> long as you are not there for more than six months.' They are saying to the aged and the frail who do not have a big bankroll, `As long as you die in the first six months, your family won't have to sell the house. As long as you're dead in a couple of weeks, it will be okay. The family will not have to put the house on the market.' What a disgraceful thing to be putting upon the people of Australia and, worst still, those people least able to defend themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is seeking to protect a minister who cannot defend this bill, who has not been able to engage in proper debate with the shadow minister, and it is using its numbers to crunch through this nasty piece of legislation. When its effects are visible in the community, the people in nursing homes and their families will make it plain to the government what they think, and the opposition will reap the rewards at the next election as a result. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, with your reminder to us all as to exactly what this aged care legislation and the amendments that are proposed here are seeking to do, I go specifically to the issue of the capacity of people to pay for that care, which is clause 2(a)(iii). I want to introduce yet another element into this debate because I do not think, although I stand to be corrected, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has defended in here the government's position in respect of this bill and the effect it will have on another section of the community; namely, the veterans community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been about nine weeks since I had responsibility on our side of the parliament for the veterans community, but let me tell the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) this: I can recall that when this bill was first proposed the veterans community were very loud in expressing their concerns
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to me because they themselves operate nursing homes right around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their concern was for the people whom the present Minister for Veterans' Affairs&mdash;and, dare I say, previous ministers as well but more particularly this minister&mdash;and this government like to stand up in front of and trumpet how much they are going to look after them. Their concern was: what will happen to these people? Their concern was for the war heroes and the people whom the Minister for Veterans' Affairs sends out kits about and gives people badges to wear and says they have to wrap themselves up in the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs should now be representing veterans' interests in terms of nursing home places. He has not been here to defend that proposition. I hope he comes in. I hope he or his staff are in front of a television and watching this debate, and I hope that he comes into this place to put a view on behalf of the veterans community because capacity to pay for care, the outcomes that people will receive and getting high quality care are all issues even more important to those people whom this country owes. The people whom this country owes are those who have fought for this country in terms of their service on behalf of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it extraordinary that the views of those organisations&mdash;the views of the RSL movement more generally but of a range of organisations associated with the RSL&mdash;that operate nursing homes around this country are not being considered here. Perhaps the minister's defence will be that they are a front for the Labor Party. Bruce Ruxton, I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is not a front for the Labor Party&mdash;never has been; doubt that he ever will. He might have had a very good close personal relationship with the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, but I can tell you he is no front for the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he and many other representatives of the RSL, I am sure, have expressed these sorts of concerns to the minister. He has expressed on behalf of his constituency, just as people like Rusty Priest in New South Wales and the other presidents of the RSL movement around the states would have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5072"> expressed on behalf of their constituency, concerns about the impact that all of these aspects of this piece of dreadful legislation will have on their membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wonder whether they are being heard, whether or not it is perhaps proposed to issue yet another kit on behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that says, `Don't worry about it. It'll be all right because you'll go into a nursing home and there is bound to be a bed struck for you.' Or perhaps the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) might strike a medal, but then that will be struck down. It is simply not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As people enter their twilight years of life they can reflect on what this country means to them and what this country owes them&mdash;and certain people do have a legitimate claim to say that this country does owe them&mdash;yet I am not sure whether the Minister for Family Services or the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has given that appropriate thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly many veterans are in the same position as ordinary aged Australians and they are, for that very reason, just as frightened. They are just as frightened about what is going to happen to the family home, they are concerned about the funding they will have to find to buy a position in a nursing home in the future and they are concerned about things like quality of care&mdash;whether they will go into a second tier system. That is really a fundamental concern that the veterans expressed to me. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The people of Australia, particularly the elderly community and aged care providers in Australia, have every right to have real concerns about this government's proposals today. One of the proposed amendments states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 2&hyphen;1, page 2, (lines 5 to 13), omit paragraph (a), substitute:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to provide for funding of *aged care that ensures that the care provided:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (iii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is available to the people who require care, irrespective of their capacity to pay for that care;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (iv)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> results in appropriate outcomes for the people receiving the care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not see anything particularly controversial in that. I think it is fair to say, and any fair-minded observer would agree, that we should all be able to agree on what is said there. But this government will not agree to it. This government again is saying, `Trust us. Be comfortable and relaxed. Stick with us and it will all be okay; it will all be all right on the night.' But, as I said earlier, many organisations who deal with aged people in this country and provide for their care are not comfortable and relaxed. They have real concerns about what this reform really means. That is why the opposition is so keen to have a full and proper debate on this issue in this chamber and that is why the opposition is extremely concerned that the government has guillotined debate on this issue, as it has on so many other issues since the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election I can remember being lectured by those opposite, particularly by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), about parliamentary standards and the actions of this parliament. Much of what has happened and much of what we are seeing today from this government has been and is about denying debate, denying the proper consideration of issues before this parliament. This is not the first time this has happened with this minister.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Many times we would think that, rather than being in the chamber, we were in some sort of hearing before a congressional committee in the US, because the minister is always pleading the Fifth Amendment: `I refuse to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me.' Sometimes she refuses to answer on the grounds, `It may incinerate me.' Sometimes she refuses to answer on the grounds, `I don't really understand what I'm doing here.' That comes through in the objectives of the bill. A real concern is the fact that much of what is in the bill does not correlate with what the minister says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have already mentioned that Aged Care Australia are very concerned about this bill and do not want it passed at this stage. They want proper consideration in the community. They do not want fluffy, puffy, pseudo-consideration. They do not want those sorts of developments within the community. They want a proper, reasoned and evaluated approach to this bill and to the consideration of these issues. This government stands condemned for its approach to this bill and its approach to these amendments, because it is denying a proper debate, it is denying an opportunity for the community to consider these issues properly and, on this issue, it is denying older Australians the safety of their position. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw attention to the parts of the amendments that insert a reference to nursing and personal care. I draw the House's attention to a release put out today by the Australian Nursing Federation which says that the Aged Care Bill, being read in the parliament today, could spell disaster for Victorian
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5074"> nursing homes. The Australian Nursing Federation have called on members of parliament to block the bill unless substantial amendments are made. They go on to say later in their release that new draft standards for residential aged care referred to in the bill&mdash;but of course we do not have the principal, so the House is yet to see these new standards&mdash;do not stipulate the need to employ qualified nurses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister might make one of her general promises again, but what the nurses want and what older people want is a provision placed in the bill, which we are seeking to do by way of one of our amendments, to ensure that nursing care is emphasised at the start of this legislation. Qualified nurses are being written out of aged care by this bill in order to make the cost of care cheaper for the government and&mdash;let's face it&mdash;that is really what all this is about.

It is terribly important that, if you need to go into a nursing home, you know that you will be properly cared for and the government will not be having one eye on the bottom line before it decides whether or not you will get into a bed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to endorse the proposals by the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), that we have a clarification under clause 2.1, page 2 of the Aged Care Bill, with a clearly defined spelling out of the provisions for people in nursing homes. I have just been on the phone to the nursing homes in my area to find out about this financially disadvantaged persons component. I received a letter today, as I guess as most members did, from the Australian Catholic Health Care Association about their concerns, which obviously have been expressed also to the minister. I cannot find much in the way of consolation by way of guarantees from the minister that financially disadvantaged persons are going to be catered for under this new system. A press release dated 26 May from the same organisation says the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed changes the Government will provide a capital regeneration subsidy of $5 a day per bed for financially disadvantaged people, while the payment of an accommodation bond will generate an average of $19 per bed per day for non financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents a shortfall of $14 per bed per day of accommodation for financially disadvantaged people. This is totally inadequate. The difference will see these people in multi-bed rooms in buildings that will reflect this disparity in funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some facilities cross-subsidisation may account for this shortfall but this raises serious concerns in our sector where over 70 per cent of facilities commit at least 55 per cent of places to financially disadvantaged people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the interim I have been on the phone to the half a dozen or so nursing homes in my electorate. I am going to have a two-tiered system in my electorate. I have the posh nursing homes in the eastern suburbs of my electorate that are just about at the quota level of 25 per cent. As I said in a speech earlier today, Elder Care in Franklin are up around 60 per cent. One that is within a bull's roar of my electorate, St Anne's Compton Downs, in probably one of the most socially disadvantaged areas in the whole of Australia&mdash;broad acre public housing gone mad&mdash;is at 53 per cent at the moment whereas their nursing home in the posh part of town, in Davy Street, is at about 30 per cent, just above what  the minister prescribes: 25 per cent. So we are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5075"> going to have two&hyphen;tiered health care in the nursing homes in two disadvantaged parts of my electorate. The letter I received today, dated 3 June, from the Australian Catholic Health Care Association says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new system service providers will be required to provide a certain percentage of beds for Financially Disadvantaged Persons&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">FDPs as they call them. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's commitment to providing a safety net for such low income and asset consumers will be very valuable in maintaining the integrity of the Aged Care system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in some regions, where there are large numbers of FDP's we fear that the elimination of the Government's general Capital Grants program combined with the new funding arrangements will reduce capital investment and therefore access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we fear is that some areas&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this will be two areas of my electorate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will become known for their ability to meet quality standards while others, in low income/asset areas will struggle to provide a service which works in the interest of the residents, regardless of the good intentions of the proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like a guarantee from the minister: `Well, Harry, irrespective of where people live in the electorate of Franklin, whether there are 53 or 60 per cent of FDPs in nursing homes, they will get the same sort of service as the people on the eastern shore of your electorate in the Lindisfarnes and the Bellerives and the Howrahs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a nursing home owns two different nursing home complexes, one is going to be upper crust and the other one is going to be socioeconomically disadvantaged because of this stupid system that the minister wants to push down our throats. It is totally irresponsible. The minister goes on to us about our 13 years of neglect and shameful treatment of people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to follow the contribution by the member for Franklin (Mr Quick), because his mother lives in my electorate. I know that she would be a little unsure about his contribution, because the member for Franklin understands very clearly the challenges that confront the elderly in an electorate like Mallee
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the north west of Victoria. We have people there who, when they visit their elderly loved ones, have to travel past existing aged care facilities to get to see them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Franklin is like so many members sitting on the other side of the chamber who know that these reforms are necessary. Gregory's contribution in 1995 should have shocked and shamed all of us in this parliament, because we have neglected and let down the elderly Australians who deserve the best aged care. I am getting a little sick and tired of being cast time and time again by members of the opposition as some uncaring Australian. I care very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, I know that you are allowing a fairly wide&hyphen;ranging debate on this amendment that we are now considering, and I appreciate that. Prior to 1990, I knew absolutely nothing about aged care, and then my family was confronted with my late father's stroke. We were shocked to discover just what a mess aged care is in. We spent two years dealing with the aged care system and, at one stage of the trauma that we were confronted with as a family, my mother said to me, `Son, for goodness sake, somebody has to go to Canberra and sort this out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I object so strongly to the cheap politics that are being played here. The people that count the most are not us. Put the politics aside. It would be better politics for the Australian Labor Party to do what it can to help the government to make sure that we get this major reform correct. We are not important here. The people who are important are the elderly Australians out there who have been neglected. I am not going to be churlish like the Australian Labor Party is currently being. I have spent four years in this parliament trying to get some satisfaction for my mother's dear wish. We go through these complicated CAM&hyphen;SAM, alternately state funded, federally funded arrangements and I resent the fact that it took six months off the twilight end of my father's life. We lost him in 1992 and I went for preselection in August 1992. That is what has driven me, and I am really pleased to stand here and support the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5076"> Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) who cares about the people out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make an appeal to the Labor Party: for goodness sake get onside, give the cheap politics away and give us a hand to get this right. There are just so many people out there&mdash;I have 67 aged care facilities in my electorate; some of you might say that that is far too many, but you need to understand that my electorate represents 25 per cent of the geographic area of Victoria&mdash;who are all saying to me, `John, these reforms are necessary. Thank you.' Sure, they have some concerns and the minister at the table has been addressing those. People have been widely consulted and we have made sure that the prudential arrangements are the best they can be. They will be monitored and we will be making sure that quality standards are properly supervised. Most importantly of all, we will be making sure that every dollar is delivered to the coalface so that people like the mother of the member for Franklin can look forward to her aged care provision being the best we can offer, and not just the best state by state but the best gauged by world standards. That is the vision we are after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My appeal to the Australian Labor Party is to forget this stupid nonsense, to get onside and give us a hand to deliver to the people who count the most&mdash;not us, but our elderly Australians who have worked hard all their lives to build a prosperous nation which we are now enjoying. They deserve the best that we can give them. Put the cheap politics aside, put the scaremongering aside and get onside and give us a hand.</PARA></SPEECH>

I and my late father resided in Nhill and Kaniva and my mother currently resides there, and I know the nursing home and hostel complexes there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point I tried to make to the honourable member for Mallee was that my concern, which is just as real as his, is to ensure that the people in my electorate, who are of a similar nature to yours, are not disadvantaged.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They are disadvantaged in telephone services, television services and access to higher education services. They are second&hyphen;class citizens.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, I did wave my $5 at the minister and got up her nose. I did it for a reason. One of the reasons I, like the member for Mallee, came into this place was that I was sick and tired of people telling me what was good for the people in my area when they came around only once in a blue moon. I support your thrust of this parliament getting together and making sure that the aged people in Australia get a fair deal from this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see some flexibility from the other side. Some of the things proposed by the shadow minister and which I have shown you ought to be incorporated, almost like a bill of rights, for our aged people so that people like your late father do not have to wait for six months. I agree that the process is not right, but we ought to be able to collectively get it right. As the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) said, this does not guarantee that it is going to solve the problem. I think that we ought to work together and accept some of the amendments. We should work collectively rather than point scoring by saying, `What she did for 13 years was totally useless.' It was not.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5077"> (Mr Lee) would be disappointed if I did not do so. I am pleased to take the opportunity to address some of the comments that he made when he was speaking on the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am angry and concerned about the direction that this debate on the Aged Care Bill has taken. I was pleased to hear the previous speakers, and the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), starting to discuss their concerns about our elderly people. I made a stand in my life to come into this parliament because I, too, was concerned about my community. One of my concerns was the level of residential aged care in my community. In my maiden speech on 23 May last year, I referred to this major problem. At that time I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Affordable nursing home accommodation is at crisis point on the peninsula area. Time and time again, I am approached by distraught family members or carers seeking my assistance when no place can be found on the Central Coast to accommodate an elderly family member.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I went on to describe some of those situations. I made a commitment in my maiden speech that I would attempt to do something about that situation. The Aged Care Bill 1997 does something about that situation. It addresses the concerns of the residents of the Central Coast. It addresses the concerns and the deplorable situation that aged care and nursing home accommodation has fallen into under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party knew for many years that nursing home accommodation and residential aged care was falling into disarray. Those facts are not new. They commissioned a number of reports and surveys, including Gregory's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the structure of nursing home funding arrangements: stages 1 and 2</EMPHASIS>, the mid&hyphen;term review of the aged care reform strategy, the national action plan for dementia care and Professor Braithwaite's work on outcomes, standards and monitoring arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The messages were there loud and clear&mdash;the messages that were in my maiden speech&mdash;that there is not enough funding for dementia care and there is not enough suitable accommodation in nursing homes for our elderly residents. The problem is that the opposition did not listen or, if they did listen,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they did not choose to act. They sat on their hands for years and did nothing to rectify the deficiencies in our nursing home system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are the result of consultation and of listening to the community and the industry. They are the result of a draft bill that has been circulated widely throughout the community. We have listened to the community because we want the best results for our elderly residents who are forced into nursing homes. They do not go there by choice; they are forced into nursing homes. We want them to live in dignity and security and we want to give them the facilities that they deserve. Older people can be confident that this bill will deliver to them security and dignity. Access to aged care will be based on need, not the ability to pay.</PARA>

As I said, the amendments to this bill are a result of community consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current outcome standards do not specify the ratio of qualified nurses. However, if the appropriate level of care, including nursing care, is not given, then sanctions will apply under our legislation, just as they do now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend the honourable member for Robertson, with whom I happen to disagree on his view on this aged care legislation. The reason the Labor Party and the opposition have many concerns about the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the honourable member for Robertson did not address is that because of the introduction of this new means test&mdash;this new 25c in the dollar means test&mdash;part pensioners in his electorate are now going to have to pay an effective taxation rate of up to 91c in the dollar.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This isn't playing politics, Jim. This is what your legislation does. Your legislation imposes a new 25c in the dollar means test on that nursing home bed subsidy. Some people think it only affects rich people, but that 25c in the dollar means test starts to bite when your non&hyphen;pension income exceeds $50 a week. We are not talking about rich people here: $50 a week and you start to get hit with this new 25c in the dollar means test. I do not know how many members of the government backbench realise what their legislation is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point the member for Robertson made&mdash;I am sure quite sincerely&mdash;was that this legislation is the result of listening to the community. He and I share a number of aged care organisations in our electorates. We share a number of aged care lobby groups. I attended a meeting of the Self-funded Retirees Association on the Central Coast a few months after him. Jim, I can assure you that the members of that Self&hyphen;funded Retirees Association are ropeable about this legislation. They are very worried about the impact that this legislation will have on them. I suggest that, before this gets to a final vote in the Senate, you try a bit harder to make sure you have heard the concerns that have been
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expressed by the members of that branch of the association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also remind the House of the views of Brisbane Water Legacy&mdash;an organisation that does a lot of great work on the New South Wales Central Coast. They have listed 10 different areas of concern and have asked for the legislation to be withdrawn or deferred until the industry can get further details from the government. When an organisation like Brisbane Water Legacy has concerns, it means that the government has not listened to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I made in my speech during the second reading debate was that one individual on the Central Coast has been speaking out and doing a lot of work on this: Neville Boyce. He has beaten up as many Labor Party ministers for health as he has Liberal Party ministers for health over the years in fighting for a fair deal for funding for the Central Coast area health service. He is not a Labor Party supporter or, as far as I know, a Liberal Party supporter. He is someone who has stayed out of party politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Neville Boyce appears before a Senate committee and raises his list of concerns surely that means that the government should be questioning whether this is the right thing to do. He raises concerns and says things in his written submission such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standard of nursing homes on the central coast is high as the majority are part of retirement complexes. I can see the importing of the richer patients to our area. The government believes market forces will prevail, that the reforms will deliver high quality accessible residential care. Market forces will prevail and the pensioner without assets will become a second&hyphen;class citizen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older Australians can be assured that there is strong protection for consumers contained in the legislation. Naturally, the affordability of aged care is an important concern to my constituents in Makin.

I add that nurses, when giving professional care, do not differentiate between DFPs and accommodation bond payers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to office, we found that 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet fire standards, 15 per cent of nursing homes did not meet their state health standards and 40 per cent of nursing home residents were in a ward with four or more beds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before being elected to represent the people of Makin in this place, I was fortunate to have worked in a nursing home and hostel which upheld very high standards of quality care and assistance for its residents. It was indeed a pleasure to be part of a dedicated team of people who prided themselves on providing the highest levels of care and assistance to our aged residents. I speak from experience when I say that the work done by nurses and fellow care workers is too often taken for granted by some in our community. Long hours and patience and dedication required by nurses and carers too often go unnoticed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 Professor Bob Gregory produced a report for the Labor government which recommended that $125 million per year needed to be spent to bring nursing home infrastructure costs up to an acceptable level. Labor's response was to allocate only $10 million a year on what it called its tiered system standard aggregated module&mdash;SAM. This amounts to a mere $3 per day per resident for much needed capital upgrading of nursing homes. The member for Jagajaga, who obviously has never known what it is to work in the area of aged care, now pretends to care for the elderly. It is a bit late to shown concern now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker talked a lot about what nurses thought of the current changes. I will tell you what the nurses say about the current changes before the House. They say that they are disastrous. That is what the professionals working in nursing homes talk about when they are describing the current government's strategy. The Australian Nursing Federation says `the Aged Care Bill being read in the federal parliament today could spell disaster for Victorian nursing homes' and it has `called on members of parliament to block the bill unless substantial amendments are made'. They say that `qualified nurses are being written out of aged care by the bill in order to make the cost of care cheaper for the government. The bill gives the green light to service providers to employ untrained staff'. So much for quality care! Two&hyphen;tiered care&mdash;a class based care system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have talked a lot about Labor front organisations. The mantra that the government is repeating in this chamber today is that we are trying to scare people by exposing the outrage of the people of Australia at what the government is perpetrating against aged Australians. The second mantra that they are repeating is that those who oppose the government obviously are with the opposition. It is McCarthyist. If you are not for us, you are agin us. That must mean, therefore, in the government's thinking, that the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church and all the other churches and caring associations in this country are with the Labor Party. I think not. They are legitimate in expressing concern about the government's legislation&mdash;absolutely legitimate&mdash;and entitled to express
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their view and should not be attacked for expressing their view. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association, ACHCA says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aged Care Bill is discriminatory and ill&hyphen;prepared. As it stands, it cannot be supported by the ACHCA or by the federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what they say. And what about the Uniting Church? In response to the government's announcement of a $5 per day concession to residents in care, the Reverend Harry Herbert said that `the government's offer of $5 a day is an insult to our elderly and a slap in the face to charitable service providers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The passage of this bill and the supporting subsidy seriously risk undermining the current standard of aged care in Australia. It is a short&hyphen;sighted attempt to address the problems of the industry made at the expense of the most vulnerable: elderly Australians. The point has been made by speakers opposite that the industry needs to be improved. We concur. But this is not the way to do it. In my view, introducing a two&hyphen;tiered basis of care or a class based system of care where the haves get a good system of care and the have nots get less than perfect care is less than desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the Over Fifties Focus say? It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aged care bill to be debated in parliament tomorrow should immediately be withdrawn to allow for a further review and public consultation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already talked about the concern of the Nurses Federation for a two&hyphen;tiered skills based system. Aged people will not necessarily be looked after by trained staff, as they should be. Mr McDonald of the Uniting Church says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of contributions on this matter that relate substantially to the practicalities of the aged care legislation. We have to look at what is happening in the real world. There has been a very clear drift to composite facilities&mdash;flats, hostel accommodation, aged persons nursing homes and, in some cases, even hospitals. The reality is that more and more people are entering this system by the sale of their home. My mother did years ago. People sell their homes and buy into one of these composite units. The deposit that is referred to so often&mdash;the accommodation bond, in this case&mdash;is paid at that point in time and follows that individual as they progress, in many cases, from the hostel to the nursing home. A legal requirement is in place&mdash;established by the previous government&mdash;for that bond to be paid. And I am not a critic of that. The bond is there, and it represents no further problem if people transfer from one facility to another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who suffer from strokes and things of that nature might find themselves admitted immediately to a nursing home. It is unfortunate for many of them that their stay is relatively short. In a practical sense, this provision will probably not apply or the diminution of their bond will be quite small. Some of these things need to brought into
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reality. A picture is being painted that this is a universal measure that is going to strike people down in their hundreds. It has been pointed out that it is means tested&mdash;and so it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue relative to all of this, and that is the reference to nursing services in aged care nursing homes. This should not be an industrial issue. This should not be, `Who gets the job?' This should be an issue of what is a fair measure of the needs of that facility for nursing services&mdash;highly qualified, specially trained people with a medical background. Clearly there is a need, and clearly it should be well serviced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of giving a better overall service with the funds that are available, there tends to be a belief in our community that the funds are unlimited. It is this approach to universal health services through Medicare that has been gobbling up more of the federal budget than anything else I know of. As someone who will go out and pay $25 to $30 for a simple meal in a restaurant, I wonder why I, on my salary, am entitled to a free first visit to a doctor at a cost of $20 to $30. I find that rather silly when it takes away money from people such as the disabled and the aged who, I believe, might need it more. But that is a separate issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes down to nursing services in an aged persons facility, should we have nurses washing bedpans or making beds; or, if they are a little frail&mdash;as they might be&mdash;but have the maximum of skills, should they be turning over heavy patients or should we have people with lesser skills under their supervision doing that sort of work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding that that is what this legislation provides for. It allows the expert&mdash;the person who is operating the nursing home&mdash;to say, `This is a better balance of the people I need to give an appropriate service.' It is not always the case that you need a person who has passed many exams to do a lot of the jobs that apply in servicing these unfortunate people who are in nursing homes. So why not have that better service? Why run a scare campaign? But the light is on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something that I really wanted to say this morning in the guillotined debate:
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5082"> if the legislation is as bad as you say it is, what are you worried about? Why don't you get it out there and let it be tested in the marketplace?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few comments about the principles that underlie this Aged Care Bill and the effect that it has on people generally, particularly those on low incomes. I was reading a collection of works of a number of prominent people's speeches the other day and I came across this in relation to a budget&mdash;admittedly a budget that was brought down a very long time ago, in 1909, and in another place. In his speech about a budget, David Lloyd George said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deception is always a pretty contemptible vice, but to deceive the poor is the meanest of all crimes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what we are seeing in this legislation. During the election campaign, there was no suggestion of this sort of measure. Even until recently, the charitable sectors that run the hostels and nursing homes did not understand that this would be the outcome of this legislation, and they went along with the minister for some time. But what they are seeing clearly now is an impact on low&hyphen;income earners. The organisations in the charitable sector, including the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants, the Community Services Australia Uniting Church, the Alzheimers Association and so on, have gone
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the trouble to draw attention to what the impact is likely to be. I will outline that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly will result in a two&hyphen;tier system. This is not a scare campaign on the part of Labor; it is an outcome of the financing arrangements that this bill proposes. It will certainly mean quality care for some and poor quality care for others. I think it is important to recognise, too, that the entry fee that forms part of these proposals was explicitly rejected by Gregory. Yes, he did draw attention to capital needs and, yes, this government and all future governments will need to address them, but he very clearly rejected the entry fee and for a range of reasons which he outlines in his report. He says, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to sell assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems too harsh a measure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I absolutely agree, which is why it was not adopted by the former government and why it should not be adopted by this government either, for the reasons that have been outlined by a great many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, let us look at the circumstances of entry. The government has wilfully confused the difference between hostel and nursing home care, refusing to recognise that entry to a nursing home is frequently not based on choice at all. Sixty per cent of people entering a nursing home do so from hospital after a serious illness, including such things as a stroke. Of course, in addition, many also suffer from dementia. These are not exactly the most appropriate circumstances in which to make critical decisions about assets and the disposal of assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But more important is the fact that the people who are running these services are the ones who are complaining to the government and to us, as members of parliament, about the likely impact of these changes. These are described very fully in that report that I mentioned, `Changes in aged care: the impact on consumers with low incomes'. They say in this joint paper:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5083">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strong feature of the current system is its horizontal and vertical equity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Which is code for: it is fair to everybody. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nursing home residents have equal access to the system regardless of income or assets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to say that the changes under the new system have:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the potential to result in a two&hyphen;tiered system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And this was before they actually knew what was being offered for concessional residents. They have made much stronger statements subsequently. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Socioeconomically deprived suburbs will have lesser quality buildings whilst, within some facilities, the quality of accommodation will depend on the resident's capacity to pay an accommodation bond. And in some cases competition will drive those accommodation bonds up and residents without the means will be driven out.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a conclusion that has been reached by the people who are providing the facilities&mdash;it is not a Labor scare campaign. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the nursing home sector, there is currently no incentive to discriminate against anyone on the basis of income and assets&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is very important&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, a fundamental principle of the system has been to ensure access for everybody. This will now radically change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, these are the people providing the services. These are the people who are using the services and representing people who do. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the brave new world of competition between sectors,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">user pays and self&hyphen;regulation, will we be able to retain the integrity of services to provide care on the basis of need and not be driven to providing on the basis of income and assets?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a rhetorical question which they clearly answer in the negative. They will not be able to ensure equity of access. I continue:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the Aged Care Bill 1997 and the amendments put forward. First of all, I would like to say that the current residential aged care system has a number of faults. It is too inflexible and it does not fulfil basic community needs&mdash;40 per cent of existing residents have to share a room with four or more others. But the most important thing is the increasing demand. In 1991 in Australia there were two million Australians over 65 years of age who would eventually require some form of residential aged care. The situation in the year 2030 will be that there will be five million Australians over the age of 65 years&mdash;an enormous burden for this country to have to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has quite rightly not only looked at the existing situation but she has also looked towards the future and, with a vastly increasing aged population, at the need for dignity, comfort, security and privacy. She has focused on residents' needs and not on their means. The Minister for Family Services is going to unify residential care under one simple funding scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say, though, that those who go out and needlessly scare older Australians are doing a great disservice to those in our country who are frail and who should be cared for and given consideration in their old age&mdash;not frightened as people in my electorate have been. As a result of what the shadow minister has been saying, I have had phone calls from older people in my electorate. I have gone out to see them and I have run information days with the home, with the management, with the staff, with the relatives and with the residents. When they actually have information, people say, `Well, that sounds very fair. That's fine. You've answered our questions. We are comfortable with that.' So I have actually gone out and done it. I have not sat here and decided that I would frighten older people in our community. I have gone out and presented what  is not only a package for those who
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5084"> are old now but also a package for future Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want very briefly, in the time left, to go over some of the changes that our minister has made. She has put forward a mission statement&mdash;something that the opposition has never done. We now have a future&mdash;goals and ideals for future aged care, a mission statement; something that we have never done before. Moving on, we now have accommodation bonds.

At the moment, the government funding for somebody on a low level of care is $29,000 per year per resident, going up to about $39,000 per year per resident for somebody needing a higher level of care. But that only pays for day to day care. It does not pay for upgrades, for rehabilitation and certainly not for capital expenditure in a nursing home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to give people the quality of care that they require in the future, we are going to have to look at some method to do so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An issue of particular interest to me and to my electorate has been the area of variable fees in hostels. It is important to note that not all hostels will be affected by the change from variable fees. Around 30 per cent of hostels charge on this basis; the remainder do not. Providers will receive additional funding as the basic contribution payable by hostel residents is aligned with that payable by nursing home residents. This will prove equivalent to 50 per cent of that which is currently provided through variable fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to ease the transition to the new system, grandparenting arrangements for existing residents will be allowed so that providers can continue to take some level of fee income from residents who are currently paying more than they would under the new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that the House recognises&mdash;I know the government does&mdash;the issues: the impact of the reforms and the improvements that these reforms will bring to regional and rural and remote services. The electorate of Grey covers nearly one million square kilometres and has one of the most diverse and sparse populations in the nation.

The conclusion that they have come to is that the providers in aged care are not only confused but considerably concerned about the implications of the details of this bill which are subject to the amendments that are being proposed by the shadow minister. The community delegation had this to say on the issue of accommodation bonds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does concern us is that the collection of these funds are to be used by agencies in the future for capital improvements on their facilities which in the past has been undertaken by way of capital grants from the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I did launch the national strategy against violence and crime which fulfils yet another election promise of the coalition. The law and justice policy for the last election stated that every Australian was entitled to feel safe in his or her home and on the streets. We are delivering on that commitment, in cooperation with the states and territories, through the most comprehensive strategy of programs at a national level to address violence and crime. The priorities of the national campaign against violence and crime in its first year are residential burglary, domestic violence and fear of crime in young people. Today's launch was in cooperation with the states and territories and there has been an allocation of $13 million over a period of three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House of the great contribution to the stability of the community and the great contribution to safety which came out of the national implementation of the firearms control from the police ministers in May of last year. Since then we have also seen the establishment of a national register of convicted paedophiles and the convening of the Aboriginal deaths in custody summit which has been set down for later this year. There have been family violence intervention projects, a domestic violence database has been established and there will be a domestic violence summit convened later this year to which the government and, I hope, all members of the parliament will be very strongly committed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have carried out a national women's safety survey and there have been a number of strategies to strengthen family responses to child abuse. There has also been a focus on a national youth suicide strategy and shortly after it came to office the government launched a number of youth homelessness pilot programs. There has been a rural and remote domestic violence initiative and, of course, there has been information on firearms safety. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5089">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these programs have been implemented since the government came to power some 14 months ago and they are an earnest of our commitment to mobilise the resources of the Commonwealth and the states in the most effective manner to combat violence and crime. At the launch today, I outlined a number of new initiatives, all of which are designed, I stress, in cooperation with the state and territory governments, to increase the level of security and stability that ordinary citizens in our community feel. There is often debate in Australia about the proper role of government. I put it to the House that there is no more important responsibility of government at all levels than to do all they can to provide the maximum climate of physical security, security of property, the right of Australian citizens to walk the streets without interference or molestation, the right of Australians to travel on trains and buses late at night without interference or molestation and the right of people to visit sporting events without being molested or abused by people behaving in an anti&hyphen;social way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again thank the honourable member for Grey for raising these very important issues in the House. The issue of the sale of AN is causing a great deal of interest and concern in South Australia because the Labor Party has decided to block the sale of AN in the Senate. This has caused alarm and outrage in South Australia, particularly amongst AN workers who have seen the coalition government's decision to sell AN, to give it a new owner with a new capital
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5090"> injection and a new management direction, as the best way forward for the development of rail in Australia and for the future of AN workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the decision the Labor Party has made to block the sale, AN workers are now going out there and expressing their concerns publicly and volubly to the Labor Party about how outraged they are at the Labor Party's action. Last week I drew to the attention of the House that AN workers at the workshops at Port Augusta had written to me and had expressed their alarm. Earlier this week I said that AN workers at Islington workshops were writing to me. I read from a letter from one of those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, in the South Australian parliament, a motion was moved expressing support for the government's decision to sell AN and calling on the Labor Party to give up their opposition to this sale. Also in that debate in the South Australian parliament a number of local organisations were identified as supporting the government's decision to sell AN and opposing the Labor Party's decision to block it. The list is very long but I will read out some of them. Rail 2000, a lobby group of the rail industry in South Australia, supports the government in their decision to sell AN. The Trades and Labour Council of Port Augusta supports the government in their decision to sell AN and is opposed to the Labor Party's decision to block it. The Spencer Region Development Association, the Northern Regional Development Board, the South Australian Farmers Federation, the Australian Barley Board and the Australian Wheat Board: all of these organisations have expressed their support for the sale of AN because they see this as the way forward for rail in Australia and an opportunity to give those people who work at AN a future and some real prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that really annoys people is the enormous hypocrisy which has been displayed by the Labor Party in this decision. Here is a Labor Party that in government were prepared to privatise so many government instrumentalities: Australian Airlines, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. They tried to privatise the airports and they tried to privatise ANL
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but failed, of course, with those latter two. Here was a Labor Party prepared to do all of those things in government yet, here they are now in opposition doing a complete and utter backflip from their policies in government and being very opportunistic. In the process they are causing alarm and concern amongst those people who work for AN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN workers have now decided to put out a petition to urge the Labor Party to change their minds and not to block this in the Senate, and to let the privatisation of AN go forward. The local paper in Port Augusta, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transcontinental</EMPHASIS>, quotes from a worker who perhaps best describes the feeling of people who work at AN. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This continuing uncertainty is destroying the morale of the work force that remains and we believe that a new rail operator of the workshops and the transport activities of AN would be more beneficial to ourselves, our families, the community of Port Augusta and Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the workers at AN want. That is what the people of South Australia want. The only people who do not want to give those people a new future and new hope and to give rail a new direction are the Labor Party who have been totally opportunistic and hypocritical in their actions to block the sale of AN. I join with the workers of AN in calling on the Labor Party to change their minds. I join with the workers of AN in asking that the Leader of the Opposition and their transport spokesman go and meet with the workers of AN. Stand up to them and hear from the workers themselves the support that the workers for AN have for the sale of AN and their opposition to the Labor Party's policies.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I refer to the capacity for people to make direct bargains at a workplace level; the fact that it is no longer possible for unions to compulsorily inject themselves into negotiations between employers and employees when they are not wanted; the fact that the unfair dismissal laws have been significantly improved, although we believe the legacy of anti&hyphen;small business practices from the former government were such that even further reforms in that area are desirable; the removal of compulsory unionism; the return of the secondary boycott protection; the capacity of business to get compliance orders from the courts and from the commission. All of those things have provided an infinitely more flexible labour market. Of the many reforms my government has implemented, I am particularly proud of the way in which we have made the Australian labour market infinitely more flexible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question. The government's initiatives in relation to literacy and vocational education and training are directed to striking at the heart of the disadvantages of young people in the labour market&mdash;disadvantages which they inherited after 13 years of the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A document has recently fallen into my hands&mdash;a very  insightful and in&hyphen;depth analysis of these issues. This analysis acknowledges the value of the government's initiatives and also contrasts and compares the government's initiatives with those of the former government. I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition has seen this analysis yet, but I am sure he would be very interested in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder, for example, whether the Leader of the Opposition would accept the conclusion of this analysis, that the Labor Party in government `did not pay anything like enough attention to the early years of schooling'&mdash;those years when the literacy skills, of course, have to be communicated. I wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition also accepts that `accommodating the needs of those not intending to proceed directly on to university

Again, under the Labor Party education policy, it was `fundamentally unfair that the needs only of those intending to follow an academic pathway are taken into account when framing the year 12 curriculum'. The member for Werriwa might well take notice of this. In relation to adult and community education this document states that the Labor Party `always paid lip&hyphen;service to the broader goals of education' and that future Labor governments `must not repeat this failure'. I suppose people are wondering who the author of this document is. The author of the document makes it quite clear that the Labor Party's education policies failed young people, they failed school leavers and they failed adults.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The budget includes a number of measures to assist small business with the taxation system with the aim of helping those small businesses with reductions in paper work and, indeed, reductions in the cash&hyphen;flow demands of the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large number of small businesses&mdash;some 300,000&mdash;will be given the option now of paying to the Australian Taxation Office on a quarterly basis rather than a monthly basis. The measures which I announced in the budget apply to those small businesses which have a withholding requirement of under $25,000 who after 30 June 1998, rather than remitting on a monthly basis, will be remitting on a quarterly basis, reducing the number of occasions on which they have to interact with the Australian Taxation Office from 12 to four&mdash;a reduction to one-third in relation to the administration requirements with the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5094">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will allow those small businesses to defer the payment of tax in 1998-99 of $500 million in terms of cash flow as a result of this measure. This comes on top of a number of other taxation measures which the government has introduced to assist small business. There was the reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. There was the introduction of generous capital gains tax rollover provisions for small businesses with assets up to $5 million. Where they rollover a business or rollover an asset, they can do so without the imposition of capital gains tax. That is an option to allow small business to grow bigger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also came along with an option for small business to rollover into retirement up to $500,000 at a cost of $50 million per annum. In relation to fringe benefits tax, from 1 April this year small businesses are exempt from fringe benefits tax on car parking on their business premises, and the arrangements for employee taxi travel have been extended allowing taxi travel to and from work to be entirely exempt from fringe benefits. These are enormous improvements in the taxation system which allow small business the opportunity to get on with the job and to save.

Indeed, it is World Environment Day, and the potential to answer this question at this stage after the government has been in power through two budgets and to focus on what we have been able to achieve in the environment is welcome. There are a couple of areas I would like to highlight to the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is climate change. We would all recognise that moving on greenhouse emissions is fundamentally important and reductions, in cooperation with the business community, have been achieved. During the year, 30 of Australia's leading companies, 12 industry associations and one government have signed agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the government is committed to continuing that agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of forests, an area that has bedevilled governments throughout this country for some time, we have made significant progress. An additional $48 million will be spent over three years to expedite the completion of comprehensive regional assessments of the nation's forests. That will allow the government to fulfil its election commitment to bring forward the completion of regional forest agreements, the first of which has already been signed for the East Gippsland region and the RFA for Tasmania is currently under negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of policy is to provide certainty to the utilisation of forestry, to provide sustainability of the forest assets that we have and, of course, to give job opportunities. The unique partnership between my colleagues the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in developing these forest policies has been a major achievement of this government to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area which we do not often hear about, but in which a major milestone was reached only last week, is whaling. A national task force on whaling has been established and the report to government has been received. It is an election promise which we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5095"> have fulfilled. The report of the task force was given to the Minister for the Environment this past week on how to achieve the implementation of a permanent international ban on commercial whaling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of world heritage, the Commonwealth and the Queensland governments have already successfully agreed joint management arrangements for the Fraser Island world heritage area, something which the former Queensland and Commonwealth Labor governments were unable to do. In addition, we have nominated Heard Island, McDonald Island and Macquarie Island for world heritage listing, another election promise fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are an island continent so, therefore, oceans and coasts are particularly important to so many of our communities. We undertook significant steps to ensure that Australia becomes a world leader in marine conservation and management with the development of the very first comprehensive oceans policy, which the Prime Minister launched recently. That will be completed and continued in the first half of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have heard in this House, we have also established the Green Corps, a first for Australia, to focus the energies of young Australians to enhance the environment whilst at the same time acquiring additional skills to lead them down a job path and an education path that benefits the nation and those individuals. It is a very innovative program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, after a lot of grandstanding and needless delay by the opposition, the major program that we have achieved and put in place is the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. Why the Labor Party opposed it, I do not know. I do not know why they hate the environment. We know the opposition leader does not like sport, but why they hate the environment and would not support the Natural Heritage Trust is beyond me. Why do they hate the environment?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had a few teething problems. They ranged from things such as the phone lines not being of sufficient quality to adequately transmit, to the design of the form and the design of the booth. But the point of the trial was that we were able to sort those out, and we now have the first stage of the evaluation of the trial in these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evaluation has been very positive. From the public's point of view, of the people we surveyed, 13 per cent had used the facility in the previous month. Of that 13 per cent, 89 per cent of people said the facility improved their access to Medicare and 87 per cent of people said they would use it again in the future. Overall, the response from pharmacists has been very positive as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This now enables us to expand the system. Eventually we will have 400 of these agencies, but over the next week the government will be announcing a further 105 agencies. These agencies have been decided on the basis of four criteria: pharmacies should be in receipt of a rural or isolated pharmacy allowance; the percentage of direct bill claims in the postcode area must be no greater than 75
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5097"> per cent; the average number of patient claims per day must be sufficiently high to justify the expense; and a Medicare customer service centre must not be located close to the pharmacy. With one exception only, they are the criteria that have been used&mdash;the exception being in Forbes, in the electorate of Parkes, to maintain an election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Payment can be made by cheque or by electronic funds transfer. Over half the people have chosen electronic funds transfer. This, together with greater electronic funds transfer capabilities and electronic lodgment in doctors' surgeries, goes to keeping our commitment to country people that we would increase Medicare access for them. It will do so substantially and it will give country people something that city people take for granted.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

What is the government's response to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's report on its inquiry into consular services? What has the government done to improve consular operations in the department?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5097" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and particularly recognise the interest that the honourable member has in the consular operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The government gives a very high priority to the consular work of my department and, since the election, we have instituted a series of reforms that I think have very substantially improved the performance of the department in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, we have established a consular response group. That is giving a specific focus to the care of families of those in crisis, such as in the Fraser hostage case in Somalia. Secondly, we have substantially upgraded the honorary consul system and our intention is to upgrade it still further. Thirdly, I have established a consular information unit in Canberra to provide relevant information to Australian travellers going overseas, and I am
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5098"> about to establish a 24-hour consular duty officer arrangement which will be available to callers in emergency situations overseas. Fourthly, the consular branch of my department is preparing guidelines for staff on handling the victims of sexual assaults overseas and, on my instructions, a diplomatic campaign has been carried out to encourage countries to accede to the Hague Convention on Child Abduction Issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member suggested in his question, my attention has been drawn to a Senate committee report and to those aspects of the report which were unanimously endorsed by members of the committee. Of course, the committee is one which has a majority of Labor members on it. I notice in  particular though that, despite the Labor majority on the committee&mdash;the usual practice is that where there is a Labor majority they defend their own kind&mdash;this committee was prepared to be critical of the performance of the previous government and obviously, by implication, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, part of the old guard. For example, the committee did raise serious questions about the way the previous government acted in the treatment of the families of those in consular difficulties, and the report found that inadequate attention had been given to the families of victims. I point out to the House that that has now been rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also criticism of the previous government over the handling of the Wilson case, in particular in the context of the so-called `no comment' policy. The Labor members of the committee, along with others, thought the policy pursued by the previous foreign minister, the now member for Holt, was a mistaken policy. Thirdly, I draw the House's attention to the fact that the Labor members of that committee and others were critical of the way the member for Holt had handled the very difficult case of Dr John Flynn,  who was incarcerated in India. The committee, frankly, made it perfectly clear that not enough was done for Dr Flynn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell the House these things because, in my portfolio, significant priority must be given to consular cases. The Australian government does have a responsibility to do all it can
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within its powers for Australians in distress overseas. That was not the practice of the previous government, as Labor members of the Senate have made perfectly clear.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Why has the government forced cuts of 1,900 student  places and $14.4 million from the University of New South Wales and forced the closure of the St George campus, the only university facility in southern Sydney near where the Prime Minister grew up, a decision described by Liberal Senator John Tierney as `an act of modern day piracy'? Will the government at least support endeavours by the New South Wales government to transfer the campus to the University of Wollongong and now offer transitional funding and student places for that purpose?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5101" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding of the situation is that the decision to close the campus was taken by the governing authority of the University of New South Wales. There is a clear policy of granting greater autonomy to universities. That is a policy of the government; a very clear policy. The decision was taken by the ruling authority of the University of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government laid down a program of reforms for the higher education sector last year. I want to congratulate the minister for the courage that she displayed in implementing those policies. Those policies over time will work to the greater benefit of the university sector of Australia. I believe that those policies will provide greater opportunities for Australian students. Those policies will relieve the heavy burden carried by the working
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people of Australia for the education of people from middle and upper income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It passes very strange to me that representatives of the Australian Labor Party would continue to espouse an approach to higher education which imposed heavy burdens on low income earners in Australia. The HECS reforms, although unpopular with some sections of the higher education fraternity and unpopular with some sections of the student body in terms of social justice and social equity, are reforms that are eminently defensible. I believe they are an integral part of a program of change in the higher education sector that over years will be seen not only as correct but also as extremely courageous reforms.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. In recent weeks a scare campaign has been mounted by various groups to justify their opposition to the government's proposal to exempt small business from the unfair dismissal provisions. What is the minister's response to these claims?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5101" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He is quite right; though, mind you, the mounting of that scare campaign is from a fairly limited base within the treacherous front ranks of the Labor opposition. It is incredible for them to mount an attack on the reforms that we have proposed with respect to unfair dismissal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the problems that we have had with the unfair dismissal scheme were the creation of the Labor government when they were in office. We have gone a long way to fixing these problems. We have significantly changed the system. We have wiped away the previous minister's reliance on the international convention, we were opposed by the Labor opposition in the Senate all through the reform process on unfair dismissals and now, in this further element of change, we find them attempting to run a scare campaign against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had five questions from the opposition to the Prime Minister in the last
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5102"> week on the question of the operation of the unfair dismissal scheme and the proposals which we have mooted. It is instructive to look back at those five examples. The first three were presented to the Prime Minister on 29 May. In a very open way, he said, `If you could give me the details, I would be happy to give you a response in respect of those individual cases.' My office rang the office of the shadow minister and sought the details. We have had no response to our request for the details. We now know why&mdash;because then they actually nominated a specific case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took advice from my department. My department provided advice in respect of this statement from the shadow minister, `The employee in question was sacked for failing to implement an instruction to dismiss another employee simply because she was pregnant.' I am advised by my department that that statement is an incorrect statement of the facts of the case. I am not surprised by that because yesterday we had another case, and this time they gave us the details again. This is the case of Schafer and Coliero. The shadow minister did not tell us that this was a case brought under the old rules&mdash;under the Brereton legislation, but leave that aside. What is more important is that he did not say that, in the event of small business being exempted from the provisions, it would still be open on the facts of this case for the complainant in that case to pursue her claim that she was dismissed because of her age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing they do not want you to know is that, whilst we would remove the unfair dismissal provisions, they are only part of the protections available under the workplace relations act. There is a raft of other protections available for people, which is why we say it is a fair scheme. Yet you misrepresented the facts of this case in the question that you asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the act, we have protections. For example, section 170CK of the workplace relations act prohibits employers&mdash;small, medium or large, regardless of the circumstances, regardless of whether they have 15 or less employees or otherwise and regardless of whether it is in the first 12 months or not&mdash;from sacking employees on the grounds of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. Those are only some of the protections; I would be happy to make the balance available to the shadow minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a useful and sensible change in conformity with the international convention and in conformity with the practice of a number of other countries in the OECD. We have done a lot to fix up the unfair dismissal provisions. We have seen a 50 per cent reduction in the unfair dismissal applications in the federal system. We have seen a bit of a pick up in the state system, but that was the design of our system. It was not the state systems that were the problem; it was the federal system put in place by the previous Labor administration. I say to the opposition: if you want to have a debate about it, let's get the facts straight for starters.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The Leader of the Opposition said in government that privatisation was consistent with job creation; now he says it is not.

He said in government that reducing the budget deficit would boost jobs growth; now he tells us the opposite. He said in government that industrial relations reform was important for job creation; now he refuses to acknowledge a link.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I refer to yesterday's question concerning the industrial dispute affecting cleaners in this building. I thank your staff for their assistance this morning with regard to this matter. What arrangements are in place to consult members and other users of the building concerning their preferences with regard to office cleaning while offices and meeting rooms are in use? Will you ensure that the Joint House Department attends meetings with the employer and the unions to make clear the preference of building users concerning the choice between the 4 o'clock to 8 o'clock cleaning option and the 6 o'clock to 10 a.m. cleaning option and make clear the facts concerning the allegation that the changes proposed were in fact requested by the Joint House Department, which I understand to be untrue? If it is clear, as I believe it is, that the convenience of building users lies in the 4 o'clock to 8 o'clock cleaning option in terms of the use of offices, meeting rooms, car parking, et cetera, will you make clear this preference to Limro, to the union and, if necessary, to the Industrial Relations Commission as soon as possible?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

The dispute was heard in the Industrial Relations Commission, as I predicted, yesterday. It is understood that, in conference, the parties agreed to a return to work, to the resumption of negotiations between the parties and to report back to the commission on 18 June 1997 about progress with these negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have two questions for you. Firstly, you would be aware, as all members would be, of the laudatory proposal in this budget by the Treasurer for a $1 billion Federation Fund. In view of the concern that many of us have about the present use and regrettable decay of the old Parliament House, would you take up with Madam President and the Prime Minister the possibility of lodging a submission within the Federation Fund for the refurbishment of the old Parliament House and its development in such a way that appropriate ceremonies can take place in that building to commemorate Federation and so that the building might more appropriately be maintained so that the future generations of Australians will be able to see that centre and historical source of democracy indefinitely into the future?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, while the responsible administration is the Department of Communications and the Arts, I understand there are four principal tenants of old Parliament House: the National Museum of Australia, the National Library's National Portrait Gallery, Australian Archives and the National Film and Sound Archive. In conjunction with your own operations and that of Madam President's within the parliament, I understand there are a number of functions undertaken by you and conducted by officers located outside this building. Would you consider, and report to the parliament in due course, what accommodation the officers and departments of the parliament use outside Parliament House, where they are, the footage that is taken up and the cost of that footage so that all members can look, make a comparison and perhaps make recommendations so that you might take up some of the space now required within old Parliament House and bring it back within the purview of the parliament itself?</PARA></QUESTION>

Another marvellous venue would be old Parliament House as we know it.

The Prime Minister said five weeks ago on the Ray Martin program&mdash;he who must be obeyed&mdash;`I am going to Newcastle soon', and still he has not turned up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a Prime Minister who has hidden from the union movement bringing a submission to him today to support the car industry, just as he was hiding yesterday from a delegation from Geelong, until the urgings and pressure from the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) shamed him into meeting with them. This is the person who wants to express concern for the battlers of Australia but will not lift a finger to help them.</PARA>

Yesterday, when the national accounts figures came out showing the manufacturing sector of this nation in recession, the Treasurer came out and said, `These are where we want the numbers to be.' I almost heard the former Treasurer say `the beautiful set of numbers'. Next we will hear that they are bringing home the bacon. This Treasurer goes home at night and watches replays of the former Treasurer performing his act in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is, this is the Treasurer who is running government policy, that is the person who again has rolled the industry minister, and the Prime Minister tries to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5110"> come  forward and say, `This proposal for a 10 per cent tariff, not 15 per cent, is a compromise.' The wisdom of Solomon! You do not go for five per cent, you do not go for 15 per cent; you go for 10 per cent. Presumably the principle is that by going for the compromise you only lose half of the jobs in the car industry: the jobs of the 47,000 people who depend on this industry directly and the 300,000 who depend on it indirectly; not just the four companies&mdash;Ford, Toyota, Mitsubishi and Holden&mdash;but the 200 component plants around the country which have gone into export markets because of Labor's car plan and have created thousands of jobs in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been today to a rally in Albury, the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). Where was he? He was in hiding too, overseas, selling out car workers in this country. That is what he was doing, and he should have been at the rally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is, this government has no industry policy and it has no commitment or strategy to getting manufacturing jobs up in this country. Quite frankly, to come into this place and say that all the jobs are going to come from services is absolute nonsense unless you have a manufacturing sector. It is true that there will be enormous job growth coming off the services sector, but what do you service if you have not got a manufacturing base? A country without a manufacturing base is a country without a heart, it is a country without a direction and it is a country without a future. That is why this government needs to support the manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has presided now for 14 months. We just heard the Prime Minister trying to tell us how we had not broken any promises. Look at the programs he has slashed in the manufacturing sector. Of the last four quarters of the national accounts figures, three of them in the manufacturing sector have been negative. That is some performance, some great contribution to the future of this nation!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are told concerning the car industry is that we have a compromise solution, the Costello solution&mdash;again, some compromise. We have two options&mdash;another day, another
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> option with this government. Every time you read the newspaper there is a new option. You have the Treasurer of the nation leaking to John Short, telling him how tough he is. `I'll give you the story, John, you run it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>'&mdash;`Treasurer wins greater tariff cuts' is the end result. The day before it was the industry minister leaking to John Short telling him how he had this great proposal to put forward. I will tell you how good the proposal was. It was contrary to our bindings under APEC and contrary to our obligations under the World Trade Organisation, and he succeeded in being the first minister in this country since Black Jack McEwen to have proposed a tariff increase.</PARA>

I have seen an interesting little press release today from the National Farmers Federation which says, `The 10 per cent cut is not enough and, if you are not going to cut it further, why did you cut our sugar tariffs?' Well they may ask. This government is one that has no consistency and no commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My challenge and the opposition's challenge to the government today is: if that is your plan, bring it on in the parliament. Make our day. Give us the opportunity to debate this ridiculous proposition. We want to debate it because what will happen under this proposal to cut tariffs to 10 per cent is that investment will dry up, and job and export opportunities will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today it was almost a bit of a revelation for the Prime Minister to hear what our car plan is. Our car plan actually creates jobs&mdash;you know, on the plus side. I know you have not had too many figures on the plus side; they have all been going into the red as far as manufacturing is concerned. Our car plan actually increases jobs. We have a commitment from the industry that if what we have proposed is put in place&mdash;the freeze at 15 per
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5111"> cent; the review, but having regard to what our international trading partners are doing; the retention of an equivalent of the export facilitation scheme; the retention of the duty free allowance; and the restoration of some research and development incentive&mdash;there will be 10,000 new jobs, together with a trebling of car component exports to $3 billion and a doubling of car exports also to $3 billion, which means $6 billion of exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might be wrong but I thought this government were saying their prime task was to create jobs and to address the current account. Yet here they are, presented with a plan that does both, and they squib it&mdash;they blink and hide. That is the Prime Minister: a pathetic leader. His hand is off the tiller but he is still at the back of the boat with the telescope, looking backwards: back to the GST, back to industrial relations reform and back to high unemployment, stunned that he has not managed to get the double of high inflation too because that is his track record. This is a Prime Minister with no commitment, no vision and no compassion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the Prime Minister does not want to live in Canberra, you cannot get him out of Kirribilli. He will not attend anywhere except, of course, Lords. He will go to the opening of a test match. He is the one who has been arguing most passionately for the retention of one person's job only&mdash;Mark Taylor's. Why doesn't he go to Newcastle and argue for the 2,500 steel workers? Why doesn't he support Labor's car plan and support the jobs of the 47,000 car workers? Why doesn't he give a signal to the 100,000 textile workers that their futures and their plans will be safe as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had today was the Prime Minister getting up stunned because of the interpretation of the Costello challenge last night. The dog was all over him; now we have the tail trying to wag that dog. We have this pathetic excuse for a Prime Minister limply coming into this place, trying to sound tough and telling us about all the promises he has honoured, but he will not honour his promise to go to Newcastle. He would not meet a delegation in the parliament today. He did not even have to go to these people&mdash;they were
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prepared to come to him. But he still would not see them. What sort of a person is this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that you have divisions on your side of the parliament in terms of this car tariff issue. You have the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) already saying she will cross the floor if the Costello proposal is carried. We have mild indignation from the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who says she does not support my bill. I think the members at Mitsubishi will be very interested to hear that because the members down there damn well support it. Yet the member for Hindmarsh is quoted as saying she would not rule out crossing the floor. So bring it on and test your strength. It is the same thing with the sugar tariff; you have tried to hide it in regulation so that you will not get a revolt from the National Party. We will use every device possible to make sure this issue of tariffs, and the legislation associated with it, is brought into the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that promised greater accountability and that it would use the forms of the House more openly and have more debate. Where are they? Hiding. Today the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) attempted to have the Aged Care Bill debated, and they gagged that. They have introduced a guillotine. They want to shorten debate on aged care and not even have debate on car care. What a pathetic government this is. Where is the leadership really coming from? Skulking back to the oval office, collecting the passports, collecting the tickets to Lords and picking up his first&hyphen;class ticket. Maybe he got it on frequent flyer points, because he likes to be a bit morally superior on these things. But he is not going to Newcastle. He is not going to Geelong. He is not going to Adelaide. He is not going to the regions of this country that depend on the manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you do not think the interventionist policies of government work in industry, let me quote you these figures. Between 1980 and 1996 manufacturing employment declined in this country by 120,000. All of that decline occurred from 1980 to 1985, when there were 140,000 jobs lost. They were the legacy of this government's former reign. In the period 1985&hyphen;1996, when Labor actually developed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5112"> industry policy and supported industries, manufacturing employment increased net 10,000, despite the recession of 1990. That is why these policies matter. That is why people are saying to you time and time again, `Get real and get an industry policy.' That is why we are saying to you, `Wake up.' We are prepared to be part of a bipartisan exercise to support you in industry policy. We are prepared to go out and work with industry, and to identify the things that matter to them and that get commitments from them to grow investment, grow jobs and grow exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about protection and looking inwards; this is looking outwards. This is about getting us into the export markets where the real opportunities are. But you need government assistance to do that. That is what Labor is committed to and that is what this government refuses to face up to. Worse, where we have industries that have actually succeeded, like the car and the steel industries, the government will not lift a finger. They will not even move their feet. The Prime Minister will not even get on the VIP jet and fly there at short notice. He will not even visit them. The government do not care and they do not deserve to be returned. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last 30 seconds of his speech the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) offered a bipartisan industry approach. It rings hollow; it is utterly untrue. Why did he spend 14&half; minutes of his contribution abusing, in the most personal terms, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore)? Suddenly, he thinks, in the dying seconds of his contribution, he can throw this hypocritical olive branch towards us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things he did not tell the House was the Labor Party's track record on manufacturing jobs. He did not tell the House that in the automotive industry between 1983 and 1996 the number of jobs fell from 70,000 to 45,000. He did not tell us that in the textile, clothing and footwear industries between 1986
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and 1996 the number of jobs fell by a massive 35,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that when the honourable member addressed the rally in Albury a short while ago he did not tell them that in the textile, clothing and footwear industries in 1986 there were 130,000 people employed and when they left office 10 years later the figure was down to 95,000&mdash;a loss of 35,000 jobs in 10 years. The Labor Party is the party of jobs destruction. It is utterly unconvincing and outright hypocritical for members of the Labor Party to now preach job creation in manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the automotive industry, the honourable member spoke about the Button plan and their plan for the future. Let us look at what happened during their years in office. In 1984, shortly after Labor came to office, car production in Australia stood at around 370,000 units, yet when they left office in 1996 production was just 314,000 units. Nissan had closed down production entirely and Australia had lost the capacity to produce small cars like the Ford Laser. In 1984, import penetration was 20 per cent. In 1996, it had more than doubled to 50 per cent of the market. So the opposition has no credibility. They had their chance in government and they devastated the textile, clothing and footwear industries and the automotive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, of course, they want instead to try to resurrect their credentials with the trade union movement, the work force and the general community by pursuing this high tariff policy. Again, they do one thing in government and say another in opposition. For instance, the honourable member for Hotham, who has now left the chamber, said this at the National Press Club on 14 August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trade union movement, I must say, took a long time to come to grips with this question, because they saw protection, tariff walls, as somehow protecting jobs, but all it did was to weaken the manufacturing capacity of the country . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a clear, unequivocal, unambiguous repudiation of a high tariff policy. On the ABC program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS> , on 28 February 1991, he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5113">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all that tariffs did was to make us look inward. All that tariffs did was to protect local production.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, he was deriding the notion of tariffs being a protector of manufacturing or Australian jobs. On the ABC television program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>  on 4 February 1992, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I am not a believer in the level playing field, but I am also a believer in the fact that part of the reason that we have got into the industrial mess we have is because we relied too heavily on tariff protection in the past.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is completely at odds with what he would now have the parliament and the Australian electorate believe. But he is not alone in this regard. Other senior economic ministers, and those who held other portfolios under the Hawke&hyphen;Keating governments, are now totally reversing their stance on the issue of tariffs as an input into industry policy, now that they are in opposition. Let us look at what the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) said in a ministerial statement to the Senate on 12 March 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the most powerful spur to greater competitiveness is further tariff reduction.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However much our competitors might bend or break the principles of fair trade, our own self&hyphen;interest is served by a steadfast refusal to return to the days of protectionism.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . worse still, tariffs are a regressive burden&mdash;that is, the poorest Australians are hurt more than the richest.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Hawke government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">deliberately and determinedly set about pulling down the tariff walls.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet now we have a succession of opposition spokespeople saying that the solution to loss of Australian jobs or to manufacturing decline is tariff protection. They have no credibility. Their record in government was not to set in place the wider economic settings that truly determine industry policy and upon which manufacturing survives or fails, expands or contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The classic case is that of another former ACTU President, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) who was interviewed on the ABC radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday, 13 March 1991, the day after the then govern
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment's 1991 industry statement, and the textile, clothing and footwear unions had alleged that further tariff reforms would lead to job losses. In defence of the government of the day, and endorsing the tariff policy, he said, `It's all about investment in our long&hyphen;term future.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), a former employment minister and former finance minister, was a great one in the old days&mdash;that is, in his government days&mdash;for pulling down tariffs. In November 1996, while visiting Indonesia, the Leader of the Opposition said that pursuing APEC's free trade goals was vital to the long&hyphen;term economic prosperity of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course he supports the need for Australians to develop market access. True industry policy is based upon investment and all the microeconomic and macroeconomic factors that will determine international investment or the decision to expand investment by domestic companies, innovation and investment in research and development by both the public and private sectors, and also market access overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the cheap and unnecessarily cruel jibes of the member for Hotham, the worst was to accuse the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) of being deliberately absent from a meeting concerned with the textile, clothing and footwear industry in his home town of Albury earlier today. He did himself no credit with that. I would have thought that nobody in this House, no fair&hyphen;minded or rational person, would believe that the Deputy Prime Minister is doing anything less than a splendidly successful job promoting Australian interest overseas. He is at the vanguard of tearing down the tariff and non-tariff barriers erected by other economies and countries to block Australian imports. To say that he should have been in Albury when a trip overseas promoting overseas exports had long been in the planning and execution is really below the belt. But it is so self&hyphen;evident it is not worth dwelling on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember that the Labor Party, as represented by the member for Hotham  today, brought about the highest unemployment rates in decades. In 1992 the unemploy
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5114"> ment rate hit 11 per cent, and youth unemployment was a record 34 per cent. Even so, we on this side of the House would show some understanding and tolerance of the Labor Party in opposition if it put its views sensibly, calmly, rationally and consistently. But on none of those criteria does the Labor Party succeed. Every day you will get a different statement or a different perspective on industry policy and economic policy more generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from the published paper of the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) what he thinks about the member for Hotham in his role as shadow minister for industry and also about the member for Holt, as shadow Treasurer. The rhetoric of the Labor Party simply does not live up to its track record and its actions when it was in government. The truth is that Labor's policy has been the cause of unemployment, which this government is tackling with such resolve and determination, particularly in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a sensible debate on industry policy. Today's MPI just heightens the difference between the government and the opposition on this vital issue of public administration. Their industry policy in 13 years of government is best characterised as a mates policy. They had a small number of sectoral policies covering a small number of industries. They generally ignored the rest of the economy. They did not tackle industrial relations reform, despite the pleadings of industry. Nor did they tackle waterfront reform, tax reform&mdash;except to increase it continually&mdash;or the budget deficit, which has the effect of pushing up interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should the Australian people take this discredited former government, and increasingly discredited opposition, seriously? We, instead, are getting on with the job. We have turned around the $10&half; billion deficit that we inherited on coming to government to a surplus of $1.6 billion next year. A down&hyphen;payment on that mammoth, herculean task is already available to Australians with a three per cent fall in official interest rates. That is going to be a stimulus to not just the housing and construction markets but industry more generally.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have locked in low inflation. We have brought about a substantially more flexible and responsive labour market. On top of that, we have introduced a great many regional policies for country areas. Despite the MPI today being phrased in terms of job losses in country areas, did we hear a word about it from the member for Hotham? Of course not! It is extraordinary. His idea of a regional centre, at the very best, is Geelong or Newcastle. Of course they are regional centres, but another 20 per cent of the Australian population lives in country and rural areas. There was not a word from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has published its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Regional Australia: leading the way</EMPHASIS> policy following the budget. It is a collection of all of the initiatives of the government and the respective funding for regional and rural Australia. It is a very impressive document. Work for the dole, Green Corps, the National Heritage Trust and the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund are skewed towards country and regional Australia. The funding is some $4 billion. Whether it be on health policy or road funding, this government is providing for country and regional Australia, thereby leading to a creation of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there was not a word from the member for Hotham because he in opposition is just reflecting the mind set of the Labor Party in government, that is, government policy, industry policy and job creation stop on the outskirts of the metropolitan areas. Instead, we see the prosperity of regional and country Australia depending on not just the general economic settings that the government is putting in place but also specific initiatives. Those initiatives are available for all to see in this publication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see the Labor Party put together a regional Australia publication which puts together their initiatives. Especially, I would like to see whether they were fully costed. On the one hand they talk about a balanced budget and, on the other, the need to spend money. We never see the two balanced, let alone come into some sort of sensible equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's industry policy is something which will put in place a sustainable
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5115"> long-term job creation result. Only by having in place the different aspects of industry policy and economic reform will you bring about true job creation. It is not enough to make noise about sectorial plans, whether it be in regard to car manufacturing or textiles, clothing and footwear. You actually have to put in place genuine sustainable programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, with the steel plan you speak of, you keep harking back to the Button plan. When are you going to tell us where one cent of the Button steel plan was paid to Newcastle BHP for steel production? Not one cent of the Button steel plan was paid to BHP Newcastle for the production of steel there. What they needed was investment in new technology to make sure the plant was viable for years to come. Yet your policies failed to ensure that that would happen. Despite the carping, the rhetoric, the exaggerations and the fearmongering of the member for Hotham, this MPI is utterly discredited.</PARA></SPEECH>

There is an old adage in politics: never return to the scene of the crime. Yet here we have a Prime Minister who, after only 16 months in office, is returning to the scene of the crime. The crime was the economic mess that he left the Australian nation in in 1983.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is leaving the country soon, as the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) pointed out. He is going to Lords to see the cricket. He cannot make it to Newcastle to see workers who are going to lose their jobs by the thousands, but he can go to Lords to see the cricket. The problem is that the workers in Newcastle who are going to lose their jobs cannot even see the cricket that the Prime Minister is going to Lords to see because, when they turn on their TV sets tonight to see the first session at Lords, they will not be able to see it because the Prime Minister has broken another promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program in February that he was going to change the law so that Australian workers could watch the cricket. He has not done that. Tonight, as Newcastle workers look down the barrel of losing their jobs, as Geelong workers look down the barrel of losing their jobs in the car industry, as the textile, clothing and footwear workers in Geelong and across the length and breadth of this nation look down the barrel of losing their jobs and as they cannot see the cricket tonight, the Prime Minister will be away over there watching the cricket that they cannot watch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very good reasons why this situation of low growth, rising unemployment and a technical recession in the manufacturing sector has occurred. It is obvious to all in this nation that this government lacks an industry policy. Businesses have been saying it for months. The only persons who are not hearing the message are the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and, of course, the industry minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen inaction on the steel industry and now we see a paralysis occurring in the major regions of this nation because of the incapacity of this government to reach a decision on car industry tariffs. But, more than anything else, it is the industry minister, the minister who should have been sacked according to the Prime Minister's own ministerial code of conduct, who has dragged down the confidence of the manufacturing industry in this country in its own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has introduced two deflationary budgets that have really sucked the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> confidence out of regional areas. It has withdrawn support for regional areas in a raft of industry programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go and talk to the manufacturers in regional areas, they are saying that this is a dumb government without an industry policy, that this is a rudderless government with a Prime Minister paralysed and incapable of making the key decisions that are necessary for it to have confidence in its future, to invest and to create more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very good reason why the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) is in here today. He is safe in here; he is not safe in Geelong.

I happened to be walking down the corridors earlier today, and there was the member for Kingston with her suitcase scurrying out of Parliament House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a document here that was delivered to me yesterday by the delegation from Geelong, whom I gave my time to very honestly. It is signed at the back by the Mayor of Geelong and the Vice-Chancellor of Deakin University. I think it is a pretty authentic document. What does it tell me on page 5? It tells me that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1990 and 1996 unemployment in Geelong soared from 4.5% to nearly 11.0%. In 1990 it was 2% cent below the national average but today it is 2% above. Restructuring in the automotive industry caused over 7,000 jobs to be lost.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now, tell me who was in government between 1990 and 1996. Not us. We were in govern
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment for only a month or so of that period. It was the Labor Party in government for all that time. That quote was not my words. Here is the document, and it will be quoted from. It tells us what your car plan did to jobs down there. God save us from your car plans. That is what I say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard a lot of talk about Newcastle. What is Labor's solution for Newcastle? Send the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) up there to have a chat. What is that going to achieve? The achievement we are planning for Newcastle is to find solutions for their inherent problem. Their problem has a lot more to it than the profitability of BHP. It has a lot to do with the fact that the new fundamentals of the steel industry are not coal and iron ore. The fundamentals are gas and iron ore, and they happen to be available side by side in Western Australia, so other interests in my electorate are going to spend $1.6 billion on a new steel industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the solutions for Newcastle? Maybe it is to involve them in this $25 billion offshore gas and energy development. What is needed for that? For a start, as the press informed us yesterday, they need to be able to overcome native title problems and environmental problems. Where does the present opposition stand on that? They do not want to fix the environmental problems or the native title problems which just might create those jobs, which just might make Newcastle's facilities suitable for the manufacturing of all those offshore units for which a lot of the facilities and a huge quantity of expertise exist now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No, Labor will go on demanding that a major company in Australia goes broke by being kept open. Who will that help? Nobody. That shows no sense whatsoever. That is the sort of thing we get from the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go on, because there are solutions for the industry. What was Labor's approach in government? They knew what the trifecta for industry policy was: it was reform of the tariff system, it was reform of the tax system and it was reform of the labour market. That is the trifecta. You cannot operate with only one. But of course the ACTU knocked the Labor Party out on tax reform. They tried
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5118"> that, but the then Prime Minister and Bill Kelty had a meeting in a grubby little motel room and that went out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, you never even dared mention labour market reform. What was the result? You were left with the blunt instrument of tariff reform. You used it and you created a situation where employers had only one choice. They moved offshore to where the tax regime and the employment arrangements were much more attractive and they exported back into Australia where you had lowered the tariffs to a point where they could have access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we find today? You go into K-Mart and see all those `great Australian' brands. They still have the brand name, but what does the little ticket that goes at the back of your neck tell you? `Made in China'. Of course, now we have a situation where you could not walk away from that if you wanted to because it has had a substantial effect on the cost of living in Australia. As much as a lot of people would like to see our industries protected, they do not want to pay any more for the things they buy at K-Mart. They are not too happy about paying much more for a motor car either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But don't take my word for it. The member for Corio does not hang around to get some advice as to how he might practically and positively help his people. He is much more interested in criticising the government. He is much more interested in trying to build up the electoral prospects of his party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite do not want to talk about fixing the native title situation so that $11.6 billion of steel consuming and vehicle consuming industries come on in Australia. That is what is held up by the current arrangements in the native title situation. I gave ground on my preferred philosophical position, recognising the national interest, and you cannot do it yet.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Car buyers pay 22% wholesale sales tax on new vehicles, almost twice the "normal" rate of 12% and possibly the highest rate in the developed world.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who put that up to 22 per cent? That was the price that was put on after the l-a-w election. What else does it say? It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vehicle buyers are responsible for only 3% of all purchases of goods and services, yet they pay 27% of all sales tax&mdash;more than double the amount paid by the second&hyphen;biggest victim, the drinker. Whitegoods are taxed at 12%, and travel, housing and clothing are not taxed at all&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and listen to this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but they compete against cars for the discretionary dollar.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And you cry crocodile tears about the people in Geelong! If the tax on cars were reduced to the more general rate of 12 per cent, the cost of a six&hyphen;cylinder family car would fall by almost $2,000 and every year 60,000 more Australians would be able to afford a new vehicle. Has the member for Corio ever thought of that simple fact? Has he ever stood up in this parliament and thumped the table for tax reform in the interests of his constituents? No, not him. He does not want to see the national interest improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur)&mdash;I stand here and say it because I have heard his thoughtful contributions in our party room and in our committees&mdash;understands what is best for his people. The reality is that it is not standing up in this place crying crocodile tears when your own policy has failed and you are putting all the hurdles in the way of clearing the decks for better policy. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australia had a GST, it would cover all goods and services at a flat rate of perhaps between 12% and 15%, would do away with such inflationary charges as payroll tax . . . and would be rebated on business inputs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What does that mean? It means that the 250,000 Australian manufactured cars that go to the fleet market, half of the total manufacture of cars, would pay no government taxes at all because the GST applicable, to replace the sales tax and everything else, would be fully rebated to that business. They could buy  and turn their cars over quicker. They would go as good quality vehicles on to the second-
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5119">hand market and&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;we might just get rid of those environmentally polluting bombs. And what would we do in the process? We would double, treble, possibly quadruple the number of cars consumed in Australia. The more cars you make, the more jobs you get. It is simple commonsense. But not from  that side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the problems? Tax reform, labour market reform and tariff reform&mdash;and they are against all three. You chuck in as well native title reform and a sensible environmental policy, and they just want to put the shutters up on that as well. You sure believe in miracles, but you had a simple solution. You just borrowed money to pay the unemployment relief for those who could not get a job due to your policies. It is all in here. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Aged Care Bill has a number of significant clauses in it which would give the minister power to transfer responsibility for all of aged care to the states. The minister needs to be aware&mdash;this is important for the House to consider in looking at this amendment&mdash;that everybody is opposed to the transfer of aged care to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last time responsibility for aged care was with the states we had the most appalling level of care in this country. That led to a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> major review by a Senate select committee on private hospitals and nursing homes headed by then Senator Giles. I want to quote a couple of fairly horrific examples of things that went on in nursing homes when the states were in control. The idea that this government would even consider putting in this bill the power for the minister, without any reference to the parliament, to transfer responsibility for aged care to the states or to any one state reflects very badly on this minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Major complaints were made to this review that Senator Giles headed about the poor quality of food, about the poor staff-patient ratios, about the way in which patients were left. There are horrific examples in this report about the quality of care, considered to be inadequate or poor, to quote this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were some of the things that were mentioned: patients being showered at 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. to reduce the strain on daytime staff; patients left shivering naked outside showers waiting for nursing staff to return with towels; patients who did not have full use of arms and hands not adequately assisted in the cutting up or feeding of food; patients left for long periods of time in wet or soiled bed linen; patients not frequently turned or repositioned in their beds to avoid the development of bed sores; nursing staff quickly lost patience with patients who did not readily comply with their routine demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what Labor had to confront when it came into government in 1983. This was the state of nursing homes in this country. The idea that this minister might even consider transferring responsibility for aged care back to the states, back to these horrific situations, is nothing short of reprehensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to ask the minister what has been the response of the states and where any discussions that she might be having are up to so that we can reassure the community that the minister has no intention of proceeding down this path. I also foreshadow that we will be opposing the sections in this bill that give her that power.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words on the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill. This bill provides a smooth transition and considers the transitional issues that need to be considered. We have adopted an approach that provides security and minimum intrusion into the lives of those persons already receiving aged care. The approach minimises the disruption also to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5125"> service providers and allows a smooth transition period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One mechanism to ensure this smooth transition is the provision of a number of grandparenting arrangements. An example of those grandparenting arrangements include the formal agreements between hostel providers and the residents concerning entry contributions and fees. They will be maintained as resident agreements under the Aged Care Bill. This will protect these residents from having to pay any more in entry contributions than they have already paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Variable fees which have already been agreed between a hostel provider and a resident will also be allowed to continue. This will ensure hostel providers maintain an income stream that they have relied on as they make the adjustment to the new arrangements. Agreements between nursing home proprietors and residents will be maintained as resident agreements under the Aged Care Bill. Residents currently receiving exempt status services will continue to receive these services and will pay the same exempt fee and will not be income tested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill specifically allows all existing approved operators who are not incorporated at the time of transfer to choose not to incorporate. This decision will not penalise these service providers under the system or impose any additional financial burdens. The bill also amends relevant legislation of the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As I said earlier today, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has been working with us on the reform of aged care. The Commonwealth departments will take account of the new aged care provisions and again ensure the smooth transition of these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some additional matters. The Aged Care (Compensation Amendments) Bill is required to amend the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995 to take account of the new aged care provisions. This act currently refers to nursing home benefits and this will be amended to refer to the residential care subsidy. The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act operates in tandem with the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995. They allow the Health Insurance Commission to collect on behalf of the Commonwealth, amongst other things, money paid for the provision of nursing home care that is included in a compensation settlement. The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act is necessary, as the recovery of money originally paid as a benefit to a resident is regarded as imposing a tax on the resident. Therefore it is also necessary to have a separate bill where amendments to this act are sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor have talked a lot about process during the passage of this bill, but they really have no right to talk about process. When they were in government, they did not have any process in relation to managing the crisis in nursing homes and legislation that they took through at that time. But they also talked a lot about substance. What did the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), and her colleagues have to say on the substance of the bill? It seemed to me that they had very little to say of any relevance about our reforms. Their main message seemed to be, `Look at Labor's record of achievement in aged care.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, they are very confused about what their role was. We have heard the shadow minister say that she was a consultant to Brian Howe on the national health strategy&mdash;`Nothing to do with aged care'&mdash;yet we have heard her time after time in this House try to convince everyone that we cannot extend the successful arrangements that have applied to hostels for 10 years to nursing homes because they are part of the health system. She cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, we saw the opposition, when they were in government, go to extraordinary lengths to put into place a monitoring system, which was one of the positive things they did, but they put in place a monitoring system that was ensuring that nursing homes were not hospitals, that they produced a home&hyphen;like environment. So again there seems to be considerable confusion about what they want.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5126">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga pointed to a number of changes that Labor introduced&mdash;some improvements, as I said, in funding arrangements, outcome standards and a few other changes. They were improvements; I have never hesitated to acknowledge that. They responded to the issues of the day, or at least to some of them. Those reforms, though, were started over 10 years ago and things have changed. As I said before, things have changed quite considerably. We have a new set of problems&mdash;problems which were more visible even back then but which are far more urgent today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a growing ageing population and we have had a very major change to the social organisations of our community. Many women who had formerly been the major carers of our old and frail citizens are now in the work force and unable to take on that role in many cases. So we see considerable pressures on the sector, on the government, on the communities and on families in providing adequate care for the frail aged. So the world has clearly moved on, but Labor clearly have not. They are stuck in the mid-1980s in terms of their policy. They could not get back into gear and get it going again. So we have new Labor with old Labor views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a crisis when Labor left office. They had nothing to offer in relation to finding a solution to that crisis. They had all the reports. We saw the Gregory report and other reports. We saw those reports consigned to the bookshelves gathering dust. We never saw them act on those reports or do anything about them. What did they tell older people in the aged care industry? What did they offer them? They said, `Forget about today. Don't worry about tomorrow. But look at what we did yesterday.' It is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We inherited this problem and we are going to do something about solving the problem and providing the older, more frail citizens of this nation with the comfort, the dignity, the security and safety that they deserve. We are responding to today's problems in a positive way. We are creating a system to ensure quality of care for older Australians, not only today but to meet the increasing and growing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demands of our future generation of older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the accusation thrown at us today that we have not consulted. There has been more consultation over the last 12 months than there ever was under Labor. We had five working groups working through the implementation issues with us. These people will tell you that they felt they were actually being listened to by us and that they were actually contributing and that they were partners in the process. They certainly never got that under Labor. Even Dennis Jones from the Australian Nursing Federation said on radio yesterday that, as a minister, I had consulted with them and I had been listening to what they were saying. So we have gone through a very vigorous consulting process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our aged care reforms will get rid of the tiers that Labor keeps talking about&mdash;the two&hyphen;tiered system. This is a system that will go a long way towards fixing the two&hyphen;tiered system which existed under Labor. If you went into a hostel, you paid an accommodation bond, you got decent accommodation&mdash;safe, secure, private accommodation&mdash;but if you were assessed by the Aged Care Assessment Team as needing to go into a nursing home the chances were that you went into a facility where there were four or more people sharing a ward, sometimes up to eight, with row after row of beds. There was no dignity, no comfort and certainly no privacy and no place to put personal belongings. That was the two&hyphen;tiered system. The two-tiered system also meant that, if you went into an aged care nursing home under Labor, you went into a system where we know that 11 per cent of the facilities did not meet the basic fire safety  requirements and 15 per cent of the facilities did not meet health and safety requirements. That was the two-tiered system under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly people live in different kinds of accommodation. We all do out there in the community. I live in a three&hyphen;bedroom, one&hyphen;bathroom house whereas my next door neighbours have a two&hyphen;storey, four&hyphen;bedroom, two&hyphen;bathroom house. So we do live in different kinds of accommodation, but the fact is that we believe that all frail older Australians have the right to live in basic, decent accommoda
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5127"> tion that meets proper fire safety regulations, proper health and safety regulations and that provides them with some dignity and the safety and security that they deserve. They deserve our respect. They deserve better than we have had in this country over the last 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We inherited this problem. We take the responsibility to fix it, and we will. We will put into place the important and necessary safety nets that will protect those in the community who cannot look after themselves.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKLIN" NAMEID="PG6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister talks about the $5, or the five bucks, as she calls it. It is more than they ever had under Labor. Our aged care reforms will get rid of Labor's two&hyphen;tiered system. Our reforms will deliver quality accommodation, quality care and choice and flexibility. They will put in place the very important protections for those in the community who are vulnerable. They will ensure access based on the clinical needs of residents, not on their means. They will deliver funding according to the care that is needed and they will also provide appropriate support for dementia, which is a growing area of concern in our community. Many more people that have severe dementia are entering facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's answer to the problem of dementia, according to the policy they took to the last election, was to provide an extra 18c. So that problem was never considered under Labor's plan. We saw dementia residents not being properly cared for and we saw dementia homes and dementia wings in nursing homes having to close down for lack of appropriate recurrent subsidies. That is a great tragedy, and what we have done will address this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will actually spend more on residential aged care than Labor did when they were in office. How we will make the savings in aged care is not by taking away any services at all from the aged but by asking those who have the capacity to pay to contribute a small amount to their care. It is very, very important that people understand that the measures we have taken produce savings not by dimin
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ishing services to the frail aged in our community but indeed by asking those who can pay to make a small contribution towards their care. We have put into place a sustainable system that will serve not only today's frail aged but also those in our community who may become frail and vulnerable in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aged Care (Compensation Payments) Bill highlights the difference between us and those opposite. Labor sees care for aged people as being the government's responsibility because old age is not a permanent state. People are not born old and frail and in need of nursing home care. Old people have made a lifetime's contribution to the development of our society and our economy, and they deserve our respect. They have paid a lifetime of taxes. But how does this government reward this service? By allowing nursing home owners to strip their assets, including the family home. This bill is short sighted and mean spirited. It is motivated by the government's desire to abdicate its responsibility for care for the aged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996&hyphen;97 budget slashed funding for aged care by over half a billion dollars, with a $244 million reduction on outlays on capital commitments, a $253 million reduction to subsidies paid to nursing homes for care and $72 million saved by introducing a system of user pays for home and community care programs. The 1997&hyphen;98 budget has allocated some funds to aged care but after the devastation of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget it is a bit like robbing someone of all their possessions one day and the next day returning the toaster and saying, `You should be grateful for this.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997&hyphen;98 budget has allocated $10.2 million over four years for dementia support. But this is very poor compared to Labor's $31 million over five years as part of our national action plan for dementia from 1992. Furthermore, a one&hyphen;off grant of $600,000 for dementia facilities is simply for show. During the 1996 election campaign the Liberals promised to introduce grant funding for specialist facilities commencing on 1 January 1997.  This simply has not happened. The paltry $600,000 offered is not enough to build even one dementia specific centre. In last year's budget we learnt all about core and non&hyphen;core promises. Obviously we need subgroups within the core promises: substantive and non&hyphen;substantive funding perhaps.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5129">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is not interested in the welfare of aged people. It is only interested in reducing the size of government services in the naive belief that market forces&mdash;those caring, benevolent market forces that the minister's mates in the real estate industry support&mdash;exist only in the minds of the coalition and will have the interests of all Australians at heart. This is really fairyland stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Grayndler, which I represent, is fairly typical of many inner metropolitan electorates. Most of the older residents in my electorate have lived their whole lives in the area. In the main they are not wealthy. They do not have big savings. In June 1995 there were 12,500 aged pensioners living in Grayndler, which comprised about nine per cent of the total population.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKLIN" NAMEID="PG6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms Macklin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Have they got $88,000?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="R36">Mr ALBANESE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They certainly do not have the $88,000 which they would need if they wanted to get into a nursing home. For most of those people, the most valuable and indeed only asset that they have is their home. After 1 October 1997, most people requiring nursing home care who own their own home will be forced to sell it. The people in Grayndler are no exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are around 2,000 nursing home beds in Grayndler, which works out to be 180.2 beds per thousand head of population over 70 years. The Australian average is 59 beds per thousand over 70 years. So the people in my electorate have a vested interest in the future of nursing home care in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tabled a petition in the parliament which contains the signatures of almost 1,000 residents in Grayndler who are genuinely afraid of how this legislation will affect their access to quality and affordable nursing home care. I feel it is my duty, on behalf of the older people I represent, to speak out against this proposed legislation which will result in an unfair two&hyphen;tier system of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who argue that this is in the interests of elderly Australians are simply kidding themselves. If you adopt the market model then you must accept that profit rather than
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accessibility and affordability becomes the goal. That is the primary problem with this bill. If the government is not prepared to put up the funding for capital works and upgrades then developers must take up the slack. You cannot argue that developers work on a charity model; developers work to make a profit and the bigger the profit the better. It is shown by the fact that friends of the government's legislation in this area are on the top 200 BRW rich list, as I pointed out earlier on today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Owners of nursing homes will not be obliged to use the interest earnings on patient care or on upgrades. They can take it as profit if they wish. There are no controls in this bill. The bill is designed for the owners of nursing homes, not for the residents. As I noted before, this legislation will result in a two&hyphen;tier system: one for the rich and one for the poor. There is no incentive in this legislation for homes to be built in poorer parts of the country, just as there is no incentive for homes to accept the less well off as residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that nursing home owners will be compensated if they take residents with little or no savings, but it has already set the subsidy for concessional residents at a paltry $5 a day. This is a pathetic response and is an insult to all those who have a genuine care for elderly Australians. It is absurdly low and it provides no incentive at all. It has had a negative reaction from private and not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit nursing home providers alike. These providers consider the absolute minimum satisfactory amount to be $12 a day. Five dollars a day is just a joke. What will happen to people who have no assets? They will be shunted into substandard institutions, possibly a long distance from their family and support networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is fundamentally flawed because it is designed as a cost saving measure by this uncaring government. The government should take responsibility for aged care  services and should ensure equal access and high quality care for all Australians. The government has a responsibility to care for elderly Australians, not simply to represent the interests of its mates such as the Moran Health Care Group. The Moran Health Care

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) joined in today in defending the Moran Health Care Group shows that she is keeping her options open in case, after the next election, she needs to get a job with the Moran Health Care Group as well. The fact that that particular group is taking responsibility for drafting the government's legislation&mdash;taking credit for this bill before the House today&mdash;says a lot about who will stand to benefit from this disgraceful bill which represents an abrogation of the government's responsibility for aged care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to entering parliament, I was fortunate enough to work for the Australian trade union movement for 20 years. As part of that service, I had extensive experience in the Northern Territory as a result of an amalgamation between my old union, the Miscellaneous Workers Union, and the North Australian Workers Union. That union had widespread coverage and developed a very close working relationship with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory. I also had the opportunity of working with them to represent them in both the public and the private sector. That included responsibility, for example, to represent stockmen in the cattle industry; to negotiate the first Central Australian Aboriginal Congress Award; and also to try to do what we could in our own small way to assist in the improvement of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opportunity for education and health services for those people in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It therefore came as a surprise to me&mdash;and I think to most members of this House&mdash;to read the report on the indigenous stolen children entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>. I specifically refer to the start of that report which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report is a tribute to the strength and struggles of many thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people affected by forcible removal. We acknowledge the hardships they endured and the sacrifices they made. We remember and lament all the children who will never come home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That takes me to the Northern Territory and I specifically refer to Wave Hill. Wave Hill is important in the overall struggle for land rights, but Wave Hill also features in this report. I refer to page 131 and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of the children from Wave Hill by MacRobertson Miller aircraft was accompanied by distressing scenes the like of which I wish to never experience again. The engines of the `plane are not stopped at Wave Hill and the noise combined with the strangeness of an aircraft only accentuated the grief and fear of the children, resulting in near&hyphen;hysteria in two of them. I am quite convinced that news of my action at Wave Hill preceded me to other stations, resulting in the children being taken away prior to my arrival.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I turn to page 140 of this report. I suppose it reminds me of my work representing cattle industry workers in the Northern Territory. Page 140 relates how some of these children were treated. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know many stockbreeders who would not dream of crowding their stock in the way that these half&hyphen;caste children are huddled . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a quote from a submission by the Labor Party with respect to this report. At page 145 there is a reference to Croker Island, which is also known to me. I suppose it goes to responsibility, admission of guilt and the question of an apology. This is what it says at page 145:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was an active program of fostering children in which the government elicited the support of the churches . . . The churches would provide the Northern Territory Welfare Department with lists of names of people willing to be foster parents. Children from the age of four upwards would then be placed in a foster placement here in South Australia . . . It was a direct arrangement between the church and the Welfare Department in the Northern Territory.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5131">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So much for an admission of responsibility. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my experience, nearly every foster arrangement resulted in those children going back to search for their roots&mdash;nearly everyone tried to find out . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What was the end result of this arrangement? I quote from confidential evidence on page 150 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I started looking at my hands and wondered, why am I the colour that I am? Why are you white?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 152, a young woman is quoted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of us girls were thinking white in the head but were feeling black inside. We weren't black or white. We were a very lonely, lost and sad displaced group of people. We were taught to think and act like a white person, but we didn't know how to think and act like an Aboriginal. We didn't know anything about our culture.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is a question of accepting responsibility and facing up to our obligation to give the indigenous people a full apology. It is not an admission of guilt that we ought to be ashamed of; it is a statement that we wronged those people and a clear public statement that we are going to do something to fix our wrongs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on a matter which has caused a great deal of concern for many of my constituents. There has been a lot of debate recently&mdash;as well there should be&mdash;about chapter 5 of the discussion paper of the Model Criminal Code Officers' Committee, which relates to sexual offences against the person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand there has also been a great deal of misunderstanding about both the content of the paper and the federal government's position. Firstly, I would like to state categorically that the concept of lowering the age of consent to 10 years is as abhorrent to me as it is to all parents. I cannot conceive that anyone could make such a suggestion. I understand that the chairman of the Criminal Code Officer's Committee, Judge Rod Howe QC, has stated that it is not the intention or suggestion of the discussion paper. I am sure that will be a relief to many people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is clear that this discussion paper does suggest a liberalisation&mdash;if I can use the word&mdash;of laws relating to consent, incest and sexual activity between children. As a mother of eight, I strongly share community concern at the prospect of providing a greater scope for criminals who perpetrate sexual offences. This cannot and will not be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly believe that our children need increased protection and that our justice system needs to be tougher on those people who do the wrong thing and are a great threat to the vulnerable in our community, particularly our children. That is the bottom line. I know it is a sentiment shared by all members of the government, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to assure my constituents that the content of the discussion paper does not in any way reflect the views of this government. The fact is that back in 1990 the previous federal government, with the support of all state governments, established a committee to develop a model criminal code. This was established under the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, which is not a federal government body but a committee made up of all state and territory Attorneys-General as well as the federal Attorney-General. The federal government's ongoing interest in this is only to encourage and develop a national criminal code, which I believe is a good idea, as long as it reflects very clearly the growing community feeling that we need a justice system that considers the views and feelings of the victims of crime rather than placing the emphasis on the rights of the criminals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A tough national criminal code would provide certainty and uniformity, which I think would greatly benefit the community. However, the views expressed in chapter 5 of  the discussion paper clearly do not reflect those of the community, which is why I am very pleased to note this is only a discussion paper for community input. I want to stress that this is not proposed legislation and it is not a binding document. Thankfully, it is only a paper for community discussion. In that sense, it may prove useful in that the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5132"> community's reaction has clearly shown that parents are concerned about this issue and that we want greater protection for our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the committee takes into account the community's submissions to the paper, it will write a report. Even then the document will be available for public input and debate before it finally goes to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Even then it will be up to each individual Attorney-General and state government as to whether they adopt any recommendations for the criminal code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to stress that the federal government has no power to implement laws in relation to the criminal code. That is entirely under the jurisdiction of the state governments. I am pleased to note that the Queensland Attorney-General has ruled out Queensland adopting this aspect of the criminal code. The Queensland government is taking a tougher approach to law and order. I support them in this. Queenslanders support them in this also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to assure the local residents of Forde that the federal government in no way endorses the views of the Model Criminal Code Officers' Committee. As a federal member, I will fight tooth and nail any suggestion that criminals be given a greater scope, particularly when it comes to criminal offences against children. I know that my federal government colleagues would join me in opposing any such suggestion. In fact, I am pleased to say that this paper is not a federal government document. It does not reflect our views, just as it does not reflect the views of my constituents.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5132"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that balance, getting the pendulum to swing back, is what we are looking for. The novelist Anatole France once wrote of `the majestic impartiality of the law which forbids rich and poor alike from stealing bread and sleeping under the bridges of Paris'. I quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>, the Wilson report, the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, chaired by Sir Ronald Wilson, the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I begin on page 152:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were completely brainwashed to think only like a white person. When they went to mix in white society, they found they were not accepted [because] they were Aboriginal. When they went and mixed with Aborigines, some found they couldn't identify with them either, because they had too much white ways in them. So that they were neither black nor white. They were simply a lost generation of children. I know. I was one of them.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was from a New South Wales woman removed at eight years with her three sisters in the 1940s and placed in the Cootamundra Girls' Home. Another extract reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a big poster at the end of the dining room and it used to be pointed out to us all the time when religious instruction was going on in the afternoon. They had these Aborigine people sitting at the end of this big wide road and they were playing cards, gambling and drinking. And it had this slogan which they used to read to us and point to us while they're saving us from ourselves and giving our souls to the Lord. It had, `Wide is the road that leads us into destruction', which lead up into hell. The other side they had these white people, all nicely dressed, leading on this narrow road, and, `Narrow is the road that leads us into the kingdom of life or the Kingdom of God'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I was 14 years old and going to these foster people, I remember the welfare officer sitting down and they were having a cup of tea and talking about how they was hoping our race would die out. And that I was fair enough, I was a half&hyphen;caste and I would automatically live with a white person and  get married. Because the system would make sure that no-one would marry an Aborigine person anyhow. And then my children would automatically be fairer, quarter&hyphen;caste, and then the next generation would be white and we would be bred out. I remember when she was discussing this with my foster people, I remember thinking&mdash;because I had no concept of what it all meant&mdash;I remember thinking, `That's a good idea, because all the Aborigines are poor'.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Another one from a confidential submission in New South Wales states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I led a very lost, confused, sad, empty childhood, as my foster father molested me. He would masturbate in front of me, touch my private parts, and get me to touch his.

I was scared to go to the outside toilet as he would often stop me on the way back from the toilet. So I would often wet the bed `cause I didn't want to get out of bed. I was scared to tell anyone `cause I once attempted to tell the local Priest at the Catholic church and he told me to say ten Hail Mary's for telling lies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my electorate of Gilmore, over 65 per cent of residents are on social welfare benefits and 60 per cent are on an income of less than $30,000. That is why the provision of quality aged care in our area presents us with an even greater challenge. The beautiful coast of southern New South Wales, the proximity of the region to Sydney, the relatively low cost of living and the wonderful community that exists are all things that make Gilmore an ideal place in which to retire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we have always made recent arrivals to our area feel as much a part of our community as those who have lived there for generations, the strain on the aged care system has been all too apparent. My work as the local federal member has seen me come into contact with the very human face of aged care, people who would probably resent being referred to as simply part of the statistics that I have just mentioned, for they are all elderly Australians who have worked hard all their lives making important contributions to the stability, security and prosperity of this country and now require government and community support in the last days of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these citizens have very real stories to tell, stories which all too often describe inadequate facilities and the type of neglect that no citizen of a modern society should ever have to experience. I have also personally been touched by the plight of the aged, having a mother who requires a high level of care and who is constantly afraid of losing her dignity in the eyes of those who love her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australians, there is no better way to express the respect we have for our elderly than to afford them the opportunity to spend their final years in the comfort of well&hyphen;run, quality care and quality nursing homes. Unfortunately, this is not always the case in many parts of Australia. For this reason, I fully support the reforms announced by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) in the area of aged care, and I have done my utmost to keep my electorate informed of any changes. I have also made a point of discuss ing the issue with those who are best qualified to understand the issue&mdash;that is, the care providers themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I comment on how fortunate we are in Gilmore with the staff of 10 aged care providers working selflessly around the clock to provide and create a happy and healthy environment for those residents of our nursing homes and hostels. It would also be fair to point out how desperately short of nursing homes we remain in Gilmore, with waiting lists for areas such as St Georges Basin, Kiama and Berry. Therefore, the reforms of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5134"> this government will allow capital expenditure to be directed at those areas in need. Just today, we have had allocated $100,000 for the place I just mentioned in Berry, the masonic village.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am the first to admit that the proposed changes have caused some concern to the people in Gilmore and this is partly due to deliberate political misinformation, something which I see as unforgivable in such circumstances when political point scoring has the effect of causing anxiety and fear among the most vulnerable members of our society&mdash;namely, the elderly. There is something terribly wrong with the way we conduct debate in this country, for it is our elderly who are least able to defend themselves. I am deeply ashamed of the tactics being used by the opposition, in particular by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, some concern in my electorate is also due to honest misunderstandings. While I have been responding to these concerns, I have noticed that in many cases it is not those who are entering the nursing homes who do not understand the changes but often family members, relatives and friends of those entering the homes who are fearful of extra costs that may be incurred. Fortunately, in 99 per cent of cases, the fears of both the elderly and their families have been misplaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has had the guts to do what the previous government did not. The minister's aged care policy is reasonable and fair. Many of the people in my electorate have come to recognise and understand the changes, and the overall response has been very positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday I invited the Department of Family Services' Jane Holten to meet with constituents of mine interested in a better understanding of the recent changes. It was a well&hyphen;attended meeting and I am glad to say that we were able to reassure those who initially had feared the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is surprising the extent to which people in the industry actually recognise the need for reform. This belief that the government can do better has made service providers far more receptive to the changes than I had previously
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thought possible. They are the people who know only too well that between 10 and 50 per cent of nursing homes have significant problems with regard to fire and health hazards. Indeed, some of them may have had to work in environments which were far less than satisfactory and therefore are eager to support a way out of the rut that the previous government's lack of initiative has placed us in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also gained an assurance that concessional placements will be made on a needs basis. For example, the need for concessional placements in, say, Sydney may not be as great as in my electorate of Gilmore; therefore, adjustments addressing the situation can and will be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must also stop the practice of families being separated. It is intolerable for a person to be in a nursing home literally hours away from his or her partner or to have your loved one in another town with no public transport to enable regular visits. This happens today in Gilmore, and the minister's aged care package will introduce now a single classification which, in my electorate, is wonderful news for our dementia sufferers and their families.

It leaves an indelible impression on any person who has a semblance of compassion for their fellow Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a part of a government that strongly endorses the loving and caring environment of the family. Even if children are born into an environment of poverty, hardship or disadvantage, there can be no substitute for  real parental love for a child. Unfortunately, this has not always been accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the report so graphically illustrates, previous federal and state governments, churches and the police forces in particular believed that the best way to provide an Aboriginal child with a future was to remove them from their environment of abject poverty and disadvantage and place them in a white man's refuge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My deep and emotional revulsion at this concept is palpable. I abhor institutions that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5136"> seek to play God with human relationships. It is the most heinous form of social engineering and it defies the most basic laws of nature. My reaction is, however, tempered by the acceptance that I may unwittingly be responsible now for an act of the state for which my children might judge me harshly in the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accounts in this report are terrifyingly haunting. The voices and tears of these children reach out to, and cannot fail to affect, the hearts and minds of my generation. Just as moving are the statistics outlined in the report. Nationally, it is estimated that between one in three and one in 10 indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families between 1910 and 1970.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children were sometimes ripped from their mother's arms by the authorities. Over and over in this report I was struck by one line: `I never saw my mother again.' For both children and mothers, this separation and the abyss that it created in their lives forever is difficult for many to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Insidiously, attempts were made by authorities to deny the children their heritage. Often they were given new names and identities, and care was taken to ensure that the children never saw their families again. Children were discouraged, often by physical means, from speaking in their native tongues, thus effectively destroying any hope of communication between family members for those fortunate enough to find their relatives in later years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, at the same time that indigenous children were being removed in the 1950s and 1960s, child welfare procedures in relation to non-indigenous children were being influenced by a UN report which stressed that child welfare services should aim to assist families to keep their children with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are accounts which acknowledge the loving environment provided by foster families as well as gratitude for a sound education, but many conclude that they still lost their sense of belonging, their history. As one of the children said, `In terms of having a direction in life, how do you know where you're going if you don't know where you've come from?' I found the words of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Greg, returning to Cape Barren Island, where he was born, to be particularly moving. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just looked back to where we used to live as kids. My whole life flashed before me and I just collapsed in the sand and started crying . . . And when I composed myself . . . I just sort of reflected on things and . . . I guess I just wanted to be part of a family that I never had. I just wanted to be with my mum and my grandmother and my brothers and sisters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I tried to imagine what it would be like to be removed from all that was familiar to me as a child&mdash;my parents, my siblings, my family home&mdash;to be removed from a loving environment and placed in a sterile institution and told that my birthright no longer existed. No matter how graphic the evidence may be, my generation can never understand the real effects of the separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not buy into the meaningless, base politics of a national apology on this matter. I can only speak for myself. The capacity to feel immense pride in the achievements of one's nation must be balanced with a capacity to feel shame for its wrongdoings. So we as a community and as individuals should recognise the wrongdoings of the past. We should try to help to heal the pain and we should ensure that our nation never forgets and never repeats.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5136"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>  and the issue of the treatment of Aboriginal young people and their removal from their families in years gone by. As has been said by other speakers, this is a particularly difficult part of the history of this nation,  something about which I think many of us are filled with great shame&mdash;I will speak on this on another occasion&mdash;that this actually could occur in this society, in this country that I am so proud to be a representative of in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As others have done, I will read into the record a number of cases set out in the report which I think highlight some of the appalling things that occurred to a number of people under this policy. I think all in this chamber would recognise education as a key issue.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5137"> Education is something which was in many ways systematically denied these young people. The first case:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wanted to be a nurse, only to be told that I was nothing but an immoral black lubra, and I was only fit to work on cattle and sheep properties . . . I strived every year from grade 5 up until grade 8 to get that perfect 100% mark in my exams at the end of each year, which I did succeed in, only to be knocked back by saying that I wasn't fit to do these things . . . Our education was really to train us to be domestics and to take orders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was the best in the class, I came first in all the subjects. I was 15 when I got into 2nd year and I wanted to . . . continue in school, but I wasn't allowed to, because they didn't think I had the brains, so I was taken out of school and that's when I was sent out to farms just to do housework.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as I stood with my father beside by grade 8 teacher, he told her of my ambitions to study medicine, and she responded that I didn't have the brains to go on to high school . . . notwithstanding that I had always had an above average academic record through school.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That last case was in fact from New South Wales Aboriginal magistrate Pat O'Shane. In addition, employment and wages and conditions, an issue that often comes before this parliament, was an area of discrimination:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They sent me when I was 16 from Parramatta Girls' Home out to M, a property 137 miles from Nyngan. We never had a holiday. We weren't allowed to go into town with them. If you did go in or go anywhere and you saw any Aboriginal people, you weren't allowed to speak to them. So you had to live that isolated life. We never, ever got our wages or anything like that. It was banked for us. And when we were 21 we were supposed to get this money, you see. We never got any of that money ever. And that's what I wonder: where could that money have went? Or why didn't we get it?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[Chief Protector] Neville got our money. We were working on a station. Some of them worked six or seven years. And the money come down here to that office here in Wellington St [Perth]. When I finished up, coming back from the Territory, I told who I was and I said, `There's money supposed to be here'. I got 30 shillings&mdash;one pound ten&mdash;a red, white and blue blanket, and a pass to the Settlement [Moore River]. I said, `Hey, I don't want your pass to the Settlement. I can go to the Settlement. That's my home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was sent out when I was eleven years old to [pastoral station]. I worked there for seven and a half years. Never
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> got paid anything all that time. [Even] Aboriginal people I was working with used to get 30 bob. Yet we didn't get nothing. I used to say, `Where's my money?' `Oh, they put it into the trust account.' So I worked there for them. Oh rough, hardly any food or anything, put out in remote area on me own, drawing water and that, looking after cattle . . . no holiday, no pay. I never received one pay that seven and a half years I was there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Reading this report, as many of us are doing, you find yourself going through your own personal journey of regret and shame. Certainly I believe an apology is warranted as one part of the necessary steps in order to try and address this historical wrong. I, on my own behalf and whoever I can speak  for, believe that an apology is necessary and certainly give it with a great deal of personal feeling. I certainly hope there will be opportunities to speak on this issue again, because this issue is not going to go away and it shouldn't go away&mdash;not until we have had a chance to address these issues. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5137"><TITLE>Keith Payne VC Park</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 May it was my privilege to be at the dedication of four plaques honouring the 1996 Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross. These plaques have been placed in the Keith Payne VC Park in the suburb of Stafford in my electorate of Lilley, the suburb where Keith Payne lived until he recently moved to Mackay. Keith Payne was one of four soldiers who was awarded the VC during the Vietnam War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dedication service was organised by Kedron Wavell RSL sub&hyphen;branch and Brisbane City Councillor Jim Wilding. For the president of the sub-branch, Mr Whalan, and Councillor Wilding it was the culmination of a project which had begun in 1995 as part of the Australia Remembers celebrations. The second stage of the dedication on that Sunday saw the unveiling of four plaques dedicated to the VC recipients from the Boer War, World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pupils from Stafford State Primary School and Stafford Heights State Primary School have planted trees in the park, one for each VC recipient, and have assumed the responsibility for the care and maintenance of the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each student spoke on an aspect of the Victoria Cross, its meaning, its history and the men who were awarded it. Katherine Nicholls from Stafford State Primary School expressed the feelings of everyone at the service when she said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Victoria Cross is a medal of plain bronze inscribed with the words `For valour'. The Victoria Cross is awarded without discrimination. It can be gained by officers or other ranks, generals or privates, but only for the highest act of valour and self&hyphen;sacrifice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clive Mitchell&hyphen;Taylor, the National President of the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia, was in Brisbane for their 18th national conference which was held on Bribie Island on Saturday. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) was the keynote speaker at that conference. Mr Mitchell&hyphen;Taylor read a message at the service from Keith Payne, who was in England having tea with the Queen Mother and joining other recipients of the Victoria Cross and the George Medal at a re&hyphen;dedication service and biannual conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Keith Payne said in his message that he hoped all who had been concerned with the concept of the park would feel proud of what they had achieved. Clive Mitchell&hyphen;Taylor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When talking about valour and self-sacrifice, we are not talking about the Knights of the Round Table, or Superman, or Batman, or the Green Lantern or the Phantom. We are talking about flesh and blood Australians who made a conscious decision to put their own lives at risk because there was a chance they could help someone else.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Victoria Cross winners are a magnificent example for our young people. It must be remembered that wars are not fought single-handedly and that there were thousands of

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote a Jewish prophet from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Old Testament</EMPHASIS>. More than 2,000 years ago he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And of others there is no memory&mdash;they have perished as though they had never existed, they have become as though they had never been born; they and their children after them.

Ongoing support for the work of the RSL and the veterans association in the work they are doing both spiritually and practically in the caring for the health and welfare of veterans is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was happy to hear that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs announced at the dedication service that his department had made available a grant of $10,000 for the work of the commemoration in the Keith Payne VC Park.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to closely associate myself with the comments that other ALP colleagues have made with regard to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>  report. I believe an understanding of the report is essential to the process of reconciliation in Australia. Indeed, it is essential for all Australians to understand the full history of this part of Australian heritage. It is not something that Australians of any generation can be proud of. It is not something the Australian Labor Party takes any political satisfaction in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to hear our leader, Mr Beazley, express an apology on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, particularly those Labor Party governments at state level that had been associated with these practices. It is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5139"> a moving set of reports and instances of the human side in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute on this occasion to Carol Kendall, who is a resident in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney. She has been exceptionally active not only in Aboriginal causes in our region but also in ensuring that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> report has been resourced and receives recognition around the country. She has dedicated a good part of her life out of her own personal circumstances to this process. I pay tribute to her efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note her own circumstances, which have received publicity. It is hard to imagine how, as Carol did, she could get to know her biological sister first as a friend and then, out of instinct, out of some association, talk about what they knew of each other's family history and then trace it back to the point where they could connect the family tree and recognise that they were much more than friends: they were sisters who did not know their proper relationship in a family sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sit down, as I did, and hear her story was certainly something that awakened my consciousness to the seriousness of this matter. No Australian with any decency in their heart could feel anything but great sorrow and look for a source of reconciliation, wanting to do good things out of this sad episode in the history of so many Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was rather disappointed that at the national reconciliation conference last Monday week the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did not develop or embellish the theme that has been central to his politics over 20 years&mdash;the centrality of the family in Australian society, whether those families are Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal. That really should have been the basis of his approach: a national unifying theme to say that these things, whether they happen in Aboriginal or any other Australian family, are unacceptable and that as a nation we owe some form of apology.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking yesterday on the 1997 Aged Care Bill, I said that the Howard coalition government was mad and bad and dangerous. I did so for what I think are quite good and pertinent reasons. I wish to speak today in this budget debate on aged care and the impact of the aged care changes in that bill. I also wish to speak on the changes in this budget on superannuation. In both of those areas, what is being proposed and what is being done is dangerous, firstly, to the health and care of our aged in terms of the aged services bill as an integral part of the government process, and, secondly, because what is being done with superannuation is dangerous in terms of the future of our national savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take up a point that I made yesterday and did not explore adequately. Today, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will be announcing a $13 million program, to run over three years, in relation to crime prevention and to lowering the level of violence within the community. I made the point that he is the George Bush of Australian politics, because what he is introducing now&mdash;and we saw it during the last election&mdash;is an American Republican mode of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5141"> electioneering. This program that he will be announcing today is touchy&hyphen;feely and emotive politics. This program is directed towards non&hyphen;Commonwealth government responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, when he announced in the House the day before yesterday that he would be undertaking this program, said, `Well, yes, it wasn't really a Commonwealth government responsibility.' Fighting crime, making sure the police forces work properly, undertaking  measures in relation to domestic violence, monitoring particular violence programs and so on, have always been, and are still, central state government responsibilities. Yet what the Prime Minister has indicated is that the Commonwealth government is willing to spend $13 million on a program that it has no responsibility for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will actually be done with that program? First, the core is that the Commonwealth government will not be taking on responsibility for crime fighting. It will be taking on a responsibility for monitoring what is done in state crime fighting programs, trying to work out a best practice model and examples, and working up that model on a pilot basis. We have seen in the 1996 budget and the 1997 budget lots of pilot programs. There is a pilot program for work for the dole&mdash;for 10,000 placements. We have seen the Green Corps, which is effectively a pilot program. Forty people are employed in Queensland under the Green Corps&mdash;and of those 40 people, 15 have previously been employed. They went out of paid employment to go to work on the Green Corps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a sloganeering, electioneering basis to a number of coalition government programs and to the way in which the Green Corps and work for the dole is pushed, with 10,000 people on pilot work for the dole programs, not the majority of people who are unemployed. And the Prime Minister indicates that he will actually take the jump and effectively go into electioneering mode on what is not Commonwealth responsibility. It is in an area where we know that people throughout Australia&mdash;whether they are the aged, the infirm, the disadvantaged, the poor, the rich&mdash;know and understand that there is violence in the community, there is crime in the community and there are burglaries in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people understand that they are state responsibilities. The American Republicans also have been extremely good at arguing on an emotive basis across a range of issues that are like fairy floss. George Bush was not campaigning on the hard&hyphen;core issues such as jobs, education and social security. The American Democrats said to George Bush, prior to him being thrown out of the presidency, that the core message that had to go to George Bush was, `It is the economy, stupid.' I think we could still say that to the current Prime Minister: the core problem here is the economy and jobs, but we could also say, looking at the 1996 and 1997 budgets, `It is also the society, stupid.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message here is, quite simply, that we not only live in an economy but we live in a society as well. Living in a society, looking at this year's budget and comparing it to last year's budget&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5142">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I restate that it is dangerous for this reason: I alluded yesterday to the Bankstown City Frail Aged Persons Homes Trust and a letter from the general manager of that trust, Mr Terry Madden. I quoted a fair amount of that letter and I will quote some more of it now because it bears on the core problem of this bill. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amalgamation of hostel places and nursing home places, as this bill proposes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the bill that has been guillotined through today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has an effect on the city of Bankstown in terms of our current provision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1985, with then coalition opposition support, the federal government put through a new way of looking at aged care services for the community. It was a tripartite manner of dealing with those problems. Instead of people who were at home with virtually no assistance being forced into decrepit nursing home conditions, as outlined in the Giles report of 1983, because they had no other recourse if they became unable to care for themselves, and if their relatives could not, we brought in a system where people could have a choice&mdash;individual choice and family choice&mdash;about how their relatives could be cared for and could care for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the new way of looking after people who are aged, there were three choices. Firstly, aged people could stay at home to be supported under the home and community care program. In that way nurses from the community could come in to assist people and help to bathe and wash them and do whatever had to be done in terms of looking after their personal care. Secondly, they could also get help from home care for mowing the lawns and dealing with the normal day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day problems that people who were slightly infirm or who had difficulties would need help with. Thirdly, they were also supported in terms of carers who chose to stay with those people if they needed more help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was in the national interest in terms of the government's budgetary position because the tripartite system of helping people to stay within their own homes, if they chose to do so, was better than building hostel places at 15 per cent a year, year on year real expenditure, and creating a massive expansion of hostel places. Then there was the renovation on a progressive basis of nursing home places, essentially through capital funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those three elements over a 10-year period built a strong, balanced, open, sensible, aged care system. However, what this bill does is collapse the hostel program into the nursing homes program. Over the past decade or more, societies such as the Frail Aged Trust, a not-for-profit group, have built hostel places in Bankstown. They have allowed people entry into those at no cost because 60 per cent of the hostel places in Bankstown are concessional. They are for people who are relatively disadvantaged. They are for people who are already on pensions, who do not have large disposable incomes and who are not asset rich. They are for people who did not have their own homes, who were in rented accommodation. There are also people who did have their own homes, did pay their way into the hostel program if they got a hostel place in another place, but in terms of the Frail Aged Group there has been no entry fee whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been four hostel groupings in the Bankstown Frail Aged Trust. They are spread throughout the city of Bankstown. They have been very successful because they have been for people who chose not to stay at home or who could no longer be looked after as well as they might be at home. They could go into a hostel and be relieved of the burden of the 300-foot backyard and all of the associated maintenance problems of the homes that they had grown up in and where they had brought their children up.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5143">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people could go into a hostel situation where there was a central meal facility, where there was central nursing help, and where they had the companionship of all of those other people living with them in the hostel. These were people who, prior to 1983, would have been forced to go into a nursing home entirely inappropriately. Those hostel places that were built in Bankstown during the period of the Labor government have delivered services to the aged  people of Bankstown. But this bill coalesces two standards, the nursing home standard and the hostel standard. We are back to Fraser government days; we are back to one possibility, one standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may think that is just a rhetorical point, but there is a core problem here in terms of what we do with infrastructure for the aged community in my electorate of Blaxland, in the city of Bankstown. The core problem is that with a relatively modern housing stock for hostel groups, they are built to level 3 standard. They are not built to nursing home standard, which is level 9. The not-for-profit trust has never had to go to a mortgage originator, or to a bank, because it has been supported by the people of Bankstown, by the registered clubs, by other charitable groups, and by the Bankstown Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the trusts are now faced with the situation that they will have to abandon the hostel stock that they have. It is absolutely perfectly utilisable, as it has been for the past decade, but they will have to abandon that stock. That has come about because what is implied in this bill is that it has to be of nursing home standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If they choose to upgrade all of that infrastructure from level 3 to level 9, they will need about $5 million to do it. They will have to go out and borrow it, because they did not charge any entry prices for those concessional hostel entrants. They will not be able to recover the cost of that, except over at least a five&hyphen;year period, if not a 10&hyphen;year period, to get back to square one. They can spend a lot of money on upgrading to level 9.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will then be faced with the problem that those hostel places are dispersed around the city of Bankstown. They are not on the same property as the nursing home that they have built. The bill impresses people into consolidating on one site. It is fine for the three major for profit providers&mdash;the Moran group and others who already have that model&mdash;it is perfectly fine for them. It is also entirely understandable that that is reflected in the bill because, of those who gave advice directly to the minister, by and large the advice that was accepted came from the for profit sector. So the model that is being imposed is what is already there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But the bill does not impose upon those for profit providers that they should actually spend the extra amount of money that they will get from the Commonwealth or the extra amounts that they will get in terms of the interest on the accommodation bonds, on building new capital stock in the nursing homes. It is very vaguely worded. They can in fact pocket it, as used to happen prior to 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who are against this particular aged care bill and the philosophy that runs throughout the last two budgets are the major charitable associations within Australia. Those who have brought these proposals into question are the Alzheimer's Association of Australia, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, ACOSS, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, Baptist Care Australia, the Churches of Christ Network of Aged Care Services, Community Services, Australian Uniting Church and Salvation Army. They are some of the most prominent social welfare organisations in the country and they have all jointly expressed their concern to the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5144">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact is very real. When the bill first saw the light of day and was suggested, the price of an entry fee was suggested to be about $26,000. In fact, the figuring was entirely wrong because what the government and the opposition and the community at large were using as a basis for figuring did not take into account a lot of the rebuilding costs. In the aged care community at large, it is now recognised that the probable average cost will be $88,000. That $88,000 is there because, over a 20&hyphen;year period, you need in fact to rebuild a nursing home.  For the Bankstown City Frail Aged Persons Homes Trust, they have this to say in relation to the problems they face:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All nursing homes are built with a 20&hyphen;year life cycle. After 20 years, technology, the frailty of the residents, changes in diagnosis and illness of residents, and fire safety requirements are such that what was built 20 years ago needs to be modernised or rebuilt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this means is that, when a charity builds a nursing home, it needs to budget for between $250,000 and $300,000 per year to rebuild the facility or modernise it after 20 years life. In the past, the Commonwealth government has provided a large share of those funds by way of its capital grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government now expects that money to come from residents paying accommodation bonds, and the charities will invest those bonds, putting the interest into a capital works account, putting the $2,600 per annum drawing down allowance from the bond into the same account, and also putting into that account whatever government subsidy is given to compensate the charity for taking any resident who cannot afford to pay a bond. These three ingredients added together have to equal between $250,000 and $300,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Madden goes on to point out that there will be a dramatic shortfall for not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit groups such as the frail aged trust&mdash;a shortfall of something in the order of $77,000 a year&mdash;and that over a 20&hyphen;year period of time $1.5 million would be ripped away from this charitable institution and they will not be capable of rebuilding their capital stock. This bill will force them to rebuild their hostel stock which is not in need of rebuilding at the previous hostel standard of level 3. They will be forced to move up to the nursing home standard of level 9. So that previous capital infrastructure spending will effectively go to waste because it will have to be done again&mdash;there will be a duplication of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this critical area, in terms of the Commonwealth actually being in place and doing something that the Commonwealth government has absolutely total, complete and utter responsibility for, this coalition government under Prime Minister Howard is effectively walking away from its responsibilities. And where is the justification for that? It is in the National Commission of Audit report. This yellow tome is effectively the heartbeat of this coalition government because in last year's budget and in this year's budget, line for line and word for word, the National Commission of Audit's philosophy informs these budget papers and the legislation that has come through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit had this to say about aged care. These were the crises underlining the changes this stupid bill has put into place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government should urgently implement measures to reduce the potential for longer term aged related funding increases . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government should take action now to change expectations of reliance on government assistance, by reducing aged and health related outlays.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just as Airservices Australia has changed the flying patterns over the Sydney basin and we have got an impact in terms of preparing people for a second airport, so this government, with the backing of the National Commission of Audit&mdash;which they brought into being&mdash;have suggested preparing the aged in the community. Start to take away resources. Start to take away government assistance. Charge them more for the home and community care assistance
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5145"> they have got. Charge them an entry fee and accommodation bond&mdash;a significant one of $88,000&mdash;into a nursing home. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that in the debate on appropriations there is considerable licence given to members on the range of matters they may address, but I would suggest to the gentleman who has just spoken&mdash;who has obviously delivered his speech  on aged care&mdash;that there is a debate going on in another place at the moment that is dealing with just that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he complains about the guillotine, he might wish to remember that in fact there has been extensive debate allocated in the main chamber on that bill. He might wish to remember that his side of the House&mdash;which has something like half the numbers of our side of the House&mdash;have had their full speaking allocation each, whilst our members have in fact cut their allocation by half. I think there has been more than enough time for debate in the main chamber on that particular bill. It seems to me that to come here and regurgitate much of that argument is probably a bit of a nugatory exercise from his point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I will move on to talking about the nation's broader economic aspects, which of course is relevant in terms of the appropriations bill. I think it is important that we put in context the nature of what the government is trying to achieve with this budget, because this budget is one of a series of budgets which have a central premise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw in last year's budget, followed up by this year's budget, a government that has been determined to try and get the country's economy back on track. We are, of course, all aware that members on the other side will come into this place and they will undoubtedly stand up one after the other and try and criticise individual measures. They will complain about something being cut or not being done or why more money has not been spent in this area or that area. In fact, that characterised their 13 years in government and what happened was that there was such a concentration on the minutia that we did not in fact get the big picture right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk this morning about some of those big picture items. What happened when the Howard government took office was that we discovered that there was a huge debt. I think we are all aware that the country has got a huge debt and the government's expenditure on a year by year basis has not been in balance. With last year's budget we saw the first moves taken to try to put that budget right, to try to make sure that the federal government did not finish up in the red each year and to try to get us back into the black&mdash;as we all have to, not only at a government level but also at a family and personal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some pain associated with that. That is inevitable. It is regrettable, but it has to happen, because you cannot continue to live beyond your means. If you do of course the national debt just gets bigger and bigger. One of the problems when you get into debt is that you have to start to borrow. When you borrow, you have to start to service the interest associated with that borrowing, which adds to the debt problem on a year by year basis. What this government has been about is putting the national accounts back into good order. It is an ongoing process: it will not be achieved in five minutes but we have made a start and that is important from a national perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about a few other matters this morning that continue that theme. It seems to me that when you are trying to get the nation's accounts back in order it is not only about good housekeeping but also about looking at how we encourage our country to export in order to start earning money overseas and to start paying off some of the debt rather than just
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5146"> stopping the rot, which was the first step along the road. It is important to look at our place in the world and remember that, whilst geographically we are a large country, in economic and population terms we are actually a very small country. We cannot therefore go out and dictate to the rest of the world what happens to suit us or how we want them to behave. We cannot use economic muscle to require other people to do the things that we want them to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of economic activity in the world, Australia accounts for less than one per cent&mdash;we are a mighty mouse in economic terms. We cannot in fact go out there and dictate, as perhaps the United States can or as perhaps a united Europe or Japan can. There is another major thing that this country has to come to grips with in economic terms. Whilst a lot of our history has been orientated towards the United Kingdom and Europe&mdash;and quite clearly that relationship will continue to have be an important strand for this country for some time&mdash;it is no longer the dominant strand in our economic future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the United States has been important to us and continues to be an important trading partner. But the reality is that, in our trade with the United States, the United States does overwhelmingly better out of that trade than we do. We have a significant trade imbalance, in their favour, with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think we are all beginning to realise that our future in fact is going to be much more orientated to the Asian part of the world, in which we are located. It is perhaps a hackneyed phrase, but we used to talk about the `tyranny of distance' when we talked about our remoteness from Europe and the United States. It seems to me that we now have the advantage of proximity in terms of the future development in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we are all aware that the booming economies in the world are those that are associated with Asia, whether it is Japan, Korea or Indonesia, which is starting to grow rapidly, or even the Philippines, which has started to put into place some economic measures to make it a potential tiger economy. Then there is Thailand and, of course, the big one&mdash;China. If we accept that we live in the part of the world that has those booming economies, we have to think about how we deal with those booming economies, how we take advantage of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting up front that we have to be careful that we do not spoil the game before we get into it. That is where I certainly take some exception to some of the comments made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). What you will find, if you travel around Asia these days&mdash;I have had the good fortune in recent months to visit a number of countries in Asia&mdash;is that increasingly people who would send students to this country are in fact asking, `Is it safe to send my student there?' Malaysia sends 10,000 or 11,000 students a year. Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong do the same. We have something like 60,000 overseas students in this country at any one time, and they bring in several billion dollars to our economy. Education is big business in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everywhere you go in Asia, and in the South&hyphen;East Asian area in particular at the moment, people ask, `Is it safe to send our students? Should we be sending them to America or Britain?' That is potentially going to do us great damage. You have similar questions in terms of tourism and similar statements in terms of investment. When I was in Singapore recently, a number of men from large businesses were saying to me, `Why should I come and invest in Australia when, quite clearly, the support that has been generated for the member for Oxley shows that you are not really interested in Asian investment. I'll go and invest my money in another country&mdash;whether it is Brazil, Indonesia or some other country.' So it seems to me that we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5147"> have to make it very clear to our neighbours in Asia that we do want to do business. That is the first and the prime lesson that we need to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just recently, Ross Garnaut from the Australian National University has published his annual assessment of the Asian economies and where we stand compared with many of those economies. This is in a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asia Pacific Profiles</EMPHASIS> which is an analysis of 15 nations. Professor Garnaut looks at the growth factors and at a whole range of factors that are relevant to where we are going and how we compare with other countries. It is interesting that on his league tables, for example, China is at the top of the pile in terms of growth, followed by Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Korea. Then we get down to some of the less well&hyphen;known, but certainly potentially booming, economies of places such as India and the Philippines. Taiwan is there of course, as is Thailand. Hong Kong, albeit only a country of six million people, ranks well above Australia. Australia is not scoring very highly at all&mdash;we are only just marginally in front of Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. Japan, in fact, is below us in terms of growth because it is coming off a far higher plane and therefore you would not expect it, as a mature economy, to be showing the same degree of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other interesting points that Ross Garnaut makes in his report is something that I think has started to hit home to people in this country just in the last few weeks. The report says that, from the second half of 1996, Australia began to lose manufactured exports momentum, an event so far unremarked but indicative of a decline in international competitiveness that is sure to influence the looming protection debate. It is very interesting that a number of manufacturers are telling me&mdash;and I am sure they are telling other members of this House&mdash;that manufacturing has been in the doldrums for some time and that any stimulus that may have been given to the economy by recent interest rate cuts has been filled by taking stock off shelves, rather than making things and restocking the shelves. So we clearly have a number of challenges in that direction. That is a problem which this government is going to have to face, but which we as a nation have to face. With our small population we are not going to drive a huge domestic market; what we have to do is to become much more export orientated. We perhaps have to look much more at what we do overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take a few minutes to talk about a recent trip I was fortunate enough to make to China with a number of colleagues from both sides of the House. It was my first visit to China and I came away mightily impressed with what I had seen. We went to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. It was very interesting that the development that is going on in China is on a scale and at a pace that takes the breath away. Quite clearly, since Deng Xiaoping started the economic revolution in China some 18 years ago they have made huge strides. Shanghai is an example. For those who have not been to Shanghai, it is built on the west bank of the river, where it comes out to the ocean. It is a large city, with something like 13 million people, and a well&hyphen;known one, having been a centre of the economy in China for many, many decades. But the east bank has traditionally been farming ground, because the river is about 1&half; miles wide and, historically, it has been difficult to get across.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seven years ago, the Chinese government decided they would develop a new industrial centre on the east bank. They have built some tunnels under the river and some bridges over the top and, five years ago, they started to build. When we went to Shanghai, we went down to the riverfront where there is an esplanade called the Bund. One of my colleagues was there five years ago. He said that he had stood on the Bund and looked across to the other bank at an area that is now known as Pudong, and that it had all been farms. But when you stand there today, you can see nothing but skyscrapers and buildings for factories and accommodation and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5148"> offices and so on. There are now several million people living there, and that is in a five&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shanghai has 17 per cent of the world's overhead cranes. You just think about that. Almost one&hyphen;fifth of the world's overhead cranes are in one city in China, because of the amount of building that is going on. The elevated roads that are going in in Old Shanghai, and all the new factories and so on, are absolutely mind blowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went on to a town called Hangzhou, which is about 180 kilometres south of Shanghai and inland. It is a relatively small city in Chinese terms: it has only 1.6 million people. We went to the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory where they make metal joints that go into car engines. They make just seven products. It was started by seven farmers 18 years ago. Today, they employ 6,500 workers on the shop floor. It was just one factory, but with building after building with rows and rows of employees turning out product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had some engineers in the party who looked at these things and told me that the quality was absolutely outstanding. The workers are working eight&hyphen;hour shifts in a five&hyphen;day working week. It is not sweated labour. Certainly, compared with our wages, theirs are poor; but, compared with where those workers were at five years ago, they are in absolute clover. The standard of the housing which we saw is improving dramatically. That company had a $US150 million turnover last year, of which $50 million was in exports. So it is that sort of thing that we are actually going to have to compete with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went on to Shenzhen, which is just across the border from Hong Kong. Sixteen years ago, when the Guangzhou area which encompasses Shenzhen was declared the first special economic development zone of China, it was a fishing town of 20,000 people. Today, Shenzhen has 3&half; million people, wall&hyphen;to&hyphen;wall skyscrapers, factories, accommodation and so on&mdash;a huge amount of economic activity. They are building skyscrapers there at the rate of one floor every 2&half; days. They built a new international airport which was opened not long ago, which took three years from go to whoa&mdash;from start to finish in three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot even make a decision as to where to put Sydney airport, after 20&hyphen;odd years of arguing about it. I have to say that both governments have been at fault in that respect. I am talking about an Australian problem, a problem which we have to come to grips with. You can come away from China as I did, and you can say, `I feel thoroughly intimidated. What hope have we got? This country of China is going ahead at such a rate of knots economically that it will become the dominant economic power in the next century. We are going to be a bit player and we are going to be taken over economically.' Alternatively, you can come away saying, `There are tremendous opportunities in that market for Australia, but we have to get our act together.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not all is perfect in China. For a start, there is very little environmental protection going on there, and there is some pretty terrible environmental degradation happening there as a result of the huge growth. Occupational health and safety is not exactly high on the agenda in some of those factories and so on that we saw. So there are opportunities for us. We are generally regarded throughout Asia as being very innovative. We have a number of areas where a highly skilled and highly trained work force can be successful&mdash;in new construction techniques and environmental management, and even in legal services, education, health and information technology and communications. There are tremendous opportunities for this country in such places as China and elsewhere throughout South&hyphen;East Asia. But we do need
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5149"> to have an orientation towards exporting. It seems to me that that is something in our culture, if you like, that we have not developed sufficiently in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To help companies do some of that, this government now needs to not only put the housekeeping matters of the year&hyphen;to&hyphen;year budget in order, which was an essential first step, but also to go on and do a few other things, and I am sure it will. For example, the government needs to look at the taxation system, which is an absolute disincentive to companies to export. There is no question about that, and that is part of the argument about the current car industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to sort out things such as the waterfront. Increasingly, the car industry is not about building a car lock, stock and barrel in Adelaide or Melbourne or somewhere overseas. It is about sourcing from a variety of countries different components at the best price, bringing them together and assembling them. That means that transportation and shipping is absolutely fundamental, so this government needs to move on and deal with things like the waterfront, the taxation system and probably more industrial relations reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to look at the enforcement of standards. If our companies, when they go overseas and do business, are going to be subject to all sorts of safety standards, we have to look at those issues when companies bring their products into this country as well. We have to do more in terms of savings and investment because we have not got a savings base in this country. We do not have the base, therefore, for investing in our companies, and that is another reason why we need to attract investment from overseas, another reason why we do not need to turn off those Asian investors who might come here and invest in opportunities in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the bottom line is that we as politicians and members of this parliament, and political leaders at all levels, need to make sure that we start getting out there and selling the message that the economic restructuring that is so necessary and which this government has to pursue over the next few years is for the long&hyphen;term good of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to get the message to business that they have to get a culture of getting out there and selling overseas. Whilst there is a lot of uncertainty undoubtedly out there in the community, the man and woman in the street has to start to be educated, in a sense, and informed as to why it is so necessary that we see our future in Asia and what we need to do to make that successful. If we show by our attitude that we do not care about Asia we will go down the drain, but if we grasp the opportunity that is there this country can once again be very prosperous indeed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Firstly, the government is taking a great deal of satisfaction at the low inflation rate that Australia is currently enjoying. I think this is a considerable achievement.

I think that is what the people of Australia expect us to do, to try to see what is in the best interests of the country, and then give credit where credit is due&mdash;and I am happy to extend that in relation to inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I must say that there are things that really do disturb me. I notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today that we have some very disturbing headlines. I am sure you would have liked to have read it but, in case you have not, the main story is `Recession hits factories'. I think  that is a very uncomfortable headline for us all in electorates such as those of Fowler and mine, because what it really means is that unemployment is going up. And in the business section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a headline reads, " `R' word is back. The Government blames the dollar."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true when we were in government that in fact the number of people employed in the manufacturing sector did go down and stabilised somewhat but at a time when manufacturing output had increased. These are very disturbing statistics. I will read from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record an excellent table that sets out sectoral growth. Manufacturing in the March quarter declined by 0.1 per cent and the annual growth is 2.2. Health in the March quarter declined 1.1 per cent and the annual growth is 0.4; retail trade is declining from 1.7 per cent to 1.3; education declining from 1.8 to 1.3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is part of the issue that I want to focus on. In the first budget we saw an expectation of higher growth but the government was not able to deliver it. I must say with this budget, I do not believe&mdash;and I see now where economists and writers are joining in that&mdash;that the growth targets predicted in the budget are actually going to be met. Again, I say we can talk here in abstract figures about whether we are achieving this growth or what growth is desirable, but at the end of the day when we leave this chamber and go back to our electorates we are talking about people who do not have jobs. These statistics actually translate into human beings. Whether they are older workers or young workers, they are human beings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the tragedies of modern society is, in fact, this unacceptably high level of unemployment. In an electorate like mine, I have had to cross a major bridge. Basically I am very much an optimist and that bridge was to come to believe that we are now going to have a core of people who will never find a job. How does society give them dignity? How does society give them a worthwhile activity? If we do not, the social costs of not trying to address that problem will be horrific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fowler (Mr Grace) will remember that, when the Keating government was looking at One Nation, trying to tackle this issue of unemployment, there was a very furious debate in the caucus. The point at issue was whether we should, in the year 2000, aim for five per cent unemployment or should we have a lower target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to confess that I was one of a minority who argued passionately that we really had to go for a lower number. In any event, when we did announce the five per cent target, people felt that this was an ambitious target but backbenchers like me and the honourable member for Fowler, who shares a concern for his constituents, very much believed that this was achievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really disappointing to see unemployment being stuck unacceptably high. It is predicted we can get unemployment down from 8.7 per cent to eight per cent. Firstly, I do not believe you are going to hit the mark and, in any event, I believe eight per cent is far too high. In electorates like mine it means that there is an even higher level of unemployment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5151">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last three years of our government&mdash;and I do not want to harp on this&mdash;we were hitting 2.8 per cent growth in jobs in the economy. The level of full-time jobs was very respectable. In the first Howard budget, the target set that was not met was just 1.5 per cent&mdash;only 1.5 per cent but it was undershot. I think you are going to find that you get the same situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made comment previously that one of the most disturbing features of job growth in the economy, as it exists, is the way we are shedding full&hyphen;time jobs and replacing them with  part&hyphen;time jobs. I do not want to get into an argument about the value of a part&hyphen;time job or a full&hyphen;time job. All I am saying is that I think the balance is being worryingly disturbed with such massive numbers of jobs being part&hyphen;time jobs. If this trend continues, I wonder how long it will be before we start talking, in a bipartisan way, about the fact that people may be unrealistic to aspire to a full&hyphen;time job. It is a thought that neither you, Mr Deputy Speaker, nor I have had to contemplate in our working lives, but I wonder what will happen with the modern generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say a few things about the current tax debate. Firstly, the most important statement about taxation has not been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the Treasurer (Mr Costello) but by the Commissioner of Taxation. He said that the lack of people paying taxation, particularly in the black economy, is costing Australia, in his estimate, between $3 billion and $15 billion. Indeed, the Treasurer had to come in because he had said it was between $3 billion and $5 billion but it is between $3 billion and $15 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that we have had billionaires address parliamentary committees saying, `Of course, any businessman will want to minimise and will have experts to minimise taxation.' But if we see this as a virtue, and people are able to succeed in doing that, it really means that governments&mdash;whether it is your government or my government&mdash;will not have the money to put into infrastructure, education and other areas. If we want to have a taxation debate, we need to focus on this issue. Even if this estimate of between $3 billion and $15 billion is half right, we are still talking about $1&half; to $7 billion. I have noticed when we get estimates like this that they tend to be very conservative and that, in fact, the figure is much higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that needs to be made is whether Australia should be moving to a goods and services tax and whether a goods and services tax would obviate the concern about the tax money. Indeed, those countries that have a goods and services tax still have this problem. So it is, if you like, indifferent to the type of taxation you have&mdash;whether it is wholesale sales tax, income tax, the company tax regime that we have in Australia or a GST as in some other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that very soon after this budget was delivered the Prime Minister got into saying, `Tax is back on the agenda.' I suppose if we are genuinely interested in the issue of taxation&mdash;particularly on the Labor side&mdash;it puts us in a difficult position. Firstly, it is a matter of history that we tried to have a taxation summit. We tried to get all of the interested players in Australia into Canberra to discuss what needed to be done and to put options before that tax summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that some Liberal members have been very keen to pull out from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> statements that I have made. It embarrasses me not in the slightest to say that I was an advocate of option C at that time. I really believed that we should be trying to overcompensate those people on fixed incomes. But history has shown that it was the business community, in particular, which was the critical body that walked away from the taxation debate and reform.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5152">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, in retrospect, they have bitterly regretted that because the climate was ideal then to introduce it. John Hewson, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, certainly did that in 1993, and I have always admired people who have the courage to put political ideas in the marketplace. Indeed, some say that the coalition was robbed of victory in that, but we had hardened our attitude to the GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is going to be a sensible debate in this country on taxation reform, you cannot do it in isolation from the opposition. If there is going to be a sensible taxation debate in this country, we cannot try to use it as a method of political point scoring. That is, the opposition of the day, one way or another, is going to have to be included. Maybe it gets me no brownie points praising the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for his idea of a parliamentary committee, but I have to say that I feel there is some merit in his suggestion. On the Labor side, we want to explore all the issues of tax minimisation and tax evasion, matters given even more relevance by the Taxation Commissioner's comments about the black economy. We have, of course, also a great interest in those wealthiest 100 people. So we would want to take the committee through all those issues before we would want to make a leap to a change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have noticed that you can have some very controversial issues before a parliamentary committee without necessarily fracturing what I think is one of the essential qualities of these committees. We are not trying to score points in a partisan way as members of the Liberal, National or Labor parties, or as Democrats, but as members of the House or Senate we are trying to come to grips with a critical issue or problem and to find worthwhile solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But time is running out on that debate and time is running out for sensibly encompassing the opposition in a debate about taxation. I have to agree with the Treasurer&mdash;again, I apologise and hope that this does not lead to any attacks by my colleagues. Taxation is not going to solve the country's unemployment and growth problems. Yes, it is always worthwhile looking at tax, its equity and its fairness. But it is not going to solve what are the hardcore problems in this economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a good and a bad thing announced in the savings arena in this budget. The good thing is that a government has stood up and wanted to reward savings. And, like the previous coalition speaker, I do not think there is any debate in the country about the need to increase personal and national savings, but there is certainly a debate about the best way to go about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record that the coalition has for the first time rewarded savings but, in doing so, members of the coalition have broken a fundamental promise. The coalition&mdash;and I am reading from the election manifesto on superannuation and retirement incomes policy&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will meet the government's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the Labor government's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">co&hyphen;contribution commitment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Part and parcel of introducing this savings scheme was to abandon the coalition's policy statement made in March 1996 by John Howard. This is flip&hyphen;flop, this is inconsistency and hypocrisy. I think that it is regrettable because it lowers our standing when you do this. I need to point out the impact of what you have done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5153">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take a worker on average weekly earnings&mdash;and the majority of workers do not earn average weekly earnings&mdash;he or she would have been contributing $1,000 towards his or her superannuation. It would have been fully matched by $1,000 co&hyphen;payment. So the first year the government gave $1,000; next year it gave another $1,000, matching the $1,000 year after year. The best this worker can do by making the same contribution towards his superannuation under your savings scheme is to get $150, not $450. I do not think it is extreme to say that  in breaking this solemn pledge the coalition made at the last election, a worker on average weekly earnings is actually having $850 ripped off their future retirement incomes policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said in this House before that I was proud of the things that we had done in terms of superannuation. They were not perfect, too many changes&mdash;make all those criticisms&mdash;but I was proud because we were well on the way in terms of superannuation savings of providing huge funds for investment, and investment equals jobs in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is history repeating itself I regret to say. It was the Menzies government that absolutely destroyed the fully funded superannuation scheme that older Australians remember so well&mdash;the national welfare fund. I can understand the coalition coming in after 13 years with a lot of enthusiasm and new ideas, but in an area so important for people in their old age and so important nationally for our economy, I think it is a tragedy that they would once again, by a number of measures, not just this one, absolutely destroy Labor's superannuation plans. We are going to see as a result fewer people contributing to superannuation than they were under what was a legislated or, if you like, compulsory scheme. I know their party stands for choice, but no matter how much money people have, if they are raising families there are always reasons to spend extra money on the children, instead of setting it aside for the future. The children will always be first priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, the Treasurer takes a great deal of satisfaction in some of the benefits of low interest rates. He says to new home owners, `Look, on an average loan, you are saving $292.' And that is true. But I want to make the point that not everyone is buying their home and those people that are in rented accommodation have not seen those savings. Thirty per cent of Australians who usually have the least amount of income compared to home owners are not getting an extra $75 a week. Ask the pensioners who are in housing department accommodation&mdash;their rents have gone up. I am not saying saving home owners mortgage repayments is a bad thing. Of course I am not. But I am saying those sorts of savings are not being passed on to each and every Australian. I wish the Treasurer might just remember that when he justifiably with some pride talks about lowering interest rates. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been recent publicity that Labor and the Democrats will block the sale of Australian National in the Senate and also in the Legislative Council in South Australia. I hope this proves to be wrong and that good sense will prevail. Any members or senators from South Australia who seek to block the sale will be guilty of an act of treachery against South Australia. The Australian National workers know and understand this. They knew what was
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5154"> going wrong at AN well before the Brew report. They knew that Labor had let them down badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some time now I have been working with AN employees at Islington to get not only the best deal for them, but also solutions to ensure a viable rail industry. I have appreciated the working relationship and the trust which has developed. While senators and upper house members are no doubt fine people, they do not have the opportunity to represent as personally and directly those who live and work in one's own electorate as we in the House of Representatives do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge any senator or upper house member who thinks it will be a smart thing to block the sale to come with me and meet with the men who work there&mdash;those men who knew what was going wrong when the previous Labor minister was claiming that all was well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past few days I have had more than 20 written submissions from AN workers on the sale of AN. I have been assured that faxes have also been sent to the shadow minister so I do hope he is sharing that information with Labor's leadership. I would like to quote some of what has been sent to me. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my belief that Australian National should be sold because we, the employees, are sick and tired of being in limbo. Labor started the demise of Australian National with the introduction of the National Rail Corporation and are now extending the agony by blocking the sale of Australian National in the Senate. I think it is unfair to prolong the uncertainty and urge you and your fellow ministers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">unfortunately, I have been promoted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to do all in your power to allow this sale process to continue with the sale taking place as soon as possible. I believe that it is our only hope to some sort of future in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that it would be fair and equitable that ALL Australian National employees be made redundant and the choice of employment with the purchasers be left to the successful tender and the relevant individuals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That letter is signed by A. S. Crimes, locomotive maintenance. Another letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you please answer the following questions because I cannot possibly see any political mileage in the non&hyphen;sale of the skeletal remains of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Why is the Federal Labor Opposition opposed to the sale of Australian National when it was a Labor government that started the demise of Australian National with the introduction of the National Rail Corporation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Why doesn't the Federal opposition allow the sale of Australian National so that employees know where they stand so they can plan their futures instead of being used as a political punching bag?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is signed by D. Platten, locomotive electrical. As the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has already pointed out, Labor's failure to understand the workers at Port Augusta and Islington&mdash;the bulk of AN workers&mdash;and their support for the sale of AN shows how out of touch and how arrogant Labor is. Labor sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas but now wants to play political games which will hurt AN workers and their families. For AN to have a future, it needs new capital injection, new management and new direction. Again, I challenge those who would block the sale to come and talk business with those who know the full story.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) still manages to damage Australia's international reputation and at a local level causes division and hurt. I have said before that I believe the issues of reconciliation, of indigenous health and education and Commonwealth funding to Aboriginal communities and individuals are far too important to be underresearched or incorrectly represented. Everyone has the right to engage in the debate surrounding these issues but, if positive public policy is the desired result, the dialogue must be based on accurate information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Oxley had drawn attention to the large amount of money spent in some areas which have clearly not advanced the wellbeing of Aborigines, and sought ways to improve their health, education and special needs, I could have agreed with her. If she had called for a calm, sensible look at immigration, including issues such as sham marriage arrangements and the balance between skilled migration and family reunion, she could have legitimately been part of the debate. She did neither.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5156">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What she has done is introduce a number of untruths into current racial debates which may be immediately palatable to some sections of the community left isolated from Paul Keating's  big picture, but they divide and they hurt. The member for Oxley has challenged anyone to tell her how Aborigines are disadvantaged: Aboriginal people have a shorter life expectancy, are more prone to disease and poverty, have a poorer standard of housing, and are more likely to go to jail and to be unemployed. Disease, effectively controlled in white society, still runs rampant in some rural and remote Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal people have a one in three chance of living to the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley also claims that we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for 1991 show that 0.5 per cent of people in Australia were born in China; 0.3 per cent in Hong Kong; 0.4 per cent in Malaysia; 0.4 in the Philippines; 0.7 per cent in Vietnam. These figures hardly indicate that we are being swamped by Asians. In looking for a cure to Australia's dole queues, the member for Oxley says that immigration must be halted. However, academic research suggests that immigration has a neutral or slightly positive effect on unemployment. It is also common knowledge that part of the solution for Australia's economic problem is a greater push into the huge Asian market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley's comments have the potential to economically harm the very people she claims to be standing up for, namely, hardworking Australians. The member for Oxley would have us return to the White Australia Policy, and she quotes one time Labor Party leader, Arthur Calwell, to make her point but on other occasions she asks us to forget the past. She hits out at Asian immigrants, claiming that they have their own culture and religion&mdash;as if that were a crime. She seems to have forgotten that, apart from indigenous Australians, we are all immigrants, all with different backgrounds and beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the United Nations, she says Australia must review its membership. I would argue that, five years after the end of the Cold War, it has never been more important for Australia to contribute in this international forum. As a result of a recent Australian initiative, more than 100 countries have signed a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley further claims that the government should cease all foreign aid immediately. Her call is completely out of step with the vast majority of compassionate Australians. Compassion has been sadly lacking in the public utterances by the member for Oxley. She also attacks the World Health Organisation. Apart from providing aid on very good humanitarian grounds, there are many practical reasons why Australia should contribute to reproductive health strategies, the alleviation of hunger and famine, immunisation programs and the eradication of infectious diseases before they can impact on our own population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps one of the most extraordinary claims made by her is that abolishing the policy of multiculturalism will save billions of dollars. Dr Mark Wooden, Deputy Director of Labour Studies at Flinders University, has been quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has yet to be a credible academic analysis of the fundamental cost and benefits of multiculturalism.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The key idea of multicultural Australia is that migrants should be able to retain and celebrate their individual cultural heritage while at the same committing themselves to the values, goals and aspirations of Australia. This has resulted in an Australia we can all be proud of for its diversity, tolerance and understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in a world of rapid change&mdash;my parents rode horses to school and my son communicates on the Internet. There can be country to country instant exchange of information. We must be seen internationally as an attractive democracy. The member for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5157"> Oxley, and those who support her, would have us live in isolation. We cannot do that. Change must be embraced and used to our benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia requires a highly skilled work force because there are clever ways of doing old things. We not only export traditional products, but also mining equipment and mining services, medical equipment and medical services. Tourism and overseas students are an important component of our economy. I would urge the member for Oxley to start thinking about what is good for our country rather than what is good for her own promotion and publicity. I would also urge the people of Adelaide to not protest violently against her next week when she lobs into town&mdash;that just gives her further publicity. There will be an opportunity to celebrate cultural diversity, and that is the more appropriate way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic mess left behind by Labor cannot be reversed overnight. It is dangerous to believe or argue that it can be. Simplistic solutions put forward by the member for Oxley and those who oppose budgetary constraint shown by this government in its effort to reduce the national debt do their fellow Australians no favours at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil Raskell, writing in 1993 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Left Review</EMPHASIS>, lamented that `there is no quick fix' and that the trends in social and economic inequality followed long-term cycles. But Labor, as he and other supporters of the opposition well know, had 13 years to reverse those trends. Far from improving or even stabilising the growth in disparity between the rich and the poor, Labor presided over unprecedented growth in inequality and isolation from the political process. Little wonder that the voices of hate and division, such as those of the member for Oxley, are now given media and public attention, unjustified by the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is in the position, as suggested by David Pemberthy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . of having taken impressive strides towards returning the Budget to balance and receiving little credit for it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The key election promise of the Howard government was to return the budget to surplus in its first term in office. With $7.2 billion in reduced expenditure in the last budget and a further $1.7 billion reduction in this year's budget, that objective is now within reach. In 1995, almost 20 per cent of the gross domestic product of Australia each year had to be accounted for by way of debt. By the year 2000, the coalition government will have cut that commitment in half. This will free up valuable resources to meet the challenge of the new century with money that has been created by Australians for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a young person, you need economic honesty on the part of the government in order to have economic opportunity in your lifetime. No country can remain prosperous or sustain a level of lifestyle such as that enjoyed here in Australia if the current generation cheat their children by leaving them crippled by debt. If we do not reduce debt we will be responsible for mortgaging their inheritance. In doing so, we will have compromised their opportunities, freedoms and, perhaps most critical of all, the safety nets that support us all when we are unemployed, sick or elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we as a parliament can get this right, Australia has the opportunity in the 21st century to be both prosperous and inclusive, a more diverse yet vastly superior society. That is an opportunity that should not be confined by partisan bickering and negative campaigning. Nor is it the preserve of any individual, no matter what their position. It is a matter of all Australians standing a little bit taller. Our future and that of our children is worth that extra effort. For its part, this coalition government intends to break a vicious cycle. This year, for the first time in nearly a decade, the Commonwealth will not go into debt.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All over the electorate, many families are enjoying the benefits of interest rates being at their lowest level since man first walked on the moon. Let us not forget that during the 1980s, business interest rates hit 24 per cent and home interest rates peaked at 17 per cent. Since coming to power this government has saved business about $3.6 billion in interest payments. It has also put local economies on the path of long term, rather than on the boom-bust cycle that was typical under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also saving is now a real option for many residents in Adelaide. Saving rates are not exclusively related to levels of disposable income. Currently lower income earners have no incentive to save and it is little wonder they may choose to spend any disposable income on other lifestyle choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 1998, however, this government will have delivered a 15 per cent tax rebate for the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings or personal contributions to superannuation funds. A study undertaken by Bankers Trust has shown that people earning less than $40,000 held 70 per cent of all savings incomes, which is eligible for the rebate. Again, lower middle income earners, about six million of them, are the winners in this budget by having a coalition government which stands for real equity and fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older members of the Adelaide community have also benefited from this budget. For the first time, the government has budgeted for pensions to be held at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Self&hyphen;retired members of the community will also be able to access the 15 per cent savings rebate on the tax they pay. Those who choose to continue in the work force after they reach 65 years of age and subsequently qualify for the single age pension will qualify for up to $21,000 tax free under the deferred pension bonus plan. This offers older members of the community real choice about their lifestyle and provides added security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From July 1998, all Australians will be given greater choice about the fund or retirement savings account, where their superannuation guarantee or contributions are invested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increase of the domiciliary care benefit of 28 per cent or $16.60 a fortnight to a level similar to the child disability allowance is also welcomed by the many dedicated carers in Adelaide. On top of the $36.7 million that this government allocated in the last budget to implement the national respite for carers plan, a further $16 million has been allocated to go directly to supporting carers and those they assist in the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I first want to simply say to the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), congratulations on your contribution today, which was made in pretty difficult circumstances following the tragic loss of your mother and severe injuries to your father in a road accident. I can well understand. I remember losing an aunt of mine on the Karoonda Road when a car rolled over in 1983. She was my second mother basically. I know that today and for quite a while into the future it will be quite difficult, so I congratulate you. Well done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, talking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) today really has a touch of the weird and the bizarre. One could be excused for believing that you are on the set of a science fiction series like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">X&hyphen;Files</EMPHASIS>, trying to identify a UFO&mdash;not an unidentified flying object, but an unfinished operation or, to put it more bluntly, a useless financial offer to the Australian people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5159">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot remember a budget that disappeared so quickly and sank into the swamp. No wonder that happened. For some reason, known only to themselves, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) thought that a mere outcome driven budget, without any rationale whatsoever, without any coherence whatsoever, would be accepted by the commentators and the electorate. Desperate about the rising number of nervous nellies on the back bench now realising they had little to sell in the electorate, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer sought alternative agendas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the run, they manufactured and reworked the GST debate and tax reform to fill the hole they had so dramatically dug for themselves. On the run, the Prime Minister addressed angrily an equally angry group of pastoralists at Longreach. On the run, an angry Prime Minister resorted to simply that at the reconciliation convention in Melbourne. These diversions and these behaviours exhibited by the Prime Minister were deliberately initiated to desperately dig his government out of the hole he had dug for his government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This 1997 budget is almost universally acknowledged as nothing more than a do nothing, directionless, shapeless, vision lacking statement that actually absented itself from addressing the major issues identified by Australians prior to the 1996 election. Unlike what the government promised, this budget is evidence for all to see of an absence of responsibility to assume leadership and originality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the budget, 70 per cent of Australians considered that the government's first task was seriously to tackle unemployment and to implement strategies other than just the economic levers to create jobs. The government's response to this budget is simply breathtaking and cynical in the extreme, with one mention of unemployment&mdash;just one sentence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy of unemployment is one of the modern developed world. However, it is a problem that, if not effectively addressed, will lead to civil disorder of the sort we saw on our television screens in Sydney the other night. Current economic orthodoxies or, indeed, past economic orthodoxies appear incapable of solving the problem. Just fiddling around with the economic levers and economic growth alone will not solve the unemployment problem. Yet the fundamental role of a nation's economy is to provide job opportunities to all who want them. Basically I am horrified at the general response to unemployment in this country&mdash;not only of this government but also of the leaders of business, of the bureaucracy, of academia and of the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are creative solutions to unemployment that are put forward from all sections of the community but they seldom see the light of day. The so&hyphen;called logic of the market prevails to the detriment of almost 20 per cent of the Australian community. These critics take little or no account of the social costs of unemployment&mdash;increased crime and suicide&mdash;nor do they mention an inefficient economy with high unemployment, occupational health and safety problems, lost productivity caused by boredom and fatigue and increased compensation claims and redundancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that job creation is beyond the imagination and the skill level of this government. Unemployment in this country has risen to 8&frac34; per cent, the so&hyphen;called official rate, but well under the real rate of about 13 per cent plus. Youth unemployment in my state is a staggering 42 per cent. It is outrageous&mdash;42 per cent youth unemployment in South Australia. I get the distinct impression from this government that it wants to get a so&hyphen;called official rate of unemployment like that in the United States&mdash;five or six per cent&mdash;but
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5160"> it ignores the four per cent in prison, the up to four per cent permanently engaged in crime and the up to four per cent on the streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first year of the Howard government, unemployment actually increased. There are 31,500 more people on the dole queue than there were at the last election. The number of long&hyphen;term unemployed, a more worrying feature, has risen by 44,000. Yet not once in the budget speech did the Treasurer even mention unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the first one to admit that the election result in 1996 clearly demonstrated that people wanted a change in government, but it has not been a change for the better on jobs. In this coming year, Australians look to a worsening unemployment rate: 16,500 Public Service jobs will be lost; nearly 9,500 defence jobs will go; 1,000 Medicare staff go; and 700 meat inspectors from AQIS will go. In addition to those job losses, 12,000 jobs are threatened in Australia's pharmaceutical industry, not to mention the jobs in the steel industry and a threatened loss of jobs in the car industry and its component parts industry. To cap it all off, one only has to raise the coalition's promise of an additional 200,000 jobs in manufacturing by the year 2000. Now that was a pretty admirable aim, but it will never be attained by this government because the minister and the government believe there is no role whatsoever for government in manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 budget saw a $2.9 billion assault on assistance programs to industry, but this budget gives no sign whatsoever of any rethink of industry policy. What there is though is a massive projected decline in assistance to manufacturing industry. From 1997&hyphen;98 to 2000-01, assistance to manufacturing will decline from $561 million to $146 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members have a much bigger role to play in stimulating growth, development and job creation than merely sitting on their hands, wearing smirks on their faces, mouthing empty words and being self-satisfied that low inflation and low interest rates will solve the unemployment problem. It will not. This government needs to engage its intellect. The Australian people expect this government to lead, to accept responsibility for the levels of unemployment in this country. The 1997&hyphen;98 budget is shameful in that unemployment is totally ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last three weeks, my staff and I have examined very carefully the Howard government's budget in order to see just how it has affected people in my electorate of Port Adelaide. I have to say our findings are very disturbing. I have already pointed out this budget offers absolutely nothing for those seeking work, or even hoping to secure work. But it offers little or nothing for pensioners either, and little or nothing for the overwhelming majority of families in my electorate. It offers no sense of direction for Australia. Hope, that very fragile piece of human behaviour, is diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the government's own figures, economic growth and jobs growth have stalled. We have a growth rate of 2.4 per cent. That means unemployment will continue to rise. And this is at a time when the country needs strong and innovative leadership to lift us out of the doldrums, to provide opportunities, and above all, to offer hope for a more secure future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly true in my state of South Australia, as it was acknowledged by the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who was here just a moment ago, when she said in a subheading in her column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The domestic car industry already has a loaded gun to its head.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quite correctly, and with other government backbenchers, she points out:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5161">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electoral backlash would result in the loss of two, perhaps three, seats in South Australia and an equal number in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quite correctly again, she implores the government to get into the real world. She said, and it is a very good quote to put into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the real world, as the State premiers and local MPs know, labour leaving the automotive industry doesn't move into other industries but goes on the dole. Capital taken out of the automotive industry doesn't move to other industries but goes offshore.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Exactly. The government ignores reality and the real world at its peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifteen months of this government have meant a litany of broken promises involving health care, education, the environment, industry policy, jobs training and welfare services. As a result, the trust of the Australian people has been breached, and this budget further breaches that trust. The frail aged in our community have been let down. About $500 million has been cut from aged care services. The cost of nursing home care has soared and people requiring care, despite what some government members say, may now be required to sell their family home to pay for it. That is a broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of medicines for pensioners and concession card holders has gone up and will soon go up again. The budget slashes $700 million from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and this is on top of a cut of $500 million from last year. Only the wealthy will get access to the latest drugs through the imposition of a new drugs tax of up to $20 a prescription. The battlers and pensioners are to get the drugs that they can afford. An amount of $600 million is to be saved by making it more expensive for Australians to get drugs to lower blood pressure, cholesterol, treat ulcers and depression. A few of us will be paying a bit more, Mr Deputy Speaker. An amount of  $112 million is to be saved by abolishing the subsidy for a number of medicines. Pensioners will pay up to $9 more for these medicines as they will no longer be protected by the $3.20 payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government that brags it governs for all Australians is a bit over the top when it comes to the closure of Medicare offices, one of which is Kilkenny and located in my electorate of Port Adelaide. Of the 44 offices to close, 24 are in Labor seats, and 14 are in seats that were previously held by Labor and in the not too distant future will come back. There are just six closures in what could be termed safe Liberal seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So begins a two&hyphen;tiered health system under the coalition. They have a two&hyphen;tiered education system. Why not a two&hyphen;tiered health system? Why not a two&hyphen;tiered social welfare system? One for the rich, who will get the newest, safest and most effective drugs and another for battling Australians who will have to make do with cheaper, less effective and less safe drugs. This is nothing but a new medicines tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the surface, if I can mention a better thing, it is welcome news that the budget allocates $54 million for additional accommodation for people with disabilities. However, like everything the government does, one needs to read past the big print. This allocation is severely tempered by the 1996 cut of $80 million and the introduction of user fees which cost older and disabled people $90 million. In other words, $54 million in return for a cut of $170 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have only ever shown contempt for education in this country. So I suppose no&hyphen;one should be surprised that promises to education should be broken in such a dramatic way. About $400 million away from schools, $250 million from vocational education, $900 million from universities. Add in the additional burden of HECS charges on
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5162"> families trying to provide a decent education for their children, the $2 billion from jobs programs and all will begin to appreciate the lack of wisdom of this government in ignoring the need of this country to develop an appropriate skills based work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For younger children, the reality gets worse. The government's 1996 budget took almost $800 million, $500 million out of child care. The 1997 budget continues the trend in taking out a further $321 million out of child care. Working parents will find it even harder to afford quality child care and it will put it out of the reach of ordinary families. Increases from the 1996 budget of $20 to $40 dollars a week in child care fees are now beginning to bite and many families with young children will and are being forced to abandon child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This in turn will force closures of child&hyphen;care centres and even more job losses and the closures are beginning. In my electorate tomorrow on 6 June 1997, the sixth child&hyphen;care centre in South Australia closes, the Parks. It closes its door to the local community.

It ought to try and create a unified, responsive and compassionate nation&mdash;and I acknowledge the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) who in a speech here earlier said basically the same thing. Yet every announcement by this government works against the basic ideals that I think are the strength of this country and that are being threatened by some rather mad and alternative groups of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of promoting unity, this government is promoting division, even if it is unintentional, because it will not take the responsibility for what is going on in our nation. Instead of creating opportunities, they are wiping out jobs. Instead of leading, they are merely content to meddle with the status quo. It is interesting that the Prime Minister and Treasurer quite often will mention outcome, outcome, outcome. That is fine. But where is the rationale and the coherence, where are the necessary processes that make that trinity of thought and action coherent to the people of Australia? They are merely absent. I think that is what is most disturbing about this budget and about the direction of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government seemingly intent on punishing those most in need of assistance. It is a government which has broken promise after promise that it made to people at the last election, and it is a government that is fast running out of excuses. I think a lot of people, even some in my own electorate, who voted for a change at the last election are seeing, or will come to see, that it has not been a change for the better. When they examine the job opportunities and their job security, I do not think people are feeling calm and relaxed. When age pensioners and people on concessions and other benefits feel the impact of this budget, they will be no better off, they will be worse off. Families, which this government purports to support so grandly, are going to be gravely disappointed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After 13 years of Labor and a tirade of broken promises, it must have been refreshing for Australians to see a budget that delivered no new taxes. There was no increase in income tax, no increase in sales tax, no increase in company tax, no increase in excise on petrol and diesel. I take issue with my colleague the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford): of course in every budget you have to look at inequities that grow up in the system. Part of the reason there are reductions in child care is that his government
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5164"> allowed child care to run on completely unfettered. In fact, I think I opened four child&hyphen;care centres in the last 18 months to two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud child care, I applaud women having a choice in going to work, but what I did find unacceptable was that one of the child&hyphen;care centres that came to complain to me had to admit that 68 per cent of the children in that centre were the children of parents neither of whom worked. You, I and all of us in here, and all the taxpayers of Australia, pay for that. If that had to be pulled back a bit, that is not being mean or mean&hyphen;spirited; that is correcting an inequity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Why should people who are not working not take responsibility for their kids&mdash;and I am not talking about people with crippled kids, or about dysfunctional families; I am talking about the broad cross&hyphen;section. I will just add another little point there. We cut back the number of hours for those people to 20. You have criticised that. Interestingly, however, in your own package two years ago, you were prepared to cut back the number of hours to 12. So at least we are being more generous in spirit than the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But returning to my text: for years the Labor Party was on a path of debt and deficit. In 1983 the foreign debt was $23 billion. Thirteen years on, it was $180 billion. Labor thought that there was no problem. Higher foreign debt means higher interest rates and higher mortgages for families and small businesses. Australians, becoming increasingly nervous about the state of our national and international debt, must have been relieved on the morning after the budget to see that the $10.3 billion black hole would be filled and that Australia returned to a budget surplus of $1.6 billion in the first term of the coalition government. By cutting debt, we have cut interest rates, and that is good for families, for small business, and for creating jobs. For the first time in more than 10 years, the Commonwealth government will not have run up a debt. Repaying a debt means that our children and future generations live more securely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of this equation is that the coalition government has brought stability to Australia over the last 15 months. Remember that under Labor in 1989, home loan interest rates reached a massive 17 per cent. The current rates are around seven per cent. That is the lowest since 1969 and a great confidence booster, I would think, to Australian families. Eight years on from Labor's mid&hyphen;term extravagances, a $100,000 home loan is $834 a month less expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put in terms of my electorate, the coalition home loan regime, in combination with the tax cuts that came into effect on 1 January, will mean that the average young Australian family, with three children, one under five years, paying off a typical home loan, will be somewhere in the vicinity of $60 to $90 a week better off than they were nine months ago. That is an extraordinary figure. When I was bringing up five kids, I would have loved to have had another $60 or $90 a week&mdash;and I brought up five kids so I know exactly what that sort of thing means. If they want to pay their loans off a bit early, it is still a good thing. Add to this an inflation rate of less than two per cent and you have all the ingredients for a full recovery, one that really respects the battlers of Australia and the families of those battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who know my views on regional development know that I am a trenchant critic of the denuding of the bush and the centralising of services away from provincial cities. I will punish my own party, or my own government, as much as any previous government, if I see this happening. A typical example of this denuding happened during the time of the Goss Labor government in Queensland. Once you start to close court houses, remove DPI offices,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5165"> reduce police strength and pull up railway lines, you create a downward spiral with irreversible impact on the infrastructure and the motivation of a community. It is not long, as people know, before it flows on to other government agencies. A school loses a teacher and then the local business puts off one or two employees and the thing goes down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of months ago I drove from Goondiwindi to Warwick in the Southern Downs. Warwick was my home town when I was growing up, so I know that area reasonably well. We passed through a little town of Yelarbon and it sent a chill through me. There it was, this once bustling little town, and hardly a shop was open. They were all empty. I am not talking about little cheap wooden shops; I am talking about solid buildings with quite good plate glass windows. I looked at these empty shops and hoped that they were not a portent of things to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, I applaud a range of measures which will play an important role in the regeneration of rural Australia. Ninety per cent of the $1.6 billion to be spent on roads will be spent outside the capital cities. This includes $700 million on the national highway and $36.7 million on the black spots project. Two roads in my electorate&mdash;one near Monto and another one in the Boyne Valley&mdash;will receive $510,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will be very important to the Monto&hyphen;Gladstone road, which has become a significant corridor for agriculture and logging and might also lead to more mining activity. To see a dangerous road in an area like that removed is a godsend, and I applaud the government for that&mdash;as, indeed, I applaud them for the previously announced $24 million for the Wallaville Bridge in my electorate, a winding timber bridge that crosses the Burnett River, one of the last dangerous bridges on the Pacific and Bruce highways and one much in need of replacement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has made a promise in the lead&hyphen;up to the election to spend a great deal on the regeneration of the environment, and the $1.2 billion Natural Heritage Fund which will come from the partial sale of Telstra is also most welcome. The clean seas and coastal initiatives have already started to take effect in my electorate. We are on the southern gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, and so these things are very important to us. Already $30,000 has been spent on coastal preservation projects in Bundaberg and Gladstone. These are community projects which encourage people to become involved in saving the coastline and marine life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget will also deliver $16 million to local apprenticeships in regional Australia. One of the few groups I have stayed on since I got into politics is the local group apprenticeship scheme, because I think it is very important. I know that my fellow directors will applaud that move as well. Work for the dole pilot schemes are going into regional areas. As you know, 10,000 positions will become available in the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would add that I hope the area of Hinkler, which is part of the Wide Bay statistical region, will be treated kindly. It is a sad fact that, when Labor left government, my area was the worst off in Australia. We had 20 per cent unemployment&mdash;worse than western Sydney. That rate has now dropped to 16.6 per cent, but it is still totally unacceptable. As it is twice the national rate, I appeal to the government to look to my area when it is handing out these pilot programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken on child care and I might not return to that, but I would very much like to talk about health. Prevention is always better than cure. Spending $34 million over the next four years on public health programs, such as the national women's health program, hepatitis C surveillance, education, the national cancer program and the anti&hyphen;tobacco campaign, will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5166"> help what I think are very important aspects which will impact widely across Australia and particularly in my area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only half of Australia's children are fully immunised, and that is a lamentable position. I am saddened that the previous government did not recognise that. But $29 million over the next four years for an Immunise Australia program, including $15.6 million for hepatitis B vaccine for schoolchildren, will get Australia's immunisation rates up to Western standards. By increasing funding to local councils for immunisation clinics, Bundaberg has already seen an increase in immunisation rates. Rural areas in my electorate are typical of many in Australia, and I like to think that all areas&mdash;whether they are small or large&mdash;can have access to health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to the need for the extra $15 million which has been promised for obstetric services in rural areas. It is quite often the case that people in rural hospitals have to come into provincial cities, because they cannot be sure that the appropriate medical attention will always be available. Also, where there are great difficulties, it is pleasing to know that not only will that money encourage obstetric services in some of the larger provisional areas but it will also give the opportunity to transfer difficult cases to the capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hinkler region, like many others, is suffering from a critical shortage of Australian doctors, and I applaud the $17.4 million provision for rural health services. This will be vital in growing communities like mine, where care is needed. The upgrading of hospitals, accommodation for doctors and nurses, clinics and incentives for specialists to come to the bush are also important aspects of this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like at this point to take issue with my colleague the member for Port Adelaide on the matter of pharmacy. Pharmacy is a very difficult area, as the previous government found, and as the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) highlighted in question time last week, when he pointed out all the drugs that the previous government was forced to take off the free list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been proposed in the current budget are two things. One is that certain drugs that can be bought over the counter reasonably inexpensively, in the range of about $2.30 up to about $9&mdash;things like antispasmodics, anti&hyphen;diarrhoea mixtures, anti&hyphen;inflammatories and antifungals, which people can reasonably buy&mdash;should be taken off the free list. Rather than criticise this, I think it would be better to put a proposal&mdash;and I plan to do this some time in the near future&mdash;to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that, where those pharmacy type lines are bought by people, they should be able to be added with prescriptions and hospital charges to your tax regime. At least that would ameliorate some of the cost for people who have to use, say, an antifungal or an antispasmodic on a regular basis, albeit that they may now buy it over the counter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is important about this is that the national pharmacy charge is increasing by a rate of 15 per cent a year in a climate where inflation is running at one or two per cent. I do not care what side of politics we are on: we cannot allow that to happen. We would exacerbate the health crisis if we were so irresponsible as to allow that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other measure, and I suppose in some cases it will not be terribly palatable, is that where there are a series of drugs with the same chemical composition, the least expensive one will be covered by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If the patient or the doctor insists on another brand, you will pay the difference. The difference on average will be about $2. I do not think they are big things to ask to keep Australia's health program alive and well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5167">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to my theme of provincial cities and country towns, I would like to commend the government for credit here. I have seen a lot of banks close and a lot of innovative councils buy those banks and invite credit unions to come and take them up. That is a very good move and I applaud having another $2.8 million to assist programs like that. It is very important in my area. I have at least two communities that have lost all their banking over the last three or four years. This will go some way to encouraging better services for communities like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy is still a very difficult issue in my electorate. It is difficult for people on the land. The new program does not sit comfortably with certain families. I find that distressing. It is also so for people in small business. The spending test does not always catch the people that we want to get and sometimes I find it imposes a heavy strain on those families that really have no income, especially people from farms. I do not know how it happens, but when you take in the spending test with all its complexities, sometimes they seem to go over the limit and lose their Austudy. This will not correct the whole scene, but doubling the allowance for the second child and adding another $3,700 to the means test for other children will mean that a lot more people will have access to Austudy. I find that a very good move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to speak now about small business because this is one area that has needed a lot of attention. I commend the government for a number of measures, including previously dropping the uplift factor from eight per cent down to six per cent for small business. In the new budget, the withholding obligations for those with a PAYE tax bill of $25,000 or less being able to be paid on a three&hyphen;monthly basis rather than a monthly basis will greatly simplify matters for small business. There are also the exemptions from fringe benefits tax, where they click across at about the same numbers each year, on car parking. I commend all those measures for those little nitpicking things that have made life intolerable for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings rebate scheme, which the member for Port Adelaide had a bit of a dig at, will also be very important to small business in savings that occur outside such matters as wages and so on. That will be a great tax saving for small businesses. It will also mean that family trusts, where the members of the family are beneficiaries, will not be caught up in any new regulations. There is a $130 million small business innovation program, and that will be good for my electorate as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, the extension of drought aid was announced. I played a part in that and I am delighted that I did. It will be very important for the Isis, Kolan, Perry shires and the city of Bundaberg in my electorate. It will mean that the benefits that close down on 10 June this year will have a three&hyphen;month extension. In that three months, the new integrated rural policy package will cut in. There was a bit of a hiatus between the end of the old program and the new one, in respect of those areas that were already in drought. The continuation of the drought exceptional circumstances classification will be extended for the Banana, Calliope, Eidsvold, Isisford, Miriam Vale, Monto, Mundubbera and Nebo shires, some of which are in my electorate. That is recognition by the government that the drought is not over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes remaining to me, I would like to talk about a number of initiatives. The integrated rural policy package that I talked about before will deliver $190 million for such matters as rural adjustment and better planning in farm debt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98, I think that some reflection is appropriate to fully understand the impact of this budget on my electorate of Namadgi and on the ACT. It is a matter of record that this government promised to govern for all Australians. It is a matter of record that early warnings were given throughout all of last year&mdash;and, I would be so bold as to say, throughout the election campaign as well, and again this year&mdash;that this government's policies were having a dramatic, unacceptable and intolerable effect on this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the debate on the appropriation bills last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a great noise about what he would do for `Mr and Mrs Namadgi', as he termed them. But what last year's budget and now this year's budget, compounding, have really produced is an attack on the greatest proportion of my community. As a result of the actions of this government, confidence in this city is so low as to be alarming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government puts itself up as a supporter of small business. Let's talk about small business in my constituency. The recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Index</EMPHASIS> says it all. Dr John Marsden, the economic adviser to that index, said, `Frankly, we have never seen confidence levels as low as they now are in the ACT.' That is a pretty damning quote. I consistently have many business people come and tell me of the difficulties they are facing in continuing to hold their business together. In fact, in all cases that I am referring to, we are talking about family businesses&mdash;small enterprises. Unfortunately, this uncertainty and low confidence is being exacerbated by the actions of the local Liberal government. They continue to jump from decision to decision, with certainty the last thing in their minds&mdash;and that is the last thing we need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us hope we see the adoption of the government majority report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> as soon as possible. Each day that passes is a day of difficulty and anxiety for these people. The Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) should also be debated and adopted immediately. These are the sorts of things that we need in order to give some relief to small business in this electorate. This budget has seen disastrous decisions for the ACT&mdash;for example, selling off government&hyphen;owned buildings. In the budget, it was announced that 11 major buildings in this town would be sold&mdash;and this at a time, I might add, when commercial tenancy levels are sitting at around 10 per cent, and when some of the 11 to be sold are described in the sale prospectus as largely vacant or with a vacant area of 20 per cent, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who on earth is going to be able to buy these buildings with a lease future in such doubt? One suggestion has been that the government could undertake to lease them back partly empty to ensure a lease future for the purchaser. But what a waste! Some people may make a bit of a profit in the manoeuvre of selling these buildings, but I can tell you one thing: in my electorate, my families see it as nothing other than another blow to government confidence in this town.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5169">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about employment. It was notable on the night of the delivery of the budget how much the Treasurer (Mr Costello) did not in fact want to speak about employment; but I do. Our youth unemployment levels have been too high for too long; in fact, they have reached as high as 50 per cent. They are down from that now, but they are still above 30 per cent. Our general unemployment levels in Canberra are also too high. Like other communities around this country, we are desperately looking for ways to replace our shrinking industry. The industry which has primarily been shrinking here is the public sector. Historically, the public sector is why Canberra is here. But all of the other sectors in our community are now suffering from that retraction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Newcastles and the Geelongs all have legitimate concerns about their futures, and I support them totally; but so does this town. Some people have been heard to say, `It's about time you in Canberra knew what it was like to feel tough times!' I constantly hear stupid, insulting remarks from individuals on the other side of this place who enjoy having a shot at Canberra&mdash;and they are pretty cheap shots, at that&mdash;and it is really remarkable, because they are from people who have worked so hard to get to Canberra! Those people need to keep in mind, when they feel gratified in making such silly remarks and go back to their own constituencies and boast about it, that it is Australian families that they are attacking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you promise to govern for all Australians, you cannot get away with that attitude, and we will constantly remind you of that. Canberra has suffered under past attacks and I recall&mdash;unfortunately, very well&mdash;the Lynch razor gang. That was pretty infamous. But we got over that and, despite the efforts of those opposite and many others, we will get over this time as well. But we need opportunities. We will happily become more diverse in our employment base. In fact, that has already started; it started some years ago. But we must have the circumstances and the conditions to allow that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Museum project is one way towards that&mdash;a decision out of the budget which I welcome. But it can only be of benefit to our community if our community has a role in it. Our ACT construction industry workers want to build that project. They do not want to sit and watch others come in from other parts of the country and build it in front of them. We must have a method. It is absolutely paramount for the future economic viability of Canberra that the National Museum project right now is packaged in such a way that our local construction industry and our local economy generally have an ability to tender and compete in a fair manner. They are not asking for handouts; they do not want this project given to them on a silver platter. What they want is a fair way of competing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already seen the first major contract for that project, the project management first phase contract, go to a company from interstate. We have already seen trucks, much to the derision of many in this town on the Liberal side of politics, sitting protesting on that Acton Peninsula, as they watched trucks from interstate come in and move rubble from the site ready for construction. They have my absolute support for holding that demonstration. We have got to somehow show those in power that this town really does need the work that will flow on from the National Museum project. It is absolutely essential; I cannot put enough emphasis on it. It is incumbent upon the government, both local and federal, to ensure that that project is managed in such a way that the ACT construction industry has a fair and equal way of competing for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at a few other decisions that have been contained in this budget. The much mooted savings plan is fine for those who are in a position to benefit from it, but hardly a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5170"> thing goes into the pockets of my constituency, the struggling families out there now losing their jobs or having already lost their jobs. The taxpayers who have no interest income to declare, the taxpayers on below average weekly earnings who do not receive any interest, the full rate age and service pensioners and the unemployed&mdash;none of those people benefit from that at all, so let us not tout it around as the saviour to the whole of the community. It is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new drugs tax basically removes $600 million out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Might I add that the PBS is the envy of most countries in this world for the way that it has been developed and run over the years, giving access and equity to so many people for pharmaceutical products. The government is now only going to provide a full subsidy for the cheapest drug in each of the six groups that they have listed, treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers and depression. If you want to get a better drug you will have to pay for it. The point is most people will not be in a position to do that. The president of the AMA, Dr Keith Woollard, has said that although separate medications within the six nominated classes had a similar therapeutic effect, they could have different side effects which made them less appropriate for some patients. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lumped them together as drugs having basically identical actions, but in fact they don't.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We really need to think a little bit more carefully about what we are in fact starting to do to the PBS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of concern to me and to many of my colleagues is the question of child care. Last year's budget cut $500 million&mdash;half a billion dollars&mdash;out of child care. This year's budget cuts an additional $321 million. What on earth is happening? In my electorate the childcare sector is desperate. They are having to increase fees, compromise their standards or consider closure. I would like to make a note here for the benefit of members. All of the players in the child&hyphen;care sector are sharing the concern in this. The private centres, the community based centres, the out&hyphen;of&hyphen;school care, the holiday care, the family day care, who have in fact survived budget cuts to date, and the occasional care are united as one in their total opposition to the way this government is approaching the provision of child care. Families are increasingly under pressure; they are being forced into making decisions they have never wanted to make. In my electorate they lose their job so they do not need child&hyphen;care, therefore the child&hyphen;care centre is immediately under pressure for numbers. Or they have a job but they cannot afford the increased fees. Again the child&hyphen;care centre is under pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of reasons why parents and families may access non&hyphen;work&hyphen;related care exist, but now there is a weekly limit placed on that and therefore there is this assumption that for some reason you can control the reasons why people may need to access non&hyphen;work&hyphen;related care. I can think of many very legitimate reasons why families need to access non&hyphen;work&hyphen;related care without any cap being put on it whatsoever. Child care is all about options, so that whatever your circumstances, should you have a need to access child care you can do so in a flexible, diverse and affordable system, with high standards, qualified staff and the care of children the paramount purpose. Our families are losing out but most importantly, our children will be the losers should these sorts of decisions be allowed to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I represent a constituency which happens to form part of the ACT&mdash;Canberra, the national capital. As I said in my inaugural speech, the people who have chosen to make this their home&mdash;and in most instances that is the case; they have chosen to come here&mdash;should not ever
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5171"> have to apologise for the fact that they live here. When Australian tourists from other cities and states come to Canberra, many come with a view, perpetuated through the media or through politicians opposite, that `Canberra did this to you' or `Canberra did that to you'. They come here bringing that sort of view with them, that this is a cold place&mdash;not just in winter, but in other ways&mdash;full of well&hyphen;off, well&hyphen;paid public servants and with a few national buildings that might be worth a bit of a look on the way from A and B to get to Grandma's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our tourist surveys show that, without any doubt, the overwhelming majority of people who visit here, whether they come with that opinion or not, leave with a quite different one. When they come here they visit this building and they leave with a pride in this building. They visit this city and they leave with a pride in this city as their national capital. They understand and recognise the role of this city and the role of this territory. When this Prime Minister makes budget decisions that attack this community, when members opposite go off making derisive comments about this community, when this Prime Minister decides not to live in the Lodge, these are all attacks not only on this community but on the role of the national capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is very puzzling to me. Prime Minister Menzies, who is held up as a bit of an icon to many of those opposite&mdash;particularly our current Prime Minister&mdash;was in fact the Prime Minister who recognised the relevance of the national capital and who did so much to ensure its future. What he did not know that he had to factor in was the treachery of the current Prime Minister towards the future of this city. The continuing attacks on the public sector, the continuing attacks on the public service, the continuing uncertainty and the increasing lack of confidence are all eating away at this community. Our families, our young people, our businesses, the people who have invested their money in businesses in this community, our community organisations&mdash;all the people who make up the fabric of our community&mdash;deserve better. They deserve job security, a vision for our future, and a confidence that there is a reason for people to continue to have a future in our national capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not just talking about Canberra here; we are talking about the region. I had an interesting experience yesterday morning when I was listening to ABC radio and heard interviewed, successively, three gentlemen who are local shire presidents or, in one case I think, a mayor, of areas that surround the ACT. They were uniform in one thing, that the effect of the government decisions on Canberra was rippling strongly through this region and that the government would continue to do that in those regions at its peril. We do not hold any of those seats, I might add. But I will tell you what: continue these sorts of decisions and we jolly well will. People are not going to take that sort of attitude being shown to this city and this region; they are not going to sit down and not do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I talk about the fabric of our community, the condition of that fabric really reflects the health of our community. Let me say very clearly: that fabric is starting to look pretty frayed at the edges in this town. The community organisations and the very community structure that exist in a city like this&mdash;and in other places as well&mdash;comes from the community. You start to attack that, you start to de&hyphen;fund it, you start to attend to it in a cursory fashion and what you are doing is attacking the very health of that community. Here in Canberra we have reached that point. It is absolutely essential that this government immediately gets rid of this attitude of derision and contempt towards the ACT and the people who live in it. As I said at the outset, none of them need apologise for living here&mdash;that should not have to be their burden. The role of the national capital is essential to this nation and has to be recognised.</PARA>

My message to the Prime Minister is very clear: you have done so much to bad effect to this town, none of it deserved at all, and it is about time you woke up to yourself and treated this place the way you promised to treat everywhere else&mdash;to govern for all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 is before the House, and I welcome the opportunity to speak on what was a very good budget. It must be remembered that, when the coalition came to office over 14 months ago, we had the excesses of the former government portrayed very clearly in the $10,000 million black hole in the budget. The coalition was unaware of this figure. The previous government was aware of it, but they did not disclose those figures during the 1996 election campaign. They certainly did not disclose the full details of this country's indebtedness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to be able to speak on this because the coalition has taken the necessary measures to reduce the deficit. They have done that in this year's budget with no increase in debt, no increase in tax, and we are now heading towards a small surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was intrigued by the contribution from the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis). She spent 15 minutes making a contribution towards families, and I applaud her for her concern. She then spent five minutes attacking the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for giving consideration to his own family. I felt that the honourable member for Namadgi let herself down in her contribution on the budget speech in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly wanted to address the regional Australian implications which were contained in this budget. It was an excellent budget for regional Australia. The Commonwealth is going to make major contributions into regional areas in Australia, including spending more than $800 million on construction and maintenance of national highways and roads of national importance. I will come back to the roads of national importance later in my contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, more than 90 per cent of the available funds will be spent on rural roads throughout Australia. This will be of great benefit to regional Australia not only for improving the road network but also in contributing to the number of jobs that will be a result of that major construction on roads and highways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also introduced the biggest natural resources program ever in the history of Australia, the Natural Heritage Trust, which will see $1.25 billion being spent on an integrated and long&hyphen;term strategy for the sustainable management of Australia's land, water, native vegetation and biodiversity. This is a major contribution to the area of central Victoria and the electorate of Bendigo which I have the privilege to represent. We have got some major issues which need to be addressed in that area, particularly in the management of land and water. The quality of water and the management of catchments within what is part of the Murray&hyphen;Darling river system is always a critical issue for the Bendigo electorate. We have two northern flowing rivers, the Loddon and Campaspe, which both flow into the Murray system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional telecommunications infrastructure fund was also a significant boost for country and rural Australia, with an allocation of a substantial amount of money which will give people living in the regions across Australia high quality telecommunications facilities and services that people in metropolitan areas currently take for granted and have had for many years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5173">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many parts of my electorate there have been small country and rural exchanges which monitor and process the calls, but the constituents never knew how much those calls were costing because they did not receive itemised phone accounts. I am pleased to say that, through negotiations by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and Telstra, that program has been advanced. By the end of 1998, many of those small exchanges throughout my electorate will have itemised billing and have all the state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art technology facilities available to the constituents in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of a dedicated assistance to depressed regions program in the budget was important. As people in this chamber would recognise, some parts of Victoria and some other parts of Australia are still experiencing drought conditions. I know the weather factor does have an enormous impact on my electorate. We went through a period of drought and it certainly does have a terrible impact on the residents of the area. I am pleased to see that the assistance package to depressed regions will take those factors into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to Austudy in the budget will provide more education assistance to regional and rural families. Families with students who need to study away from home will be major beneficiaries. That is important for country people. An increase in the income disregard for families with more than two tertiary students living away from home will mean that students from the regions currently receiving Austudy may receive up to $925 a year more. That is a very welcome initiative, particularly in the electorate of Bendigo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new business plan for Australian agriculture is going to be developed to place the industry on a sustainable footing. My congratulations to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who is doing an excellent job in that portfolio. A national planning system for the Commonwealth child&hyphen;care program ensures that services are established in the areas of need. An additional 2,500 family day care places will be provided in the period 1997&hyphen;98 to 2000&hyphen;01.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency is a new initiative by the government to implement a one&hyphen;stop shop in the delivery of services, and that is currently being implemented. It commenced on Monday of this week in the city of Bendigo and I understand that it is providing a more convenient way for people to access the services of both the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch briefly on local government, because we made a substantial contribution to local government over the last two budgets. In this year's budget the estimated financial assistance grants for local government will be $1.205 billion. Funding to local government through those grants has increased by $40 million over the two budgets handed down by the Howard government. That is a total increase of 3&half; per cent from the last Labor budget, in 1995&hyphen;96. So local government are in a better position following the increases in financial assistance grants, which they certainly welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional Australia aspects that I have touched on are very important, and none is more important than transport, which is a major issue for everyone in a rural area. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), has indicated a total allocation of $1.606 billion for roads in 1997&hyphen;98. As I said earlier, 90 per cent of that Commonwealth spending on roads will be allocated outside of capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to mention one program. At the initiation of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, a roads of national importance category was introduced. Some $112 million has been allocated to this program. One of the roads in that category&mdash;and one
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5174"> which affects residents of my electorate&mdash;is the Calder Highway in Victoria. The minister recognised the need to upgrade the Calder Highway to a road of national importance. It is now attracting more money. A substantial amount of money was put into the Calder Highway to take it up to a dual&hyphen;carriageway, four&hyphen;lane highway. That is going along very well at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, we could always do with a few more dollars. I put in my bid regularly to the minister to ensure that that road of national importance attracts additional funding, because it is particularly important for trade and commerce. It is also the outlet for the whole of the northern Victorian area&mdash;the Sunraysia area&mdash;for carriage of goods to the markets, shipping ports and airports, and it is very important for the carriage of primary produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The road safety accident black spots program was abolished by the previous government. Members of that government should hang their heads in shame for abolishing that program. It took a coalition government initiative to reintroduce it. It is very important to road safety. It is a $149 million program over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate has already been the beneficiary of much needed funds for some of the black spots areas, where there has been a high level of accidents. We received over $1 million for improvements to those areas, some of which have already been carried out. The bulk of those programs will be completed by the end of June. They are certainly important in terms of employment because of the construction period, the changes that have been made and the implementation of those programs in the Bendigo electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to primary industry, which is important to Australia, both domestically and for export markets. The process of sustainable resource management in primary industries introduced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is receiving a great deal of commendation from industry leaders in the primary industry sector. He certainly is making a very strong impression, both here and overseas, on our markets. The need for sustainable resource management is being addressed comprehensively by the Commonwealth and a record total funding of $166.5 million has been made available for 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also compliment the minister on his very quick action when there was a suspicion that fire blight was in the central Victorian area. Members would be aware that a substantial fruit industry exists in my electorate, and close to my electorate in the seat of Murray. I commend the speedy action taken by Minister Anderson to address this question. He got experts from both state and federal resources to swing into action, and to clear, in particular, the Harcourt area, which is world renowned for its apple quality, of any presence of fire blight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the communications area, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, announced a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. The $50 million allocated in this budget, and the progress of that rural and regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to improve regional and rural telecommunications infrastructure, is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days, it does not matter where you are in the world, you can run your activities, your business and your home, provided you have access to the latest services and good communications. It is very important for rural and regional Australia. A total of $250 million over five years has been allocated to this program. Already we are seeing the benefits of it in my area with the upgrading of rural exchanges and local exchanges so that modern facilities can be hooked up to the phone system and a whole range of services can be delivered at that point.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5175">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has done extremely well with this initiative. It has been welcomed by many people throughout the electorate that I represent. It also helps in the furtherance of mobile phone coverage. Recently, we have seen an expansion of that through Heathcote and Castlemaine&mdash;two areas which had poor reception. That is now being upgraded and the mobile phone network will be improved to both of those districts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter I would like to mention is overseas aid. Australia has always played a very strong role in overseas aid. The budget has been very supportive, particularly of food aid. Many of the volunteers from my area who go on overseas aid programs welcomed Australia's contribution to the increase in food aid. Australia's international aid obligations under the Montreal protocol and global environment facility, as well as our obligations to provide 300,000 tonnes of wheat or wheat equivalent as food aid per annum under the food aid convention, will be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is good news for the rural community in terms of their input into that, but also the assistance provided through the AusAID non&hyphen;government cooperation program will be increased by $3 million, or 17 per cent in real terms, and the volunteer programs will continue to be funded at 1996&hyphen;97 levels. As Australia plays an important part in providing aid to a number of countries, this certainly is welcome news in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to touch briefly on the education side of the budget. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is doing an amazing job pulling back some of the problems that the previous government left. Australia's 10,000 schools will receive an extra $152 million from the federal government in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget. The schools budget has increased by 4 per cent, from $3.6 billion in 1996&hyphen;97 to $3.75 billion in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997&hyphen;98 funding package features $560 million for special programs, including $160 million for literacy, $156 million for students with special learning needs, and $54 million for languages. An extra $7 million has been earmarked for Australia's new national literacy and numeracy plan. This was agreed to by federal, state and territory education ministers in March of this year. That is all welcome news in the education field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has introduced a number of initiatives, including funding for new apprenticeships. That was an area that was terribly neglected by the previous government. We will be providing $265 million for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997&hyphen;98. Already, many young people have been taken on as apprentices in my area. I commend the employers for taking those young people on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have liked to speak for a lot longer on this topic. Overall, the budget has been welcomed by the Australian community. We are still repairing the damage that was left to us by the previews government, and no doubt there is still a little way to go, but we are approaching a situation where the budget processes are improving Australia's economic climate and interest rates are coming down&mdash;I think there have been four interest rate drops in the past 12 months. Obviously, the economy is responding to the positive initiatives of the government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The headline of the business section of that paper says, `R word'&mdash;that is, the recession word&mdash;`is back and Govt blames the dollar.'

As the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Allan Handberg, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is now a genuine concern to us and it should be for the Government. The Government must spell out clearly its vision for Australian manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In another analysis, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  economic commentator said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . important employment generating sectors of retailing and manufacturing, and service industries like health and education, were either in recession or experiencing negligible growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the same article, Mr Richard Gibbs of the Macquarie Bank commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not augur well for employment and that's the rub.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the first sentence under the lead headline of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The manufacturing sector is now officially in recession . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article concluded that the question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . why annual growth had halved from 4.9 per cent when Labor was last in office to 2.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One recalls the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), after he came into office, that this government had inherited an economy which was better than good in parts&mdash;or words to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of my comments this morning are very much directed to the issue of a lack of vision for industry and its interrelationship with the chronic unemployment that we are suffering. My comments will focus on why this government is simply incapable of addressing those problems while it maintains its current philosophical underpinning. That philosophical underpinning is one of classical liberalism. It is perhaps the most economically fundamentalist government in recent Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The philosophy of the classical liberal economists is that anything emanating from government is bad; government has to make a flawed, irrational or illogical decision and, therefore, the appropriate role for government is to contract government to get government out of the way and let the free market forces take over the show. Apparently, these free market forces have the ability to generate some miraculous cures and miraculous phenomena. All that is needed, according to the classic liberals, is to let the free market have its rein. But it leads to what I have called the doctrine of calculated neglect. While the government maintains its allegiance to that doctrine, it is incapable of backing Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, if everyone is honest with themselves, they will realise the manufacturing sector is the only sector that is going to generate sufficient jobs to eat into Australia's unemployment. Indeed, the government, when in opposition, realised that with their promise of 200,000 jobs by the year 2000 in the manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What has happened? There is evidence that the government is prepared to trade off tariffs on Australian manufactured goods for reductions in foreign tariffs on primary goods. While it is appropriate for government to enter into negotiations about tariff reductions and mutuality, as a result of the influence of the National Party, their thrust is all one way and they are turning their backs on and ignoring the manufacturing sector. We are risking very much a return to the 1950s when we exported our primary products, let the foreign countries value
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5177"> add and we bought back finished products at much higher prices after labourers in other countries had obtained the benefit of using their skills to value add to our primary products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their obsession to remove the impurities from the free market, the government has cut back industry assistance from $561 million to $146 million over the next four years. Assistance to exporters is down $26 million in the same period. Last year's budget took $400 million away from exporters and exports fell from 11 per cent to seven per cent, and it actually made a negative contribution to growth. Now, we are facing a situation where foreign debt, under the Liberals in just one year, has exceeded that for two years under Labor. One recalls the great play they made of the issue of foreign debt during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to removing assistance, they have come around and they have hit Australian exporters with higher charges. There will be an additional $14.4 million imposed for Australian businesses wanting to use the services of Austrade and they have brought forward the recovery of the export facilitation loans by $9 million over the next four years. In terms of export promotion, the government has literally vacated the field. They have abandoned the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference and they have virtually withdrawn from all major expositions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked a series of questions on notice to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). In question No. 618 I asked, `Where and when will the next world exposition take place?' The answer was Lisbon, Portugal, in 1998. I asked, `Will Australia be represented at the next expo and, if so, what form will that representation take?' The simple answer was, no. I asked, `What theme will be presented by Australia at the expo and how far have plans developed for Australia's representation?' The reply came back: a simple, `not applicable'. That highlights the attitude of this government's industry policy. It is one which is not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I followed up that question with question No. 1367 to the minister. I asked whether he was able to say how many countries would be represented at the world exposition in Portugal in 1998. If Australia was not to have a presence, why not, and was he able to say whether countries in Australia's region would have a presence at Lisbon and, if so, which countries? The reply came back that he understood that 100 countries had agreed to participate and that Australia's decision not to participate was one taken on economic grounds in light of fiscal targets. In terms of which countries from our region would be attending, his astonishing reply was: `I have no knowledge of which countries may have agreed to participate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision not to participate in the Lisbon expo was taken in circumstances where the minister had no information as to which countries were going to participate and, specifically, which countries from our region. That just shows you how lacking this minister is in terms of promoting Australian products, as compared with competitors in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked the minister a further question. In question No. 1366, I asked,`Is a world exposition to be held at Hamburg, Germany, in the year 2000?' He corrected me and said, `No. Expo 2000 will be in Hanover, Germany.' I also asked him whether Australia would participate in that exposition and he said, no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at a situation where we are coming up to perhaps the most significant event in Australia's modern history, the year 2000 Olympics. Two years before that at Lisbon, we had the opportunity to expose ourselves to the rest of the world to promote tourism and the government ignored that opportunity. The answer came back in terms of what we would be demonstrating and portraying Australia as&mdash;`not applicable'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5178">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at the year 2000 exposition in Hanover, perhaps one of the greatest events for the turn of the century, aside from the Olympics, when there inevitably is going to be great interest and Australia is not on the field&mdash;not even got its boots on. How is Australia going to kick any goals? It will not. There is a lesson that any politician can tell this minister: out of sight and out of mind. If you are not seen, you are not considered and people ignore you. That is what is going to happen to Australia as a result of the complete absence of any vision or any promotion of the interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the proof of the pie is in the eating is very much an old cliche, but Australians have had the opportunity to taste the pie of this government and they have found they are only eating pastry. It is one without any substance. Most thinking, successful and dynamic Australians are bored, if not disillusioned, with this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aside from export promotion, the government has abolished industry assistance programs. There has been no reversal of last year's policy to take $2.9 million from programs. It slashed research and development. It has abolished the DIFF scheme and it has removed bounties in a number of new and growing industries: ship building, computers, books, tool making and robotics&mdash;all industries in their embryonic stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of protecting our Australian industry, this government has indicated it is prepared to unilaterally disarm Australia's car industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industry. Rather than putting a pause on tariff reductions until our competitors match the goodwill that we have demonstrated, the government looks like it is going to go even further ahead of the pack. As a result of their efforts, it looks like our very important car industry and indeed the textile, clothing and footwear industry may be in real trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is suggesting there may be some compromise, there would be no member on the other side of the House who would not believe that the Treasury line is going to prevail in cabinet and these supposed impediments to the free market operating, the Treasury will say, have to be removed. Australians already know what the outcome will be and our industry is going to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), referred to the quote where Gough Whitlam said, `The impotent are pure'. While this government is pure in adhering to its economic fundamentalism, it is also very much an impotent government. Its obsession with academic theories is precluding it from properly addressing the reality of what Australia faces in this very competitive world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, not only for subjective reasons but objectively, predict if this government continues down the line it is going, it is going to be a very short-lived government indeed. For instance, an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 3 June 1997 showed that Australians are willing to sacrifice cheaper cars and clothes in order to secure Australian industry and the accompanying jobs. The reference was to the AGB McNair survey of 1,000 voters and that showed that 92 per cent of voters voiced their support for maintaining an Australian car industry. Australians certainly are not economic fundamentalists; on the whole they are realists. They are usually balanced and thoughtful people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another good indication of the mood of the electorate is in a speech given by Rod Cameron, the managing director of ANOP Research Services to the Minerals Council of Australia at a seminar on 29 May 1997. Mr Cameron predicted as a result of his research that aspects of industry policy will dominate political debate in this country in the foreseeable future. The government has already lost that debate, it has no industry policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5179">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the concerns that are being reflected in the electorate, he said in respect to the BHP announced closure of its Newcastle steelworks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps no single announcement by a company in recent years has had a greater unsettling impact on ordinary Australians than this one has.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In terms of the decline of manufacturing industry, Mr Cameron said that there is real concern about the absence of jobs for apprentices, and the recent termination of apprentices by Qantas had demonstrated that. Further on he said there is a:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">worry about an over reliance on imported products</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Toss in headlines about the balance of payments and you have quite considerable concern about the growing absence of Australian made goods and produce.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">these individual triggers are combining to create a state of mind in Australians that is far from relaxed and comfortable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the catchcry used by the Prime Minister before the last election. Mr Cameron continued by saying there is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an emerging frustration that government cannot see the sense of supporting and encouraging Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said that there is a gloom about an Australia on the verge of returning to being an export quarry rather than value adding to our own resources. He concluded with these prophetic words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians are demanding that their leaders produce a plan&mdash;a plan for industry&mdash;that shows them how jobs will be created. . . </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sooner rather than later this government will realise that it must turn its mind to industry policy . . . The only alternative to doing so is substantially to decrease the time before this government is voted out to be replaced by one which does see a role for governments in interfering with the free market in an effort to recreate industrial growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reality is the government has no industry policy. It cannot address the concerns that are being voiced by Australians. These are real concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the insecurity that is currently being felt, unemployment programs have been slashed. Between March and April this year, 16,200 people joined the ranks of the long-term unemployed. That is 40,000 people since this government came to power. An amount of $14.3 million has been cut from vocational and industry training, $70 million cut from education training grants to the states, and that is on top of of $183 million cut in last year's budget. Traineeships have reduced in growth from 117 per cent to 68 per cent under this government, almost halving, despite the rhetoric of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my region, unemployment has increased by 2.2 per cent in the last 12 months. It is the greatest increase in the Sydney region. In one area where I have a significant migrant population, the rate is currently 8.1 per cent. Clearly, the Australian public expects governments to play a positive role in addressing these problems. This government's obsession with reducing the size of government in the hope that market forces will miraculously stimulate industry and give jobs to Australians is nothing more than ideological bloody mindedness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a government which is prepared to reintroduce direct, targeted unemployment programs, one that has a vision for industry and one which assists our traders to export Australian products. This government is none of those things. The current Liberal&hyphen;National
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5180"> Party government is incapable of achieving those essential requirements. Australians will find that the only useful purpose the leadership of this current government has is to retreat to the environs of academia and lecture about the bygone days of classical, liberal, economic theory, but it is their very obsession with that philosophy that is preventing them from solving Australia's problems.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate and pleased to have this opportunity to follow the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), who is noted as an intelligent and articulate member of the parliament, but who has just espoused a great deal of nonsense, as he knows. He cannot possibly expect me to rise following his speech without responding to some of that nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Barton suggests, quoting the guru of the ALP, Gough Whitlam, that there is something impotent about this government&mdash;which at this stage is largely following, in tariff terms, the very policies his party put in place. Does he really expect me to swallow that sort of argument and not respond? Here we are, pursuing the elusive level playing field&mdash;the very policies that his government pursued as well, policies that we believed were defensible, policies that we could have capitalised on in opposition by saying just the same sorts of things as the member for Barton has chosen to say this afternoon. Because we at least had the electoral stamina not to run down the popular course but the responsible one, we backed his government on tariff reductions. Now he expects us to pursue the same tariff reduction policy in government while he has the luxury of being critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He quoted from a news release which, by the way, I have as well. I presume it is one from the Australian Business Chamber, but it matters not whether it is the same one or not because it is true that a survey undertaken by the chamber discovered that 92 per cent of Australians said they would prefer to forgo cheaper imports&mdash;the very point the member for Barton made&mdash;in favour of protecting Australian industry and jobs. If that is true, if that is what this chamber is to believe, if that is what the member for Barton believes, tell me why it is that every time I step out of this door, or the door of my own home, or my office in my electorate, I am inundated by imported cars? Clearly, Australians are prepared to put one thing on paper and do something else when it comes to delivering the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australians were really prepared to defend Australian industry and to buy Australian made goods, at least in the automotive area, they would be buying the more expensive Australian production which, thanks to the former government, is now at least of equal quality, and in some cases better quality, than the imported product. I concede that; we do have a much better car industry&mdash;that is why we supported you. If Australians were prepared to buy those cars they would  protect Australian jobs. The reality is that they do not really care that much, I am sorry to say. I wish you were right, I wish that survey was right, because if it were I need not worry about protecting Australian jobs. Australian consumers would do it for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not want to spend my entire speech referring to the member for Barton's contribution. I wanted to tell the chamber that in the Andrew house there was a happy event early in the year when my son got married in Brisbane. This may seem somewhat unrelated to the appropriation bill, except that when we returned from this happy event my wife announced to the entire family, me included, something that left us quivering. She said that, having been  through a family wedding where everything had been very happy, she was now going to introduce a family ER policy. The kids knew what she meant and I knew what she meant. She meant we were going to have a little economic rationalism in the Andrew house, because we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5181"> were going to pay off the Bankcard and pay off a few incurred debts before we got back to the normal luxurious lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, on a parliamentary salary, it did not take long to balance the books, but for a while the 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;old was very twitchy about no longer being able to go to the movies when he wanted to. My wife knew what Australians fundamentally know&mdash;that is, if you have spent more than you have earnt, you have to do something about it. The budget we have handed down and that we are dealing with in this appropriation bill is simply a budget of a government that is saying, `We are going to stop spending more than we are earning. We are going to prune our expenditure.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just like the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), the member for Barton and the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), I have had to front nursing homes and child&hyphen;care centres which are not ecstatic about the government pruning their expenditure. But what I can say to them is that we have taken a $10 billion deficit that we did not run up and we have got it to the point where we can confidently predict a surplus in one term. That is responsible economic management. That does something for the national economic outlook. That does something in the long term for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also does something, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated in question time yesterday, for the overseas debt. In spite of what the member for Barton has said&mdash;and he may well be right that the debt is rising&mdash;the government's portion of that debt will be pruned back by this government because we now have the capacity to do so. I have not checked the foreign debt figures and, if you are right, sir, I will gladly concede.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone coming into government, I always thought the foreign debt would rise anyway. How do you have an economic recovery unless people are importing goods in order to be more efficient producers and to generate more exports? It is to be expected that there may be a hiccup upwards in the foreign debt, as part of making a more efficient and export oriented Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Barton was relatively kind to us on the job front, but most of the other speakers from the opposition have been critical of the budget on the grounds that it has done nothing for unemployment. As if we could run around, as they did for at least a decade, creating mickey mouse jobs so people had nothing more than a revolving door, job training program! We are committed to doing something about jobs. The member for Barton, in his speech, would have said, `Hang on. If you are committed to doing something about jobs'&mdash;I do not want to put words into his mouth; he will nod or shake his head if I am misinterpreting him&mdash;`why are you taking this action with the manufacturing industry and with the car industry, action that may in fact put people out of work?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell the chamber what I suspect everyone already knows: tariffs have almost nothing to do with jobs in Australia. Jobs in Australia are disappearing only because of technological advances, not because of tariffs. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that, and the member for Lyne knows it. I can turn around the job market in Australia tomorrow by being a dictator who says to every farmer in the electorate of Wakefield, `Listen, Sam: you are no longer going to hop on your fancy self&hyphen;propelled combine. Instead of that, you are going back to the horse and the plough and the bag,' and of course jobs will be created. I can say to every wine grape  grower, `The harvest you have just taken off with a machine is the last one you will take off with a machine. From now on, you are back to the bucket and the picker and the bin,' and of course I will create jobs. I have no doubt that I can say to the car manufacturing industry
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5182"> the same thing: `Throw away those robots you have modified from Japan and put on more people.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is a farmer or a wine grape grower or a car manufacturer, we all know that they would employ more people and go out of business. What is costing jobs in Australia is technological advance. I regret it, but I cannot stop it happening if I am to be at the cutting edge in a competitive world. Here we are asking how we can keep competitive industry in Australia but keep people employed and, at the same time, keep ourselves as efficient as our competitors are. It is a very difficult balancing act, not solved by running simple arguments about tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) ran a very good illustration of what tariffs do. He said that tariffs are like taking a small town called Morgan and saying to everybody who lives in Morgan, `The local builder is about to leave the town. What I am going to do, as dictator of Morgan, is to say the local builder, "We will make sure no&hyphen;one else comes into this town to build unless they put a 25 per cent impost on their costs. So you cannot come in as a bricklayer to Morgan unless you charge 25 per cent more."' The Morgan builder will say, `Great idea. I'll stay. My children will stay at the school. My wife will still be at the hospital. All will be well.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we all know that, over one year, perhaps nothing will happen. Over five years, suddenly we will discover the local builder does not have to work as hard as he used to because he has got a 25 per cent insulation against competition. Worse than that, over 10 years, suddenly every house in the town&mdash;the parsonage, the school house, and all the rest&mdash;is 25 per cent dearer than it used to be because you have kept the competition at arm's length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we, as parliamentarians, saddled with this tariff argument that the member for Barton has put in more simplistic language than he knows is defensible? Because we know that, while we can protect a local industry, in very short time we effectively put that industry out of business because our competitors are not doing the same thing. That is why the parliament is where it is. That is why the ALP in government advocated lower tariffs. That is why we backed them when they were doing it. That is why in government we have taken up this difficult mantle. If we are to keep Australia efficient, if we are to keep Australia in the export market&mdash;the very thing the member for Barton called for&mdash;we have to be prepared to do what the rest of the world is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can almost hear the arguments from the other side. `That is fine, Neil, but, in fact, the rest of the world is not doing it. There is no level playing field, and we are being very gullible.' And the member for Barton nods his head. But, sir, I am on this course because you put me on it. There is no such thing as a level playing field and there never will be such a thing. What we have achieved and the former government achieved, and we are endeavouring to keep it going, is that for the first time in your life and mine, we have a more level playing field than we have ever had before, because no signatory to the World Trade Agreement is able to be a signatory unless that country has agreed to lowering their tariff barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy to say, and my electorate is crying out for me to say, `Let's have a pause until they catch us up.' Delightfully simplistic, very saleable! But here I am, an Australian federal parliamentarian, and my country, with the best will in the world, cannot generate two per cent  of world trade. I am not the tail on the end of the world trade dog; I am the flea on the end of the tail of the world trade dog.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5183">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has no leverage at all in world trade terms. You know it and I know it. We are obliged to do what the World Trade Organisation allows us to do. Passionately, we may put our case in the World Trade Organisation, as your trade minister did and as ours does. But to pretend that we can say to 98 per cent of the world `Hang about; we're going to set the terms' is nonsense. It is nonsense to pretend that we can say to them `Hang about; we'll have a pause and wait for you to catch up.' They will say, `Get lost; we will promptly put our barriers up against whatever you're offering us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I feel some passion about this? Because, unlike most other members of this parliament&mdash;maybe not all, but certainly most&mdash;I am someone whose annual return is directly affected by tariffs. Most of you know that I am in the citrus industry. I am insulated from it, thankfully, by a parliamentary salary. The input of Brazilian concentrated orange juice directly affects the productivity of my property. The people in the area that I represent want me to stand up and say, `Let's have a bigger tariff barrier against Brazilian imports.' But they fail to recognise that, as a result of being signatories to the World Trade Organisation, my Riverland citrus growers now enjoy access to markets that were closed to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What am I going to do? Put at risk that market access; put at risk that opportunity to earn export dollars for Australia by locking out cheaper Brazilian imports! It sounds simplistic but, of course, it would be ultimately to the nation's detriment. That is why it is so much nonsense to run the present car tariff argument. That is why the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> ought to be hung, drawn and quartered for the nonsense they have been running in my state about car tariffs. They have been running simplistic drivel that you would expect from people who are ill&hyphen;informed about tariffs, but not from the sole newspaper in a state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the reality? The reality is that we are on the car tariff carriage that the ALP set up, and it was always due to run to 15 per cent. The question is not what happens to the 15 per cent&mdash;because, frankly, it is neither here nor there. The question is what do we do about encouraging that market, that industry, to be competitive to continue to make a real contribution to manufacturing exports by keeping it at the cutting edge of world efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have a simplistic answer to that. I do not even have a complicated one because I am not in the car industry. But I do know this. I know that the export facilitation program gave the car industry the opportunity to be an exporter for the first time and that it now exports something like 60,000 units. If I can get that to something like 100,000 units, I have kept that industry in Australia and all of that has got very little to do with the last 15 per cent of tariff protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is time that, as a parliament, we stood up and spoke with one voice about tariffs, because what you were advocating and what we are advocating is precisely the same thing. If the ALP had still been in government, they would have faced just the same difficult decision over the degree to which we manipulate the remaining segment of car tariffs&mdash;little as it is&mdash;and retain our opportunity to be seen as serious players in the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is currently going through is this difficult balancing act between keeping the car industry efficient and keeping our obligations to the WTO. Under world trade and under market access, we have enjoyed an opportunity to put a whole lot of Australian goods, not just primary, manufactured as well, in markets that were closed to us. People have the view that we are the only ones with an open market system. It is nonsense. What is the tariff on Australian automobiles going into Japan? Zero.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I freely concede that it is quotaed&mdash;but it is zero. There is a real step forward because, under you, we achieved a zero tariff with a quotaed arrangement and the opportunity to negotiate those quotas. Japan, previously the most protected market in world terms, is now in a situation where it takes Australian rice, citrus and wheat. Would you have us put all of those advantages at risk simply by running the populist line currently being peddled by the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  and to a lesser extent by some of my colleagues opposite?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are serious about employment in Australia, the obligation we have is to foster those industries in which we are at cutting edge of the rest of the world. It probably will not be manufacturing thongs or T&hyphen;shirts but it might be manufacturing cars. It will certainly be manufacturing wine. There is a classic illustration of an industry which has now export domination without any protection at all and it is effectively a manufacturing industry, if you look at the degree of value added that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the obligation that we have as a parliament is to identify those industries where we can outperform the rest of the world and get on with encouraging them. This budget, by reducing our deficit, allows us to do just that and, by adhering to the World Trade Organisation, we can ensure that we will not be locked out of markets that were previously closed to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be a part of a government that has had the intestinal fortitude to continue unpopular policies, knowing that they are right, and the tariff industry is a classic one of those. It is time that, as a parliament, we endeavoured to speak with one voice on the question of the access that we need to have to export markets.</PARA>
