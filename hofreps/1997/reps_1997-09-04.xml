<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of infrastructure on the Bradshaw Field Training Area, near Timber Creek, NT.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Department of Defence proposes to develop the Bradshaw Field Training Area to allow company, battalion and brigade sized units to conduct collective and joint training in live fire and manoeuvre activities. This proposal will allow Defence to develop the area to provide long&hyphen;term sustainability and greater training opportunities and ease the environmental pressure on the Mount Bundey training area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal will provide a bridge over the Victoria River in the vicinity of Timber Creek; working accommodation for the range control organisation; living and working accommodation for the range masters; communications facilities; an internal road network; two camps; vehicle crossing points over creeks and rivers; two C130&hyphen;capable airfields; and vehicle wash points. The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost is $53.66 million. It is anticipated that construction will start about now and be completed by the end of the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 28 August 1997, supports the proposal, and its recommendations are consistent with Defence proposed development plans. I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The proposed works are to the roof balustrades for the installation of glass safety barriers to the viewing ports and the curved walls on the roof of Parliament House. Some visitors to Parliament House stand on the edge of these viewing ports. Concern has been expressed that there may be a risk of injury should someone jump or fall from the viewing ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The installation of the glass barriers will prevent people from accessing the ports and, as such, will prevent any accidents.

He has just put that proposition to you. That is clearly outside the definition of relevance to the matter before the chair, namely, the dissent ruling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not moved that the member be not further heard because it is convention in this place that, if people have a dissent from the ruling, they are entitled to put that point of view. But it is also the convention, and required under the standing orders, that your presentation be very tight to the matter before the chair. So we resist and we will continue to raise points of order when the member is beyond the motion of dissent. He is not entitled to use this as a de facto attack on the government, which he is obviously attracted to do, but which he is not able to do under the standing orders.</PARA></INTERJECT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government of course does not want to hear the truth. But let me go to the specific point, Mr Speaker. You have said that this is too long. You further said that the words that are contained in the motion are already in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . Since when is it a ruling of this place that you cannot contain in a motion that which is already on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> ? This is a parliament that operates through two forms: publications and debate. To suggest that you cannot contain in debate what is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  is absolutely ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of length, I thought this issue might have been taken; I am surprised that you took it. But the motion before us today, if I were allowed to complete it, contains 234 words. There have previously 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7797"> been motions which you have not sought to take issue with. A censure motion from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley): 264 words. I did not even get the chance to finish mine, so how you would have known how long it was defies me. There were 264 words in the House of Representatives on Monday, 23 June, page 6049. Count them if you like. I go to 24 June, another motion of censure on the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) by the Leader of the Opposition: 352 words contained in that. Again, on Wednesday, 25 June on the sugar tariff, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), a suspension of standing orders motion: 285 words. Mine is shorter than all those, Mr Speaker, but you would not know that because you did not allow me to put it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When have we ever had a direction from you in this place about the length of a motion to suspend standing orders? When have we had that? That is why I am moving dissent from it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or even a suggestion that they are getting too long? The truth of the matter is this, Mr Speaker&mdash;this is completely pertinent to the point&mdash;if we know, and you know, because it has been the form of this government to gag us on every suspension motion in this place, that that is going to be their step, or at least it is anticipated, surely we have got to have the ability to put as much on the record to state our position as possible because it is the only opportunity we get.</PARA></TALK.START>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, Mr Speaker. I will stay within the confines of the motion. But it strikes me as strange that the reason that we have got this dissent motion against you is not because we believe that for the first time you have imposed something not in the standing orders as to length or to content, nor have you raised it with us on any previous occasion. And this is not the first suspension of standing orders motion that we have raised. In the short space of time available to go through those three examples I have not come to any of the motions that I have moved in this place which have been much longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not take the suspension of standing orders motion issue lightly. We move them on serious issues. If the House is not prepared to give us debate, then we have no option but to resort to the other forms open to us in the standing orders&mdash;not limited by length, not limited by content, not limited by anything in the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are saying today that they are not gagging me in this debate which is against you. What they are gagging is the TCF debate in this House. They are gagging the opportunity for the member for Indi to get up and come and vote with us, to vote for those 2,850 people in his electorate whose livelihoods depend on the textile, clothing and footwear industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Indi goes with them and says, `I support the tariff freeze. I'll put a motion in the House but don't force them to make me vote on it for one moment.' Well, we will force him, because accountability in this place does not just mean our ability to raise issues; it means members who say 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something to their constituency being required to vote and back it in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Indi should be in here today, not only listening to this debate but prepared to have it on. His motion is deficient, because calling for the tariff freeze in the textile, clothing and footwear industry is not enough. We have to also retain the import credits scheme. His motion does not contain that. That is what we are seeking today to have brought on in this place. That is the motion we want the suspension of standing orders for and, unless you put in context, Mr Speaker, the reason we want to add to that motion, unless we are referring to the deficiency by reference to what the motion is that we are seeking to bring on, the addition that we are seeking to have the House consider has less meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of the record, the workers in the TCF industry&mdash;100,000 of them around this country, the ones that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) told us in that old house, looking at his old vision, were much more secure&mdash;are not feeling secure today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. This bill seeks to put in place a permanent exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy student assistance schemes from the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as they relate to marital status. A person who is married is entitled to the independent rate of Austudy, subject to the normal income and assets test and the actual means test, if applicable. Abstudy living allowance, income testing and rent assistance eligibility criteria also come into conflict with the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7806">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an expired provision in the act for a three&hyphen;year exemption for student assistance schemes. This was to allow time for a way to be found to provide assistance to students without discriminating between those who are married and those who are in a de facto relationship. This point is actually very important because, unlike social security payments, where lower rates are often payable to people in married or de facto relationships, the incentive in Austudy is the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If de facto relationships as well as marriage were a sole criterion for receiving the independent rate, there would be a financial incentive for students under 25&mdash;when the independent rate is payable on the basis of age&mdash;to set up such relationships in order to be regarded as independent and free of the parental means test. The incentive is much stronger now following the government's unjustified and unreasonable decision in its first budget to raise the independent age for Austudy payments from 22 to 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech on the bill, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) spoke of the difficulty for scheme administrators in verifying the legitimacy of de facto relationships. The opposition acknowledges this point and, therefore, we await with interest the proposals for verifying the legitimacy of such relationships once the youth allowance is in place and students in de facto relationships of two years or more can qualify for the independent rate on that basis alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the temporary legislative exemption for student assistance schemes in the Sex Discrimination Act had expired, the previous government sought exemption by administrative means through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Such exemptions are granted only for a finite period. When the Labor government's exemption period expired, the new coalition government sought a further exemption, which will now expire on 31 December this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In seeking this further exemption, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the unlovely Senator Vanstone, undertook to provide a report to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, prior to the expiry of the exemption, on long&hyphen;term solutions to address marital status discrimination in student assistance schemes. This report has not been sighted. I understand that it is in preparation, although with no particular haste. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary, in his remarks later, can enlighten the House as to the state of the preparation of the missing report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition finds it extraordinary that the minister would allow this bill&mdash;which makes very clear the direction in which the government is heading on discrimination in Austudy and Abstudy&mdash;to be introduced before she has met her commitment to report to the commission. Senator Vanstone seems to go out of her way to crudely deal with sensitive issues. It is not as if student assistance overall has been treated generously by this government. In its first budget, it launched a half billion dollar attack on Austudy, which included raising the independence age to 25, removing case management and the schooling incidentals allowance for homeless students and extending significantly the actual means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone's administration of the revamped AMT has become infamous not least amongst the coalition backbench&mdash;and, I dare suspect, even her parliamentary secretary&mdash;who have had to face angry, bewildered and frustrated constituents complaining about having to wait for 50 minutes or more on the so&hyphen;called hotline or having to wait for more than three months for a review, or who have simply given up their attempt to study because the minister's incompetence has restricted their access to income support beyond any reasonable point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1997&hyphen;98 budget the government also turned its attention to Abstudy. It announced nearly $40 million in cuts out of what is an annual expenditure of only some $130 million. The government has described these cuts as `better targeting', but if they are about better targeting the funds would surely be redirected, not cut. Worse still, the government has announced a review of Abstudy after the cuts, with a clear instruction that it should not recommend increased expenditure. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7807"> These unjustified cuts are a demonstration of the government's lack of commitment to both indigenous education and student income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the second reading debate on the  Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996  in November of last year, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) spoke of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government's commitment to equal opportunity and the prevention of discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One would not know that the government had made any such commitment to students, given the nature of Senator Vanstone's behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out earlier, the opposition acknowledges the point that has been made by the parliamentary secretary about administrative difficulties. Our concern is about process&mdash;the process of Senator Vanstone bringing this legislation to the parliament prior to the appropriate report being made from the government to the commission and thereby being open to public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes it perfectly clear that the government has decided, irrespective of any report and due process, that the issue of discrimination between married and de facto couples in relation to the student assistance scheme is too hard for it to resolve. It is not interested in the facts. It is not interested in a report. It is not interested in due process. It is just interested in getting this issue off its agenda through a crude and insensitive piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition do not believe that this question should be dealt with in the manner proposed by the bill. We are not prepared to support a permanent exemption for Austudy and Abstudy from the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and, therefore, during the consideration in detail stage of the bill I will be moving an amendment which provides exemption for a three&hyphen;year period only, during which time we would expect&mdash;and I think this entirely reasonable, and the community certainly has a right to this manner of scrutiny and due process&mdash;to see some sort of genuine effort by the government to address this significant issue in the proper way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R238">Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997</XREF>  represents an administrative change which will allow statutory exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes. Since 1994, the federal government has had a problem with applying different tests for individuals, married couples and couples in a de facto relationship because of its breach of the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that under the Austudy scheme single applicants are assessed differently from couples. The parents of individual applicants are means tested to assess their eligibility, while married couples are treated differently. They are treated as being independent, and their parents' income is therefore not taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This different treatment is based on the principles that underpin Commonwealth allowances such as DSS payments and are accepted by both sides of this House. The principles are based on the assumption that a person with a partner has access to the financial means of that partner to meet their combined costs. In contrast, a single person who is independent of parental assistance does not have this opportunity to share costs for accommodation and other living expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, differences in the way Austudy is assessed are found in the way married couples and de facto partners are assessed. Married couples are automatically deemed to be independent in assessing income, but de facto couples are not. If de facto partners were automatically assessed as being independent for Austudy eligibility, it would encourage people as young as 16 to leave home, enter a de facto relationship and receive full independent Austudy, free of parental means testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that breaking up family homes is the type of thing this government, or indeed any government, should be encouraging. I believe there are already too many incentives for parents and children to part company for the sake of collecting an additional social security payment&mdash;although I do recognise that there are times when it is appropriate. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7808">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, this is the reason why the government has announced the common youth allowance, which will encourage young people to stay at school or in training rather than leave home and collect unemployment benefits. This change signals an important shift in the way this government will tackle youth unemployment and better distribute assistance to those people and families who most need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP will stand condemned for opposing the common youth allowance but, given its record of blatant obstructionism during this sitting and throughout the whole year, I will not be surprised when it decides to oppose this important policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the issue of Austudy and Abstudy in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act, it should be noted that in 1994, under the Labor government, a temporary administrative exemption was issued by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. This was followed by the granting of further temporary exemptions, with the current exemption ending on 31 December this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that officers from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs have considered renewing the exemption or finding other non-legislative avenues to comply with the Sex Discrimination Act. However, such options were found to be prohibitively costly, administratively complex, legally flawed and totally against community attitudes; therefore, a statutory measure is required, which is what this bill will provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Sue Walpole, was fully consulted on this issue and that all relevant departments agreed to the permanent exemption, including the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and, most importantly, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides a permanent solution to a long&hyphen;running problem. I congratulate the officers of the various departments who have dedicated their time and resources to what is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a complex problem in need of reform. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It attempts to ensure that every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy. The SDA gives effect to certain provisions of the international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which was ratified by Australia in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997  will provide a permanent exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. Prior to this bill, governments have periodically applied to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for grants of exemptions, for various pieces of legislation, from the operation of the SDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first saw this bill, I could not work out why the government was introducing it. The explanatory memorandum says it will have no financial impact. The bill, by adding an exemption, appears to conflict with the stated intention of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996&mdash;currently before the Senate&mdash;of making laws fairer by removing or limiting exemptions for discrimination. It conflicts with the government's purported view that exemptions to the SDA should be limited and that, where possible, all federal legislation should be consistent with the SDA's objectives. That was in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7809">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also conflicts with the government's stated policy `to introduce positive measures to encourage equal opportunity and to prevent discrimination against individuals'. That is in the coalition's law and justice policy. Further, half the bill will be irrelevant after July 1998 when the controversial proposed youth allowance commences, rendering Austudy obsolete. Finally, the SDA has been around since 1984 and the Student and Youth Assistance Act since 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government has been able to secure exemptions from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for all of these other years, why is it not just getting another six-month exemption this time? What is the difference this time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 exemption of the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status provisions of the SDA was granted on condition that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) gave an undertaking that a report would be made to the HREOC prior to the expiry of the proposed exemption&mdash;that is, 31 December this year&mdash;on long-term solutions to address the marital status discrimination within student assistance schemes, existing and proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DEETYA claims it is currently preparing the report, but it is difficult to see how it will be meaningful&mdash;at least as it relates to Austudy&mdash;given the impact of the bill and the imminent introduction of the youth allowance. A cynic might argue the government has decided to implement the bill because it has been taken aback by HREOC's condition. HREOC was saying, `Okay, enough is enough, the SDA has been around for 13 years. It's about time the government actually stopped talking about removing discrimination in the difficult areas like marriage and actually addressed the issue.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the government's reaction? It was not about to be dictated to by the commission, was it? No, rather than try to address the issue, it has taken the easy way out. It promised to prepare a report on the issue. This place is great at preparing reports when it does not want to change anything and, therefore, entrench the exemptions by amending 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the legislation itself. It matters not if such a move directly conflicts with the intention of the SDA itself, international conventions or supposed government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To gauge further the government's position, you have only to look at how the Attorney-General, and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), handled the report of the Steering Committee on Social Security Discrimination. The report recommended a review of the implications of the policy based on dependency assumptions; for example, indirect discrimination due to the different treatment of married couples and de facto couples in income and asset testing rates of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his 1996 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the operation of subsections of the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984</EMPHASIS>, the Attorney-General, with the Minister for Social Security, undertook to report back to parliament within 12 months in relation to the issues raised by the steering committee. I may be wrong, but the only report I have been able to find so far is a dismissive two-page press release which concludes the government will not take steps to reduce `discrimination in the social security regime on the grounds that reduced payments to couples recognise principles of economies of scale'. That is, the government assumes a person with a partner has access to the financial means of their partner to meet their combined costs whereas a single independent person, who is independent of parental assistance, does not have the opportunity to share costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This assumption was also made clear by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) in his second reading speech on this bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If de facto relationships are treated the same as marriage&mdash;that is, as a ground for independent status&mdash;there would be a financial incentive for establishing the existence of a de facto relationship . . . This would make it difficult for the scheme administrators to verify the legitimacy of de facto relationships.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-legislative options for dealing with this issue have been explored, however, these would have serious social or financial repercussions. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7810">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That says it all. The government simply does not want people to live together before they are married, and it definitely does not want to pay them the independent rate of Austudy if they choose to do so. But this ignores the reality of the situation out there in mortgage land. I appreciate the government's concerns, but it is a dilemma we should tackle in the interests of fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to take the opportunity to remind Mr Abbott that there was a time when de facto couples received independent Austudy. Way back between 1976 and 1982, if applicants could prove their status by providing two stat decs&mdash;preferably from their parents&mdash;confirming that they had been living together for at least two years, they were considered independent. I can only conclude that the government did not look too hard for solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a government which claims it supports non-discrimination principles. It then introduces an SDA amendment in 1996 which claims to limit exemptions from the operation of the SDA but which, in reality, just maintains the status quo. We have an education minister who prefers to entrench a discriminatory exemption after the commission requested she investigate how to remove discrimination from the Student and Youth Assistance Act. We have an Attorney-General and Minister for Social Security who have recognised the problem and promised to investigate and report back to parliament but who, from the detail of their report, appear to have given the issue only cursory attention. To top it off, we have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who earlier this year endorsed tax incentives to persuade married women to leave the work force and stay at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It all adds up to a serious lack of commitment on the part of the government to the non&hyphen;discrimination principles it claims to respect. It is a contradiction. Whatever the problems of social security rorting, I can tell you they are not the exclusive province of de facto couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this bill is all about money, about government inactivity, about a government shirking its international commitments and about entrenching discrimination, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> flies in the face of the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act. If the government were committed enough, these exemptions could surely be removed. It is about a government saying one thing and doing another. In short, it is hypocritical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The independent rate of Austudy is available to people who are orphans or wards of the state, have a dependent child, are married, are able to prove severe family breakdown, have been in the work force or have been unemployed for three out of four years or are above the age of 25. Students in de facto relationships are not considered independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this bill, the government is assuming that students in de facto relationships will not get married in order to access the independent rate of Austudy. I would not be so sure about this. I recently attended a mock mass wedding at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst, where 50 students tied the knot in protest at the government's increase in the age of independence from 22 to 25 years and at the failure of the government to recognise people in de facto relationships as independent. It was a novel and creative protest which effectively demonstrated the absurdity of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As speakers at the event pointed out, they were old enough to vote, old enough to go to gaol for their actions and old enough to fight for their country, but until they get married, have a child or turn 25 they will not be considered independent for the purposes of Austudy. I wonder, in our emphasis on family values, how commendable it is to encourage abuse of the marriage vows and sacraments. How about stat decs again on the couple's status of their de facto relationship, as de facto relationships are a fact of life?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had students coming into my electorate office whose parents still hold on to the view that, once children turn 18, they are adults and therefore have to fend for themselves. What are the options for people in this position if they want to study? They could try to find work for three years, which could prove difficult given the high youth unemployment rate. They could go on the dole&mdash;they will be able to until the common youth allowance is introduced. They could try to prove severe family breakdown, but they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7811"> would fail because mere withdrawal of economic support is not a sufficient reason. They could have a child or get married.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that, for those children who are from families who do not share the government's view that it is the parents' responsibility to look after their kids until the kids are 25, there is no safety net. Such people are left to fend for themselves and, if their parents earn too much, they get nothing. On my reading of the common youth allowance bill, this will also be a feature of its operation. I do not know what the answer is to the problem, quite frankly. I can see that it would leave the system open to abuse, but the safety net issue certainly has to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to touch briefly on the infamous Austudy actual means test. It is relevant to this debate because it is another example of the discriminatory operation of the Austudy assessment system. Due to numerous inconsistencies, legislative flaws and poor handling by DEETYA, this test has impacted particularly harshly on struggling small business people and farm partnerships in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The following extracts are taken from letters I have received on the issue in my electorate. Mrs Betty Drady of Lyndhurst wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austudy is a nightmare, you need an accountant to fill it in, but if you can't afford one you are penalised because you put the wrong answers in the wrong boxes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Dave Phillips of Bathurst wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I fail to see how a family who qualify for a low income rebate on tax, do not qualify for Austudy. Do any of you live hand to mouth day by day? Try it! You are institutionalising a system which will leave people no other option than to try to cheat it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The test provides an alternative assessment regime for applicants whose parents are involved in private companies, trusts, small businesses or partnerships. After pressure from various members and interest groups, particularly in my electorate, the government finally decided to conduct a review into this highly controversial test. I must place on record the work of my young electorate assistant, Tim Payne, in this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got no problems with the rationale behind the test, but after dealing first&hyphen;hand with the problems of affected constituents it is clear that its operation is unfair. I have recently presented a submission to the review highlighting the numerous anomalies present in the test and proposing an alternative fairer assessment. I only hope that the government takes notice of the recommendations I and other contributors made before including the test in its common youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian parliament introduced the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984 with a commitment to do all it could to remove from the Australian landscape discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy. While current and past governments have continually reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the SDA and to the international convention it ratifies, one could be excused for thinking that the current government is not fair dinkum about really taking a proactive approach to removing discrimination on the basis of marital status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have outlined, the government's action&mdash;or should I say `inaction'&mdash;in addressing the obvious discrimination resulting from the exemption of marital status discrimination from coverage of the SDA tells the true story of the government's views on discrimination. In fact, rather than address the discrimination, the government has chosen to entrench it. It is enough to make you wonder why we have got the SDA at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this bill itself will not change the status quo for the treatment of de facto couples seeking Austudy, the government's handling of the issue clearly demonstrates its lack of commitment to the principles of non-discrimination. It is clear this government will get proactive on removing discrimination only when it will not cost anything to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder how many de facto couples in my electorate will be forced to get married earlier than they would like just so they can study. To be consistent, the government should remove marriage as a criterion of independence. I will certainly study the amendment to be moved by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I reserve my vote on this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R238">Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997</XREF> seeks to provide a permanent solution to what would otherwise be an ongoing problem. It is a problem which has bedevilled the parliament and the last government and this government for quite a few years. From their inception, the Austudy and Abstudy schemes operated under a regulatory exemption from the principles of the Sex Discrimination Act. Then in 1991 these schemes were given a temporary legislative exemption that was to run out in three years. So from 1994 these schemes have operated under a series of temporary administrative exemptions. We have gone from a regulatory exemption to a legislative exemption to an administrative exemption. Now we want to go back to a legislative exemption, only this time we want to make it permanent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need an exemption, because this scheme, in common with all other income support schemes, treats married persons and single persons differently. They all do that because they are all based on an assumption that couples have access to the resources of each other. That is a perfectly reasonable assumption. It is acknowledged by all parties, as far as I can work out, and at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austudy and the Abstudy schemes treat differently formally and informally married applicants. Formally married people are regarded as independent under Austudy and Abstudy. De facto couples are not regarded by that fact alone as being independent for the purposes of Austudy, and for the purposes of Abstudy the relationship is required to be on foot for six months before it is recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is obviously a very significant issue. It cuts to the nub of the problem that the member for Calare (Mr Andren) has alluded to. Obviously, if we were to do what the member for Calare seems to be suggesting&mdash;that is to say, extend independence to de facto couples&mdash;we would be creating a lot of additional costs for the government. In addition to that, we would perhaps be encouraging people to move into de facto relationships 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rather earlier than might be good for them. So this government, in common with other governments, is faced with a dilemma. We have to solve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could run Austudy and Abstudy in ways which entirely comply with the Sex Discrimination Act. We could end discrimination between de facto and other married couples. We could do that by removing marriage as a ground for independence, and that is something which the member for Calare mentioned as a possibility. Indeed, it is something that the former government tried in February 1995, but that regulation was rejected by the Senate. Or we could add de facto marriage as a ground for independence but, as I have just said, that would be an extremely costly exercise. Sadly, someone would have to pay for it, and that someone would be your constituents and my constituents and the taxpayers of Australia. Or we could try to provide a permanent exemption, and that is what we are going to do with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should the Sex Discrimination Act mean that married and unmarried students are treated exactly the same for income support purposes? I do not think it should mean that. It does not happen in other bits of legislation and it should not happen here. Should the operations of the Sex Discrimination Act encourage people to move in together?  Should it provide, even if only indirectly, an incentive to shack up? No, I do not believe that that is the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would point out to the member for Calare that the youth allowance will at least in part address this problem. The youth allowance, as the member for Calare should know, will provide for de facto relationships of two years standing to be a ground of independence for the purpose of being assessed at that independent rate. In fact, we are doing with the youth allowance what was done with the tertiary education assistance scheme back in the 1970s and early 1980s. So, to that extent, the government's policies are accommodating the member for Calare's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should point out that Department of Social Security benefits are provided with a perma 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7813"> nent exemption in the Social Security Act from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act. So what we are doing with this piece of legislation is extending the same exemption to these particular benefits as is already provided to DSS benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in his contribution suggested that we should not do anything until the department has completed a report to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That report is indeed in preparation, but obviously we would not be introducing this legislation if we did not think that it was perfectly consistent with the tenor of our investigation so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the member for Werriwa is suggesting is that we go back to the former situation of a temporary legislative exemption. Well, we did that before. The former government did that. It expired and they were left with the problem. That path has been tried; it was not very effective. Why go back to something that has failed? I have to say, for a gentleman who thinks that he is better than the people who have gone before him, I am disappointed to see the member for Werriwa going back to old, failed solutions. We all know that the member for Werriwa thinks that he is better than his senior colleagues; it is a pity to see him emulating the sort of thing that was tried by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans).</PARA>

It is interesting to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). He provided a very poor justification as to why the government has not made public its report; why it has not completed due process and reported on these 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me to be an absolute perversion of process for the Parliamentary Secretary to stand up and say in the House of Representatives, `We know what is in the report and it is not inconsistent with our legislation.' If they know what is in the report, and he is willing to say that in the parliament, then make the report public. Report to the human rights commission so that due process, at the very least, has been completed. This is a basic principle in having faith in the processes of government&mdash;that information is made public and it is subject to public accountability and scrutiny. It is poor form indeed for the Parliamentary Secretary to take that course of action, to treat the parliament and the public with contempt on what he described as a very important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I might respond in the spirit in which the member for Warringah concluded his remarks. I was interested to hear his reservations about the impact of this provision on de facto relationships. Certainly, from talking to my parliamentary colleagues about this, we acknowledge there is a concern about the administrative difficulty of monitoring the legitimacy of de facto relationships in these circumstances. I think that is a public administration concern that a reasonable person would acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the member for Warringah comes from that social engineering strand of the Liberal Party that places greater emphasis on what he thinks people should be doing. His main concern was not about the administrative difficulty; it was about whether or not it is in their best interests for people to be in a de facto relationship. I think his exact words were `that it might not be in their best interests to be in a de facto relationship at this time'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the honourable member for Warringah has wide interests in these matters. I am not saying he is part of the bedroom police at this stage, but I don't think he is in any sort of position to make a judgment about whether it is in the best interests of consenting adults to be in a de facto relationship or out of one.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7814">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are limits to what parliamentarians can legitimately achieve in public life. We have to allow a bit of freedom of choice and adult discretion. It is not our job to ascribe to people what their interests may be if they are in or out of a de facto or any other form of relationship. So I urge the member for Warringah at the very least, in his consideration of this matter, to drop the social engineering strand from the Liberal Party. Let us stick here to public administration matters. There are some administrative difficulties, so let us stick to those instead of getting into the sort of social engineering for which the Lyons Forum in this place has become renowned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think these are the two matters of substance. Let us stick to the administrative issues, and let us also acknowledge the need for due process. Quite frankly, the Labor Party is not in a position to support the bill in its entirety until due process has been completed, and it would be unreasonable of the government to expect us to take any other position.</PARA></SPEECH>

This is what we are doing, and it is a perfectly reasonable and simple thing to do. I also have to say that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has indicated that it is not opposed to the course of action that we are taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of the administrative difficulties involved in including de facto relationships as a ground of independence, as the member for Calare (Mr Andren) said, we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have had, so he tells us, 50 people up at Charles Sturt University going through some kind of sham marriage. If people are prepared to go through sham marriages in order to get independent status, obviously they will be even more ready to claim to be living in a de facto relationship for the purpose of getting Austudy. It is a very simple point; it is one which all governments up until now have recognised, and it is certainly one which this government recognises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am mentioning the point made by the member for Calare, I wish to acknowledge his great concerns about the actual means test. I acknowledge the quality of his submission to the government's inquiry into the actual means test. I repeat in this chamber, as I have said in a number of other venues, that obviously we as a government are deeply sorry for the pain and the suffering that people have endured because of the administrative difficulties involved with the actual means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These administrative difficulties operated last year under the former government's AMT. We certainly have not cleared them up this year. We have to take responsibility for that, and we are working overtime now to try to ensure that the actual means test for 1998 is simpler and fairer. I have to say that it is not an easy job. It is a very difficult job, but, if we cannot make it simpler and fairer, obviously there is something fundamentally wrong with the concept or there is something fundamentally wrong with us. Let us hope that we ultimately pass the test with some colours still flying. Mr Deputy Speaker, the government sees no need for the amendment of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R237">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  amends the previously legislated amount payable to the states through the ANTA agreement to provide for cost supplementation and the effect of budget changes and also legislates an amount for 1999. The reason the amount in 1998 is to be reduced despite cost supplementation is that the 1997 budget announced a cut in Commonwealth vocational education and training grants to the states and territories of $20 million per calendar year beginning next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts are being introduced under the interesting label of benchmarking efficiencies, which are described in a budget measures table as providing `an incentive to the states to achieve efficiency gains in their VET operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost&hyphen;effective states'. The most cost&hyphen;effective state for this purpose is described as Victoria. I would suggest it has been much more about crudely cutting costs than about building effectiveness within its TAFE sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The closure of TAFEs, described by the Kennett government as `amalgamations', the running down of their system and the merger of 14 TAFE institutes into eight and possibly five is a further indication of how these do represent cost savings much more than efficiency or effectiveness gains. These decisions by the Victorian government have now been rewarded by the Howard government holding this as a model for the rest of the country. The irony is, however, that in Dr Kemp's so&hyphen;called $4.5 billion TAFE `deal', delivery of guaranteed Commonwealth funding is dependent upon states and territories creating an extra $100,000 student places each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this whole approach to vocational education and training, like the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment's overall tackling of higher education, is input focused. Dr Kemp talks about the need to improve quality, yet the benchmarking measures he is forcing on the states are entirely focused on costs. Nothing demonstrates this better than the results of the national employer satisfaction survey conducted in late 1995 and early 1996 by AGB McNair and funded by ANTA. It is interesting to note how Dr Kemp's star state performer&mdash;Victoria, by his assessment&mdash;is actually measured in this survey. For instance, on the question of supervisor satisfaction about the extent to which the course fitted in with work commitments, there was an Australia&hyphen;wide level of satisfaction of 74 per cent but for Victoria only 65 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of recent TAFE graduates, where supervisors were satisfied with the compatibility of the course with training requirements, Victoria again failed to measure up to the national average. The state rated a dismal 42 per cent on the issue of satisfaction with the incorporation of on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training, compared with 68 per cent for the New South Wales sector and a national average of 61 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benchmark state ranked second lowest in the country when employers were asked about the relevance of skills to the current needs of their organisation and second lowest on the issue of job readiness of graduates. Not even on the cost&hyphen;effectiveness measure does Victoria make it anywhere near the national average. It scores 58 per cent, as against an Australia&hyphen;wide satisfaction level of 69 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, when employers were asked to rate their general satisfaction with the training provided, where does Victoria rank? Last by the length of the straight. This so&hyphen;called `model state', when it comes to various measures of effectiveness and satisfaction within the sector, comes a long last. It should be noted that New South Wales, the object of some criticism by Dr Kemp, rated higher than or equal to the national average on every one of the above criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult to escape the conclusion that this is about cutting costs, whatever the result. It is about an input focus irrespective 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7820"> of output. More than that, it is a disturbing reminder of how this government has been driving privatisation into our education system at all levels, of course in itself driven by the minister's ideological obsession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TAFEs are being expected, with reduced funding, to continue their traditional role of providing broad access to adult education while, at the same time, competing with private providers to meet the needs of employers. As the Pro&hyphen;Vice&hyphen;Chancellor, Vocational Education and Training at the RMIT told the Senate inquiry into this legislation on 5 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a substantial decrease in capital funds for VET. That is a concern to us because of the old stock that we have . . . if we are going to go into a competitive trading market, we are competing with other providers that may be up to date with buildings, facilities and equipment, whereas we have been left with a fairly run&hyphen;down situation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government is walking away from its responsibilities in all sectors of education. Mr Des Fooks, a former head of DEETYA's Vocational Education and Training Division told the same Senate inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the graduates of TAFE in 1995, 55 per cent were female, 27 per cent of them came from a non&hyphen;English speaking background, six per cent had a disability and 1.6 per cent were Aboriginal. That is a pretty impressive little bundle of statistics to demonstrate the importance of TAFE in the community . . . Anything that is going to impact on TAFE resources will impact immediately on those target groups, many or most of whom will have nowhere else to go&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in the education sector. According to an ABS survey of TAFE graduate outcomes for 1994, the average age of TAFE graduates was 29 years, with 11 per cent of graduates being over 44, highlighting its critical role in the development of life&hyphen;long learning, opportunity and possibility in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The survey also highlighted the increasing significance of TAFE in providing particular skills to people who have previously completed a university education, with some five per cent of graduates having completed a bachelor or higher degree before commencing their TAFE course. By inadequately resourcing TAFE, therefore, the Howard government is effectively abandoning one of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the most important roles it can play in Australia's current and future interest: ensuring the appropriate provision of quality education and training for all our citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Dr Kemp's media release of 8 June, announcing his so&hyphen;called $4.5 billion `deal' to the states and territories, he claims his funding contract will lead to a major upgrade of the TAFE system. Dr Kemp implies, as he does in so many other areas&mdash;literacy, vocational education in schools and civics education, to name a few&mdash;that nothing ever happened until he arrived on the scene. The truth is that between 1991 and 1994 contact hours in the VET system grew by 21 per cent. The average growth rate for TAFE over the last decade has been around seven per cent per annum. In the last five years growth has been something like 10 per cent per annum, according to submissions received by the Senate inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These achievements are now being ground to a halt. The Kemp deal, which reads more like a threat to the states and territories, commits the Commonwealth to a guaranteed level of funding of around $900 million annually for the next five years on the condition that the states and territories increase student places by 500,000. There will be no growth funds from the Commonwealth. All this growth must be funded from the states and territories through so-called efficiency gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a peculiar minister indeed who is promising an extra 500,000 places in TAFE off the back of no increase in Commonwealth funding. Dr Kemp is winding back the growth component of Commonwealth funding yet telling the Australian public that 500,000 places can be produced. It is a bit like the New Testament&mdash;I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), will relate to this&mdash;Dr Kemp positioning himself such that he wants to turn fishes and loaves into a feast. There is no feast without Commonwealth resourcing. There can be no feast or growth in the TAFE sector without a matching Commonwealth contribution. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7821">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the ANTA documents received by the minister highlight the past funding growth under the former Labor government and the fact that his deal is more a threat. His deal cannot produce a feast unless the Commonwealth keeps up the growth funding that the former Labor government had committed to TAFE and vocational education and training in Australia generally. The schedule to the Australian National Training Authority Act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will provide growth funding on a continuing basis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister is now even acting outside the schedule of the legislation. This is the reason why he wants a new ANTA agreement&mdash;an agreement on his terms and conditions alone. The government does not want to be reminded of the commitments and responsibilities from which it has walked away. It is no wonder the states are resisting so strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an ALP piece of resistance. It is not an ALP objection to the way in which the minister is going about his business. The strongest objection, the strongest piece of resistance, comes from his own colleague in Victoria Phil Honeywood, the Victorian Liberal Minister for Tertiary Education and Training. He has led the drive by state and territory training ministers. They met in Adelaide because of their concerns about the future of the system. They believe in their statement that young people have had their expectations raised unrealistically. They wanted to come to Canberra to meet Dr Kemp and discuss a more reasonable proposition for future TAFE funding than the one being put forward by the Commonwealth. The minister refused their request and now the states are talking about involving the premiers&mdash;going to the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot wait for Jeff Kennett to involve himself in vocational education and training. He has been such an astute critic of this government that I would certainly welcome his intervention in this debate. He would know, as does his minister, that the states are being screwed over. The states are being ripped off in this so-called deal which, from their perspective, can only be understood as a threat&mdash;the threat that unless they squeeze 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the lemon in the TAFE sector there will be no Commonwealth funding out of the ANTA agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states in this regard are being placed over a barrel. They are being placed in an untenable position&mdash;the 500,000 places are to come off their budgets, out of their efforts, without any Commonwealth growth funding. One could reasonably understand why they are objecting and why they have put party politics to one side to barrel the minister and highlight his hypocrisy on these various matters and to highlight the way in which his public rhetoric, particularly the promise of an additional 500,000 places, does not accord at all with the sort of information that has been provided to him by ANTA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the document in question available for the House. This is what ANTA have to say in their advice to Dr Kemp:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of States and Territories to deliver efficiency gains of this order&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the order wanted by Dr Kemp&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">within a single calendar year, is problematic.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They then go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience suggests that for most states a baseline efficiency of one per cent per year has been achieved over the past five years. Nationally, annual average efficiency growth of one per cent would fund only between 9 and 20 per cent of the required growth in VET clients.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For the past five years they have made a one per cent efficiency gain. If they were to do that for the next five years it would only meet one&hyphen;fifth of Dr Kemp's target. So Dr Kemp is expecting the states and territories after a substantial period of change and reform within their TAFE sectors to multiply by a factor of five the efficiency gains to meet his target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly it is unrealistic. Clearly it is nothing more than a publicity exercise. Clearly it is nothing more than the minister again trying to protect his own hide, advance his own interests against those of Senator Vanstone. That is not hard to do. You do not need to mislead the parliament or mislead the public to look better than Senator Vanstone. Dr Kemp is out of control and he is certainly not providing this parliament with any accurate information when one examines this ANTA document.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7822">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document goes on to say&mdash;and I think this is the most damning commentary on Dr Kemp:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities as opposed to notional possibilities requires access to detailed information on State/Territory system budgets that is not available.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bottom line is that this information is not available. It is not available to ANTA. It is not available to the minister. The minister has no right or authority for making the claim that 500,000 extra TAFE places will be provided in the coming period. The information is not available. He is engaged in a public relations exercise that is doing damage to the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and territories and, ultimately, and most unfortunately, doing damage to the whole nature of vocational education and training in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters need to be placed on the public record. I am delighted to be joined in my criticism of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, by Phil Honeywood, who has come out in his frustration in recent weeks. For example, on 13 June Mr Honeywood was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> as questioning whether the Common&hyphen;wealth's aim was to `dismantle the TAFE system by squeezing it to produce impossible efficiencies while encouraging private providers to take over training'. Mr Honeywood has been a pretty effective dismantler, a strong dismantler, in his own right. But now he is asking the question: `who will guard the guardians?' One of the dismantlers is saying that the system will be under further pressure if Dr Kemp has his way. On 12 June the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> quotes him as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a complete sense of frustration that Dr Kemp is a centralist who does not acknowledge the part the States play in funding training. I feel there is a betrayal of trust.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You can tell when the Liberal Party start getting real angry about these matters: when they really want to cut into someone they describe him as a centralist. That is like putting up the cross to Count Yorga. He has really gone for the low blow of describing the minister as a centralist. On 20 August another <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  report has Mr Honeywood saying:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories have just given up, basically. Kemp, just to get headlines, goes out after each Minister's meeting . . . and hits us with another bombshell that we haven't agreed upon.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Upon coming to office, this government acted quickly to signal that it has no commitment to any part of the education sector. It made education and training funding its No. 1 target for budget cuts at exactly the same time as it was trying to quarantine Defence spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its first budget, it reduced vocational education and training grants to the states and territories by $66 million over four years and abolished the five per cent real growth on TAFE for a saving of $91 million over four years. The government also cut $12 million from ANTA's operating expenses. The trend continued in the 1997 budget with the so-called $72 million benchmarking efficiencies, to which I referred earlier. Vocational education and training funding has been cut by 2.2 per cent in real terms between 1996 and the year 2001, yet the government came to office having promised&mdash;again, it must have been a non-core promise&mdash;to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . continue to support a strong and effective TAFE sector, that is, the publicly funded network of TAFE institutions . . . and to ensure that the network of TAFE institutions, especially in rural and regional centres, will not be undermined and that TAFE will continue its traditional role as a provider of further education and second chance educational opportunity, particularly for disadvantaged groups.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the public promise. The reality since the election has been nothing more than betrayal, nothing more than empty publicity stunts, nothing more than cost saving measures and nothing more than running TAFE into the ground and not fulfilling the commitment of the former government to grow TAFE, to grow the pathways available for post&hyphen;secondary education in Australia. The other cutting blow to the TAFE sector comes with the creeping privatisation of the sector such that some $500 million a year in Commonwealth and state funds are to be made available to fund the training of all new apprentices and trainees through the provider of the employer's choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We listened yesterday, for instance, to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talking about the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7823"> difference between sectional and national interest as he referred to the ACTU congress in Brisbane. I would question the nature of a sectional interest when employers in Australia are provided $500 million under the banner of user choice without any matching user pays. I have not known of a single part of the public sector in these recent decades of reform where user choice has not been accompanied by some element of user pays, yet here we have the federal government authorising a transfer of $500 million to employers for them to undertake the training options on behalf of their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would make the point to the House that there is a substantial difference in the training agenda between employee interest and employer interest. I would have thought that, if employers were given a user choice, they would be expected to fund more substantially the nation's budget in vocational education and training than they do in Australia. If they are to have a choice of training options for their workers, they should be making a greater contribution to training funding and general support in the workplace than what we have seen in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a dangerous proposition to place worker and employer interests in this particular perspective because it may be tempting for some employers to use their choice, to use their budgets in this particular area, to cast a narrow set of skills for their particular workers. I would have thought it would be preferable to have workers very closely involved in the casting of their own training, their own skill development. Dr Kemp has raised examples in this particular area&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has used this example: why should a worker not have four different sets of skills, say, in a wine making enterprise? Why shouldn't they not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only grow the grapes, fix the vat, do the accounting systems and do the retailing? If we are to disperse skills in this fashion and provide just a narrow set of skills amalgamated to suit the interests of just one enterprise that might require that particular base of skills, it will not place the employee in a very sound situation. If the enterprise goes out of business or the industry restructures, which is almost inevitable, surely workers need a stronger base of skills than that particular example provided by the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is an argument to say that employee and employer interests do not always match, that in this particular area there needs to be better consideration of the interests of workers. They should have a stronger say in the development of their skills so their skills are portable, stand the test of industry restructuring and stand the test of economic change, which is so inevitable now in our open economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so many areas&mdash;whether it be the nature of the training agenda, the funding cuts, the publicity stunts, the empty rhetoric, the misleading of the Australian people by this particular minister through to the substance of user choice and the conflicting nature of worker and employer interests&mdash;this government has moved in the wrong direction on vocational education and training. The Labor Party will be standing against these particular changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a proud record in government of growing the sector. That remains our commitment. It is only out of Commonwealth growth and responsibility that TAFE places around Australia can be grown in cooperation, instead of confrontation, with the states and territories.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard the comments of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who refers to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7824"> the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), one of the most capable ministers in this portfolio this country has ever seen, as Dr Doolittle. I think it would be more accurate to refer to the member for Batman, as he is a former President of the ACTU, as Mr Job-Destroy&mdash;something which he continues to try to do today. He and his colleagues obviously do not realise that the wider sector of the youth in our community are out there looking desperately for methods to get themselves into the work force because of an education system which has been failing them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and, as part of that committee, we have been undertaking an inquiry into the constraints of employing young people. Some of the things we have heard have been very disturbing because, as those opposite and most of the community would be aware, 70 per cent of young people going to high school do not go on to a tertiary education, do not go on to university. We have heard time and time again that they feel the school system is gearing them for only one thing&mdash;that is, university&mdash;and, if they cannot get into university, they have no hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very privileged to be involved with a group of people in Caboolture in my electorate of Longman who have an organisation up and running called CASILS, the Caboolture area school industry links scheme. This is an innovative program which has only commenced in the last few months. It has seen business working together with schools, private trainers as well as the public sector, in the form of TAFE, to ensure that we integrate vocational education into the schools and give young people the very best opportunity to progress into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government&mdash;the Labor Party&mdash;left this country with apprenticeships at a 30&hyphen;year low. The member for Batman, as the former President of the ACTU, stands up in this place and waxes lyrical about how we need training and how desperately we need to have a work force which is able to meet the needs of the Australian consumer and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workplace. What we find is that the very base which skilled workers come from&mdash;apprenticeships&mdash;is at a three&hyphen;decade low, and the Labor Party did nothing to assist or turn the situation around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not taking money from vocational education but ensuring that the money that is spent is spent wisely and to the benefit of all those students who will not be going on to university. We are ensuring that the appalling lack of apprentices right across the board is addressed. The fact is we have a lack of skilled metalworkers and skilled people in the hospitality industry as far as chefs are concerned. We have heard that in Mount Isa they cannot get apprentices. In fact, MIM have told me personally that they were only able to fill half the apprenticeships they had available in 1997. Why is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that it is because the vocational education system applied by the previous government failed the young people of Australia. We need businesses, industry, industry leaders, the private and public sector training systems and the schools to work together. It will only be then that we will start to address the problem of vocational education needs in the schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can just talk briefly about the CASILS project, we have seen young people being given an opportunity to work one day a week in a workplace so that they understand both the rights and the responsibilities they have in a workplace. Some have already gone on to traineeships and apprenticeships as a result of the work that has been undergone in Caboolture in the last few months. What has impressed me is that the business community have not just supported this; they have become almost fanatical in their approach to wanting this scheme to progress so they can employ young people. This is a great turnaround, and it is a turnaround that has been fostered by a government policy which sees the need for vocational education to take a proper role in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the private schools in Brisbane&mdash;Nudgee college, which has a very long history&mdash;has also seen the need to embrace vocational education. Through its dedication, it has seen a growth in the number of young 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7825"> people getting jobs in that sector and not just going on to university. Nudgee is catering not just for the 30 per cent who go to university but for 100 per cent of its students, including the 70 per cent who must find jobs in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the picture that is painted is that we have to move away from a system that has failed young people and that has failed the wider community in not allowing us to have the skills base that we need to take the opportunities that Australia offers us. Isn't it appalling that we have to go overseas to find skilled people to fill jobs in Australia? The wider community gets very upset about that, and understandably so. But we have to do that because the system that we have had in place for many years has failed to bring through those people with the skills necessary to fill positions in the industries that Australia has. Unless we turn this around and we start to put vocational education into the schools in such a way that it meets industry needs, that it is proactive rather than reactive and that it uses the resources of the public and private sector&mdash;whether it be TAFEs or private providers&mdash;then we are not going to be able to progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, mentioned ANTA. ANTA actually has the task at the moment of sifting through a number of trial schemes to come up with skills centres. Skills centres allow for technology to be placed into schools so they are able to increase the vocational education ability of the attending students. I am very much a supporter of this entire project. Once again, it is a demonstration of the government's commitment to vocational education and also its dedication to the knowledge that we must immerse both traditional and new skills in technology. This has been very well done by John Paul College on the south side of Brisbane, which have a success rate in placing their students approaching 100 per cent. They do not just have computers in the school; they have actually immersed every subject in technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, CASILS have a very innovative idea. They have put up a submission which would enable six schools, each with a particu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lar voc ed bent&mdash;including plastics, mechanical works, agriculture and three other groups&mdash;to allow each student in those six schools to access, through technology, much of the information that is needed to fulfil those subjects. This means we get a sixfold return on the physical equipment and industry products that we are putting into each school, rather than just allowing those few students in the immediate catchment area to benefit from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are just some of the few ways in which we in the government are very deliberately addressing the needs of vocational education. We are listening to business. We are trying to respond to the fact that we do not have enough apprentices and that we have a skills base which has deteriorated under Labor and has not been assisted by their policy of quick turnaround courses. We are embedding technology, training and vocational education in the combined industry, schools and training providers so we have a coordinated approach to overcoming the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only through the innovative ideas that this government is putting in place&mdash;supported by the increase in finances in this budget and the redirection of some of those funds into the more needy areas of vocational education such as apprenticeships, and by allowing both traineeships and apprenticeships to involve education and training at the one time&mdash;will we start to address the long&hyphen;term problems of Australia's lack of a skills base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the minister for the fabulous work that he is doing in a very difficult area. This area requires more than just rhetoric; it requires answers. Very shortly, a report will be tabled from the inquiry of the employment, education and training committee. I believe that many of the messages that come from the report will support what the government has been undertaking and will continue to undertake to give young people in Australia more than just a fair go&mdash;to give them the kick&hyphen;start they so desperately need to get into the work force through vocational education.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity that the member for Longman (Mr Brough) is leaving the House, because he might have heard some of the real 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7826"> facts about the fall&hyphen;off in the growth of traineeships and the decline in apprenticeship opportunities in the first 18 months of the Howard government. That aside, facts are not an issue that has worried those on the other side of the House with respect to their performance on the training front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise today to support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). In doing so, I support the condemnation of the  Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill  expressed in the second reading amendment. This bill is about further cutting the funds needed to help train young Australians for jobs at a time when this government is responsible not only for the growth in the number of young people coming from overseas under the working holiday makers program and taking jobs and training opportunities that ought to be available to young Australians but also for a 50 per cent growth in the independent skill category of migration. So much for this government's support of training and apprenticeship opportunities for young people in Australia. This government would prefer to give training and job opportunities to people from overseas rather than concentrate on the needs of young people in Australia. That is the crux of the problem. This government has made no commitment at all to job and training opportunities for young people. It is about time this government faced up to the fact that unemployment is the biggest problem confronting Australia, in association with a lack of opportunity and a lack of a sense of security in people's lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is to implement the 1997 budget decisions&mdash;to do what? It is to cut $14.3 million from vocational and industry training and another $72 million from education and training grants to the states. That is what it is about. It is not about increasing opportunities but reducing opportunities through cutting the very programs that are supposedly aimed at helping young people in Australia to get decent skills on the basis of which they can be attractive to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time in the last 18 months in this House that we have had to deal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with cuts to training opportunities for young people. The cuts I refer to are in addition to the $183 million cut from vocational education and training in the 1996 budget, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) is well aware.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not about increasing opportunities; it is about reducing expenditure in the first two Howard budgets on training for young people in Australia and ripping away their opportunity to gain the skills that are so necessary in order for an employer to be willing to say, `Yes, I am prepared to give a chance to that young man or that young woman for the purposes of training and for getting a job with me.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about taking us further down the road of high youth unemployment at a time when severe skills shortages exist in Australia. That is what it is about. In Western Australia and Queensland at the moment, where there is potential growth in the need for people with skills, there are huge skills shortages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we doing about that as a nation? We are making it harder for the states to provide opportunities to overcome those skills shortages. What will we have in the very near future? We will have employers knocking on the door yet again and saying, `Don't blame us for the fact that we did not train people, but open the doors again&mdash;bring them in from overseas.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple answer, the old answer is: `We are not going to do the training. The federal government is not going to provide the opportunities for states to assist. We are not about overcoming unemployment in Australia. Open the doors. Bring them in from overseas.' That is going to be the end result of these cuts in expenditure with respect to vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will mean, as I have said, that more skilled vacancies are filled by ad hoc decisions to have intakes of skilled immigrants instead of using young unemployed Australians trained in this country&mdash;using people from overseas as an alternative to young unemployed Australians getting a decent opportunity in life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7827">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in the inaugural Prime Minister's lecture, suggested that Australia is safer and fairer than it was 18 months ago. If cuts in vocational education and training mean that Australia is safer and fairer, then I do not know what young unemployed Australians must think about the performance of the Prime Minister in the last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that the Prime Minister has been letting his Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) run around wasting money on publicity while our TAFE colleges and apprenticeship system fall into neglect. In an extraordinary outburst last week, the minister's Liberal Party colleague, the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood&mdash;a person well known to you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;said that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training was more concerned about his personal publicity than he was with putting young people into jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know what that is about; it is about Dr Kemp stabbing his senior minister in the back so that he can obtain her post at the cabinet table at the expense of young people, purely on the basis of his own self&hyphen;promotion and publicity. Last week, the minister put out this very expensive glossy kit, which includes a colour photograph of himself. We all know about publicity&mdash;and we will deal with that in due course&mdash;but surely this money would have been better spent on helping some young people get training opportunities, rather than on colour photographs of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is also well known for doctoring the figures to give the opposite impression of the truth. Recently he has been exposed in the House on a number of occasions in question time with respect to those activities. He was known as misrepresenting statistics in his academic days, as throwing figures around without proper caution to justify his claims. He is continuing that approach as a minister of the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the articles here to prove it if he wants to have a debate about it. He doctored the figures on the success rate of Working Nation programs, for example, to justify abandoning the election promise to maintain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> labour market program expenditure in real terms&mdash;again not a core promise, despite the promises before the last election. Nearly $2 billion was taken out of jobs programs in John Howard's first budget. Clearly, the real losers as a result of those cuts&mdash;for example, with respect to LEAP, which is a highly successful green program that assisted young people&mdash;were young people, their families and their local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training had to find an excuse to justify this massive betrayal&mdash;that is what it is&mdash;of a promise to maintain spending and to do something positive to reduce unemployment. But, as usual, the minister could not rely on the real facts. The real facts were that the number of long-term unemployed had fallen by 35 per cent since the Working Nation labour market programs came in. The number of long-term unemployed had fallen in trend terms every month for the last 32 months of the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the minister, the honourable member for Goldstein, set about twisting the facts to justify cutting these effective and compassionate programs for the long-term unemployed. He even manufactured figures to discredit the programs, and the department itself knows this. For instance, he baldly stated in the House&mdash;and the Prime Minister repeated the claim&mdash;that the cost per job obtained through new work opportunities was $143,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It later became clear that these figures related not to the cost per person assisted, as the statement implied, but the so-called cost per net impact of the programs. It also became clear&mdash;as the parliamentary secretary is well aware&mdash;that the so-called cost per net impact was a very artificial concept which served only one real purpose, and that purpose was to mislead the Australian people into thinking more was being spent on these programs than there actually was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Goldstein's own senior minister, Senator Vanstone&mdash;the person whose job he is after&mdash;has admitted under questioning in Senate estimates that assessing labour market programs according to the cost per net impact is a limited measure of their effectiveness. She has specifically said that suggesting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7828"> that the figure for jobs under the new work opportunities program is $143,000 is not the cost per person. Department officials made clear that this figure is in fact 14 times&mdash;yes, 14 times&mdash;the actual cost per person assisted. But that does not worry the minister, the member for Goldstein, because it is just a little twist of the figures. He did it during his academic days, and he is continuing it whilst he is a minister of the Crown.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training is in direct conflict with his senior minister and department. The truth is that those programs should not have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been abolished. Since the government began to remove them, the number of long-term unemployed has risen by almost 32,000 to a 27-month high, reversing the steep decline in the number under Labor. Unfortunately for the parliamentary secretary, that is a fact, and I know that he does not like to deal with facts such as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth unemployment rate&mdash;John Howard said reducing that in his first term as Prime Minister would be his highest priority&mdash;has in fact risen. Well might the parliamentary secretary hang his head in shame. It has risen by one full percentage point since he took office. And it is no wonder, given funding cuts to vocational training of the order enacted in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has been doctoring the figures again recently in relation to the number of apprenticeships in Australia, and we will deal with the facts again to prove the point that I have just suggested. At the time of the 1997 August budget, his media release titled `Funding for new apprenticeships' portrayed the government as providing $265 million for 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997-98. This is grossly misleading. As this bill makes clear, funds for vocational education and training are in fact being reduced, not increased. The facts speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so-called new apprenticeships and traineeships are just the continuation of annual commencements, and their rate of growth has slowed drastically since the Howard government took office. The number of traditional four-year trade apprenticeships has in fact fallen, not risen, since the Howard government took office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Independent officers of the department confirmed at Senate estimates hearings a fortnight ago&mdash;and I hope the parliamentary secretary is listening because these are the facts&mdash;that the number of apprenticeships in 1996-97 will be as many as 2,000 down on the 1995-96 figures; that is, around 46,000 compared with 48,000. They are Senate estimates facts, not my figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the rate of growth in traineeships, which has also dramatically 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7829"> slowed since the Howard government took office. It has gone from 117 per cent in Labor's last year of office to around 33 per cent in the last year, with virtually no growth expected for next year. The reason for this is that the Howard government has cut rather than expanded vocational and industry training in its first two budgets by nearly $270 million&mdash;and again we are talking about facts that have been twisted and distorted to suit the minister's own best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of those cuts have been to grants to state governments. It is no wonder that the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood, has had some harsh words to say about the performance of this government in recent weeks. When you look at the 1997 budget papers, as distinct from the minister's PR material, you see very clearly in the savings measures table&mdash;table No. 7 of budget paper No. 1&mdash;that another $72 million will be cut through benchmarking efficiencies in vocational education and training grants to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The labour and employment affairs outlays table, which is on page 4-94 of budget paper No. 1&mdash;I suppose it is a bit hard dealing with the budget papers, when things have been twisted and distorted to suit people's own best interests&mdash;shows a cut of $14.3 million for vocational and industry training, including a cut of $16.8 million for entry level training in 1997-98. I suggest this bill is a further instalment in a series of cuts. As a result, there has been understandable outcry from the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 August the minister made another very misleading statement. He said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face to face</EMPHASIS> program on Channel 7 that the government would be committing new funds to enable an additional 18,000 young people to take up apprenticeships and traineeships at school. I think `18,000 new apprenticeships for secondary students' sounds like a good headline&mdash;it was, after the program. But at the Senate estimates hearings a fortnight ago, the department when questioned about the fine print was forced to admit that only 900 young people would start apprenticeships and traineeships in schools as a result of this program&mdash;not 18,000. At Senate estimates, a parliamentary process of this nation, we were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> told there would be only 900 places. Using the figure of 18,000 was again grossly misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then last week the minister put on another glossy public relations charade. What did we get? A new program called `Apprenticeships can work for you'. I think apprenticeships and traineeships are fairly important, but I cannot see why, when I picked up that kit&mdash;made at considerable expense to the Australian taxpayer&mdash;the first thing I came to was a glossy photo of none other than the minister, the member for Goldstein. I can understand that the minister wants to promote himself, but I would have thought the expenditure on the production of that glossy photo and on all those kits would have been better spent on trying to train young Australians rather than again opening the gates and reverting to increased immigration from overseas. That will be the end result of cuts to these programs by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state governments are correctly aggrieved by the fact that there have been no consultations with them before last week's media announcements of the so-called new apprenticeships. Indeed, some are so annoyed that they are going to raise it at the next Council of Australian Governments meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not believe in letting the nation's skills base run down. We believe in actually tackling Australia's high and rising youth unemployment. We must have an adequately resourced national training program. We must be about securing an environment conducive to companies planning ahead to meet future skills needs. It is about identifying the skills shortages and creating the opportunities through the Commonwealth government adequately resourcing state governments and creating adequate incentives to encourage employers to take on young people in apprenticeships and traineeships. I do not care whether it is an apprenticeship or a traineeship, provided it is decent training that ensures that a young person is made job ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this end, Labor supports the further development of closer consultations on the training front between the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7830"> Affairs and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs so that we do not again resort to not only cutting expenditure on our skills needs and training opportunities but also falling back on the easy option of increased skill immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time the Prime Minister faced up to the fact that he does have an obligation to do something about unemployment&mdash;not just youth unemployment but also mature age unemployment, one of the major problems confronting Australia. The textile, clothing and footwear decision that is about to be made is central to the debate about the future of mature age unemployed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has taken no action whatsoever to expand this initiative and to prevent continuing severe skills shortages. A recent report handed down in Western Australia shows, for example, that some 7,000 skilled tradespeople, managers and engineers will need to be imported to meet expected shortages in Western Australian development projects between now and the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that these shortages should be filled not by cutting expenditure on training in Australia but by increasing the number and going out of our way to get our unemployed young Australians, who desperately want work, into those training opportunities. However, the problem is that this bill and the associated cuts to TAFE colleges are going to make this impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the second reading amendment to the House. I also ask the parliamentary secretary to examine the facts that I have referred to in the debate today. Figures have been twisted and distorted by the minister to try to suggest that he is doing something other than what he is doing in the bill before the House&mdash;that is, drastically cut expenditure on vocational education and training.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts speak for themselves.

The bill will appropriate the same level of funding for 1999.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent to which a nation achieves a standard of living that is acceptable depends on the levels and relevancy of its education and training. That is what this bill is all about&mdash;making sure we have the funding that is going to ensure that the Australian nation has the levels of education and training that will fit this nation for the part it wants to play in the global economy of the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had under Labor over the last decade was an appalling situation of a maldistribution of skills. In the city areas we had oversupplies of people like medical and hospital staffs, doctors, nurses and paramedics of all descriptions. We had teachers clustered in cities. We had the hospitality and tourism employees clustered in metropolitan areas. But in regional Australia we had a skills shortage. In electorates like Murray we have restaurants that could be open seven days a week, with bookings well in advance, open only two or three days a week, because we in the country do not have the hospitality and tourism staff necessary to keep those sorts of businesses open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor we had a situation where, as migrants came into this country, they automatically and quite happily ended up in the major metropolitan centres of Sydney and Melbourne. There was no incentive for them to be directed towards regional centres. Under our migration policy, we are giving incentives to those who come here with skills to locate in regional areas. The electorate of Murray has just been designated a part of one regional skilled migration program. We want to make sure that we get our share. And of course there will be no blow&hyphen;out in the migration numbers that we are now permitting into this country. The member for Batman 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7831"> (Mr Martin Ferguson) seemed to suggest that we are going to have ever increasing skilled migration. We are saying that we want to very carefully focus our immigration policy on the skilled people this country is currently short of, and then provide incentives for them to come to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor we had a very sad situation where, as the realisation of the election drew nigh, instead of looking at the essential training needs of our younger people they looked at Mickey Mouse short&hyphen;term training courses to make sure the stats looked better, without giving any long-term work opportunities to the younger people in the dole queues. What this government does is look very seriously at the long-term needs of the nation. We want to give those older people who are unemployed the opportunity to gain training that enables them to be geographically mobile, so that they have qualifications which allow them to move around this nation and do not restrict them to one state. We are also looking very seriously at how we can make sure that our younger people can adjust their lifelong training needs. We want them to be able to move in and out of training as their families grow and as their interests change. We will not focus on a quick fix for the sake of statistics&mdash;a Mickey Mouse course that does nothing to adjust unemployment in the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, for the decade or more that Labor was in office, Australia was not well served by our post&hyphen;primary school system. Teachers, parents and students have been focused on university entrance. At the end of each year 11 and 12 more than half of the students have been finishing their post&hyphen;primary education disappointed and disillusioned. In the case of those lucky enough to get places at university, attrition rates have soared to between 26 and 55 per cent. Meanwhile, we have seen the number of young people entering skilled trades plummeting and the youth unemployment rates rising, especially in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is addressing the problem of the deskilling of parts of the population&mdash;the skills shortages, the maldistribution of the skills that we have in this country, the irrel 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evancy of much of the training that went on before, and the clumping and clustering of skilled labour in areas where there has been an oversupply for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker referred to the new apprenticeship scheme that has just been announced by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). This scheme is one of the most essential parts of our new order which will make sure that we have people trained for life. It is an initiative of national significance. It aims to refocus the educational thinking of a generation of people badly and sadly served by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not simply look at what happens to our students as they leave the post&hyphen;primary school sector. We understand that we have to tackle the skills needs of Australia back in the  schools, where students first begin to form their views about careers and about their own potential. So the Commonwealth is providing $187 million over four years for a school to work package. Fifty million dollars will be available in 1998 specifically to expand vocational education in secondary schools. This funding has several components. Twenty million dollars will be allocated in 1997&hyphen;98 for expansion of the vocational education and training program in schools. This program was introduced by Labor, but they left it at such low levels of resourcing that the actual numbers involved in VET in schools were inadequate. Approximately $7 million will be put into 1997-98 funds for the school to work program. There will be $9.9 million in 1997-98 for the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation; $10 million in 1997-98 for the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation workplace coordination funding; and $5 million in 1997-98 for jobs pathways programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Murray there has now been a response to this government's initiatives and the funding that is helping them to achieve the goals that they need to achieve for their young people. There are altogether 18 government and independent colleges offering post&hyphen;primary education and, of these, half are now offering vocational education and training as part of their programs. All 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7832"> programs commenced within the last year or so. For example, Numurkah Secondary College is in the first year of its program. When they considered the needs of their local industry, they saw career paths and a clear need for training for young people in the fields of agriculture and engineering training that would enable people to remain in regional communities, thereby ensuring the continuation of the social and physical infrastructure necessary to keep those communities intact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In talking to these young students, you cannot help but be struck by their commitment to their chosen fields, their enthusiasm, which comes from taking part in a real life education experience, and their realistic but, at the same time, lofty goals in life. These students are already fielding job offers from local businesses, who are keen to pick them up before they get lured away to other areas with skills shortages like ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the NBEET report for 1995, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a national education training strategy for rural Australia</EMPHASIS>, it was noted that there are proportionately higher concentrations of demographic groupings in rural and regional Australia which are underrepresented generally in education and training. These are Aboriginal people, early school leavers, persons with no post&hyphen;school qualifications and low income earners. Statistics show, too, that when our rural students do get to universities, while they are overrepresented in agricultural related courses, they are substantially underrepresented in courses of all other descriptions&mdash;in medicine, in law, in business, in architecture and in courses that would give them the qualifications that would help them to come back and fill those positions that we currently are facing huge shortages in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind you that this is a 1995 report. The report said that limited employment opportunities in many rural areas contributed to low participation in education training. That no longer is the case. We have those job opportunities in our areas now, but we need to create the training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Labor do about the 1995 report? Unfortunately, not very much. Decades of inflexibility and irrelevancy in the vocational education and training system took their toll. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The past is now with us; it has come back to haunt us. Today's crisis in skilled labour shortages in my electorate was well and truly entrenched 10 years ago when rural electorates were heading into recession. They had, of course, the huge costs of employment of labour; they had the task of putting on an apprentice that involved them in complicated red tape. There were costs associated with putting on a young person. There was, of course, the relative lack of control a company had over the formal training portion of the apprenticeship itself. So, for many small businesses, surviving in the short term meant not taking on apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have businesses, such as our metal fabricators, who want to participate in the extraordinary opportunities now growing in Asia for processed food. Some of these manufacturers have positions now for 40 or 50 metal fabricators that they cannot fill. They are trying to find trainees for these positions and, at this point in time, after a decade of neglect of the system, those trainees are simply not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is going to be an enormous challenge for an area such as Murray, which has had substantial overseas offshore investment in our food manufacturing area, to find the young people to do the training and to make sure that the systems will deliver to them the training that gives them the opportunities now presenting offshore in the supermarket to Asia scenario. We have food manufacturing demands that we can meet only if we have the skilled labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the draft report by the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, we are now making up for lost time. Vocational education and training in schools programs, for years 11 and 12 across Australia, in 1997&mdash;that is, this year&mdash;now involve 38,867 students. This represents a 116 per cent increase over 1996, and a very significant increase from the 2,815 students involved in the ASTF&hyphen;supported VET in the previous program in schools in 1995, when Labor had their hands on the wheel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Batman, that Labor did it well. If it was being done so very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7833"> well, why are we seeing right now a 116 per cent increase in participation in these vocational education programs in schools?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growth in these programs from 1996 to 1997 is significant, both in metropolitan and non&hyphen;metropolitan areas. Particularly, I am pleased to see this growth in the Loddon&hyphen;Campaspe and Mallee areas. Loddon&hyphen;Campaspe is entirely in the electorate of Murray, and parts of Mallee are too. Those are the areas which have seen the highest levels of youth unemployment in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are now putting funding towards these VET schemes in both metropolitan and rural areas, in regional schools we may need to give particular additional support as the schools try to establish the schemes. It is more difficult for their teachers to get access to professional development. It is more difficult for our young students to observe a diversity of local role models, given that the populations are smaller. Students who are in remote situations may never have interacted with a whole range of professions that are found in metropolitan areas. So I am sure that, as we move along, we will see our government looking at the need to address additional funds to support regional vocational education and training in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always been more difficult to access and participate in education and training if you are from regional Australia. But this is not a new understanding. In 1994, the National Board of Employment Education and Training released a report that condemned the Labor government's achievements given the amount of participation access that could be tracked in terms of rural and remote Australian students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national board found, for example, that in non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia there were very special needs, that in fact access and participation of regional students in higher education was declining&mdash;the only sector in Australia to have declining access to higher education. The study also determined, from the results of a survey of TAFE participation, that students in non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia were less able to participate in TAFE than students in the state of Victoria at large. The students were less likely to have completed secondary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education; they were less likely to have had experience of higher education; they were less likely to have taken middle level courses, and they were more likely to be studying in external mode. We all know that students who are only able to study through external mode suffer lower levels of completion of courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That information was on the record in 1994. What did Labor do about that? Unfortunately, next to nothing. That is why, of course, we see in this House only two Labor representatives of regional Australia. Regional Australia got very sick and tired of being treated as second&hyphen;rate citizens. They were sick and tired of seeing their young students denied the access that they should have had&mdash;the same rates of access as other students&mdash;to higher education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report in 1994 recommended that traineeship places should be expanded and targeted at 15&hyphen; to 25&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in regional areas. That did not happen. It said that training should include basic general education, vocational education and employment. As we saw, under Labor's VET programs the participation rates of schools were minimal. In 1994, we were told traineeship programs should be further developed on an industry basis with programs controlled by employers, unions and workers in the industry rather than specifically just in educational institutions. In other words, it was calling for a participatory, coordinated, cooperative approach. That, of course, did not happen. It is happening now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, this report said a large number of vocational education centres should be established in regional areas using existing educational facilities and new facilities where needed. That was quite a few years ago&mdash;in 1994. Since then, the numbers of regional students participating in higher education have continued to decline. I think that is an indictment of the previous government. They should be feeling very ashamed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important part of vocational educational and training in schools is, of course, the opportunity for students to take part in work placements. In 1996, with our initiatives, 38,867 students in Australia were able to do just that, and 6,401 students completed a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7834"> work placement component of more than 20 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did we get to this situation? We have had a massive maldistribution of skills throughout Australia. We have had a cultural cringe about apprenticeship training and technical training compared with a goal of going to university. Tragically, decades ago all that started to happen. Victorians in particular will remember that one of the premiers of the day, Joan Kirner, abolished the name `technical schools' from our vocabulary. Technical schools were very substantially encouraged to amalgamate with the high schools to become so&hyphen;called `secondary colleges'. The name `technical schools' largely disappeared throughout the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message given to the student was, `Look, if you really want to get on in life, make sure you're going to something called a college, and make sure that you don't get tainted as someone who's studying in an area which will lead to a skilled trade.' Of course, it is no surprise that we saw a significant decline in the number of young Australians commencing apprenticeships. In 1988&hyphen;89, 62,678 commenced apprenticeships, including 5,217 who began metal fitting and machining apprenticeships and 1,252 who began horticulture apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 1990&hyphen;91, the number of people beginning apprenticeships had dropped by about one&hyphen;third. In 1993&hyphen;94, the figure had climbed back somewhat, although there were still far fewer than in 1988&hyphen;89. In 1993&hyphen;94, there were 3,430 metal trade apprentices&mdash;1,718 fewer than six years earlier. The food manufacturing area in particular, which is the growing area of opportunity in the electorate of Murray, is where we need the work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is addressing those needs. This government knows that the economy needs skilled people, with the will to be mobile around the country. We know that the past is haunting us, but we will overcome those difficulties. I commend this bill to the House, because that is what the nation expects and demands of this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Werriwa (Mr Latham). The government's legislation amends previous legislative amounts payable to the states through the Australian National Training Authority for cost supplementation and effects of budget changes and legislates an amount for 1999. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Act gives the minister the power to make payments up to a maximum legislated amount. However, while I will be referring quite extensively to figures and costs and how this will affect my state of New South Wales in particular, the key issue of the debate is the danger of stopping the reform process begun by the Labor government through short-sighted cost cutting and failure to properly invest in educating and skilling Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following on from last year's cuts to vocational education and training, the  Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997  implements a further reduction of $20 million per calendar year, as announced in the budget. These cuts are being called `benchmarking efficiencies', aimed at encouraging states to benchmark their vocational education activities against the most cost&hyphen;effective states. The coalition government's cost cutting exercise for vocational education and training will once again lead to uncertainty and stop&hyphen;start policies in this vital area of educating and skilling the Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new ANTA agreement, the minister wants an efficiency dividend of 100,000 extra enrolments to be produced each year. At the same time, the government wants the states to meet the cost of training places for unemployed 16&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds previously on unemployment benefits. This would require the states to fund over 262,000 training places at $6,000 per place, totalling $1,572 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cutback and additional responsibilities will create the possibility of derailing the training reform process begun during the term of the Hawke Labor government. This process reflects the Labor government's determination to complement its commitment to restructuring the Australian economy by revitalising education and training policies and programs to develop a highly adaptable and skilled 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7835"> work force. This program is now under even greater threat. Worse still is the fact that these cutbacks are being implemented at a time of high youth unemployment with a dramatic reduction in the number of jobs for young unskilled school leavers. The economy and industry are still undergoing considerable change with new and more demanding requirements of the modern workplace meaning higher than ever levels of vocational training have to be achieved, with the work force being required to be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed in a highly competitive global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now find that, against these increased demands on the various state training systems, the government is reducing funding. What will the government achieve by these cutbacks? We are advised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> provided by the Parliamentary Library that the reductions aim to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide an incentive to the states and territories to achieve efficiency  gains in their VET operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost effective state.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This ignores the reality of vocational training where, quite clearly, each state has to respond to the needs of their own particular industries. New South Wales, with a diverse industrial and manufacturing base, would have different benchmarking requirements to, say, South Australia, where the motor industry is its main manufacturing activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the Northern Territory election, and I pose the question: if we are looking at the cost&hyphen;effective states, and Victoria at $8.30 compares with the Northern Territory at $20.30 per unit cost, how much are the people of the Northern Territory going to really suffer? Or was there some special deal offered to last through the election campaign, to become a non-core deal now that the election in the Northern Territory is over?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, we can reasonably expect that the more efficiently a state benchmarked, the more likely it is to receive funding cuts. Again, we are advised by the Parliamentary Library:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While details about conditions of the Commonwealth's offer are unavailable, reports on statements by the minister suggests that new places, better 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> targeting, improved standards and greater responsiveness to industry are likely to be the criteria to be considered during funding negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are all worthwhile objectives, but who will be making the final decisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the professionals in the field are very concerned that the effects of the implementation of this bill will impact severely on quality teaching and learning conditions in TAFE. For instance, the New South Wales government's budget provides for some 5,000 extra student places in TAFE in 1998 but, with the likelihood of less money, the increased places with less money would impact adversely on student&hyphen;teacher ratios and maintenance of existing facilities and increased facilities for the extra student places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also surprised that those National Party members who represent country areas are not making very loud noises to their government colleagues about the effects that these measures are likely to have on their country TAFE colleges, which are going to be stretched to the very limit by these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my own experience as a member of the New South Wales TAFE Council, I know the great role that TAFE colleges play in regional and country areas, not only in the areas of training but also as a great focus for a lot of community activities. No doubt, this cutback will severely impact on their role in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TAFE scheme is a real success story in Australia. It has adapted to commercialism and competitive practices; it is meeting the diverse training needs of industry and enterprise; and it is participating successfully in delivering vocational education and training to the international markets, particularly in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Sydney, three major TAFE colleges&mdash;at Blacktown, Mount Druitt and Werrington&mdash;are providing training for the international market in the subjects of information technology, engineering, accounting and business studies, and hospitality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of efforts by various governments to increase private provision of vocational training, TAFE, the public provider, has delivered the largest share of training. It has a proud record and has shown an enormous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7836"> ability to become flexible to meet the needs of various government labour market programs such as traineeships whilst maintaining its very high technical and academic standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised by the TAFE unions that there has been excellent research done which shows, for example, that 80 per cent of TAFE graduates achieved their main aim in undertaking their course. Some 78 per cent believed that their TAFE course was relevant to their job. Of employers, 75 per cent thought that the skills acquired were relevant to the needs of their organisation. That is a very important figure, because that shows that TAFE is providing a service to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat the figures: 75 per cent of employers thought that the skills acquired were relevant to the needs of their organisation; 73 per cent of employers said that the training was cost effective; and two&hyphen;thirds of employers said that the training resulted in productivity gains for their own organisation. That is another very important figure in showing that employers are recognising the great role that TAFE is playing in increasing productivity in their own organisations. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would any government therefore try to harass such an organisation by these funding cuts? Is it so ideologically driven that it cannot bear to have a successful government body remain in operation? Is it a belief that everything done by a public servant of any description is to be regarded as bad and that all private enterprise is good?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned at the general thrust that is being given to really downgrade the TAFE system. The cuts contained in this legislation merely serve to underline that issue. When one lines up the cuts with the passion for a training market in vocational education and training, the concerns become even more intense. I intend to quote from information provided to me, once again, from the New South Wales Teachers Federation. It relates to AEU briefing paper No. 3, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Latest statistics show that TAFE was responsible for 92.1% of the annual student contact hours funded by the public in 1996. Private providers were responsible for 2.2% 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The zealots driving the market will use the figures above to invigorate their efforts. Firstly, they will be hoping that user choice, commencing in January 1998 and involving some 20% or $500 million of recurrent funding in VET will finally get the market operating. ANTA's plan for user choice is to ignore both public and private providers and concentrate on enterprise-based training with the enterprise as the provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can you have a market if private companies are both purchasers and providers. As long as public funds can be used in this way we can expect a turning away from public provision irrespective of how efficient and responsive public provision is.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, we can expect greater emphasis on competitive tendering especially in states such as Queensland and Western Australia. Competitive tendering will make TAFE funding problematic and impact negatively on staffing profiles thus</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">further casualising TAFE teaching.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">By way of example, a family member had been working full&hyphen;time at TAFE for four years, yet he was still a casual, with no annual leave, no sick leave and, most important of all, as he had a young family, no permanency. Is this the way to treat highly qualified TAFE teachers? I would suggest not. The briefing paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contestable funding brings TAFE under the Trade Practices Act. This act was intended to regulate business conducted for profit not organisations such as TAFE with their social and community obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the introduction of third party access will give TAFE competitors access to TAFE buildings and infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, the teachers have a biased interest in this issue, but it cannot be denied that TAFE staff have provided a magnificent service to Australia as a whole over a great many years. The subtle and not so subtle attacks on this system are a disgrace and give no recognition to the valuable role that TAFE has played in assisting industry to become more competitive and its work force to become more skilled and versatile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having spoken in general terms concerning the budget cuts to vocational education and training, I would like to turn to the implications of these budget cuts for my own state of New South Wales. I am indebted to the office of the New South Wales Minister for Education for this information.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7837">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reductions in VET funding for New South Wales will impact on the state's ability to meet the demand for vocational education and training. The total reduction in national VET funding of $20 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $72 million for the period 1997&hyphen;98 to 2000&hyphen;2001 will mean a loss to New South Wales of $6.72 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $24.19 million over 1997&hyphen;98 to 2000&hyphen;2001 on a population share basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that the cut in ANTA funds be offset by state efficiency gains. This ignores the fact that New South Wales has been achieving significant efficiencies in VET. There are major difficulties with benchmarking efficiencies between states and territories because of the lack of comparability of data. New South Wales has consistently taken up this issue with the Commonwealth and ANTA. New South Wales would favour an alternative method for distributing the $20 million cut, as would most other states and territories. The favoured alternative is to base the cut on a relative population share&mdash;of the 15&hyphen; to 65&hyphen;year&hyphen;old population&mdash;so that all states and territories bear the cuts equitably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The absence of additional growth funds beyond 1997 will significantly reduce the VET system's capacity in New South Wales to respond to growth in VET arising from population changes and industry growth and restructuring. Most importantly, something which the federal government has possibly forgotten, there is the need for additional training relating to the Olympic Games development, which no doubt will create additional employment, but before employment can take place, the work force has to be trained. This is an area that will suffer considerably because of this reduction in funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further reduction in labour market program funds, on top of the $1.86 million over four years announced last year, represents a loss to New South Wales of over $10 million in 1997. The cessation of labour market programs in March 1998 will have a severe impact on New South Wales and will increase the number of people seeking VET funded training places, including new apprenticeships. Given that the Commonwealth is not providing additional growth funding, this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> places great pressure on the New South Wales VET system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although $24 million has been allocated out of the $415 million for the new national network of one&hyphen;stop shops and $14 million for group training schemes in 1997&hyphen;98, there does not appear to be any provision for implementation infrastructure or training delivery to support the anticipated increase in apprenticeship and traineeship numbers. Once again, this is an area of concern. The government are talking about these additional trainees and apprenticeships, but they are not providing funding for the TAFE system to support them and train those new apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding to support new apprenticeships appears mainly to provide for an increase in incentives for employers and employment support services, not for TAFE. Lack of funding to VET systems for the implementation of new apprenticeships will create a significant burden on New South Wales resources. Infrastructure costs include the implementation of user choice, monitoring performance, reporting, and establishing and monitoring new recognition structures. The Commonwealth is expecting these costs to be absorbed by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The planned further reduction of one per cent in university operating grants in 2000, on top of the cuts already borne by the higher education sector, will deny places to potential university students and direct more of them to seek their education and training within the VET sector, thus placing more load on a sector that has already been cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996&hyphen;97 Commonwealth budget, there was a net reduction of national recurrent funding for vocational education and training of $133.4 million, of which $44.8 million was lost by New South Wales. This situation has now been compounded in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget by a $20 million reduction in Commonwealth grants. The $20 million cut represents around 0.7 per cent of total VET expenditure and will have a significant impact on TAFE New South Wales, whose share will be approximately $7 million annually or $24 million over four years. The cessation of growth funds for VET will further reduce the number of student places in TAFE.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7838">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the introduction of the new apprenticeship and traineeship system in association with user choice will have a significant budgetary impact upon TAFE New South Wales in 1998. This impact will increase in subsequent years as user choice arrangements are extended and further private vocational education and training providers enter the market. It is estimated that user choice arrangements in 1998 could affect 12,000 TAFE student places at a cost of $40 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, capital funds to New South Wales, excluding funds for skills centres and Aboriginal educational projects, fell from $76.8 million in the 1996 calendar year to $62.6 million in 1997. The reduction of $14.2 million will continue into future years and therefore represents a permanent decrease in capital funding of some 18 per cent. Based on the average cost of around $1,500 to $2,000 per square metre of building space, this equates to a loss of around 7,000 to 9,500 square metres of space each year. After allowing for building refurbishment, based on previous years experience, the number of new student places that have been lost is around 710 per year or 2,130 new enrolments each year. This represents 6,390 new student places over a three&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having given my own state a fairly good run, which I make no apologies for, I would like to conclude with some remarks from the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood, who is quite clearly very critical of the present federal government. He is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 13 June as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian Minister for Training yesterday led an attack on the Federal Government's TAFE funding plan, claiming it may lead to the dismantling of the system and the introduction of university&hyphen;style fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Phil Honeywood and other state training ministers, meeting in Darwin, said in a joint resolution that they doubted they could produce 500,000 new places over five years, called for in the plan by better using $300 million of funds.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the future of Dunkley's young people is always uppermost in my mind, I regard the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vocational education and training amendment as one of the most important proposals to come before this House in this session. I noted from the comments of the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), who spoke extensively about what sounded like the difficulties he was having with his own state government in New South Wales, that one of the key tenets of the sorts of program the government is pursuing is that it is not a TAFE only sector. There are other options, and certainly the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is to be commended on encouraging industry groups and the like to explore training delivery alternatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that, in my own electorate, a high school in its current incarnation, Monterey Secondary College&mdash;things change as we age&mdash;has in fact quite a respectable motor trades workshop. It has the capacity to be more involved in training through that venue; and now, with the changes that the government has implemented, the opportunity to mesh the vocational training with secondary schooling is available and possible. It is something that the schools in my electorate are taking a great deal of interest in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remarked in my maiden speech to the House 15 months ago that the presence in Dunkley of institutions like Peninsula TAFE, Monash University's Peninsula campus and the broader educational infrastructure made it quite well suited as an academic centre of some prominence. I talked of how strategic alliances between our educational institutions and our primary and sunrise industries had the potential to enable Dunkley by the bay to excel in areas like clean and green food production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I did not say in my first speech was that a year and a half on it is becoming clearer just how the government's plan is beginning to produce a demand driven training system; a system of education that is moving from being often largely concerned with providing students with a liberal education&mdash;and that is not to be criticised&mdash;more towards one that provides them with the wherewithal to find employment. We need to bear in mind that 70 per cent of the students 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7839"> in my electorate of Dunkley do not go on to university. They have to consider other career options and the government is putting in place strategies that will aid their search for employment. While we have the taxpayers still funding, on average, three-quarters of every university degree, people who do not choose to go down that path currently are not getting the sorts of attention and assistance that this government believes they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all aware also of how the former government ran down apprenticeships to one of the lowest levels since the war. That was a disgraceful measure for them to simply turn their back on. When you look forward to the future you realise that we need a very skilled labour force if we are going to compete. If we are not investing in the vocational skills that are so important to our future, particularly in the fast-growing services area, how are we going to be well positioned to provide the jobs for the young people who are leaving the education system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A quality national training system built into all industries has a critical role in establishing Australian businesses, services and products as leaders in the worldwide market. Quality training is about people: equipping them with skills and matching them with the needs of employers. That is precisely what the minister has been talking about. I understand that the personal attacks directed at him by earlier contributors just illustrate how little grip the Labor Party has on these issues facing the nation and these 70 per cent of young people who quite rightly believe that Labor has turned its back on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people in Dunkley need any reminder about which group has the best chance of obtaining ongoing employment, the ABS noted in its October 1995, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Educational Attainment and Employment: Victoria</EMPHASIS>, that seven in every 10 unemployed people had no post-school qualifications compared with 52 per cent of people with a job. This is not advocating credentialism&mdash;collecting pieces of paper just for the heck of it. It is about accumulating skills and competencies&mdash;I see you like that, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;that enable young people to present themselves to employers as productive persons in the workplace. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> another area where this government has taken some very important initiatives. The measure that recognises that apprenticeships need to be renewed, upgraded and made more responsive to today's economy is one of the most excellent initiatives that Dr Kemp has introduced&mdash;and there have been many of them, so it is quite a compliment to point that one out as one of pure excellence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If your training schedule and the program that employer and trainee work through have an emphasis on a greater level of training in the earlier part of their employment, to enable those skills to be accumulated and to enable those qualifications and credentials to be obtained, then that should be encouraged. All we are saying to employers is, `You pay for the productive time of that young person, for the time that you are getting value out of them so that that person is attractive to your business, and the government will make a contribution to top up the salary that is paid to make sure that it meets national training wages.' That is a very important measure&mdash;to recognise that this concept of training is not solely about the trainee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need providers of training, which we are talking about here today, but we need employers willing to participate in that structure as well. It is a recognition that the government has made and that it is actually doing something about it. Again, it is another reason to compliment Dr Kemp on his very visionary and forthright approach to this portfolio. It just disappoints me greatly that those opposite can only resort to denigrating him personally rather than addressing the issues before this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, 1997 Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training will rise to $909.263 million&mdash;a bit under a $1 billion&mdash;with an extra 43,000 student places expected to be created this year from Commonwealth moneys, apart from an extra 12,000 places created by funding from other sources such as the states. The 13 May budget provided for an overall increase in vocational education and training funding of $144 million or 12 per cent. While funding through the Australian National Training Authority to the states will decline by $20 million in 1998, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7840"> this should be measured against the very substantial efficiency gains that all ministers have agreed will be likely as the Commonwealth's plans are put into practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need only concern ourselves with the average cost per training place throughout various states to understand that there are opportunities to generate some efficiencies. It would be negligent of this government not to work with the state governments in securing those efficiencies. The speaker before me, the member for Greenway, mentioned the contribution of the Victorian minister, Mr Honeywood. That is understandable. Those who have been involved with politics for some time understand the role posturing has to play by state governments that are looking for the Commonwealth to make a greater contribution to the cost of its activities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From estimates made by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, there are about 160,000 Australians who currently have an apprenticeship or a traineeship. Dr Kemp recently launched, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne which stretch from Kew and Whittlesea to Portsea and south of Pakenham, a new apprenticeship training one&hyphen;stop shop in the electorate of my friend and colleague the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi). That is important because that region alone accounted for just under 4,000 apprenticeship and around 2,000 traineeship commencements in 1995&hyphen;96, with a further 12,850 apprentices in training. This is important business. This is why we need someone as competent as Dr Kemp to handle the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, of Peninsula TAFE's 9,600 students, almost 4,900 came from the five major suburbs in the Dunkley electorate&mdash;that is, Frankston, Seaford, Langwarrin, Mount Eliza and Mornington, all of which I am very proud to represent. The age profile of students from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this TAFE is also of interest, with just under half aged between 15 and 24. This indicates the important role that Peninsula TAFE plays in equipping our young people with vocational and, dare I say, life skills, which are so much a part of the training offered there. Almost one&hyphen;quarter of the TAFE's enrolments in 1996 were in engineering and in personal services, showing the degree to which the local industry and tertiary industries, such as tourism and hospitality, are dependent on these sorts of training facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might dwell on that issue for one moment. In the hospitality industry, as in many other service industries, there are no traditional apprenticeships. If we had left the responsibility for managing this important area of our future in the hands of the Labor Party, they would probably still not be recognised in that formal training structure. Dr Kemp has introduced a regime where industry is encouraged to work with trained providers to get accredited training programs in place and to provide new apprenticeships in industries where the new job opportunities are for the people of this country. He is to be commended for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge one of my dear friends, who is a qualified sheet metal worker, and the continuing importance of those more traditional trades to our economy. This is particularly so when we hear from areas in Western Australia, for example, where highly skilled boilermakers and the like cannot be found to support the industrial growth in that part of the country. Again, that highlights the decline in apprenticeships and vocational training that occurred under the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a continuation of the government's plans first announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 ministerial statement by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training entitled `Training for real jobs'. Rather than continuing Labor's largely program driven assistance, where you set up some programs and try to squeeze people into those programs, notwithstanding that they might not be responsive to employment requirements or to job opportunities, the focus of the coalition government is on issues such as expanding 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7841"> these opportunities for young people in new industries and in new occupations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A former minister who served during Labor's 13 years suggested that Labor did not do enough about accommodating the needs of those not intending to proceed directly to university. May I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in my electorate 70 per cent of young people choose not to go on to university. This is why these sorts of reforms that the government is pursuing are so important. I am delighted that, through this amendment, many other elements of the government's plan for young Australians will also be addressed, remedying the regrettable Labor legacy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to compliment the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training for taking the time on Friday, 15 August to visit my electorate. Not only did the minister meet a wide cross&hyphen;section of Dunkley school council presidents, principals and careers teachers at the Peninsula Institute of TAFE but we then went to the Langwarrin Secondary College, where we were hosted by the principal and talked with careers teachers about the sorts of challenges they are facing at the coalface. It was comforting for me to hear from those people dealing with the difficult job of aiding young people in their transition from education to employment about how responsive and how welcome these reforms are. They just cannot get enough of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have PVET, the Peninsula Vocational Education and Training organisation, which consists of a cluster of schools on the Mornington Peninsula. These schools are very driven and very with it in terms of the requirements of their students, and they are very understanding of the important role that the education system has in aiding that transition from schooling to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I also thank Mr Don McKenzie, the Director of Peninsula TAFE, and Doug Moore and Stephen Robin for their organisational skills and hospitality. Similarly, at the Langwarrin Secondary College, the minister found his more than one hour of discussions with the careers teachers very productive, due in no small measure to the good work of Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bob Loader, principal of the secondary college and chair of PVET, along with Sylvanie Morgan, assistant principal at the secondary college, and Lorraine Rawlings from the school council, who also showed the interest that the school community in the Dunkley electorate has for these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said that one of the key messages he was taking around Australia was that we need to be informing young people that they can go anywhere through a new apprenticeship. The career and lifestyle choices that are available to them are enhanced by the approach to vocational training and education that is being pursued by Dr Kemp. I found the minister's remark especially appropriate for the Dunkley community, because we have a lower percentage&mdash;around 30 per cent&mdash;of young people taking up the university option than the national average, which is around 37 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister said in the House earlier, the coalition government's new apprenticeships will help young people to achieve a rewarding career. That is what this is all about&mdash;getting young people into the jobs that they find satisfying and rewarding. Employers will see their businesses become more productive and competitive if they take on an apprentice, particularly in the new apprenticeship framework, where they are paying only for the productive time of that apprentice while also gaining the benefits of their productive time, for which the business is paying. It is attractive for business to pay for productive time and to have the government step in to support these new traineeships with a top&hyphen;up of income so that the trainee can enjoy the national training wage. The government has made a long&hyphen;term commitment to training the young people of Australia so that our companies and small businesses, and micro businesses in particular, can continue to be great contributors to our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Dr Kemp observed, it is critical that children are able to read properly by the fourth year of primary school. The agreement he has secured with every state and territory to test children in years 1 and 3 for literacy and numeracy skills is most important. The minister alluded to the great pressures that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7842"> schools face to add all manner of items to their curricula, but literacy and numeracy remain the main game as far as I am concerned, and as far as the government, parents and students are concerned. With those core competencies, you can tap into the other training and life opportunities that are available. Without those core skills, participation in the workplace and in the community, being able to read training manuals, being able to understand safety instructions in the workplace and being able to comprehend orders that come through from customers are made very difficult. This is why we need to invest in these core competencies of literacy and numeracy. It is a commendable effort that complements what the bill before the House today is seeking to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Linkages are a key part of the coalition government's plan for vocational education and training. It is appropriate that the Peninsula Institute of TAFE, whose aim is to achieve excellence in education, continually stresses the development of strong links with industry. For instance, its relatively new $7 million automotive and metal fabrication facility at Fletcher Street on the Frankston campus is a key contributor to the service industry in Frankston, Seaford and Mornington, all areas that I continually remind people generally do not have large Boeing-size employers. We rely on some 8,000 Dunkley small and micro businesses to generate present and future job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The school based apprenticeships and traineeships that the minister for schools recently launched are part of what I would like to call the quiet revolution in secondary education. These will serve to bring the schools more closely into contact with their local business communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the comments made by the member for Greenway, who seems to think that the only way you can get vocational training is through the TAFE system. It is not the only way. It has a great head start&mdash;it has years of tradition and skill in that area&mdash;but the government is saying that it need not be the sole provider of that training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other forms of delivery of those training opportunities are something that are to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> encouraged. A number of schools in my electorate have put their hands up and said, `Maybe that's something we would like to be involved with.' The Commonwealth is committed to providing schools with more resources to undertake this new role, and it is encouraging schools to form clusters so that they can tender for these opportunities where they are appropriate for their local conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister said to his Dunkley audiences, the initial trials of this exciting concept appear to have been successful at two Brisbane high schools. For the sake of our children in Dunkley and throughout the country, we have to institute these sorts of changes, because we cannot focus solely on the minority of students who go on to university. All young people in this country deserve to be invested in. All young people in this country deserve to have the encouragement of their government working with them, and their schools, their parents and their local employment communities, to see that they have opportunities ahead of them and to make getting up in the morning and striving for a better life something that is really worth pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has backed these plans with a budget allocation of $187 million over the next four years, while still paying back $5 billion of the debt that Labor racked up on the Commonwealth bankcard. Unlike Labor, we do not believe in adding to the nation's debt by recklessly throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at programs that basically try to squeeze people into them rather than having the programs respond to the needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents are concerned about many issues, including the standards of literacy and numeracy, and the government is responding to that. Provided the information is publicly aired in a realistic manner, I think the testing that is being considered will be a helpful tool in enabling parents to make choices about the education for their children and to encourage the schools themselves to excel. I see a net benefit right across the education sector with the  reforms  that  Dr  Kemp  is  seeking  to introduce.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7843">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Training must be demand driven as far as possible. With employers being able to select the training that meets their business needs from 1 January 1998 under the user choice system, $500 million annually will be available from Commonwealth and state sources to divide among public and private education providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Change of this type always brings questions. Established institutions like Peninsula TAFE are already looking ahead, and I commend its director and the whole board for their forward looking approach. I was pleased to be at the launch of their `Strategic Directions 1996-2000' document, which identified their key missions as providing quality services and responsiveness to their customers. I have been very pleased to support their efforts in attracting international students to this area. I understand we have the daughter of an Indonesian minister currently studying a business course in the electorate of Dunkley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TAFEs may have to change their names or have other changes to deal with as a result of the current Ramler review commissioned by Minister Kemp's Victorian counterpart, the Hon. Phil Honeywood MLA. I have been assured that these sorts of changes are geared at providing a more responsive, more able and more capable TAFE sector in this state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an area of great passion for me. I could keep talking for a long time about the many other reforms the government has introduced to complement this new national training framework, but I will conclude by commending the bill to the House and I look forward to a very positive and constructive contribution from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) as we go through this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an incentive to the States to achieve efficiency gains in their VET operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost effective States.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is longwinded code for cuts. The government assumes, as it does in many other areas of social policy, that current programs and administrations are inefficient. That is the basis for its understanding of the needs of vocational education. It has produced no evidence to support this view. It appears to rely on the fact that some states, when measured in terms of recurrent costs per curriculum hour, have unit costs which are much lower than others, ranging from $8.30 in Victoria to $20.30 in the Northern Territory, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>  which we all have available to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> itself acknowledges, this is a very crude measure. It takes no account of factors such as population density, the proportion of students who are from various disadvantaged backgrounds and so on. Nor does it take any account of the measure of quality of services provided. The whole issue of benchmarking is fraught with difficulty. Anybody with experience in this area recognises this and is accordingly cautious in its 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7844"> use and inclined to use it in conjunction with a range of other measures. Not so this government. It has been unable to produce any other guidelines to assist the Australian National Training Authority in distributing funds. These are still to be negotiated with the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ANTA will be forced to rely solely on state and territory records in meeting efficiency benchmarks. These records show that on average over the last five years most states have achieved a baseline efficiency gain of one per cent a year. This would fund only 10 per cent of the government's proposed new places. Even a continuation of the one per cent efficiency gain is in doubt, given the other constraints on the TAFE sector, such as the efficiency dividend required annually by state and territory treasuries and the current round of enterprise bargaining, which will require efficiency targets of between three per cent and 14 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is in danger of exacerbating the difficulties facing the TAFE sector if it proceeds with plans to increase TAFE places over the next five years while at the same time enforcing these funding cuts. The minister suggested an additional 100,000 places a year over each of the next five years to be funded by `better targeting of existing funding', that is, of course, current funding less $20 million a year. This is a nonsense. It again assumes that major inefficiencies exist in the training and further education sector which, if overcome, would provide a sufficiently large pool to fund these 100,000 places a year&mdash;a figure which the minister estimates would cost $300 million each year. How the minister has arrived at this figure, we have no idea. Certainly not through discussions with those with the clearest understanding of the sector, that is, those who work in the TAFEs&mdash;the teachers and administrators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who would actually fill these 100,000 places? The Australian Bureau of Statistics calculated in 1996 that 62,000 people were unable to gain a TAFE place. Of these, 7,000 cancelled their applications, 11,000 were not eligible for the courses for which they applied, 6,000 applied too late and 21,000 gave `other reasons' for their failure to gain a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place. Almost 30,000 were unable to gain a place because places were full&mdash;too many, I agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that some added demand will result from the government's plans to force more young people to remain at school or to go on looking for vocational education. The other plank of the government's efforts, as far as 16 and 17 year olds are concerned, is to deprive them of any income if they choose to leave school without having a job. The government itself estimates that this is around 27,000 students a year. Nor are the government's new traineeships and apprenticeship arrangements likely to result in demands on the TAFE sector of the magnitude suggested by the government's target for new places, given the states' reluctance to support them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet again the government is providing simplistic solutions to very complex problems. Very sadly, it will be our young people who will have to bear the brunt of government indifference and incompetence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the government's grand plan for the expansion of traineeships and apprenticeships, certainly as put by the minister, one would have expected more detail about how it intends to fund them. The states fear, with some justification, that they will be expected to do so. Their view is summed up by the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood, in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the coalition's announcement . . . of 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships was so poorly designed, it might force the Government into setting up a Higher Education Contribution Scheme for TAFE colleges.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When he was talking about the apprenticeship scheme, he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was unlikely to have a significant impact in Victoria because there were no funds to create TAFE places.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apprentices are required to attend a TAFE college or post&hyphen;secondary training institution&mdash;which are two&hyphen;thirds funded by the states&mdash;to complete their apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7845">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Victorian government would have to find up to $54 million a year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this is just in Victoria&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to fund new TAFE places created by the scheme and the new youth allowance which would force many young people back into post&hyphen;secondary schooling.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I won't (find the money). The Premier and our government have a policy of not filling a financial hole that's been left by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Honeywood's fears appear to be well founded. Departmental advice to the minister suggests that schools will be required to cater for an additional 27,000 students per year when changes to the youth allowance take effect. It suggests an additional allocation of $140 million per year would be required as a result, but the Commonwealth has made no move to increase its contribution to schools funding. Instead, of course, that too is being cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the electorate of Jagajaga, the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE is expected, as with all other TAFEs, to provide excellent training and education while this brawl goes on. The minister needs to wake up to the fact that fights of this kind between the Commonwealth and Victoria do nothing for TAFE and do nothing for the students. They only make providing education harder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some state and territory ministers have gone so far as to suggest that the government's real aim in requiring the states to expand TAFE places while reducing their funding is to dismantle the TAFE system, thus leaving the way open for private providers to take over an increasing proportion of its work. This is a further example of the government's neglect of our public institutions and its attempts to channel public money into the private provision of services, which are motivated by ideology rather than any evidence that the private sector can provide an equivalent quality of service at a lower cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very conscious of the depths to which the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states has now sunk. Two other agreements&mdash;the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement and the Commonwealth&hyphen;state 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disability agreement&mdash;are in tatters because of the Commonwealth's unrealistic expectations of the states. They are being asked&mdash;although from the states' point of view I am sure they think they are being told&mdash;to do more with less Commonwealth support. They have been pushed to the limit and, just as in the TAFE sector, they have refused to sign new agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement, governments are operating on the basis of an interim agreement which is now into its third extension. The situation is even worse in the disability area. The Commonwealth&hyphen;state disability agreement has been operating on the basis of an interim agreement renewed each month since the minister unilaterally and without any notice, let alone consultation with the states, withdrew support from a one&hyphen;year interim agreement to which she had previously agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resulting hiatus is, of course, creating considerable anxiety and confusion to providers and participants of affected services alike and is preventing any long&hyphen;term planning or policy development. On the issue of vocational education and training, we see a similar breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When informed of the minister's plan for 100,000 new TAFE places per year to be funded from `more effective use of existing funds', the states' reactions were predictable, though seemingly not to the minister. I have already mentioned Victoria's response but, more significantly, in a recently issued joint response, state and territory ministers said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are concerned that the Commonwealth is not providing funding to support new apprenticeships and the Common Youth Allowance initiatives, and that young people are having their expectations raised unrealistically. This concern, coming on top of the continued uncertainty surrounding the negotiation of a new five year, industry led ANTA agreement arises because of the Commonwealth's demand that states and territories agree to the arbitrary creation of an additional 500,000 student places.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are all state and territory ministers. The response continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth is requiring that these new places be funded by states and territories without 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7846"> additional Commonwealth funds and in the context of earlier funding cuts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This response was issued by eight state and territory ministers. Seven of them are supposed to be allies of the Commonwealth government&mdash;politically at least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shouldn't their reaction give the Commonwealth some pause? Shouldn't the Commonwealth take some time to reflect on the problems that are being created for TAFE and for the students? It should be the case that we see some reflection of the impact of the measures that are being considered in this legislation and the impact of other related issues being dealt with by this minister and by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be the case that the states have to carry the increase in numbers of TAFE places, and it should not be the case that states and the TAFEs have to carry the cuts that this government has introduced. It is time that the government stopped playing politics with this essential area of education and training and provided the funding that is necessary so that TAFEs all around the country can keep up with the services they provide. I commend the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like many, often look to the classics for words of wisdom and inspiration. Quotations and thoughts of the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King and Anne Bronte are as brilliant as they are timeless. There is one adage, however, which has not survived the test of time: the conventional wisdom that the only fundamentals to a good education are the three Rs. It is both unfashionable and obsolete in the context of a beneficial, contemporary education. Arithmetic, reading and writing are only the beginnings of a relevant, modern education. The development of practical skills and abilities, a pertinent knowledge of information technologies and an aptitude for further learning and professional development are supplementary qualities which today's employers require.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accelerated evolution of the Australian marketplace, small business and industry over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the last decade has changed forever our approach to vocational education and training. To illustrate this point, in decades past there were many vocations where you could literally walk off the street and into employment without any experience or training. Such is not the case today. Every job requires a particular range of skills and abilities. Indeed, in the past it has been the lament of many young talented Australians that they cannot find work because they have no experience or relevant training in the industry in which they wish to make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently, this government has set about redefining the fundamental three Rs of education&mdash;whether it be school, tertiary, vocational or training&mdash;to relevance, responsiveness and realism. A particular priority for reform for this government is vocational education and training. It is significant to note that 70 per cent of school leavers do not go to university or to TAFE on a full&hyphen;time basis. Yet, despite their number, it is a group which was marginalised by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my previous term as the member for Sturt, young people and parents alike would often ask what was being done to help that majority of school leavers who did not go to university or TAFE. There was a sense of not being recognised by the then Labor government, whose impotent attempts to reform this area of education served only to further frustrate many young people and their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These frustrations were not isolated to an unlucky few. During the recession that middle&hyphen; and lower&hyphen;class Australia had to have, national youth unemployment reached 34.9 per cent in July 1992, compared with total national unemployment of 11.1 per cent. The former Labor government's ineptitude in this particular area punished not just young people but also Australian small businesses and industries&mdash;and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) was a member of that government. A philistine approach to industrial relations policy, coupled with inadequate training programs, stifled apprenticeships and training opportunities in a great variety of small businesses and industry. To a certain extent, the effects of this era are still felt today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7847">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community challenged this government to rejuvenate vocational education and training practices, and this government has responded accordingly. The  Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997  which is presently before the House is an integral component of this response.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Before highlighting the particulars of this bill, it is important to stress to the House that this is not the only plank in our vocational education and training platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some other government initiatives to complement this bill include an allocation of $45 million towards achieving improved literacy and numeracy rates, of which I have spoken earlier in our term of government. This commitment represents a 50 per cent increase on the former Labor government's expenditure in this area. There is also a $23 million investment in professional development for teachers, including up-to-date training in industry experience, and a $74.1 million initiative aimed at developing Asian language skills among our school students, which will likewise complement this government's cohesive vocational education and training strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides for an increase in funding of $17.938 million to the 1997 amount previously appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This will take this government's commitment to vocational education and training to almost $1 billion in 1997&mdash;$909 million, to be precise&mdash;a 12 per cent increase on the former Labor government's 1995-96 vocational education and training expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is anticipated that this increase in funding will contribute to an estimated national total increase of 55,000 training places for our youth in this year alone. This bill also makes provision for an adjustment of funding amounts and arrangements for 1998-99. This adjustment is in accordance with the resolution of state and territory ministers at the Australian National Training Authority ministerial council meeting in May this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the most significant aspect of this bill is the establishment of the new apprenticeships program. New apprenticeships have been developed by this government to provide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trainees with a nationally recognised qualification which embraces the concepts of simplicity, relevance, flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of employers and trainees. Accordingly, this government also expects new apprenticeships to play a major role in ensuring that Australian small business and industry can confidently meet the challenges and demands of the global economy into the next century and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key words in defining new apprenticeships are `relevant training'. The former Labor government, as is their wont, tentatively approached vocational education and training by aimlessly throwing money around in the desperate hope that there might be some method in their madness and that some of their expenditure may end up representing good value for the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make matters worse, they could not even afford to pay for their irresponsibility, so they did what all good, irresponsible governments do: they booked it up on the national credit card. Unfortunately for Australia's youth, small business and industry and, indeed, the economy in general, the former Labor government's vocational education and training strategy was obsolete in the technological and performance oriented business culture of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New apprenticeships will address these deficiencies. The parameters under which new apprenticeships will operate can be broadly summarised as a national system which is responsive to and accessible by small and medium enterprises; ensures that training leads to quality and nationally agreed qualifications; gives business a key role in leadership and provides training which is relevant to business; has streamlined regulation delivery mechanisms to ensure responsiveness to clients; and is more efficient through the use of flexible, workable and competitive delivery arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, the coalition government has given small business, the engine room of the Australian economy, the confidence and assurance for the utilisation of this initiative. A reduced budget deficit, a revitalised economy and the abolition of the anti&hyphen;economic growth provisions of the Industrial Relations Act have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7848"> meant that small businesses and industries are no longer intimidated by the irrelevant policy shackled to them by red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nationally accredited and accepted qualifications in vocational education and training is also a long overdue initiative which will lend itself to recognising geographic diversities. This bill is responsive to both regional and urban needs. The government achieved this by recommencing the dialogue suspended during the Labor government between government and urban and rural small business and industry interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its pursuit of excellence in all forms of education, this government has encouraged small businesses and industry to assist in the development of training programs. This will ensure that the vocational education and training provided is relevant to the demands of the particular industries involved, which, in turn, will give our school leavers an appropriate preparation for employment. This government, as promised in the election, will continue to accompany and assist the youth of this nation, particularly in the formative stages of new apprenticeships. A training which is both nationally accepted and relevant will give trainees the flexibility and adaptability to pursue their own employment ambitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By simplifying and streamlining vocational education and training whilst avoiding the disproportionately large administrative expenses of Working Nation, the government has also made significant savings for the taxpayer. The new apprenticeships program is good for youth, employees and, inevitably, the economy. As a form of illustration of this assertion, the national training manager of Woolworths expects to treble their trainee numbers from a present total of 350 to a minimum of 1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the involvement of companies such as Woolworths, other small businesses and industries are likely to appoint trainees in trades such as manufacturing, maintenance, engineering and construction, graphic design, forestry, child care, youth support work, sport and recreation, and rural industries. New and expanding industries such as technology and communications, tourism and hospitality, the domestic music industry and information 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technologies will also benefit from youth participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this far&hyphen;sighted, equitable and fiscally responsible attitude of the government which will define new apprenticeships as a groundbreaking program. Indeed, the coalition government is providing hope for Australian school leavers regardless of their career paths. Encouragingly, enrolments for undergraduate students in tertiary education are up by 14,350 or four per cent. Contrary to what Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Carr would have us believe, an injection of funds for better targeted programs for vocational education and training and a strengthening economy is evidence of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this bill and the accompanying new apprenticeships project will lend itself to an improvement in the employment participation rates of our youth, the cornerstone of this nation's future economic development. New apprenticeships is also an initiative that the opposition&mdash;many of whom are themselves serving apprenticeships in political competence and commonsense, some for as long as three terms now&mdash;should be able to appreciate and relate to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vocational education and training is a very important issue in my electorate. As other opposition members who have made contributions during the debate on the second reading have said, we really do get some very confus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7849"> ing if not misleading statements from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has often said that in the 13 years under Labor we really neglected vocational education and years 11 and 12 at school were really only for those who were academically inclined or those who sought to go on to university. I find those sorts of statements&mdash;that is, that we neglected vocational education&mdash;objectionable. As with many other issues, I am ready to accept that we could have done more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality in terms of years 11 and 12 retention rates is that at the end of the term of the last coalition government you had about 33 per cent of students staying on to years 11 and 12. They most definitely were, in the main, university bound. We placed a great emphasis on trying to push the message that it is important for a nation, as it is for the individual, to invest in people's talents and potential and encourage them to stay on to years 11 and 12. We have seen a huge increase in the rates of young people staying on for years 11 and 12&mdash;and certainly that applies in my electorate. They now have quite a number of choices of subjects of a vocational nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember very well the Carmichael report and actually getting Laurie Carmichael to talk to interested people in my electorate about the changes that were proposed for skill formation, whether that was for people in the workplace or for people about to start in the workplace&mdash;that is, people at school. I have to say that currently there is a very hot issue in my electorate and that is the results of the investigation into the HSC at Mount Druitt High School. We have had, for some months now, the McLaughlin report which I have tried to disseminate as far and wide as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with a number of other issues, I have gone out on the front foot and said that 10 years ago we were right in advocating a senior high school for Mount Druitt. Regrettably, the then Labor government did not proceed with that, but the Liberal government formed the first ever public senior high school 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at St Marys. It is not based on the model we proposed, but, to give credit where credit is due, the first public senior high school in New South Wales at St Marys, which is  now in my electorate, is an outstanding success. At that senior high school there are 800 applications for 400 positions in year 11. This is a public school that is reversing the drift from public to private. It not only offers exceptionally rigorous courses that lead on to university but also offers rigorous vocational courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very keen to ensure that this senior high school at Mount Druitt not only has vocational courses which are board approved but also, more importantly, lives up to the principles that Laurie Carmichael was espousing. We must ensure that TAFE units are placed in that senior high school so that we give reality to the proposition that people can complete high school and be part way to their TAFE qualifications. For example, if someone wanted to do an apprenticeship, by staying on and doing years 11 and 12 at Mount Druitt Senior High School not only would they finish with a department of education qualification but also they would be well into their apprenticeship, including practical experience. I am going to continue to fight for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the abolition of the youth allowance has had a dramatic effect on my electorate. Again, I think the minister is a little confusing if not misleading in his statements. I can remember when we were doing a review of Austudy in this place quite rightly coalition members said&mdash;and I note that the former deputy chairman, now chairman, of that committee, the honourable member for LaTrobe (Mr Charles) is in the House&mdash;said, `We have to make sure that people just do not go to school to collect their Austudy and that there are benchmarks of progress.' The committee agreed with him and we recommended that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By abolishing the youth allowance, what you are doing right across Australia, and I am talking about my electorate, is forcing people back to school not because they see school as giving them extra skills, giving them a better start in the job market, but merely because they have been deprived of a benefit. Schools have sufficient challenges just dealing with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7850"> young people and all their aspirations in years 11 and 12. If you get a group of unmotivated students, as the coalition was saying when debating the Austudy provisions, who are merely at school to fill in time, then the potential for disrupting serious students becomes even greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate there are something like 537 students who may be going back to school because they have been cut out from receiving the youth allowance. As the shadow minister has said, there has been no extra money provided for schools to cater for this huge influx and no extra resources provided to maybe have a second chance at interesting them in worthwhile subjects and seeing their potential and talents developed. It is going to be an extra burden for high schools that the McLaughlin report has suggested already are very fragile and near collapse. I think that is a very unfortunate approach to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In western Sydney we are well provided for by a network of TAFEs. I have been pleased to see the Mount Druitt TAFE go through seven stages of expansion&mdash;not all in the time I have been a member. I was thrilled to be there, because we promised to provide a TAFE, when the sod was first turned. Now I am thrilled to see a vibrant institution with effectively some 8,000 full&hyphen;time places for young people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is regrettable that when the minister suggests that there is going to be wholesale expansion of the TAFE sector&mdash;for example, Mount Druitt TAFE is going to be able to take even more students&mdash;what he is really talking about is that there have already been federal government cutbacks to the TAFE sector and they are expected to be able to achieve extra places through efficiency gains. This is at a time when in New South Wales through a similar methodology 5,000 extra places were already provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say that in New South Wales and at Mount Druitt TAFE there is not the opportunity to dramatically increase the intake of students by these so-called efficiency gains. Even if there were, two-thirds of the funding to expand TAFE places comes from the state government. When the minister says that we are going to have an expansion of half a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million places in TAFE, what he is really doing is trying to predict how the states are going to be able to spend their money at a time when, in terms of direct line items and untied grants, they are cutting the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vocational education for young Australians, indeed all Australians, is too important to trivialise and it is too important for the minister to make misleading statements about&mdash;misleading statements about TAFE's capacity to expand the system without any extra federal funding. I think the opposition would welcome an expansion of the TAFE sector, but what we really want to see in that expansion is the government putting its money where its mouth is. The high schools in my electorate are being expected to take on an extra 550&hyphen;odd students without any additional funding.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Native Title Act 1993 has been a disaster for reconciliation in the Australian community. What the existing Native Title Act has done, because of its flawed operations, because of its manifest complications, is contribute to rather than subtract from division and argument within the Australian community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mabo decision of five years ago contains sound  principles. The Native Title Act of the former government took the Mabo decision way beyond the original decision of the High Court of Australia.

What we have been left to do, as we were left to do in relation to the budget, as we were left to do in relation to unemployment, as we were left to do in relation to so many other things, is take responsibility of cleaning up the Labor Party's native title mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 10-point plan that has been developed by the coalition strikes the right balance, the fair balance and the only balance between the interests of different sections of the Australian community.

They were very interested in retail sales a couple of months ago, but with a 2.6 per cent increase&mdash;the highest for three years&mdash;there are no questions on it, no economic statements and, in fact, no economic spokesman coming in here and asking questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seasonally-adjusted retail sales, which grew in July, showed a particularly large increase of 17.6 per cent in the department store component of retailing. Although anecdotal evidence suggests this could in part be a result of end of year clearance sales, growth in total retail sales over June and July averaged 1.1 per cent, a step up from the average growth of 0.4 per cent per month recorded in the first five months of the year. Excluding department stores, retail sales grew by a solid 1.2 per cent in July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retail sales growth was broadly based across all of the areas, other than recreational, hospitality and services and, as I said before, it was particularly strong in relation to department stores. In addition to that, revisions have occurred for past months which have actually made the retail sales for June somewhat stronger than had originally been thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big step up in retail sales for the month of July is a welcome sign in relation to consumer spending and consumer spending patterns. That can be taken together with the national accounts for the June quarter, which were released yesterday. They showed a 1.2 per cent increase, which was a very strong result in relation to the June quarter. We have seen, coming together with a low inflation climate and a low interest rate climate, an economy which is definitely stepping up into

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Oxley for her question. She, firstly, is under a wrong assumption in making the statement that one-third are specifically reserved for non-Australians. The fact is, as the honourable member should have known as the legislation went through this House, that legislation provided that no more than 35 per cent of the shares be sold to non-Australians. It was up to 35 per cent&mdash;not specifically one-third, not specifically 35 per cent, but up to 35 per cent be sold to non-Australians. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member also referred to the fact that there is some considerable demand for shares, if one can judge from the reservation of the public offer document. It is true to say that, since that particular process started about three weeks ago, there has been some considerable interest and a number of applications have been made. One cannot take from that that all those who reserve the public offer document will in fact, subsequently, after receiving advice from their brokers, proceed to apply for shares. The international experience on that is that between 30 and 60 per cent of those who reserve the public offer document proceed subsequently to actually apply for shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could indicate further, prior to the election, we made it abundantly clear to all Australians that we would proceed as a government to sell one-third of Telstra in shares so we could get funds to provide for the biggest single attack on environmental degradation in this nation's history through the $1.1 billion Natural Heritage Fund. That is one of the main purposes behind the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure you, Mr Speaker, and I can assure the honourable member for Oxley that nothing has changed since that time. The allocation and the structure of the sale will be determined at some point down the track. The honourable member for Oxley is wrong in her assumptions. I can assure her that that process of providing for the mums and dads of Australia to buy shares in this great Australian company is still to the forefront of the government's thinking and, ultimately, when the allocation is made, that will be seen by all Australians to be the case.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

When the ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Columbus Canterbury</EMPHASIS> arrived in Melbourne, the ship being loaded by Australian wharfies was loaded at the average rate of 17 containers an hour.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. On a recent visit to her electorate, I was very impressed by the very deep and widespread support for the government's work for the dole scheme and for the principle of mutual obligation, on which that scheme is based. I detected this level of support also in recent visits to the electorates of Warringah, Wannon, Ballarat, Bendigo, Dunkley, Deakin and others. Indeed, the Australian community has embraced the work for the dole scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth recognises the need for protection for all participants in work for the dole projects. Participants in projects will not be employees of either the Commonwealth or sponsor bodies. Accordingly, the Commonwealth will be purchasing accident or liability insurance to ensure proper protection for all participants in line with current insurance arrangements for labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accident and liability coverage also protects a participant's liability arising out of negligent acts which cause personal injury to a third party or damage to a third party's property. But I should say that sponsors are expected to provide and maintain a safe working environment in accordance with relevant laws relating to occupational health and safety throughout the projects. Sponsors will be required to maintain public liability insurance&mdash;the cost of which can be included in the project costs in the application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to say that the first contracts are expected to be signed by the end of September, after some 600 applications have been sorted through. That shows the level of community support&mdash;community support which the Labor Party has completely failed to acknowledge. The Labor Party, as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7862"> we know, opposed the work for the dole scheme until Major Backflip over there decided that he could not withstand public opinion any further.

The prudential arrangements that I have announced will provide full protection of residents' funds and will ensure that the balance will be repaid in full and on time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot compromise on its commitment to prudential arrangements. While the record of the hostel sector has been very good, the reality is that a number of facilities have encountered financial difficulties as a result of a variety of factors. In one case a large facility in Victoria became insolvent; in another case another facility in South Australia encountered financial difficulties. In these situations residents either face lengthy delays in receiving the balance of the bonds or the complete loss of those bonds. No matter how limited the number of such incidents is, the consequences are simply unacceptable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. As extraordinary as it seems, Australia has had no regulatory infrastructure to oversee the Commonwealth's nuclear activities. So we have decided to merge the Australian Radiation Laboratory, which is located in Melbourne, and the Nuclear Safety Bureau, which oversees ANSTO, which is in Sydney. We are putting the two together to form the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agency will have a number of activities. The first is that it will regulate all activities at Lucas Heights. So for the first time the regulator will be at arms&hyphen;length from who is being regulated. It will also have statutory power by way of its office&hyphen;holders. It will work by having a system of advisory committees and working parties. These advisory committees and working parties will allow direct input from interest groups, local people and people with expertise on health issues. Finally, it will be responsible for trying to get uniformity in state and territory laws on matters relating to nuclear radiation. This was an issue that I raised with my colleagues at the last health ministers' meeting in Cairns and they agreed that Australia should move towards uniform Commonwealth&hyphen;state regulations and laws on nuclear radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hughes also asked me what the benefits would be for her constituents. The benefits are very simple. For the first time, located in my department, there will be a body that oversights all activities at Lucas Heights. These activities will not only include the decommissioning of the old reactor but also the activities of the new reactor, the storage and disposal of spent rods and the production of isotopes, which are so essential to medical diagnosis. Also, her constituents will have a chance to have a direct input into this by way of the operation of the advisory committees and working parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it was first put to me that there should be a new authority like this and that it should be located in my department, I was not wildly enthusiastic. But after a long period of advocacy by the member for Hughes, I was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7870"> prepared to change my mind. I do see the importance of this being at arms&hyphen;length. I do see the importance of this for the constituents of Hughes. I congratulate the member for the advocacy she has put on behalf of her constituents.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate that Minister Kemp is acting like an endangered species who will say anything to protect his hide.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here he is&mdash;the arrogant and the endangered who spends all his time trying to manipulate information before this House. He is told one thing by ANTA and he tells this House something completely opposite. It is like reading an Orwell novel where this minister tries to pretend that black is white, good is bad, cuts are growth and funding reductions equate to opportunity. For a man who spent most of his adult life campaigning against totalitarian governments, he has embraced the 1984 ethos&mdash;that is, white is black, good is bad, cuts are growth. That is the nature of this minister's performance in this House on every single issue of education funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite the House to look at the record of this minister's comments critical of the funding policies of the former government and then examine the information that has been provided to him by ANTA. This is what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7875"> ANTA had to say about funding policies under the former government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . total VET participation, measured in terms of annual hours curriculum (AHC), has grown by an average of 5.0 per cent per year in the context of significant real increases in government, especially Commonwealth government, funding (an average annual real increase of 3.4 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So under Labor there was an annual increase of 3.4 per cent. The number of additional dollars that this minister is putting into VET&mdash;into vocational education and training&mdash;is a big fat zero, abolishing the growth that Labor had running under the former ANTA agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while in this House he criticises the former government, he has clear information from his own authority, ANTA, to actually praise the former government and its funding policies. Then there is the mother of all misrepresentations, the mother of all Orwellian tactics. In his press release on 8 June this year, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of student places in TAFE colleges will increase by up to 500,000 in the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not `may increase', not `might increase' but `will increase', according to the minister in his public statement, by up to 500,000 in the next five years. This is what ANTA said to the minister recently in this document that has been provided to the opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of States and Territories to deliver efficiency gains of this order, within a single calendar year, is problematic.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So what is a certainty for the minister is problematic for ANTA. It gets even worse for the doctor because ANTA then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This experience suggests that, for most States, a baseline efficiency of 1 per cent per year has been achieved over the past five years. Nationally, annual average efficiency growth of 1 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, what they have done for the last five years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would fund only between 9 and 20 per cent of the required growth . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the doctor's growth. The doctor's growth is totally unrealistic. The doctor's claim in the public and parliamentary arenas of what the states and territories have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doing in the last five years is totally unrealistic by any sensible measure. I can guarantee the minister that they have not been sitting on their hands. There has been substantial reform in the TAFE sector over the past five years. The document goes on to then say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities as opposed to notional possibilities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">hint, hint, who is presenting the figures notionally in the public arena&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">requires access to detailed information on State/Territory system budgets that is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While the minister in his press release is saying there will in absolute certainty be another 500,000 places, his department is saying that the information needed to make that statement is not available.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On your very thorough ruling and advice, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. The minister said this in the House on Monday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very clear from analysis done by the Australian National Training Authority that there are very significant numbers of places to be gained in growth from the state TAFE systems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no such analysis. I would challenge the minister in this matter of public importance debate to provide the analysis that he alluded to in his statement to the House of Representatives on Monday. The document that has been given to him by ANTA in the last two weeks provides no such analysis. They call it problematic. They say the information is not available. They cast all sorts of doubts over what sort of efficiency gains can be made by the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, what for this minister is white is really black. What for this minister is good is really bad. What for this minister represents as growth really represents in the eyes of ANTA exactly the opposite. What we are seeing from this minister is an attempt to mislead and deceive the parliament and the people of Australia, and all for what?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister does not like my words on these particular matters, he should take on board the words of Phil Honeywood, because this is what the minister in Victoria&mdash;his Liberal colleague&mdash;had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The states and territories have just given up, basically. Kemp, just to get headlines, goes out after each ministers' meeting . . . and hits us with another bombshell that we haven't agreed upon.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So Honeywood is there saying that this minister will say and do anything all for the sake of a headline. Maybe this is a bit too harsh on Dr Kemp. He does not look like the sort of person who could build a PR campaign. I thought, in one of my moments of good faith and goodwill, I would give him the benefit of the doubt. That was until this document lobbed on my desk&mdash;`New apprenticeships can work for you'. I opened the document and, all to my surprise, the first item that popped out was this. A photo of Dr Kemp. I wondered to myself, `What practical use could this be put to?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr O'Connor interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Corio has raised the right point. The valid fault with the kit was that it lacked the complementary cross and stake which would be needed to drive through the photograph to get it away from oneself. I was at this point a Honeywood convert. I thought, `There is something in what Phil Honeywood is saying about someone looking like that wanting to try to attract headlines.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the minister needs to do away with the little coloured photograph and stick to the substance of the debate but, even more importantly, he needs to tell the truth. He needs to tell the truth when it comes to giving the Australian people and the parliament of Australia an accurate reflection of what you are actually doing in the funding area for vocational education and training. Your authority, ANTA, have blown the whistle on you. They have exposed you thoroughly in that document, and it is incumbent upon you to provide evidence to the contrary in this debate in this House. You have to provide the analysis that you have promised the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt in your own budget figures that you have cut TAFE funding by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7877"> $242 million. In the new ANTA agreement, you are abolishing all the Commonwealth growth component that was established by the former government and you have dumped the problem solely on the states and territories. You have owned up to the fact that 60,000 people cannot get into TAFE under your policies, and you are solely trying to shift the blame and public presentation to the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, it is a fantastic and unbelievable proposition that you are trying to present to the Australian people. The proposition is that, on the back of no growth in funding&mdash;not a single extra dollar in real terms in Commonwealth funding&mdash;there will be an additional 500,000 TAFE places over the next five years. It is fantastic to the point of disbelief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought the minister, in dreaming this up, was at a Lyons Forum gathering, where it was a matter of turning loaves and fishes into a feast. Minister, there is no feast and there is no way, on the back of a zero increase in Commonwealth funding, to generate another 500,000 TAFE places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are trying to set the states and territories up for a fall and, to their credit, they have fingered you. It has not just been the Labor Party government in New South Wales. Every single state and territory education minister has fingered the doctor for trying to set them up for a fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear before the parliament that it is not possible to create a feast in TAFE out of the fishes and loaves that the minister is providing. It is not possible. It is not possible to provide 500,000 TAFE places&mdash;and that was the certainty and guarantee that the minister gave the Australian people and the parliament&mdash;on the back of a zero change in Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil Honeywood needs to be commended for these remarks. If you tried to criticise someone in the Liberal Party, what would you call them? If you tried to think of the way they work things out in the Victorian Liberal Party, what would probably be the most harmful thing you could say? Is it `Minister Kemp is a total centralist'? I think that is getting pretty close to the mark. Honeywood said: </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. One can only note the sensitivity of the member for Werriwa who felt free to use words which he now finds offensive. Let me clarify exactly what the Commonwealth is saying to the states, because the Commonwealth's position is not accurately represented by the member for Werriwa. The Commonwealth is making a very significant offer to the states, which is to maintain funding in real terms for five years. It has called on the states essentially to match that offer and to produce growth in TAFE numbers by operating their TAFE systems in a way which will ensure that any efficiency gains go back into additional places for young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claim that I have made&mdash;which the member for Werriwa disputes&mdash;is that there are significant efficiency gains to be made within the TAFE systems. The member for Werriwa says that that is not the case and that there is no possibility that there could be growth in the number of places of the kind that I have foreshadowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for the member for Werriwa, the document that he has released demonstrates the exact opposite. If you turn to the table on page 4 of the document which the member has released&mdash;he has difficulty reading tables, so I shall take him through it very carefully&mdash;column 4 shows the 1997 notional possible efficiency gains. The member for Werriwa will see that at the foot of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that table it says that, for instance, for Australia as a whole, the notional possible efficiency gains that ANTA projects are no less than $343.5 million. What ANTA is saying is that if the state TAFE systems were operated at the level of&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LATHAM" NAMEID="K26">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the sentence after it. If the state TAFE systems were operated at the level that was most efficient, there would be savings of some $343.5 million. The member for Werriwa believes that, despite the fact that these very substantial savings are there to be made, the Commonwealth government should apparently continue to pour funding into TAFE, into that black hole, on top of these inefficiencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth is saying that it will not do so. The Commonwealth is calling on the states to make efficiency gains and to grow the number of places in TAFE. That figure of $343.5 million equates to well over 100,000 places in TAFE per year. The document then goes on to say that a reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities, as opposed to notional possibilities, requires access to detailed information on state and territory system budgets that is not available to ANTA.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LATHAM" NAMEID="K26">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr Latham</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is quite reliable as an estimate. The Commonwealth's position is to take that comment from ANTA on board and, as the Commonwealth has said to the states, we will sit down with each of the states and negotiate the level of efficiency gains that can be obtained in each of the states in the light of the actual situation. That is an entirely appropriate way to go about it. It is entirely consistent with the document which has been tabled by the member for Werriwa and which he simply fails to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just look at the broader picture. We have before us an MPI which says that we have failed to provide sufficient post&hyphen;secondary opportunities for young Australians. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was the Labor Party which restricted opportunities for young Australians across the post&hyphen;secondary sector. It neglected TAFE for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7879"> vast proportion of its period in office. It locked tens of thousands of students out of universities. Apprenticeships and traineeships declined as a proportion of the work force to their lowest level for three decades in 1995. In the last year of the Labor government, apprenticeships and traineeships were at a level only of 69,500 compared with 99,000 in 1996, the first year of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this government has expanded opportunities for young Australians in every area of post-secondary education. There are 55,000 extra places in TAFE in 1997, of which 43,000 have been funded by the Commonwealth. Again, I think one must make allowances for the shadow minister because he is relatively inexperienced, and I do not accuse him of deliberately misleading on this point. The fact is that total funding for vocational education and training has increased by some $144 million over the level of the last year of the Labor government. That shows this government's great commitment to vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expenditure on vocational education and training is not the same as expenditure on TAFE. It is broader because it encompasses, for example, the Commonwealth's commitment to provide support for employers in taking on apprentices and trainees. The Labor Party neglected that whole area throughout its entire period in office, and it has fallen to this government to build it up to ensure that there are opportunities for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa went around the country last year saying that the budget decisions of the new government would restrict access to universities. The reality is quite the opposite, as the government intended. The government intended to increase access to opportunities for higher education. In fact, enrolments in universities this year are up 15,000 over the previous year. The university sector is better funded this year than it was last year. So the government has expanded opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growth in the apprenticeship and traineeship system is equally significant. I think it falls to me to point out to the House that the previous government completely neglected the apprenticeship system and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> desperate need for reform. It even attempted to wipe the word `apprenticeship' out of statistics on employment based training. It introduced the traineeship, which was not well understood, and for 10 years tried to get it up and running. But because its partner, its close mate, the ACTU insisted on surrounding it with so many requirements, rules and regulations, it was unattractive to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we had the dramatic run-down of opportunities for many of the thousands of young people who would be in the member for Werriwa's own electorate. Like so many on the Labor side of the House, the member for Werriwa had his eye fixed firmly&mdash;as did his predecessor, John Dawkins&mdash;on the number of young people going into universities. There was a significant increase during the period of the previous government in the number of young people in universities, but only 30 per cent of school leavers go on to universities. What about the other 70 per cent? They were virtually utterly neglected. The member for Werriwa, along with all the other members of the Labor Party, went around giving the totally misleading message to young people that, if you were not going on to university, you were not going anywhere. It has fallen to this government&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7880"> government to ensure that employment based training apprenticeships and traineeships&mdash;the sorts of opportunities that tens of thousands of young Australians are looking for&mdash;are much more attractive to employers because of the reforms that we have put in place. In the most recent budget, the Commonwealth government has provided some $550 million to support 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships, which is something like a 48 per cent increase over the last two years of the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us have none of the nonsense that is embodied in this MPI before the House, that this government has failed to provide expanded post&hyphen;secondary education and training opportunities for young Australians. In every sector, there has been an improvement. Let me say that this reflects the outstanding commitment of this government to redress the neglect of young people that occurred over the previous 13 years. When we came into office, for example, we found that some 30 per cent of 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in year 9 in school could not read properly and that the reading comprehension level of boys had declined. That was how much the previous government cared about the most disadvantaged young Australians. Getting literacy to young Australians is the single most important social justice measure in education, and you did nothing about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is determined to give young Australians a proper foundation on which they can build their future lives. The measures of this government to expand vocational education and training options in schools by a commitment of $187 million over this four-year period provide an outstanding initiative to make sure that those thousands of young Australians who drop out of school have the chance to get schooling which they perceive is relevant and which will be relevant to them. This government has also encouraged schools to begin to think about their role in employment placement and to take a responsibility for actually getting young people jobs with local employers as they leave school.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the MPI proposed by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I also wish to condemn the government's failure to provide sufficient post&hyphen;secondary education opportunities for young Australians. The most disappointing thing about the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is that he was previously firmly committed to education and he is now committed to deception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is trying to tell this House and this parliament that serious cuts in education in the university, TAFE and school sectors equal more for education. That is what he is trying to tell this House; that is what he is trying to tell this parliament. He ought to be ashamed of this kind of deception because he knows the importance of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whenever the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is asked questions about these matters, he says, `We were in a difficult budgetary situation. We had to make all those cuts.' At least the Prime Minister admits that serious cuts have been made to education, unlike the minister who tries to pretend that nothing has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7881"> happened in cuts to education and that somehow cuts to education equal better education for more people. What kind of nonsense is this? What kind of misuse of the statistics and facts is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this government is now in a position to fund education because it gained a lot of revenue in the last year or so from various sell&hyphen;offs, privatisations and the like. Instead of coming in and saying, `We will spend more on universities. We will spend more on TAFE colleges. We will spend more on training. We will spend more on primary and secondary education,' the government says, `We are spending less money but, never mind, even though we are spending less money, there are going to be better outcomes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then what happens? The minister attempts to push the state governments into a situation in which they have to fund the expansion. Basically, that is what is going to happen. The minister tried to tell the state governments, `We have cut $70 million at least from your budget, but you are going to have to expand by 500,000 positions in the next five years.' How is this going to be funded? According to the minister, the state governments are going to have to find a way because the federal government is not going to do that.</PARA>

Of course we put it on the table, because the minister has tried to pretend to this House that this matter will be achieved, notwithstanding the fact that the states are going to have to fund it and that the states are saying, `We will not fund it. We are not capable of these kinds of efficiencies, because it is going to be a detriment to education.' I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this document say? It says:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities as opposed to notional possibilities requires access to detailed information on State/Territory system budgets that is not available.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, you have this notional figure and then they say, `A realistic assessment means that we have to get the figures from the state and territory systems.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the state and territory ministers met and talked about this matter, what did they say to you, Minister? Didn't they say to you that these figures were not achievable and that these cuts that you are making to the budgets are an outrage? Didn't they say that to you? They issued a statement on 12 June, didn't they? They were really condemnatory of your approach. You have not referred to that statement, Minister, have you?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state ministers said that what you were trying to achieve was not achievable and that what you are trying to do is to force the states into a situation where the quality of the TAFE system will go down. You insist on efficiencies and increases which are not viable instead of going to the Prime Minister and saying, `We need more money for this sector,' as we do for all of the education sector. That is what you would be doing if you were really responsible in terms of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know very well that you can afford that money at the moment, because you have had various windfalls. We have even heard the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) tell us about how he gained $400 million from privatisation. Why don't you use a bit of that money for social welfare or for education? Why don't you use some of that money to fund the post-secondary sector? Why don't you use some of that money in the school system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the view of many representatives on the Labor side, our schools and our post-secondary education system are suffering as a result of your cuts, which are then represented through the state system as well. They are suffering. I can tell you what a disaster education was when we came into government in 1983. You talk about working-class kids not getting to university. You should have seen what it was like in 1983, after your 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7882"> government had been in power for eight years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a terribly disastrous situation in terms of the number of kids starting school and finishing year 12. The retention rate increased from about 30 per cent to about 75 per cent under our stewardship. That is what happened in education in terms of high schools. You talk about people from disadvantaged backgrounds going to universities and colleges. How could they go to universities and colleges when under you at that time they could not even finish high school?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are trying to reverse what happened under the Labor government when we achieved a dramatic increase in university positions and a dramatic increase in TAFE positions. We put the TAFE sector on a financial footing in terms of federal support. It was the Labor government&mdash;not your previous government, which did hardly anything for TAFE. Now you are trying to cut back on this with the way in which you are proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not beat around the bush, Minister: you are having a serious problem with the state ministers on this matter. You can come into this House and bluster and tell us about immodesty. I have never heard a more immodest minister than this fellow. Every time he talks he says, `We have had substantial increases; we have had wonderful achievements; we have had fantastic results.'

What is wrong is the attempt by the minister to pretend that things are going well in education in this country. It is a shame, because this minister knows&mdash;probably more than anyone else, having been an academic&mdash;the importance of education to this country. He has allowed a situation where education is being

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are probably all fortunate that all that waffle 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7883"> has just finished. The point of this matter of public importance is about providing post-secondary education opportunities for young Australians. I am grateful to the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) for straying on to that subject near the end of his contribution. Particularly for people in the gallery and those listening&mdash;and I am sure you would appreciate this information, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins&mdash;what Labor is talking about when it talks about cuts is cuts to its fairytale forward estimates. These are the forward numbers that Labor dreamed up to make it look good. At the same time that they were dreaming those numbers up, they were telling you and me and the whole country that we were on target for a surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened when we actually got the figures? There was no surplus; it was a $10.3 billion deficit. When they talk about forward estimates, when they talk about cuts to education, just remember that these are fairytale figures that they are referring to. The member for Calwell knows it well. You do also, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those listening have an opportunity to gain an understanding about these so-called cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me talk about what the Howard government has done. We were faced with the problem of having to fund the $10.3 billion deficit left to us by the members opposite, by those people that the broader community understood were doing nothing about post&hyphen;secondary education opportunities, by those people opposite who were going around ignoring the 70 per cent of people in my electorate who do not go on to tertiary education&mdash;the 70 per cent who do not get the support that those going to university get. While they were ignoring those people and clocking up more debt on the Visa card, we were planning a better future for young people, to restore their hope and their job prospects and to give every young Australian an opportunity to make that transition from education to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why the member for Calwell may have ignored all these sensible facts, because he probably has not been listening to some of the reforms the government has introduced. Those reforms demon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strate that this government views the future of young people as one of its highest priorities. It has backed that up with a comprehensive plan that does not just start, like the member for Calwell would like to suggest, when there is an election around the corner. We do not start plans like Labor, which will say and do anything to make themselves look good. We all know what they do when they get into government. The vast majority of Australians understood that and threw them out at the last election and created so many vacant seats on the other side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university sector would probably say, `Under this government they have given us a chance to fill the seats and retain the revenue that comes from it. Isn't that great.' If we have got all the infrastructure there and it is left half empty, like we see on the Labor Party benches over there, why not put those resources to use? Why not give people the opportunity to occupy those places? Why not give them the benefit of the wisdom and the tuition available from lecturers that are already being paid, that already have the resources that are required for them to deliver their programs? If there are vacant seats there, why not use them? That is a very important change that we have made, and I will talk about many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on the subject of university enrolments, the member for Calwell might be interested to understand this while he is talking about cut, cut, cut. We are all saying, `Cut, cut, cut&mdash;cut the rot,' but we will keep going for now. Universities in 1997 have enrolled more Australian students than ever before. You might not have understood that from what the member for Calwell was saying, but that is a fact. There are more Australians in universities this year than ever before. There are more opportunities for the young people of Australia. There are more opportunities to tackle the question of post&hyphen;secondary education for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on this subject, isn't it fortunate that the standing orders in this place are fairly slack when it comes to MPIs? Because this is so misleading that it would not have passed the test of almost truths. That is probably why 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7884"> those opposite chose to talk very rarely about it during their contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The enrolment figures for 1997 indicate that enrolments of Australian students have increased by 15,820 effective full&hyphen;time student places, which is 3.6 per cent on last year. That does not sound like a cut. That sounds as though 15,000 people are making use of the educational opportunities that this government is providing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, Australian undergraduate enrolments have increased by over 14,350 or 3.9 per cent. That sounds like another increase to me, and further demonstrates that so much of what has been said in this debate today is just absolute, utter nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of funding levels for universities, the university sector is estimated to have some $33 million more of Commonwealth revenue in 1997 than in 1996. That does not sound like a cut to me either. That sounds like more resources. That is probably why we have more students in there. That is probably why, in Victoria, we have more than 120,000 students in government funded places. That is probably why students at RMIT, my old alumni, are so appalled by the student demonstration that was going on there that was talking about up&hyphen;front fees. There is no obligation regarding up&hyphen;front fees for more than 120,000 government funded places in Victoria. The people who are paying up&hyphen;front fees at the moment are people who are not Australian citizens, who can buy places to pursue their dreams and who can pursue their post-secondary education vision for a better life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone except Australian students can have that opportunity. If someone were to say, `I've just missed out very slightly with my TER score to gain access to a veterinary program, but that is something that drives me, that is something that is within me as I love animals and I'd like to make a contribution in that area for the rest of my career,' why can't they invest in their future? Everyone else has had the chance&mdash;but not Australian citizens. We have addressed that also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Total postgraduate fee paying students and overseas students have increased by 19 per cent and 11 per cent respectively over 1996 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> levels. That sounds like more again. Where is this cut? There is no cut. University revenues from both these sources&mdash;that is, government funded places and overseas students and those who are paying up&hyphen;front fees&mdash;have increased by $65 million over 1996 levels. Again, that does not sound like a cut to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on the subject of universities, let us talk a little bit more about what actually happened when people had the chance to enrol. You know the scare campaign that the Labor Party was going on about when it was said that people would be missing out on university places? As I have clearly demonstrated, not only has the number of government funded university places increased but they have actually overenrolled some 28,000 students against the undergraduate targets this year. There is an eight per cent overenrolment. That is more on top of more. I do not know how more on top of more becomes less, becomes a cut. Perhaps the member for Calwell could explain that or perhaps he has not confronted&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the tight budgetary circumstances that I have already outlined&mdash;that very heavy Visa card that this nation was carrying around, the debt that was left by those opposite for our young people&mdash;what has this government done? We have invested in those young people. We have said to them, `It is so important that we can provide you with future opportunities.' Dr Kemp has talked at length about the vast array of initiatives that has been introduced&mdash;all part of a plan to provide more opportunities for young people as they leave secondary education. Whilst that has been going on, we will put an extra $26 million over the next four years into universities to help them restructure, to take advantage of the opportunities that this government has provided them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also be an extra $130 million provided over three years for research infra 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7885"> structure, postgraduate research training and collaborative research. That is $130 million in addition&mdash;more; more opportunity; more investment in the young people of this country. That is not less. So the member for Calwell again does not have a grip on what is actually going on in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move quickly to those people who have not yet had to make the choice about their post&hyphen;secondary education. Let us not forget them. Let us not forget the fact that we have a responsibility to give them the opportunity to take advantage of these vast improvements in alternatives they have before them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Dr Kemp, I was recently meeting with a number of careers teachers down our way, on the Mornington Peninsula, around the electorate of Dunkley. They were telling us about how overworked they are&mdash;and they are. They are working and working for the young people of this country. One of the challenges they are facing is that there are so many more choices for them, there are so many other alternatives that they need to explain and so many new opportunities that were not there under the previous government, that they are now spending more time talking with employers, talking with TAFEs, talking with the universities and working with the school community to make sure that those young people have a future and that the school is playing a valuable role in aiding that transition of a young person from the school environment to work. They want to have a stake in that transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put an extra $560 million together for special programs, for literacy, for students with special learning needs and for languages so that opportunities are there for those people who, perhaps through some cognitive disadvantage that is not of their making, can be assisted. We are making sure that they have a chance to benefit from this vast array of alternatives that is before them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the young people who have intellectual disabilities who were here today from Woorinen&mdash;an ATSS centre down in Dunkley providing supported employment&mdash;have choices now. They have more choices; we are funding more places for them. We are not just 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> talking about those people that Labor talked about for the last 13 years; we are talking about all young people because they all have a right to expect that the government is working with them for a brighter future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are so many more initiatives that I could go through, but my time is running out. Let me simply conclude by saying that it is important to appreciate what this government has done. It has done what the Labor Party's former minister said that Labor could never do, and that is to think about the 70 per cent or more of people who do not go on to universities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is over five years since the High Court's historic Mabo judgment. That decision held for the first time that indigenous Australians have native title rights in relation to land that are recognised by the common law. The judgment challenged our legal and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliamentary systems to provide a framework to respect and protect those rights, while at the same time to provide the necessary certainty to enable economic activity and development to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The previous government sought to respond to the Mabo decision through the Native Title Act 1993. In 1993 the coalition's clear and consistent view was that the act was inadequate and unworkable, and failed to address many of the uncertainties arising from the Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In 1997 it is more apparent than ever that the Native Title Act has not delivered real outcomes to the Australian community, and particularly to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> After almost four years and over 600 claims lodged under the act, there has been only one determination of native title on mainland Australia. Australians have been disappointed with the delays, confusion and lack of results from a complex, costly and litigious system. The act has placed a burden on resource development, without yet delivering benefits to indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the significant uncertainties left unresolved by the original act, community relations in many parts of rural and remote Australia have been unnecessarily strained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These frustrations, uncertainties and tensions were intensified following the High Court's Wik decision of 23 December 1996 which, contrary to general assumptions about the law, found that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish all native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In responding to the Wik decision, the government is determined to reduce these uncertainties, simplify native title processes, improve the workability of the act, and increase community understanding and acceptance of native title issues and processes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government aims to develop a more effective framework for managing native title in Australia, a framework which respects, balances and gives voice to the interests of all parties with an interest in the land&mdash;native title holders themselves, the resource based industries, pastoralists and farmers, state and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7887"> territory governments, local governments, and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians want to have confidence that native title issues are being resolved by efficient, fair and timely processes which find the right balance among the rights and interests of all parties involved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We believe that the bill introduced today achieves those objectives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government reiterates today that it is committed to respecting the native title rights of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. The Mabo decision was an important day for indigenous Australians. Most Australian citizens continue to support the decision's acknowledgment of the rights and interests of indigenous Australians in the continent we share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill delivers on that sense of broad community support for the Mabo decision and the need to accommodate the legitimate native title rights and interests which flowed from it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But the bill goes further and also delivers on the government's central policy objective of encouraging economic development across Australia. It delivers certainty for pastoralists, reduces complexity for the resource industries, and recognises the appropriate role for the states and Territories. For the first time Australia will have native title processes that work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Processes towards the bill</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In developing these amendments, the government has worked through an open and participatory process. On 27 June 1996 I introduced the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 into the House. In October 1996 the government released a range of amendments to that bill, in particular in relation to the right to negotiate provisions. The substance of that bill, and the proposed government amendments, have been incorporated into this bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> More importantly, this bill also brings to the parliament the government's response to the Wik decision. As honourable members will be aware, in the months following the Wik decision the Prime Minister held an intensive series of consultations with all interested parties. On 8 May 1997 he released 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a 10&hyphen;point plan which summarised the government's proposed response.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 23 June 1997 the government made available a working draft of the bill for comment by interested groups. Following a further round of extensive discussions over 80 written submissions were received and considered by the government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not surprisingly, given the broad spectrum of views on the issue, the bill will not accommodate all the representations of all the interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Farmers Federation has continued to call for the extinguishment of native title on pastoral lease land. The bill does not do this. However it does protect the interests of pastoralists and allows them to carry on pastoral activities and to diversify those activities with greater certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Indigenous Working Group has proposed a package of responses to Wik. Some of these responses have been incorporated into the bill, while others have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In developing its proposals, the government has sought, through its 10&hyphen;point plan, to put in place a fair and equitable process for dealing with native title which balances the interests and objectives of all parties, in the overall interests of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Pastoral Leases</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Since the Wik decision Australia's pastoral leaseholders have been grappling with the uncertainties of native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government is determined to resolve those uncertainties as directly and as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The previous government took the view that pastoral leases extinguished native title. In the second reading speech to the Native Title Bill 1993 the previous Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the government's view [is that] . . . under the common law, past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to the renewal of pastoral leases in the future . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The previous government developed the Native Title Act on the assumption that native title on mainland Australia would exist principally in relation to vacant crown land, that is, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7888"> the 36 per cent of Australia where there has been no significant grant of private rights, or public reservation or use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assumption was that the rights of native title holders in relation to such vacant crown land could be significant, and could be equated to ownership of the land. Based on these assumptions, the act provided to native title holders the same protection and the same procedural rights as freeholders, as well as a special right to negotiate in relation to mining and some compulsory acquisitions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the High Court's judgment in Wik contradicted these assumptions. The Wik decision held that the grant of a pastoral lease over land did not necessarily extinguish all the native title rights in relation to that land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Justice Toohey said in Wik:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent that at one end of the spectrum native title rights may "approach the rights flowing from full ownership at common law". On the other hand they may be an entitlement "to come onto land for ceremonial purposes, all other rights in the land belonging to another group".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">19.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is clear that, in relation to pastoral lease land, native title rights cannot be the former, and may only be the latter. In this government's view the assumption underlying the Native Title Act, that native title rights are likely to be rights approaching ownership, is rendered false by the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is inappropriate therefore that that false assumption should continue to underpin the Native Title Act as a whole. The current act is clearly deficient in that it does not deal in any systematic way with the relationship between co-existing native title and other rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">20.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The amendments in the bill put in place a more appropriate regime to deal with native title rights on pastoral lease land and other non&hyphen;exclusive areas. The amendments protect the legal rights of pastoral lessees, and enable them to carry on their legitimate activities. They continue to protect any surviving native title rights but, in relation to pastoral lease land, they recognise that these can only be co&hyphen;existing rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with this philosophy of finding a balance among the rights of different parties, the amendments allow for the introduc 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of new processes for reaching land use decisions over pastoral lease land which give equivalent procedural rights to all parties with an interest in the land, including the pastoral leaseholder and the native title holder.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The High Court has held that the Native Title Act is supported by section 51(xxvi) of the constitution. Legal advice to the government is that the bill is supported by section 51(xxvi).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">22.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me now take the House through some of the key elements of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Validation</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">23.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I have said, the effect of the grant of a pastoral lease on native title was not specifically resolved by the High Court in Mabo, nor by the Native Title Act. The previous government assumed that pastoral leases had extinguished native title. As a result of the Wik decision, we now know that pastoral leases do not necessarily have that effect. However, the government does not accept that grants by governments, and actions by others, in particular pastoral lessees, should be left invalid because of a legitimate and reasonable assumption, subsequently found to be wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The appropriate remedy for those actions should be compensation for any native title affected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">24.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thus, the bill provides for the validation of so&hyphen;called `intermediate period acts' over freehold and pastoral lease land and public works, which occurred between 1 January 1994, the date of commencement of the Native Title Act, and 23 December 1996, the date of the Wik decision, which might otherwise have been invalid as a consequence of the existence of native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Confirmation</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">25.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The approach of the previous government raised expectations of certainty which the act proved unable to deliver. This has proved to be costly to all parties. This government's policy is to bring a much greater level of certainty to bear in relation to native title issues, in particular in relation to the circumstances where it can reasonably be said that native title does not exist. To do so we have chosen to confirm explicitly in the Native 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7889"> Title Act the extinguishment of native title by certain grants or activities by governments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">26.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It needs to be clearly understood that the government does not seek to extinguish native title in this process. We do not seek to go beyond what can be inferred from the decisions of the High Court as to what acts have already extinguished native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already made plain, this government respects, and will continue to respect, the Mabo and Wik decisions and the native title rights of indigenous Australians. But it is in the interests of all Australians to be clear and certain about where extinguishment has already occurred. The resolution of native title issues will be made even more difficult by unrealistic expectations on the part of claimants or by unnecessary uncertainty for others with interests in land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">27.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Accordingly, the bill provides that certain `previous exclusive possession acts' have extinguished native title. They include the grant of a freehold estate, leases for residential, commercial or community purposes and interests included in a schedule to the act. The bill provides that states and territories are able to confirm that such grants extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">28.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  The Commonwealth has worked extensively with the states and territories to develop the schedule of interests. It has proved to be a complex and time&hyphen;consuming task. We are currently discussing its terms with a range of interest groups, and this intensive process has meant that the schedule is not ready to be included in the bill. It will be added as a government amendment to the bill after further consultation. The schedule includes particular types of leases and other interests where exclusive possession must have been intended.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">29.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill is intended to introduce further certainty by confirming the effect of the grant of pastoral leases on native title. Consistent with the High Court's view, states and territories are able to confirm that the grant of such leases is confirmed to extinguish native title to the extent that the native title rights are inconsistent with those of the pastoralist.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">30.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill provides that such extinguishment is permanent. The government recognises that the permanency issue was left unresolved by some members of the High Court in the Wik decision. However, it is a central element of the government's approach to amending the act to put an end to such uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">31.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To the extent that these provisions confirm the common law there will be no effect on native title rights. But if there is any actual extinguishment by the provisions, the legislation will provide for compensation on just terms. I would note that the government has retained the Land Fund to enable Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders to remedy past extinguishment of native title rights by the purchase of land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Future act regime</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">32.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The `future act regime' in the Native Title Act seeks to answer the question: what acts can governments and others now undertake which may affect native title rights? Despite more than 3&half; years of the operation of the current act, for most of Australia we do not yet know where native title exists and, if it does, the identity of the native title holders or the nature of their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the view of the government that changes to the future act processes are required if land use decisions and activities are to be made with certainty in the future. Accordingly, the bill includes a revised future act regime. If an act by government will not affect any native title, then nothing in the Native Title Act prevents or restricts that act. But, if the act will affect native title rights, the act provides some basic rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present bill clarifies these rules, and adds some additional provisions to deal with the new concepts of co-existing native title on pastoral lease land. These include, among other things, expanded scope for agreements, new provisions relating to primary production, confirmation of the ability of governments to regulate and manage water, facilitation of the provision of services to the public, facilitation of renewals, and provisions to allow for the implementation of past reservations of land.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7890">
<PARA STYLE="Para">33.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The amendments make clear that where governments carry out acts under one of the `future act' provisions, then that act is valid, even though it may affect native title rights. The bill provides that where a person has, or receives under one of the future act provisions, a lease, licence, permit or authority to do something, such as a right to take water or conduct primary production activities, then this authority prevails over any native title, and the existence or exercise of any native title cannot prevent any activity that the authority requires or permits.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">34.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Importantly for indigenous interests, the great majority of future acts are subject to the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle. This ensures that while native title is subject to a lease, licence or other government grant for the period of the grant, it is only temporarily suppressed for the period and can revive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With several minor exceptions linked to past actions or future processes, native title can only be extinguished under these amendments in the same way as it can be extinguished under the existing act, that is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> by agreement of the native title holders; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> by compulsory acquisition of the rights of native title holders under legislation that applies equally to other land&hyphen;holders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Primary production</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">35.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill recognises on the basis of the Wik decision that native title is able to co&hyphen;exist with other interests on pastoral lease land, although those rights are subject to the rights of the lessee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill enables pastoral lessees to carry out primary production activities, notwithstanding any co&hyphen;existing native title that might exist. The definition of `primary production' is based on the definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 with some minor modifications. It includes incidental and associated activities. The approach is intentionally wide to reflect the national interest in diverse and flexible rural industries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">36.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, any activity permitted under the Native Title Act still requires authorisation under any relevant state or territory legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">37.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As the Prime Minister has already made clear, the government does not expect, and would not support, across-the-board freeholding of pastoral leases at the expense of native title holders or of Australian taxpayers. There will be no massive windfall gain for holders of pastoral leases. Nor will there be risk of environmental degradation through loss of legislative and administrative controls over inappropriate land clearing and overuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if there is a legitimate need for exclusive possession of pastoral lease land in order to facilitate changes of use, then this can be achieved by agreement with the native title holders or under a general non&hyphen;discriminatory compulsory acquisition regime, on a case by case basis. In its financial agreements with the states and territories the government will be requiring a proper financial contribution by the beneficiaries of the upgrading through the payment of a betterment charge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Statutory access rights</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">38.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government's legislative package protects any existing access of native title claimants to pastoral lease land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">39.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In a significant new provision in the Native Title Act, access for registered native title claimants to pastoral leases will be guaranteed, provided that they regularly had physical access at the date of the Wik decision. This is a provision designed to maintain the status quo, pending determination of their claim. The access rights will, however, be subject to the rights and activities of the pastoral lessee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Right to negotiate</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">40.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Among the many shortcomings of the current act, it has become apparent that the `right to negotiate' procedures, which apply to mining and certain compulsory acquisitions, have failed to deliver the outcomes that were expected. Not only have these procedures impeded resource and commercial development, but they have done so without giving indigenous peoples substantial benefits in return. Both development interests and indigenous groups&mdash;and the two are not always mutually exclusive&mdash;have every right to be disappointed. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7891">
<PARA STYLE="Para">41.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government foreshadowed changes to the right to negotiate when it released its exposure draft of government amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 last October. Since then, the decision in Wik has made the need for change more urgent, as mining and certain compulsory acquisitions on pastoral lease land may now also be subject to the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">42.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government proposes to remove the right to negotiate where it is inappropriate because of the nature of the rights to be granted, the minimal impact on the land, or the limited native title rights that can exist. However, the basic procedural rights of native title holders are protected. The bill also streamlines the right to negotiate process, so reducing unnecessary delay; and, where appropriate, devolves greater responsibility to the states and territories to deal with these matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">43.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While the right to negotiate will generally remain on vacant crown land, the bill will enable a state or territory to apply its own regime in relation to mining and relevant compulsory acquisitions on areas described as `non&hyphen;exclusive or reserved areas'. These are basically areas of land or waters in relation to which, if native title exists, the native title holders do not enjoy a right to exclude others from the land or waters, and have, at best, only co&hyphen;existing rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the Commonwealth minister approves a state or territory regime under the act, the right to negotiate will no longer apply to acts covered by the state or territory regime. Of course, the act will require that the alternative regime satisfies specific criteria, including the provision of procedural rights for native title holders equivalent to others with like interests in the land, and compensation for any loss or impairment of native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Agreements</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">44.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Currently, the act provides for an essentially `claims driven' regime for dealing with native title issues. In the government's view, insufficient support is given to resolving native title issues by agreement&mdash;often the speediest, lowest cost and least divisive mechanism. The bill therefore sets out a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comprehensive framework for reaching consensual arrangements between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government encourages agreements, nobody will be forced into such agreements. However, the bill does provide a number of mechanisms to facilitate the use of agreements as one way of resolving native title issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Procedures</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">45.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amendments to the act in schedule 2 of the bill address the constitutional issues raised by the High Court's Brandy decision. Many are the same as those included in a bill introduced into the House at the end of 1995 by the previous government, and in the bill introduced into this House last year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">46.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These amendments set up a new system under which native title, compensation and non&hyphen;claimant applications will be filed in the Federal Court. They will then be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for notification and mediation, where such a reference will assist the parties to come to an agreement about native title. In all cases, however, the determination of claims will be made by the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill confirms that the court will consider all the claims for native title in relation to particular land or waters, and once a determination is made it will be good against the whole world, and generally subsequent claims cannot be considered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Registration of claims</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">47.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Arising out of the Brandy case the bill will separate the consideration of a claim by the Federal Court from the registration of the claim on the Register of Native Title Claims. Registration will be the prerequisite for native title claimants to access the special right to negotiate, gain statutory access rights and enjoy certain other procedural rights under the act. The Federal Court will determine all claims, whether or not they satisfy the registration test.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">48.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is wide agreement that the current lack of an effective threshold test for access to the right to negotiate is an issue which must be addressed to maintain the right balance between the legitimate interests of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7892"> native title holders and the need to ensure that economic development is not impeded.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">49.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill sets out the more demanding conditions which must be met if the benefits of registration are to be enjoyed. The Native Title Registrar must be satisfied that prima facie each of the elements of a claim can be made out before it can be registered. The registrar must also be satisfied as to a range of matters which have a bearing on whether a claim is credible and well researched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The registrar must take into account information provided by the relevant state or territory government as to whether the land is or was subject to freehold, or other extinguishing grants, and if it is or was, the claim will be ineligible for registration.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">50.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> By operation of the transitional provisions in schedule 5, the new test will be applied as a matter of course to claims made on or after 27 June 1996, the day on which the predecessor to this bill was introduced. All claims will be tested when a section 29 (right to negotiate) notice is given. As claimants will be required to provide greater detail for the purposes of claim registration, the bill will increase by one month the time within which a claimant is able to lodge a claim in response to a section 29 notice in relation to a mining proposal, or a non&hyphen;claimant application.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">52.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The amendments to the act in schedule 3 of the bill strengthen the representative body system by setting mandatory functions for the bodies and imposing nationally applicable standards of performance and accountability.

<PARA STYLE="Para">53.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is the government's policy that the representative bodies should not have a monopoly role as representatives of indigenous peoples.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Benefits of the bill</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">54.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Speaker, the Native Title Act as amended will continue to provide significant benefits for Australia's indigenous people. Most significantly, co&hyphen;existing native title over most of Australia's rangelands will be recognised and protected. This is in addition to any native title over land that has never been alienated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">55.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The opportunity for native title holders to prove their claims in relation to pastoral lease land is assured. Following registration of a claim, any existing physical access to pastoral lease land enjoyed by native title claimants is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `right to negotiate' in relation to mining development and certain compulsory acquisitions is generally retained where native title may be equivalent to full ownership, that is, on vacant crown land. Where rights are only co&hyphen;existing rights, equivalent procedural rights for native title holders will be provided. There are greatly expanded provisions for negotiated agreements among parties on all aspects of native title. The role of representative bodies is clarified and enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">56.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill provides much improved certainty for agricultural and pastoral lessees. There is confirmation that most agricultural leases have extinguished native title due to the exclusive possession nature of those leases. In relation to pastoral leases, all primary production activities, including associated and incidental activities, are protected. Lessees will have security that their rights continue to prevail over those of native title holders. Legal aid will be more readily available to pastoralists and other persons responding to native title claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">57.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Transparency and predictability of processes for the resource industries will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7893"> enhanced and new projects will be able to proceed without undue delays or restrictions. Mining titles issued between 1 January 1994 and 23 December 1996 over pastoral lease land will be able to be validated. The revised registration test, which gives access to the right to negotiate, will restore a proper balance between the interests of native title holders and the need to ensure that economic development is not impeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years the resources industry and indigenous communities have been increasingly interested in negotiating agreements to the benefit of both sides. The government encourages this development and the bill facilitates such agreements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">58.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill provides for a greater role for the states and territories in native title matters. It properly preserves state and territory prerogatives in relation to land and water management. Subject to conditions, states and territories will be able to put in place their own regimes instead of the right to negotiate on leased or reserved land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are new provisions allowing equivalent state&hyphen;territory bodies to take on the functions of the National Native Title Tribunal and the registrar, but still operating under the broad framework of the Native Title Act. Claims for native title will still be able to be heard throughout Australia by the Federal Court, allowing for a consistent approach to these cases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">59.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill responds to the community's call to the government to restore certainty to native title processes throughout Australia. From the outset the coalition identified the Native Title Act as unworkable and so it has proved. Too often, decisions, development and progress have been confused or have simply stalled. Disagreement and misunderstanding within communities has resulted. The Wik decision raised new uncertainties.</PARA>

It was an act that was challenged by the Western Australian government&mdash;in particular, the Premier, Richard Court, led that challenge&mdash;and the High Court upheld the validity of that act seven&hyphen;nil.

We have tabled in the parliament an explanatory memorandum that runs to 385 pages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7894">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for the government is that in its eagerness to suppress native title it actually threatens to create a legal environment vastly less certain for pastoralists and miners. The Labor opposition has major specific objections to the bill. Our intention is to seek amendments to the bill so as to deliver justice to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and genuine certainty and predictability for all stakeholders, especially farmers and miners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mabo decision was a watershed in the history of this nation. After 200 years of European settlement we became belatedly the last of the so-called `new world' countries with a tradition of British common law to recognise the native title rights of our indigenous peoples. The decision was a milestone in the social progress that had already seen us abandon the White Australia policy, grant citizenship to indigenous Australians, address inequity in their education and many areas of active discrimination against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this decision the High Court had confronted a most insidious form of racism&mdash;the racism of denial and neglect. It was powerful, real and a symbolic gesture of respect from mainstream Australia to the culture of indigenous Australians and thus an important instrument of reconciliation. It was a triumph for basic decency and had an enormously positive impact on how we see ourselves and how others see us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responses in this country to the High Court decision were as varied as the number of interest groups who saw themselves affected by it and political parties purporting to represent them. Conservative political forces started almost without exception from a position of outrage and denial&mdash;outrage at what they characterised as an activist High Court and denial of the legal concept that the court had seen fit to recognise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was widespread misunderstanding of the implications of the decision for the security of title for the beneficiaries of crown grants, vesting and so on since European settlements. Equally there was the prospect of an avalanche of common law claims for title from indigenous groups that could go on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indefinitely with no statutory framework and one piece of case law for guidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act 1993 accepted the concept of native title and set out to address the attendant problems. It confirmed the validity of every previously issued title and set down a process for the expeditious and cost-effective handling of native title claims. The act introduced into this place represented the end product of negotiation and compromise with the key stakeholders. These were genuine negotiations, not just consultation and certainly not a crude sales exercise for a predetermined government position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those negotiations in 1993 were carried on within the context of a relentless campaign of hysterical scaremongering and wilful misrepresentation conducted by political opportunists and interest groups who felt threatened by the native title concept. It should be said that the National Farmers Federation at that time was one of the honourable exceptions to this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous interests were not motivated to trust the motives or actions of any of the other interest groups, including the government. The government pursued the goal of delivering certainty, clarity and workability through the act. It set out from a position of respecting everyone's rights and the conviction that certainty for any of the interest groups could only come from consensus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the bill was in the parliament it was clear that the conservative coalition opposition was intent on playing a totally negative role. No provision, no clause, irrespective of the attitude of any interest group, was to receive the support of the coalition. They did everything in their power to deny the community an instrument for certainty and just  resolution of claims. There was no evidence of respect for the existence of native title. There was no evidence of respect for the need for governments, farmers, miners, pastoralists, the judiciary and others to have a workable instrument to deal with apparent and real legal uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite their worst efforts, the 1993 bill was enacted by the parliament, albeit in an imperfect amended form. In return for accepting this process and the legislated validation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7895"> and confirmation of existing titles for non-indigenous Australians, indigenous people were given the right to negotiate, a land fund for those with no prospects of successful native title claims, and the promise of a social justice package that has yet to be delivered. This government will not deliver that social justice package; they have already said that on the record. They are now setting about taking away the right to negotiate in any meaningful form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a range of common law cases already in train, and with entirely new structures set up to deal with a new and difficult range of problems, the implementation of the act would always be difficult. It was equally acknowledged that courts were yet to rule on critical issues such as the continued existence of native title on pastoral leases. That view was far from settled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1993, the decision was to leave that view to the courts to decide. Wik had commenced in June 1993. That was the deal that was done with all the stakeholders in 1993. The High Court has now decided. The 1993 parliamentary record shows an interjection by me when the then Leader of the Opposition was asking a question of the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. That interjection indicates that I was one who believed that native title could coexist with pastoral releases at that time. So the issue was not settled, and it was not one way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Practical experience and subsequent court rulings have meant that it is inevitable, and it would be inevitable, that the act would need to be amended at a relatively early stage. The timing needed to be such that cases being heard were not compromised and that the teething problems that did not need to be legislatively revisited were worked through. In 1995, the then Labor government were moving to introduce amendments to deal with developments to that point in time. They constituted a measured response rather than an overreaction to sectional pressures. The initiatives lapsed, of course, when we left office. However, a transformation appeared to be taking place in the body politic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia went to the polls in 1996 with a coalition as enthusiastic converts to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concept of native title and with a newfound respect for the Racial Discrimination Act. As with so many other issues, it was a case of, `Elect us, trust us and we won't change a thing.' The coalition policy says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition approach to Aboriginal land rights is based on the following:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment bill does not retain it. It guts the Native Title Act. Their other promise was to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill does not do that, and it is significant that this bill was not introduced, as our bill was, under the special measures section of the Racial Discrimination Act utilising section 8(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act and, therefore, relying on the external affairs power. This bill, as the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) concedes and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) concedes, is introduced under the races power. The races power does support our Native Title Act, but it supports it on the basis that it is a benefit to indigenous Australians, that it is consistent with the special measures approach as contained in the Native Title Act as it was originally enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The noise of the bells is now deafening with what purports to be the government's legislative response to the Wik decision. The Wik proposition is that native title might, in theory, persist on some pastoral leases but that any such title was emphatically extinguished or suppressed to the extent that it was in any way inconsistent with a pastoralist's enjoyment of his or her title. Wik confirmed pastoralists' title yet, with the hysteria that went on after the Wik decision, one would think that it was the exact opposite.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7896">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 amendment bill appears to be a gross overreaction to the Wik decision, to the Brandy and Waanyi decisions and to experiences of difficulties in the field. It is excessively complex, convoluted and riddled with internal contradictions. I repeat: we now have a 293&hyphen;page amendment bill to an original bill that has only 127 pages, and we have an explanatory memorandum that runs to 385 pages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill asks legislators in this place to accept on faith that massive schedules provided by the state governments of purportedly exclusive possession acts should be incorporated in this bill without a shred of corroborating evidence. It winds back the right to negotiate that Aboriginals gained as part of the 1993 package. It appears that the response from the government is to go for bucket loads of legislative extinguishment, and not just on pastoral leases. In a process where native title claimants have never had a right of veto, it removes the incentive for respondents to negotiate with claimants by giving Commonwealth and state ministers the right to intervene and make determinations for the respondents at the very beginning of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill massively increases the complexity and volume of work for court and tribunal registrars, but it is silent on resources for the job. It is a recipe for bottlenecks and delays. It is a recipe for uncertainty. This amendment bill delivers uncertainty for pastoralists, uncertainty for miners and uncertainty for indigenous interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill thumbs its nose at the Racial Discrimination Act and invites legal challenge under the constitution. It ignore's the Commonwealth's constitutional responsibilities and sets out to disadvantage indigenous people. This will, of course, be legally challenged. The  Native Title Amendment Bill  appears to corrupt the process. It is in this context that I support the bill's referral to a joint committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee bears an onerous responsibility. We now have legislation. We now have an amendment bill. Not weasel words. Not a moveable feast. Not shifting sands. Not a 10&hyphen;point plan. But at least we now have some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thing concrete to look at. This is the opposition's first opportunity to see the actual bill itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee bears an onerous responsibility. It must make sense of this mess. It must fairly and dispassionately allow stakeholders a desperate last chance to be heard on the legislation's inadequacies. The committee owes it to the parliament and the people of Australia to be a servant of the parliament and an agent of an incisive and fair inquiry. It should be neither a lackey to the government nor an agent of obstruction. Members of that committee, burdened though some might be by declared or undeclared vested interests, must do what the government has failed to do. They must listen openly to criticism of the bill and show how it can be improved. The bill must be improved towards offering greater certainty, real workability and real equity for all stakeholders.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7897">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Creation of a new list</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government considers that the broad structure of the system for taxing foreign source income is appropriate, it has become evident that there are problems with the list of countries used for providing exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These problems have arisen because the current list of countries has been used for two distinct purposes that would have been best served by separate lists. The list has been used for the purpose of determining when income should be exempt from accruals taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The list has also been used to determine when dividends and branch profits derived by resident companies should be exempt under the foreign tax credit system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current list, comprising over 50 countries, is unsuitable for the purpose of providing exemptions from accruals taxation because there are many countries on the list that do not consistently levy tax on a comparable basis to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more robust list of closely comparable tax countries is required for the purpose of providing exemptions from accruals taxation. The accruals taxation rules apply to amounts derived from investments that are likely to be significantly influenced by taxation considerations. Amounts derived from these types of investments are treated as `tainted' and include interest income, royalties and certain amounts derived from arrangements involving related parties. Accruals taxation of these tainted amounts is crucial to ensure investments offshore are not favoured over similar investments in Australia for purely taxation reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To address the problems with the current list, the bill will create a new list of seven `broad&hyphen;exemption countries' for the purposes of providing exemptions from accruals taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The list will comprise Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. These countries will be designated in the Income Tax Regulations as broad&hyphen;exemption listed countries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A shorter list will also make the task of designating tax concessions more manageable. Efforts to designate tax deferral opportunities in listed countries have had only limited success and are made more difficult by the large number of countries that must be monitored. The risks to the revenue associated with not designating a tax deferral opportunity are significant because tainted income by its nature can be diverted to take advantage of the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current list of countries is also to be updated and will continue to be used for the purposes of exemptions under the foreign tax credit system. The current list is still considered suitable for the purposes of providing exemptions under the foreign tax credit system because the exemptions apply to amounts derived from investments that are less sensitive to taxation considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Countries that are listed for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system and not for accruals taxation purposes will be designated in the Income Tax Regulations as `limited&hyphen;exemption listed countries'. Countries on either the limited&hyphen;exemption list or the broad&hyphen;exemption list will be treated as listed for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Branch profits exemption</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also modify the existing exemption under the foreign tax credit system for amounts derived by a branch in a listed country so that it can continue to apply to amounts derived through a branch in a limited&hyphen;exemption listed country. The exemption will generally continue to be available for branch income other than tainted income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An active income test will be provided for branches in limited&hyphen;exemption listed countries to help reduce compliance costs. The test will allow branches in these countries to derive up to five per cent of gross turnover as tainted income and still receive a full exemption for branch income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An exclusion from tainted income will also be provided for banking income derived by branches of Australian financial institutions in limited&hyphen;exemption countries. This exemption is broadly consistent with the exclusion from tainted income provided under the controlled 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7898"> foreign company measures for subsidiaries of Australian financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no changes to the treatment of branches in broad&hyphen;exemption listed countries. These branches will continue to be generally exempt on amounts that have been taxed at full rates in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Measures to help reduce compliance costs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another feature of the bill is amendments to help reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures. The amendments will help keep compliance costs for legitimate business operations offshore at a minimum and are largely made possible by the creation of a new list of broad&hyphen;exemption countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will make the following changes to help reduce compliance costs:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the more generous active income test for controlled foreign companies in unlisted countries will be extended to companies in listed countries;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the thin capitalisation and debt creation rules will no longer apply when calculating the attributable income of a controlled foreign company;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the transfer pricing rules will no longer apply to non&hyphen;arms&hyphen;length transfers involving controlled foreign companies resident in the same broad&hyphen;exemption listed country;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the rules for making elections under the controlled foreign company measures will be relaxed; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> amounts derived by a controlled foreign company from an associated controlled foreign company resident in the same country will generally not be treated as tainted services or tainted rental income.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">General maintenance of the rules for taxing foreign source income</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendments made by the bill are required for the general maintenance of the system for taxing foreign source income. Transitional rules will apply to deal with uncertainty arising from the dissolution of a number of listed countries. These rules will operate from the time of dissolution of the countries. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments will also operate to reduce the extent to which taxpayers may be disadvantaged by changes to the lists of countries. In this regard, the Czech Republic and Vietnam are to be added to the list of limited&hyphen;exemption countries with effect from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also repeal the exemption in the foreign investment fund measures for approved country funds. The exemption was originally provided to allow portfolio diversification in emerging markets that do not allow direct investment by Australian residents. There is now little justification for the exemption following recent reforms in emerging markets that have resulted in substantial investment liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Commencement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new two&hyphen;list approach will generally apply from 1 July 1997 for the purposes of exemptions under the foreign tax credit system. To avoid the need to calculate attributable income for a part period, the two&hyphen;list approach will first apply for statutory accounting periods of controlled foreign companies and years of income of transferor trusts commencing after 30 June 1997. In some cases this will defer revenue collected from the changes by up to 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures to help reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures which are made possible or are required because of the creation of a short&hyphen;list for accruals taxation purposes will apply for statutory accounting periods of controlled foreign companies commencing after 30 June 1997. The measures to reduce compliance costs that are not linked with the creation of a new list will apply prospectively from the time the amending bill receives the royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transitional rules dealing with uncertainty arising from the dissolution of a number of listed countries will generally apply from the time of dissolution of the countries. The exemption from the foreign investment fund measures for approved country funds will be repealed with effect for notional accounting periods of foreign investment funds commencing on or after 1 January 1997. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7899">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Consultation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been two rounds of public consultation on the proposed changes. The first round was on policy issues following the release of an information paper by the Treasurer on 24 December 1996. Submissions were also invited on measures to reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures whilst still meeting the government's objectives for taxing foreign source income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The views expressed in submissions on the information paper were taken into account in settling the changes announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget. The measures in this bill for reducing compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures were adopted following consideration of the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second round of consultation was on legislation giving effect to the changes that was released in draft form on 1 July 1997. The bill currently before the House is essentially the same as the draft bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Revenue implications</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The likely annual revenue gain from the changes made by this bill is estimated to be $125 million in the 1998&hyphen;99 financial year and $100 million for subsequent years. It is expected that a significant proportion of the revenue will arise due to changes in investment behaviour and be collected under the general provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 rather than directly under the controlled foreign company or transferor trust measures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay tribute to Senator Bruce Childs who next week completes a distinguished parliamentary career. Bruce has been a true representative of his class. After joining the ALP at 16, Bruce was apprenticed in photoengraving, before becoming a clerk at the printing chapel at 17.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to become an official of the printing union, culminating in his election as secretary in 1965. He was instrumental in the formation of the PKIU the following year. After federal intervention in the New South Wales branch, Bruce became the Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales ALP in 1971.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this position he broke new ground. There were no precedents and no&hyphen;one to seek advice from in what was often a hostile environment. However Bruce, as he did throughout his entire political life, continued to take a principled stand and to earn the respect of all those around him, whether they agreed with his political position or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce was elected to the Senate in 1981 and played a prominent role as a convener of the national Left and the parliamentary Left throughout the period of the Hawke and Keating governments. Bruce played a critical role in the positive achievements of those governments. Often in a minority position, he always took a principled view, always advo 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7900"> cating the collective position that the Left chose him to lead and always taking a constructive view of the role of Labor in government because, above all else, Bruce Childs is a thoroughly honourable man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce has been throughout his life a genuine collectivist. He has believed that the movement is bigger than any individual. His values of democracy, respect, integrity, hard work, collectivism, modesty and loyalty are ones that humble those of us who see him as a role model. He is much loved by all of those who have been privileged to work with him and learn from him. Bruce has always been there to guide and support younger members such as me and others in the movement, even when we have not always deserved that ongoing support. He has particularly encouraged young women to advance themselves in the movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce is a true believer in the principles of action embodied in the ALP's socialist objective&mdash;that progressive change comes not just through the parliament but through trade union action and through ongoing action organised by community groups. His leadership in organising the Palm Sunday peace marches of up to 170,000 people is practical evidence of his ability to unite and inspire often disparate groups in pursuit of common objectives. He is the ultimate democratic facilitator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is, of course, retiring only from parliament, not from politics. I am sure that Bruce, as head of the Evatt Foundation in Sydney and convener of the national Left, has many more constructive years in politics. He has been involved in a broad range of issues in the party, in the trade union movement and in organisations as a parliamentarian, such as UNICEF and Parliamentarians for East Timor. He has been involved in a range of issues&mdash;often taking on issues that other people would duck because they were hard ones. Bruce has never squibbed it. Bruce has always been prepared to take up that principled position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that those of us who remain in the parliament would look forward to the function that Bruce had last night, when parliamentarians and friends and family gathered to farewell him. If when we leave we can leave 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with just a portion of the respect which was shown to him last night, then we will have been fine representatives of the labour movement, as Senator Bruce Childs has been.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7900"><TITLE>Tariffs: Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak about the hypocrisy in the TCF debate. In the early 1970s, the TCF industry was flourishing in Australia. However, in 1974, when the Whitlam-Labor government oversaw the wages explosion combined with a 25 per cent tariff cut and currency revaluation, our competitive advantage was well and truly obliterated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imports began to flood in and jobs were lost. Analysts have stated that between 1972 and 1978 over 1,300 factories&mdash;32 per cent of the TCF industry&mdash;closed down. Fifty&hyphen;thousand jobs were lost; that is, some three in 10 TCF jobs were lost. In other words, Labor instituted a TCF plan of 1989 which featured, amongst other things, the removal of quotas and the removal of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally believe, as the Industry Commission states in its draft report, that the removal of quotas had a substantial impact on the local domestic TCF sector, greater still than the tariff wind&hyphen;down. To add salt to the jobless wound, in 1991&mdash;in the midst of the most protracted post&hyphen;World War II economic downturn&mdash;Labor revised this plan, accelerating the rate of tariff reduction and continuing the plan beyond 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these poorly thought out plans, more jobs were lost and more industry went offshore, with the telltale figures between 1987 and 1994 highlighting the TCF factory employment falling by some 32 per cent, overall employment in the sector diminishing by some 20 per cent and manufacturing output down by 24 per cent. That is history. They are the facts. It was not helped along by the former Prime Minister, who stood up and proudly displayed the fact that he wore an overseas suit, a Zegna suit, instead of supporting Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I stand up here tonight to talk about the TCF industry is that I am surprised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7901"> by the hypocrisy. Today I have heard the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) called names such as the `battler for burgundy' and the `master of disaster'. I do not know whether they are true or not and I do not wish to call him those things in the course of this discussion, but I think he is a hypocrite because of the fact that he deserted the TCF workers. He was the person who put his foot on the accelerator in driving down the TCF industries and people out of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is not bad enough, I draw the House's attention to a speech given on 26 March in 1992 by the former member for Hunter, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`One step forward and two steps back.' If someone is 25 stone and wants to lose weight, he does not try to run a marathon and kill himself. If we want to make our manufacturing industries more competitive, we do not drive them at a pace which kills them stone dead. Our plan, which stages the reduction in protection for the TCF industries, is too rapid and too harsh. I admit it is no easy task to judge the pace of reform, but quite clearly we have failed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was in government and he said, `We have failed.' Did his colleagues listen to him? No. As he came out to support the TCF industry, did his colleagues listen? No. What did they do? They accelerated the rate of winding back the tariffs. Then on 30 September 1993, that same member for Hunter came out and stated again that he was losing jobs&mdash;some 700 jobs throughout the Hunter in companies such as Depict Fashions and National Textiles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is so important for the member for Hotham&mdash;the alleged `battler for burgundy', who cannot even be bothered drinking Australian wines and supporting that industry&mdash;to come out now and support the TCF industry, why didn't he listen to his own members? Why didn't he listen then and protect those jobs? The bottom line is that they deserted their union membership. All they wanted is their union dues. The only time they went into the factory was to collect union dues, never to protect jobs. So all of this screaming about protecting jobs is nothing more than wind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) gets up and screams about the TCF industry, but did he defend the jobs of his Gloweave 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workers in Brunswick? Where was he? There was not a word in the last parliament about the protection of those jobs for those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the crying and screaming in this parliament is nothing more than a sham, but a sham is what they are on the other side of the House. They do not deserve to be in parliament. They do not deserve the support of the TCF industry. They got the barrel roll out at the last election because they could not deliver to those people who depended on them. They depended on them, but the Labor Party ignored them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7901"><TITLE>Education: Government Schools

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a time when the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) goes about the country running down government schools and her junior minister is going around touting spurious figures for increased TAFE places&mdash;which even his own department describes as `problematic'&mdash;the nation is facing a crisis in education. There is no mystery about what has caused the crisis. It has been government neglect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria, the crisis has been sharpened by the combined impact of state and federal funding cuts. A recent report on the resourcing of primary schools by the Victorian Primary Principals Association indicates that in 1981-82 the education budget in Victoria represented 31.2 per cent of the state budget. In 1996-97, it represents 18 per cent. Victorian government primary schools received the lowest government spending per student in Australia. In the two years to 1995, the Kennett Liberal government reduced in-school spending in primary schools by 11 per cent from about 4,300 to 3,800 per student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Jeff Kennett was elected, 39 per cent of classes had more than 25 students. Two years later, 60 per cent of classes contain 25 or more students. Cuts have seen a decrease in the provision of both curricula and extra&hyphen;curricula activities. Victorian parents now pay an average of 30 per cent of a school's operating costs from voluntary contributions and locally raised funds. This is a scandal.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7902">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) indicated not so long ago, the Australian tragedy that a person's educational opportunities are dictated by their postcode is increasingly true. The savage cuts to the education budget have not impacted equally. The capacity of school communities to respond to the cuts is also unequal. Disadvantaged schools have been the hardest hit. The impact of cuts has been exacerbated by the reduced capacity of relatively disadvantaged school communities to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times, matters have reached a high farce in Victoria. In 1996 Dallas North Primary School, which is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, was selected to participate in an early literary research project, ELRP, conducted jointly by the Victorian Department of Education and the University of Melbourne. For participating, the school received additional resources&mdash;0.4 of an EFT&mdash;in the form of an experienced teacher to coordinate the project. The school was also given leave credits to allow those class teachers involved the opportunity to undertake regular professional development as part of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Dallas North Primary School ELRP team has achieved spectacular results by any standards. The University of Melbourne believes that during 1996 literacy levels at the school were improved by 20 per cent when compared with the reference group. In addition, the school has provided professional development for more than 300 teachers from all over Victoria and has also shown the program in operation to principals and teachers from interstate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on these excellent results, Dallas North Primary School won the 1997 teacher of the year team award announced recently. This award acknowledges the professionalism of the ELRP teachers and highlights the value of the additional resources dedicated to the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, however, the story becomes a tragic farce. Despite these outstanding achievements and the critical need for ongoing resources from the Victorian government, the school council has recently been informed that the funding and resource provision given to the school for the program is to be slashed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in 1998. The school council has written to Minister Gude, pointing out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the cut&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is the case then we believe that the program will be unworkable in its present highly effective form because the school could not support the program from its present school global budget.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a travesty it will be if the program ends next year. What a cruel joke. Dallas North Primary School has suffered successive cuts in funds. The school council rightly believes that it is unable to do more for less. Victorian primary principals estimate that it costs about $60,000 per year to operate a literacy program in a school of 350 students. In terms of the amount that has been ripped out of the education budget in Victoria in the last 15 years, this is peanuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having proved that ELRP works, I call on the Victorian government to fund it. If Jeff Kennett will not fund it, I strongly urge the federal minister to stop bagging state schools and to provide the funds needed. Under the heading of economic rationalism, we cannot again allow Australia to be a place where only the wealthy have the opportunity to receive a quality education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the brief few moments allowed to me, I would like to join with the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) in what he had to say about Senator Childs. Across the parliament, in both houses, Senator Childs is greatly respected. Within this parliamentary party, the whole caucus also respects him. He has been a fine ambassador for the parliamentary left. We will miss him, but I know that he will continue to contribute to the Labor movement.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7902"><TITLE>Northern Territory: Speech by the Member for Kalgoorlie</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to discredit the completely offensive claims about the Northern Territory made in this place by the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I was stunned by the breathtaking ignorance shown by the member in relation to the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a speech that was supposedly about forest industries, the member for Kalgoorlie 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7903"> launched a savage attack on the territory. The member called the Alice to Darwin rail link uneconomical. He stated that the $100 million Commonwealth contribution to the railway was a stunt in light of the upcoming election campaigns in the Northern Territory and South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As most members would be aware, I have made many comments in this House in regard to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. It has been on the drawing board since 1911. It is not a stunt. It certainly is a major project worthy of financial support from the Prime Minister's Federation Fund. The railway will turn Darwin into a major transport hub servicing Asia. It is a project that will provide jobs and investment for the whole country, not just the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory and South Australian governments would not have committed $200 million to the project as a stunt. The railway would not have bipartisan support unless it was a viable proposition. I always thought the member for Kalgoorlie was in favour of economic development. Certainly, when he was in government he extolled the virtues of government investment in infrastructure projects and industry. This makes his attack on the railway not only fanciful and unfounded but also out of character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His comments get worse. The member for Kalgoorlie then said, `Tasmania is much more important than the Northern Territory to the welfare of this nation.' What an outrageous statement. The comment shows a complete lack of knowledge of the economic contribution territorians make to Australia. I am happy to take the opportunity to educate him. Territorians are the most productive people in Australia. While accounting for only one per cent of the nation's population, we produce 1.6 per cent of Australia's exports. In 1996-97 this totalled more than $1 billion worth of exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the population of the Northern Territory is less than half that of Tasmania. Despite this small population, the value of territory exports per capita last year was almost double that of Tasmanian exports. Let me repeat that: the territory has a population of less than half of Tasmania's, but 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exports almost twice as much as Tasmania on a per capita basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ignorance shown by the member for Kalgoorlie reminds me of the exploits of the former Labor member for the Northern Territory Warren Snowdon who would try to imply that the territory was a burden on the national economy. As we are all aware now, this is untrue. Perhaps the most offensive statement made by the member for Kalgoorlie yesterday was when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what we ought to do with the Northern Territory is get realistic and whack it up amongst the surrounding states. That is the best solution for the Northern Territory. It would solve quite a few problems and, believe me, it would be much more economical.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an appalling statement made by a member of this House. I could forgive his comments if they were ignorant, but I am quite sure that they were not. Of course, we are aware that the member for Kalgoorlie is trying to set up a party called Australia First. I hope that he does run candidates in the Northern Territory, because with thoughts like that his party will not get one vote. It reminds me of comments made by a former Prime Minister of this country when he said that the best way to see Darwin is from 35,000 feet up in the air, flying to Paris, sipping champagne. And look where he is today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very disappointed that the member for Kalgoorlie chose to denigrate the Northern Territory in the federal parliament. When he does get around to seeing the territory&mdash;I do not think he has been there for a while&mdash;I am quite sure that he will be very impressed with the productivity and the energy that territorians have in promoting Australia by way of tourism. I am not sure of this fact, but I think the Northern Territory gets more international tourists than Western Australia does. I understand the Western Australian government is now trying to promote Western Australia. We have been promoting the Northern Territory for a number of years, and our runs are on the board. The federal member for Kalgoorlie should come and have a look at what we are doing in the Northern Territory. Our mining industry is on the increase; our cattle industry is on the increase. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

These kits are well received and in fact are anxiously awaited. They are able to inform our veterans and pensioners of their rights and also of their current entitlements. Many of these pensioners and veterans phone my office to express their appreciation after receiving their kits. This recent dispatch of kits was no exception. My office received many calls from our elderly citizens, but this year they had a sting in the tail&mdash;not for me or the opposition but for the Howard government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These important members of our community are extremely annoyed with the Howard government. Their major concern, of course, is the cost of pharmaceuticals and various cuts in benefits. These important citizens have given their very all to our community of Australia over the years. They have worked hard and have paid millions of dollars in taxes to the government. They have no negative geared or used family trusts, nor have they been paid a stipend by their company. They have in fact been the battling backbone of our nation, and they really believed John Howard when he seemed to be reaching out to them prior to the 1996 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a disaster it has all been for them. They find to their horror that their regular and often weekly visits to the chemist for their pharmaceutical needs are fraught with financial danger. They now seek advice not about the value of the treatment they need but as to which of several treatments they should get due to the cost increases. This means that they are not taking all of their prescribed treatments, only those that they can afford in a particular week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The phone calls and letters to my office are extremely critical, with people saying such thing as: `We think that such cuts to benefits on those pensioners who are ill and/or infirm and most in need of such care are disgraceful and contemptuous actions of economising by the government.' The ignoring of these 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comments by the government will be done so at its own peril. I guess that, in my electorate of Greenway, when the election comes it will mean that my margin will grow substantially. However, for the government, despite its current enormous majority now, reactions of people such as the elderly and veterans will see these margins dramatically reduce, and in fact many seats will return to the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed breathtaking to see the extent to which the Howard government has lost faith with the voters of this nation. It matters not where you travel, the tune is the same: `They promised the world and delivered a desert island.' The veterans and pensioners are writing to and phoning my office saying, `We hope that you and other members of parliament will take every opportunity to criticise and condemn these actions by the government, not only in parliament but also in the media.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have done just that and will continue to draw to the attention of my electorate the shameful attacks that have been launched upon so many of these less able members of our community by this uncaring and ideologically driven old&hyphen;style tory government. Who would have thought that children and grandchildren of those who lived through the 1930s Great Depression would inflict such constant and vigorous pain on those who became the backbone of Australia through wars and good times?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not be allowed to escape the wrath of the voters from all avenues of our society as we move closer and closer to the next election day of judgment. Those with children in need of reasonably priced child care, those out of work, those who have had to sell their family home to get into a nursing home and those who have watched as their elderly relatives have been dogged by higher and higher prices for their pharmaceutical necessities of life will remember on election day, and we will see that they remember.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on business conduct issues arising out of commercial dealings between firms, because I think it is of great importance to my constituents in Lindsay. It is important to put on record one quote from the beginning of this report. This quote is from a witness, whose name has been withheld, from submission No. 185. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I once had a thriving business in an industry few could match my enthusiasm for . . . [What the retail leases tribunal could not consider] is the devastating effect the past five traumatic years have had on me and my family, which not even our once rock solid 27 year marriage could survive. We were once confident, positive thinking go&hyphen;getters but now we're broken dispirited relics of our former selves with several stress related health problems, not the least being acute depression, insomnia, nervous tension and obesity. I went through premature menopause and my once cheerful workaholic, loving partner is now an angry, aggressive alcoholic. Our children suffer too, helplessly watching both their parents fall to pieces before their eyes, and their quality of life diminish. At 50 years of age, we've been left with a massive business debt which we have insufficient earning power to repay and . . . we now face the real prospect of being homeless as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chains have been allowed to gobble us up and the landlords allowed to trample us down. Our pleas to politicians fall on deaf ears and the legal system treats us with contempt. The end result is the tragedies exposed almost daily on the national news. Why must it be so? We are entitled to our place in the sun. [The Fair Trading inquiry] has it within its power to recommend that justice is done and if I believed in God anymore, I'd pray that you will ensure it is.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is something that I have a lot of empathy with. A lot of constituents in my electorate have been working 12&hyphen;hour days, seven days a week in their own businesses and do not qualify for any welfare payments. They are actually paying tax and meeting their responsibilities in the social contract and have little to hope for in the current state of things. I wish to reassure them that this government has this in the forefront of its mind and also has a vision for how they will prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of issues that have been raised here. Firstly, what is the future of retail trading? I believe that the future is in the plazas. It is where I, as a young female,  and possibly as a mother and certainly as an elderly female, would seek to shop. It is safe. It is secure. It is indoors. I have everything I need in the one plaza. It has some key shopping attractions, such as the large chains like Target or Grace Bros. I am assured that my car will be there; there is security. There are eating places and pleasant places to sit down while you are shopping. There is freedom from any hooliganism. It is the shopping of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the massive investment required to establish that style of shopping that we as consumers all desire and demand as our living standards&mdash;especially someone as busy as I am, who enjoys shopping on a Sunday&mdash;and the investment required to go with that style of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7908"> shopping into the future, we need to guarantee the livelihood of those who are remaining in the actual shops in those centres. It is not like strip shopping, where, if the landlord becomes unreasonable, you can move your premises across the street and, with the same name and phone number, still be in business. It does not have the same landlord competitiveness and competition, which is what our government is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe very strongly in strong competition. Small business is not afraid of strong competition and it is not asking to be protected from a tough trading environment. It simply wants a chance to survive. The committee's recommendations would give small business that opportunity. Really, you have to look at this in a holistic fashion. It is not a matter of just tweaking the edges; it is a matter of looking at where consumer spending is going in the future and how to address that vision for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the committee is recommending that a uniform retail tenancy code be underpinned in the Trade Practices Act; that specific franchising legislation be enacted by the Commonwealth; and that part 4A of the Trade Practices Act be strengthened to outlaw unfair conduct. That has a number of implications, not just in the plazas of the future but certainly in franchising legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of petrol stations and petrol station operators in my area have complained to me about the invidious position that they have found themselves in with regard to someone who has a strong grip on their industry. All they are asking for is the ability to compete, for there to be strong competition and for them to be able to get ahead on their initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fuel stations are the classic example. If you work very hard in your fuel station it is unlikely that you are going to earn any more than if you were a manager of one installed by one of the major petroleum outlets. Where does that leave the consumer and what is the competition for that? Do we then look at the competition in the future coming from Woolworths and being between Woolworths, BP and Shell? It is a matter of addressing those issues and the franchising issues and of seeing where we want competition in Australia and where it is coming from. With unemployment being the major issue in my electorate, I see it as addressing jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, in petrol stations right across my electorate, they are working seven&hyphen;day&hyphen;a&hyphen;week jobs for incredibly long hours that take them away from their families. They would be more than happy, if the profit margins allowed, to employ other people on a part&hyphen;time or even a full&hyphen;time basis. Their standard of living would go up, the incentive for working so hard would be increased and competition would become quite fierce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment is the major reason. If we can see an area in which we can secure employment, then that is probably the option we should be taking. Certainly, into the future, as things unravel and employment stabilises at a socially acceptable level, then we can look at various restructuring. You always have to look at things in a holistic sense. For example, as in the tariff debate, where it is no good lowering tariffs in isolation, if you are looking at it in a holistic sense in terms of other on&hyphen;costs coming down as well, then you can tweak business here, you can tweak business there and you can make a holistic environment where small business can compete in a very strong competitive environment, they can succeed, and initiative and hard work are rewarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the essence of the people from my electorate, not only in the petroleum service stations and the distributors, but in retail businesses in the large plazas and also in information technology. The business innovation fund has been a major step forward in that. It certainly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7909"> is looking like it is going to shape up to be one of the major employers in the future. Certainly in my area there has been a rapid purchase of the latest technology games and gadgets that this era has given us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to look at three specific issues. One is security of tenure. A person who takes out a lease, or even when they are trying to get a mortgage for a house, needs to know that his business, if it is successful and thriving, is secure in those premises and that he will not have to move again and re&hyphen;outfit another premises in the short term. That is a right to renewal of leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue concerns disclosure statements. They are vital. If you are going to install a petrol station operator on one side of the road and you are aware of another petrol station or an independent operator going in on the other side of the road, then that information should be made available to your franchisee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, franchisees want some independence to make money on their own initiative. It is a two&hyphen;way street, obviously, because major franchisees who work in a self&hyphen;regulated environment, such as McDonald's, have a high standard and require a number of protections of their own in order to reach that standard. People who have a good opportunity and good ideas for franchise should be able to make money on those and not have a black box attached to their till through which major landlords, or major franchisors, can measure their gross turnover and take a percentage of takings. It certainly needs to be underpinned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue was access to justice and education. This access is going to become available with things like the Internet. If we get all businesses on the Internet, we can regularly have management and business education courses to develop the skills, knowledge and ability of our small business people to take Australia into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got a number of incentives that we can provide for small business. Some of the businesses in my area have, in fact, taken to employing people with disabilities. We get a holistic management of society where people who are on disability support pensions are now taxpayers. They come to me quite frequently complaining of how much tax they are paying and their ability to get ahead. In fact, we have with us today the members from my electorate who are nominated in the Prime Minister's award for the best employer of the year and that should be announced at 11.30 a.m. today by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is indeed a most important report and one which deserves the attention of the entire nation. It covers many varied aspects. The particular aspect that I want to focus on relates to franchisees in the petrol retail area. I put forward for the consideration of the House the correspondence sent at the end of July from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7910"> the Shell National Action Group to the honourable Prime Minister (Mr Howard). This correspondence comes from Grahame Henderson, the National Chairman of the Shell National Action Group. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my melancholy duty to confirm to you that Shell has effectively declared war on its remaining single site franchisees by drastically altering their occupancy costs to the extent that many will be insolvent by the end of the year. These latest actions are directly opposed to Shell's written and verbally recorded assurances given to franchisees, politicians, federal and state governments and recent inquiries. These assurances related to our ability to remain for the balance of our terms, without pressure from Shell, even though their previous promises and commitments to renew our terms had been broken.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are aware, and Shell have confirmed, that they intend to imminently close a portion of their retail network and the balance of the remaining businesses currently being operated by single site franchisees are immediately required to amalgamate into their company&hyphen;owned networks after the demise of the franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Shell's dilemma in achieving this outcome has been the existence of contractual arrangements which are in place for up to six years with their remaining single site franchisees who have not accepted the meagre offers to exit. Shell's offers have been declining rather than meeting a fair market price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his letter of 18 July to the Treasurer, the honourable Peter Costello, Shell's chairman, Dr Roland Williams states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of the franchise act would in no way diminish the existing contractual rights of franchisees which are embodied in their current long-term contracts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet, in their latest movement of the goalposts, Shell's letter of 7 July to franchisees has increased occupancy costs in the range of $1,000 to $5,000 per month for most franchisees and less than 20 days notice of this catastrophic restructure was given. Franchisees are unable to restructure mortgages and leasing arrangements, divest of personal assets or rearrange their children in education facilities at such short notice. Mr Henderson further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these unconscionable, and we believe illegal, acts are left unchallenged, Shell will effectively achieve their stated aim of taking complete control of their metropolitan retail network by the end of 1997, regardless of the contractual arrangements which are in place with their existing franchisees and previous written commitments given and received in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be achieved at a profit rather than a cost to Shell when they walk in and pick up the remains of the retail businesses, after our members have been squeezed out by further economic duress, instead of receiving a fair market price to exit, or instead of continuing in the contractual franchise environment, including renewal of terms and enjoyment of the security and reward levels which they purchased at the commencement of their franchise. More insidiously, this will be at the cost of the financial and social demise of their previously necessary and dedicated franchisees, staff and families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shell's Dr Williams' remark and others in that correspondence of 18 July can now be seen in their true disingenuous form when Shell has once again breached their franchise agreements and the Trade Practices Act and have practised blatant discrimination. Shell and the other oil majors' passionate fervour to repeal the petroleum acts is now surfacing in its true colours. It has become abundantly clear that removal at any cost of their single site franchisees is a major portion of their hidden agenda. Prudent industry analysts will no longer be fooled by the Australian Institute of Petroleum's propaganda relating to restructure of this industry and repeal of the petroleum acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He goes on to say that the Franchising Code Council, that he was a director of prior to its demise, is no longer available to control errant franchisors in these situations, and that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7911"> Motor Traders Association and their affiliated bodies are attempting to assist his members with these serious and catastrophic actions by Shell. He further points out that Professor Fels will not be able to act in time to save these imminent insolvencies and that the removal of franchisees from their businesses drastically increases the concentration of retail marketing power in the hands of an overseas owned and controlled oil company which is not in the long&hyphen;term interests of competition for the motoring public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of the Shell National Action Group, the backbone of small business in Australia as well as franchisees of other oil companies, and indeed all small business people, Grahame Henderson points out, all urgently need the immediate protection as detailed in the recommendations of the recent fair trading inquiry, that is to say, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>, which we are debating now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, according to Mr Henderson, Shell have been allowing their members to enter into insolvency before these new draconian measures have been introduced. Indeed, in one case, they delayed serious buyout negotiations with another franchisee, waiting instead to negotiate with his distraught widow once his fight with cancer had ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister, we beseech you to implement the fair trading inquiry recommendations to protect small businesses and cause the behavioural changes in big business necessary for fair trading in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we implore you to convince the Shell company of Australia that their latest unconscionable actions against their contracted franchisees are simply not the way we do business in Australia. They are not just, not right, nor fair to all concerned. Franchisees should be either offered a fair and reasonable price for their businesses, or they should be allowed to remain in compliance with the original contractual arrangements under which Shell and the franchisees entered when they purchased the franchise in the first place. Our hopes and prayers for survival and an equitable solution now rest with your government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That correspondence occurred back in July; we are now in September. We have a government, which claims to support small business, doing nothing while this disaster unfolds. They have had three months to respond to the fair trading report. That is the appropriate time to respond to reports of parliamentary committees. The three months is up. They have done nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is this situation outlined by Grahame Henderson bad for franchisees, it is also bad for the motoring public. We have had a situation just in the last couple of weeks where Shell has reduced its price support arrangements for franchisees in its desire to drive them out of business. Until recently, Shell franchisees have been receiving price support, so they can maintain a dealer margin of 3c per litre, even when they are discounting. Shell is now introducing an arrangement where the level of price support will be reduced if the franchisee discounts more than 3c per litre below Shell's wholesale price. For example, a Shell dealer who discounts 4c per litre below the wholesale price will only get a margin of 2.5c a litre, and one who discounts 5c below the wholesale price will only get a margin of 2c per litre. Certainly in Melbourne, this will just about kill off Shell petrol below 70c per litre. The service station retailers cannot afford to sell petrol for less than a 3c margin because they have to pay rent to Shell, they have to pay their staff, they have to meet all their other costs from this amount. This is simply the latest move by Shell in its campaign to get rid of its existing service station retail network in favour of multi&hyphen;site franchisees whom it can control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next step is to occur on 1 October, when profit support arrangements will be reduced. That, in turn, will send a number of franchisees to the wall. Shell's actions, taken with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7912"> complete disregard for the welfare of both their franchisees and the motoring public, underscore the need to implement the fair trading report presently before the House. The Howard Liberal government must strengthen the protections for franchisees, so that Shell and other oil companies cannot put them out of business by stealth in the way that they are presently aiming to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the government's response and body language in relation to this report are far from reassuring. Indeed, I have heard reports from the National Federation of Independent Businesses that they visited the new Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and that they were very discouraged by his response. He referred to this report as containing isolated incidents, as being over&hyphen;emotional, as having to be examined from a legal perspective. He said he would have great difficulty implementing its recommendations. I further hear that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has refused to make himself available for a very important rally on 17 September in Melbourne at the Camberwell Civic Centre organised by the United Retailers Association.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UK6">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I further understand, moreover, that the minister has not made available a representative. This rally is being organised by the United Retailers Association, the premier body representing retail tenants in this country, a body which is most concerned to secure the implementation of this report. This might be Minister Reith's view from his 17th floor penthouse, but it is not the view that people who are on the ground, in small business, in retail tenancies are seeing. I have got to commend the statements made by a lot of government members, both those who were involved in this committee inquiry and also those who have been speaking in this debate. But the crunch question is: is the government going to implement this report? That is the thing that we need to get from the government, and we need it now&mdash;the three months has passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard from the Property Council of Australia during the parliamentary recess. They produced a report from Access Economics which purported to attack the recommendations in the House of Representatives committee report. They said, `Well, we can't have a situation where there are, at once, both too much supply and also retail tenants being ripped off.' What this market theory that they advanced fails to take into account is the issue of plain, outright lying&mdash;all the misrepresentation to retail tenants that goes on before they enter these businesses in shopping centres and get trapped and locked into these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and over again we find reports of the kind of lying and misrepresentation which appear in this report, and over and over again I find in my own electorate examples of that having gone on. A woman by the name of Olga Pappas set up a deli in Sydney Road, Coburg, right outside Coles. She was told by her landlord, prior to signing the lease&mdash;the landlord is also Coles's landlord&mdash;that Coles would not set up a cafeteria in competition with her. This representation to her that she would have exclusivity was absolutely critical in her agreeing to sign that lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened? As soon as she set up the deli, Coles set up a cafeteria in competition with her. Her lease contains a provision for exclusivity, but it says, `This provision will not be binding on the lessor if their corporate identity changes.' Guess what? Their corporate identity has changed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the kind of conduct that lessees have to put up with. It makes their businesses non&hyphen;viable, it threatens their life's savings, they find themselves negotiating with management with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7913"> a gun to their heads, engaged in secret deals and contracts that they are not even able to tell to the general public.</PARA>

The fact is that these are not new problems being faced by business. These are problems that have been faced by business for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was fortunate enough to attend a meeting in Brisbane a couple of weeks ago with some 350 small business people which was held particularly to address this issue. The member for Wills tried to engage in some cheap political opportunism today by saying that we had a situation where the retailers in Victoria had invited the minister to attend a rally. No government member is running away from this report or running away from the issues here. I remind him that this report was supported by all parties unanimously. The fact is that what it contains can do a hell of a lot to address some of the very important structural problems within business today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the meeting that I attended in Brisbane, it was obvious that feelings run very deep. People are very concerned about their livelihoods. I think that comes down to the fact that we now 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7914"> have, in parts of Australia, some 85 per cent of the retail trade going to the two major players. That is not a healthy situation. That is not the case right across Australia, I realise, but it certainly is in some quarters. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That causes a problem not just to the retailers. It goes right across the sector. It goes down to manufacturers, who are then forced to deal with one or two major players, and to producers, whether of small crops and the like or something else, because of the buying power of these large corporations. This problem is bigger than just retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make here is that I do not want to differentiate between small, medium and large business. I think that the government's focus has to be on business and we should address that situation. What we have is business people being unable to compete on a level footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not subscribe to the theory that we should somehow legislate to assist what is seen to be small business to advantage it over large business, or somehow take away the property owner's right to be able to deal with his tenants. What I am suggesting, and what this report states, is that we should be moving towards safeguards being put in place so that unconscionable conduct cannot take place. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cut and thrust of business should not be interfered with by government. We should be in a robust marketplace where the consumer is able to make decisions. At the same time, we have to be in a position whereby business people entering into arrangements are not sent to the wall because of a disagreement with a landlord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the unfair dismissal laws being based on a fair go all round. That is the principle on which they are based. That is the same principle that I would like to see applied to this report and to the issues that are raised in it. We do not want to see burdensome legislation which is going to create greater red tape and more difficulties. We want to see mechanisms in place so that when there has been conduct unbecoming by either party, that can be dealt with in a fair way without sending proprietors broke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult enough doing business in today's environment without creating greater barriers. I call on the opposition, those members who have bleated long and loud that we have not acted upon this report. Let us just state one thing. As I stated to the small business community the other day, here is the report. It is complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has made a commitment to respond to it in the next couple of weeks. The political point was made that the government had said that it would do it within three months. That was the commitment it was intending to uphold. But due to factors unforeseen, that has had to be blown out by some two or three weeks.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand behind the thrust of the report. I believe that we must see a robust business sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that he will act soon. I might point out also to the member for Longman, before he goes, that even in the most robust of capitalist economies, the United States, there is in my view a far greater degree of protection of these interests, particularly those of franchisees and those that take on leases in shopping centres, et cetera, than can be the case in Australia. In particular, there is always that element where the people entering into these arrangements need to properly satisfy themselves, before they go into the arrangements, that they are actually going to be in a profitable business location from which they will be able to make a living and which, at the end of the day, will enable them to be able to sell or transfer their business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the committee for its work and, in particular, I congratulate the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the chairman of the committee, who has done the parliament a great service in stewarding this particular report through his committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>is probably one of the great landmark reports of the parliament. It is one of those reports that many people in the community look to and say, `This is an example of how the parliament can work effectively on behalf of everyone and not just for one particular interest or political group in the community.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The findings of the report deserve the swiftest, most detailed response from the government to show that it is in fact not only listening to the committee, which it ought to do, but also taking note of the comments and the enormous amount of material that went into making this report from the various interest groups who obviously wanted to participate and have their say. The committee took considerable evidence, from all around the country, showing that small businesses were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power by larger competitors and small business finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the committee for its recognition that action must be taken to improve small business access to justice and to provide small business with better education and training to forestall problems arising. I am particularly pleased with their recognition of the need for general legislative protection for small businesses against unfair conduct, and with their recommendation for change to the Trade Practices Act and for more vigorous activity by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7916">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking through the main recommendations, we see that the committee has first recommended the drafting of a uniform retail tenancy code by the ACCC in conjunction and cooperation with industry participants. This code would then be submitted to the Council of Australian Governments with a view to the adoption of a uniform retail tenancy legislation around Australia. Underpinning this code in the Trade Practices Act is an essential element of protecting and stimulating small business in Australia. A uniform national code with legislative protection, dispute resolution and, above all, security of tenure will be essential if the government is to restart an economy which will boost employment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have to rehash the motherhood statement that small business is the engine room of employment. We know that is a fact. Unfortunately, while everybody talks about small business, it is given lip&hyphen;service in many instances. Whereas the member for Longman did not want to differentiate between small, medium and large corporations or businesses, I do&mdash;because in my view it is possible, in the framework that we have now, for large corporations to be able to manipulate the market so as to give themselves unfair advantages over the smaller and medium&hyphen;sized businesses, to such an extent that they are almost entering into monopolisation of a particular market area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the great culprit in this is the Coles Myer group, and I might mention this a bit later. I view some of the predatory tactics of the Coles Myer group as really needing to be the subject of limitational circumscription by a more vigorous ACCC and certainly by a more vigorous ASC&mdash;because the ASC seems almost to be a lap&hyphen;dog in the current context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must admit to a degree of cynicism when I look at the time it has taken this government to get to a position where we are still only discussing a motion to `take note' on this singularly important plank of their election commitment to small business people. I cannot help but feel the coalition is building momentum for an election campaign. It has developed its package for federal pork&hyphen;barrelling of electorates, now known as the Federation Fund. The members opposite might think I am being a bit unkind, but I was amongst the coalition members who attacked the then Labor government for doing exactly the same thing, so I would feel a bit of a hypocrite if I were not to attack the coalition for merely mimicking what was considered to be one of the low points of the Hawke administration&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the government have had 13 years in opposition to come to some views on this&mdash;not all of you; some of you are very new, of course&mdash;but certainly the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), who was a member before, would know that this is something that has been in the offing for a long time. If the government wanted to get the consensus implied by this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7917"> report, then it should have made a greater effort to bring it to a conclusion and enact its recommendations in the first year of its government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other great criticism of the coalition government is that it is becoming very much like the Fraser government years. It has a large majority on the back bench, there is no debate in the party room of any consequence, the debate outside in the public&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the debate is being led out in the public sector. And who is the debate being led by? It is being led, in many instances, by people on the Left who were actually appointed by the previous Keating administration, who are still in jobs in statutory bodies or in government positions and who are out there, on the taxpayers' payroll, attacking the government that is employing them. I cannot understand how this situation has come to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem, which probably will not please the two members from South Australia sitting here, is that the media, championing the darlings of the centre left of the Liberal Party and giving greater credence to those views, are distorting the mandate that the coalition was given to reform the economy of this country and to make those social reforms that are necessary to get our country working and in a situation where people can run their lives, raise their families and get government off their backs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say this to the coalition: you are going to have a big problem in the next election in saying that you are the natural party of small business, that you understand their problems and that you will fix it for them, because here you are with a milestone report in front of you and we are awaiting and anticipating a response.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will conclude by talking about a problem of fair trading. I am sure the honourable members from South Australia would agree thoroughly with me that it should provide protection for customers. Without it, unscrupulous traders may seriously damage the reputation of the industry sector in the eyes of the public and hurt even the most scrupulous of small business traders. An example can be seen by looking at the operators of two WA computer companies, Computer Warehouse and Jericho Computers&mdash;the latter is also in my electorate. This company is now in liquidation, with substantial debts to its creditors and a record of deceptive and improper dealings with customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of these customers is a part&hyphen;time voluntary worker who sometimes helped in my office, a man over 70 years of age who has dedicated himself to charitable work for the Salvation Army. Computer Warehouse was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 21 May this year as having been described by the WA government's Ministry of Fair Trading as WA's worst retailer. The ministry alleged that the two companies had breached the Fair Trading Act by attempting to mislead customers into believing contracts existed to buy computers when people had simply made inquiries about them, or sought quotes. The companies then billed the people between $2,900 and $6,000 for computers. In some cases, invoices or a letter of demand came months after people had sought a quote. People were led to believe that if they did not buy, they would be sued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One charge against the company relates to coercion whereby the company threatened a customer who had refused to pay for the goods for which a quote had been sought. The man in my office was steamrolled by the company and pressured with threats of legal action that would have destroyed his ability to live a modest daily life on his age pension. When this matter came to my attention I investigated the facts to find, lo and behold, that the principals of the companies were none other than a man named Gabriel Ehrenfeld and another named Marc Dale.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7919">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marc Dale is the president of the Young Liberals in WA and Mr Ehrenfeld's brother, Simon, ran the ill&hyphen;fated 1996 election campaign of Paul Stevenage for the Liberal Party against me in the electorate of Moore. Both have clearly established credentials in the WA Liberal Party and access, in many instances, to decision makers at the highest level in the Western Australian coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply make these observations as a way of indicating the kind of resistance that possibly even the most fair&hyphen;minded people might find in trying to implement a national retail tenancy code, or any form of regulation, to protect people in places such as the state of Western Australia. We have an instance there where people connected with the Liberal Party of WA have behaved outrageously. I make no reflection on the Liberal Party elsewhere. This is a peculiar problem in WA, as you would probably all know, and Mr Dale is a particularly unpleasant character. And I am sure that South Australians would agree with me that the principal of this particular company has been engaged in extraordinarily outrageous conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the people who make up the party which runs government can be demonstrated to be acting contrary to the interests of people, then obviously they should be removed. The problem in WA though will be perpetuated because of the nature of power&hyphen;broking which characterises the Liberal Party in WA. People whose votes are needed to keep one particular faction or another in ascendancy will be tolerated doing almost anything as long as they vote the right way in the state council meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report has the potential to help small business and it is a milestone report. The honourable member for Bendigo will go down in the annals of parliamentary history as being the steward responsible for this magnificent document, the blueprint for the coalition winning government again with the support of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment the coalition does not enjoy that support. Small businesses are feeling extremely jaundiced about their prospects under a coalition government and in many instances they feel betrayed because they were promised a great deal. Unfortunately, after 1&half; years of coalition government they are still saddled with enormous amounts of red tape. They were promised 50 per cent reduction&mdash;</PARA>

I congratulate the committee's chair, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), and other committee members on its completion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report, perhaps innocently, holds within it opportunities to affect the future direction of this nation and the way in which Australians perceive themselves and their opportunities to succeed. In this respect, the report represents more than its authors could have anticipated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7920">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In seeking to address the imbalance that has emerged in this country between the big guy and the little guy in the retail sector, it offers us an opportunity to reflect on the wider Australian society, on the way in which Australians have perceived themselves over the past 209 years and on the way we choose to perceive ourselves into the next millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is undoubtedly a major imbalance in the power relationship between the small retailer&mdash;who has often placed the family home on the line by mortgaging it, borrowing excessive sums of money and going into the retail business&mdash;and the major conglomerates who become their suppliers, competitors and landlords.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negotiations that take place to secure an agreement might be compared to the negotiations that David would be forced to undergo with Goliath if he did not have a slingshot to achieve the victory. The major companies might do well to consider that Goliath in fact may have survived had he been willing to negotiate. Perhaps the government's response to the report should simply be to issue slingshots to small retailers. But killing off the big guys is not the answer of course at any time. We simply need a more equitable playing field and we need to restore the balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the modern day retail Goliaths, there are plenty of Davids ready to do business in search of their financial independence. Inability to find work, the need to be mistress or master of one's own destiny or perhaps a misguided search for prosperity, an investment of a voluntary separation package and plain old masochism are among the factors that lead to the decision by many Australian Davids to establish their own small business. Figures from the last retail census in 1991&hyphen;92 show that 80,230 did so in the retail sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian nation has been built by ordinary hardworking people, willing to pull up their sleeves and get down and just do it. The people who built this nation did so with the great optimism and confidence that they were building a future for themselves and their families. In building their own futures, they were in fact building a nation. They were woolgrowers, merchants, explorers, surveyors, goldminers and innkeepers. The people who built this country rolled up their sleeves and, at times in the face of severe adversity, just did it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the division I was saying that it is a similar spirit which, in the latter part of the 20th century, inspires people to throw themselves into their own businesses. It is most timely that this report has been produced when the federal government is seeking to address what has become, over the past 15 years or so, one of Australia's major diseases, unemployment. Small retailers not only provide goods and services to customers; they are also intensive employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides information on the number of people employed per $1 million of turnover. An examination of the categories where small retailers tend to dominate the market, such as bakeries, shows that in 1991-92 there were 25.6 people employed per $1 million of turnover. In hairdressing and beauty salons there were 39.8 people employed. Pity help the hairdressers and Australia's unemployment rate if someone invents an automated hair cutting, colouring and perming technology! Comparing these figures with categories where large retailers tend to dominate the market, such as supermarkets, the figures show that only 6.9 people are employed per $1 million of turnover.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7921">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst these figures may be open to some interpretation, they do suggest strongly that employment is more intensive in the smaller retailing sector and that, for every $1 turnover transferred to the large retailing sector, jobs are lost. This is something that must be foremost in our minds as we respond to the fair trading inquiry report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What should we do to protect the smaller retailer to ensure that they get a fair go, that there is some equity in the power relationship between them and the owner of the premises they need to rent and their multinational competitor? One of the problem areas for small retailers is in the negotiations with landlords. The major conglomerates pour vast investment dollars into their centres, and they do not do it in order to receive a minimal return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst these large centres provide customers with a great diversity of choice and the comfort of weatherproof shopping, little thought is given to what the customers are missing out on due to the vast social changes that have occurred in changes to retail shopping. The large centres have wiped out many of the smaller shopping centres and shopping strips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, the small retailers outside the large centres have struggled to compete. The small retailers in the large centres have also struggled against the power of the large corporations who own the centres and occupy much of the larger areas of retail space within the shopping centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many factors contributing to the problems facing Australians today, and changes to retailing can obviously not be blamed in isolation. But it is interesting to reflect on the loss of the role of the corner shop and its proprietor from neighbourhoods, and the consequent loss of contact with proprietors and neighbours. Undoubtedly, large regional centres have affected change in social patterns and have contributed to the isolation suffered by many people in contemporary Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small retailers not only provide goods, services and employment; in a small way they help fill the void left by the change in retail and other social and economic patterns. The hairdresser, the deli owner, the bakery, the newsagent and the snack bar all provide a role in communicating with their customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My small retailing constituents provide me with many examples of customers who have come to rely on that contact. In fact, one of my newsagents, upon whom many of my elderly constituents have come to rely for their papers, cards and conversation, helped me campaign to receive postal services in Morphett Vale after the closure of the post office. He has such a good relationship with so many of his isolated customers&mdash;elderly people who could not walk the two kilometres up to the new post office&mdash;it helped me convince Australia Post of their plight, and we got extra postal services at his newsagency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's report identified four areas where small businesses were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. These are retail tenancy, franchising, the misuse of market power by large competitors and small business finance. The chapter on retail tenancy contains a number of horror stories. No&hyphen;one in this place should be left with the impression that these are just a few horror stories that happened to find their way into the court. I hear similar stories from small retailers in my electorate and from other major shopping centres all around South Australia. Clearly, the states have not provided adequate protection to the small retailer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee made 12 recommendations to address the issues presented to them, which it described as plugging the gaps in retail tenancy legislation around Australia. One of the recommendations addressed the proliferation of shopping centres. There were suggestions that social and economic impact statements be lodged with development applications. This is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7922"> perhaps one of the more innovative but obvious recommendations and one which I fully support. Surely it is healthy to examine the impact of large scale investment and determine if it will contribute to the decline of other small businesses in the region and the loss of long&hyphen;term employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also addressed the issue of franchising. Franchising, it seems, can work anywhere between very well and very poorly. Concerns about problems in franchising resulted in the establishment of the franchising code of practice in 1993. Once again, the report recognises difficulties emanating from the inequalities in the power relationship between the little guy, the franchisee, and the big guy, the franchisor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee made three recommendations on franchising. These were: the enactment of franchising legislation; compulsory registration of franchisors; and compliance with codes of practice. From the correspondence I have received, these are desperately needed by the franchisees. One of the other areas where the small retailers suffer at the hands of the big guys is dealt with in chapter 4 of the report, `the misuse of market power'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chapter covered issues such as price discrimination, where evidence was given to the committee showing that supermarket chains were selling products considerably cheaper than the wholesale price available to small retailers, and predatory pricing, where the large retailers undercut the small guys to eventually force them out of business. Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is supposed to provide the protection that small retailers need against these practices, but it has been unremarkable in providing such protection. The committee has recommended amendments to the Trade Practices Act and a greater role for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to curtail the misuse of market power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to last year's election, I met many small business people in my electorate who told me that one of their biggest hurdles was gaining access to finance. The response of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to the Wallis inquiry into banking is designed to produce a more efficient and cost effective financial system through improved competition which will widen access to finance for small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has made five recommendations on this matter which will focus exclusively on the treatment of small business by our financial institutions, with particular attention to the security small businesses are forced to offer if they want the finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my favourite liberal political philosophers, as I said in my first speech to the House, is Leonard Trelawney Hobhouse, because he was passionate about tackling inequality. Hobhouse saw an active role for government in levelling the playing field to protect the less powerful from the more powerful long before such terminology was ever used. Indeed, he saw it as the obligation of government to do so because, in a democracy, the elected government has an obligation to maximise freedom for all its citizens. At times, this requires government to limit the freedom of the more powerful in order to enhance the freedom of the less powerful. Given the beneficial contribution of small retailers to the Australian economy and social fabric, the government should do nothing less in responding to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have great confidence that the report's recommendations will implement in a practical way the good old Australian expectation of a fair go for all, an expectation that this country was built on and an expectation that encourages Australians to give it a go. We will not survive and prosper as a nation and we will not provide jobs to Australians who want them if the little guys do not continue to give it a go. I do not think I want to live in a country where there are no more little guys. I commend the report and its recommendations to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to begin by paying tribute to the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which is chaired by my colleague and friend the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). Their report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> , is a very thorough and comprehensive study of the issues relating to fair trading in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was asked to report on the issues which arise out of commercial dealings, particularly in the area of franchising and retail tenancy. The committee was further asked to recommend ways in which these issues could be addressed, whether by government intervention or by industry self&hyphen;regulation and voluntary codes of conduct. The need to minimise the regulatory burden on business was an important element in the committee's terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of small business to the Australian economy cannot be overestimated. This was the truth that was conveniently overlooked by the previous Labor government, which preferred to do deals with its big business mates. Since coming to office, the Howard government has initiated many reforms which will help small business to survive and, hopefully, to grow. Changes to fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax, reduction in red tape, simplification of government forms, and abolition of the job destroying unfair dismissal laws are but a few of the major achievements of this government in the area of small business policy. These measures have been welcomed by many in small business, but they also tell me, and I can see, that more needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I visit the many small business proprietors in my electorate of Makin, I learn first&hyphen;hand of the experiences and difficulties that many of them face on a daily basis. One of their chief concerns would have to be their relationship with big business. This is not a recent phenomenon, but one that has been around for many years. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>, the committee concluded that many of the concerns felt by small businesses were justified and needed urgent attention. My own observations allow me to support this conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When introducing the Trade Practice Amendment Bill in 1976, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, stated that `free and fair competition is a basic tenet of a free enterprise economy'. Unfortunately, the relationship between big and small business is, too often, not `free and fair'. In investigating the various issues relevant to its terms of reference, the committee received evidence which showed unfair 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7924"> practices in a number of areas&mdash;in particular, between retail tenants and their landlords and between franchisors and franchisees, as well as in the misuse of market power by large firms competing with small businesses and in the harsh conduct by banks and other financial institutions towards their small business clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major concerns is that, in many instances, small business is presented with a deal on a take it or leave it basis and does not have the financial resources to challenge the heavy&hyphen;handedness of big business. The committee has recommended in its report that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission be more active in promoting compliance with the proposed new unfair conduct provisions to the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within Makin there are several shopping malls, including Tea Tree Plaza which will soon become the second largest shopping centre in South Australia. The development of the shopping malls has increased job opportunities for many constituents in Makin and I am naturally very pleased to see that the developers and shop owners have enough confidence in our economy and in my home state to embark on new business ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the downside for some small business retailers has been in their relationship with their landlord. Complaints about retail tenancy accounted for the majority of the submissions received by the committee and more than half of the evidence given at public hearings. Retail tenants have genuine and legitimate concerns and I am pleased that this was recognised by members of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken with small business proprietors in Makin who tell me of the stress they are under from the lack of security of tenure for their business. They feel that they are left in a helpless situation, particularly when they may be trying to sell their business close to the date of the expiry of their lease. Relations between many of these small business proprietors and their landlords are further exacerbated by the lack of clear information given by the landlord during lease negotiations and by the reviewing of rent during the term of lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many small business proprietors who have been trading successfully for years have experienced these problems. Miss Soula George, from South Australia, gave evidence as a representative of the Micro Business Consultative Group. She told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been in small business, mainly in the retailing of food, which is the fastest growing sector in the industry, for approximately 20 years. Seventeen of these years have been in a major regional shopping centre. Consequently, I have witnessed first&hyphen;hand the changes within the industry. I have also seen the deterioration of business relations between landlords, managers and their tenants to such an extent that the malpractice has led to our industry being in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am very pleased with the response of the committee to these problems. Its recommendation for the drafting of a uniform retail tenancy code by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in consultation with industry participants is a sound and fair response to the evidence it has acquired during its investigation of fair trade in Australia. I certainly would support the adoption of this recommendation and look forward to the drafting of such a national code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee further recommended that the uniform retail tenancy code provide for minimum lease terms of five years, with the option of lease renewal for a further five&hyphen;year term. Tenants would also have a right of first refusal of the lease for subsequent five&hyphen;year periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report goes on to recommend further measures for inclusion in the uniform retail tenancy code which would redress the imbalance which currently exists between retail tenants and their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7925"> landlords. Included in these recommendations, I am pleased to say, is that the market review of rent only be permitted on renewal of a lease. If adopted, I believe the uniform retail tenancy code would establish dealings between retail tenant and landlord on a fair and even ground. This measure needs to be adopted and implemented as soon as possible to ensure a sustainable future for many small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr Richard Flashman, Executive Director of the Motor Trade Association of South Australia. He and two other representatives involved with the issue of multi&hyphen;site franchising in the oil industry spoke to me about the problems associated with the operation of a service station. I am pleased to see that these concerns have also been heard by the members of the committee and that recommendations were made in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move by Shell and Mobil to multi&hyphen;site franchising has caused great difficulties for many service station operators. Multi&hyphen;site franchising reduces competition by allowing the oil companies to control the price of oil in a particular area, whereas before, when the owner operators owned the oil in the tanks beneath their service station, there was the ability for the operators to set their own prices accordingly and compete with other service station operators. This is not the case in a multi&hyphen;site franchise situation where the oil company owns the oil in the tanks and sets the prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Service station operators have little real choice other than to accept that which is offered to them by the oil companies or leave their business. They have very little bargaining power. This gives the oil companies great power over individual businesses; the cards are definitely stacked in their favour. The committee heard the concerns, such as the fact that there will be no payment of goodwill on the termination of an agreement between the oil company and the service station operator; that there is an inability on the part of the service station operator to negotiate a price at which products are supplied, with the oil companies dictating price; and that the majority of any liability has been shifted to the service station operator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of the joint statement issued by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Moore) on 11 December 1996 in which it was suggested that the government may remove the Petroleum Retail Marketing Site Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act when the oil companies, the distributors and service station operators, have reached agreement on the new oil code and appropriate code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say that from my investigations into these issues such agreement is still a long way off. I certainly believe that the oil code needs to be strengthened in favour of the small business proprietor before these two pieces of legislation are repealed. The committee has noted the regulatory action taken in the United States in relation to this issue within that country and I express the opinion that something approaching that measure may be needed to be adopted here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have cited two of the main areas of dispute between small and big business covered by this report. These two issues I know to be of relevance to many small business proprietors in my Makin electorate. On their behalf I speak in favour of the adoption of the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. If implemented, I believe that the recommendations will redress the imbalance and bring about greater fairness and equity in the business dealings between big and small business.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all want to see more jobs created in Australia so that our people will be able to work and provide for themselves and their families.

Only small business will be the provider and creator of real jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to take a couple of minutes to commend the committee on the work that it has done so far as reflected in the summary report into aspects of youth suicide. I have taken a particular interest in this inquiry for two reasons. Firstly, I was the first chair of this committee and I have always thought that it has chosen some pretty substantial topics, some very hard personal and social topics to deal with over time. The members of the committee who have been actively working on this particular inquiry will have come across many family situations that are both distressing and difficult to come to grips with. So I commend them for the work and the report to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I also had a particular interest because at one unfortunate time in the late 1980s in Kyneton where my office is in the electorate of Burke, the town was identified as Australia's worst location for youth suicide. At that time there were a number of unfortunate occasions when young people took their lives and, statistically, Kyneton topped the poll for a period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That led to a significant amount of money being spent on some research into that area by both the former federal Labor government and the Victorian state government at the time. But, I have to say that I do not think it took us very far because many of the questions are so difficult to answer. Then, as other areas suddenly became listed at the top of the poll, of course the attention moved elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first recommendations of the committee should be carried through, and I would urge the government and the minister to adopt those findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the first seminar, I was pleased at the extent of interest of federal MPs&mdash;at the number who attended and the presentations. I was quite taken by Professor Baume's presentation, which is in the report. One of his points was that the drug problem that we talk so much about in our community concerns illicit drugs, but that the drug problem at the heart of the youth suicide problem was primarily alcohol and some other forms of legally prescribed drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That gave the committee a fairly sombre note to work on. There is a popular notion that young people get themselves into trouble, for whatever reason, with illicit drugs, but the dominant drug that is prevalent in the medical research that analyses drug deaths is alcohol, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7927"> and that is a legally available drug. So society's defence against this has to be tempered by this knowledge and by understanding the best way to go about dealing with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly draw attention to recommendation No. 3, which is rated priority 3. I think it deserves a higher rating than 3. I call on the government and the minister to give priority to all of these recommendations. The third recommendation comes to the heart of this. In nearly all situations, the people who commented&mdash;family members and so on&mdash;might have noticed some depression. They might not even have been aware of any symptoms. It is very clear that a lot of us do not know what depression is, nor can we recognise it in ourselves or others. When it happens, it seems to be a fairly normal thing; we just seem to be going through a bad time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendation places great focus on putting information in areas where young people go to read and find out things, including the Internet. That recommendation gives a very clear emphasis to the fact that, whatever the circumstances, we might get depressed. If we understand what is happening and what can flow from this, maybe we can put in the defence mechanisms to help not only young people but everybody face this depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recount one situation that I have experienced. A close friend of mine took his life a week or so after talking to me. We were standing outside his house and he said to me, `Neil, I've got five television sets in this house.' He said, `What sort of a family is it that needs five TV sets.' I did not recognise that he was asking me: `Where have I failed? How has this happened that my family is so uncommunicative?' I did not recognise that. Of course, he was obviously entering a severe stage of depression that led to him taking his life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that it is a hugely difficult task that the committee is trying to tackle. Members of the committee will have come in contact with some very difficult and moving situations on which they are trying to make policy sense and in circumstances where often it is impossible to make sense. Despite this, I commend the members of the committee for the work they have done, and the report that they have brought forward is a firm starting base for a national response to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some involvement during our last term of office with the national road safety strategy and it hit me at the seminar that we had either just a few more or almost as many young people taking their lives through suicide as were being killed in car accidents. We are taking many steps in various ways to try and overcome the problem of young drivers being killed in car accidents and since youth suicides are of the same magnitude, that too warrants a national response to the issue. That is what the committee is trying to come to grips with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government and the minister to take account of these recommendations. They are a very good platform from which to launch a response, but I would urge whoever is working with this to give particular attention to priority 3, the depression awareness campaign, and particularly to the use of the Internet. We must make people aware that this can happen to them, that this is how it happens, that here is how they respond to it and all the ancillary offshoots of that, including training and recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the committee for its work and recommend to the government that it adopts these recommendations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> . This report was the result of a one&hyphen;day seminar held here in Parliament House 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7928"> which was attended by members and senators from across the political spectrum and which involved many people from the broader Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all came together to focus on this serious social problem, united in our desire to turn the tide on this tragic conundrum which concerns the whole nation. It is a conundrum because in so many ways to so many people, our great Australian nation is the land of milk and honey. To many of us it is indeed the lucky country, the land of opportunity, the land where fortune truly favours the brave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know so many vibrant young people who have tremendous enthusiasm for life and who have an irrepressible optimism for the future. Therefore, it is incomprehensible to many of us that we also have those young people who feel so isolated from the happy thrust of life, who feel alienated within their own communities, and who experience such a deadly loss of hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are mournfully aware that we have the fourth highest suicide rate amongst our 15- to 24-year-old males in the industrialised world. In 1995, the most recent year for which data is available, one&hyphen;quarter of the total deaths of young males in our target age bracket were attributed to suicide. However, as the report warns us, these deaths can be seen as just the tip of the iceberg because there are about 10 times as many hospital admissions for suicide attempts. Alarmingly, there are about 35 times the number of suicide attempts by young females. These figures have struck alarm bells across the lucky country. We are faced with the tragic reality that there are many young Australians who are so desperately unhappy that they cannot bear to continue to live in our world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Robert Kosky, director of psychiatry at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital, put the question which taxes the hearts and minds of the nation: why do our young people kill themselves? The most vexing aspect of this tragic question is that there is not one clearly identifiable cause for suicide. It was shown to be a multifactoral phenomenon and hence demands a multifaceted approach for solutions. Professor Kosky's research showed that young people move into a dangerous situation when they experience emotional depression at the same time as chronic family discord. In effect, these young people feel that they are unloved, unwanted and worthless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much of this is an unfortunate by-product of our modern high&hyphen;tech society and its accompanied stress is a matter of anecdote and conjecture, but there are many of us who instinctively appreciate that the thrust of modern living leaves many of us bereft of the necessary time to nurture those special relationships in our lives. It seems to me that modern society is marked by an impoverishment of time, and yet many are unaware of how this impacts upon the quality and nature of the relationships which forge the inner worlds of the hearts and minds of our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two significant aspects suggested by Professor Kosky which are instructive in that they produce in the hearts of a depressed young person a sense of isolation which appears to be the one common identifiable factor manifested in each and every victim. It is instructive to consider one of the graphs presented by Dr James Harrison, Director of the National Injuries Surveillance Unit at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which showed a marked decline in the previous suicide rate during World War II. While he did say that there were many complex reasons for this, there are influences within communities in times of perceived common threat which we, again, instinctively understand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7929">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are aware that there is a deeper sense of community spirit, a sense of being needed, a powerful instinct to stand together in our country's darkest hour, a personal feeling of sharing in a great effort, of belonging, of having a real social purpose. One aspect of suicide then, leaving aside those cases of the mentally ill, is a deadly crisis in one's emotional life. It is the lack of any perception by a vulnerable person of any sense of feeling valued or feeling needed or feeling worthwhile. This does not necessarily mean that such a person is not loved or not needed or not worthwhile but that they do not perceive that they are. When such a perception is coupled with a problem in their lives which they are unable to solve because of poor problem solving skills, or they are unable to share because of poor communication links, they find themselves alone, isolated and hopeless, and in terrible danger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know how to create a loving and loved, well&hyphen;adjusted adult human being. It takes a loving and nurturing environment which allows the infant human being to grow in self&hyphen;esteem and self&hyphen;confidence, secure in the knowledge of who they are and where they fit within their families and within their neighbourhood. It is the natural consequence of growing up in a loving family network. I do not assume to define a family because they are like rainbows&mdash;they come in many colours. But, within a nurturing family, a strong sense of belonging and contented happiness grows within the self of the infant from the first days of its life. Babies just do not survive without love, affection and care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Hughes one of our church groups carried out a survey on the feelings of local young people in an attempt to find out how to assist them. To the question, `Do you consider that you live in a loving, caring home environment?' an unexpected 67 per cent said, `No.' I am sure their parents would be shocked because these children come from solid, middle&hyphen;class families where hardworking mums and dads are endeavouring to provide the benefits of life for their offspring, and whose love for their children is their singular reason for working so hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the children do not perceive the strength and security of this love, and this signals to me that we have some very serious problems in the way and effectiveness by which we communicate the strength of our love to our children. One leading consultant child psychiatrist told me that he believed human beings need at least four seven-second hugs a day. Hugs say a lot, especially in the uncertain world of the adolescent. Hugs actually say, wordlessly but very powerfully, `I value you.' Loving hugs are the greatest expression of emotional reinforcement and personal affirmation that we can give our children: they cost nothing but time. But teenagers are not cute and cuddly and it seems very few receive hugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often a self&hyphen;held perception of lack of love and self-esteem leads a young person into alcohol and substance abuse because a lack of love means a lack of understanding, which helps create the sense of isolation, which leaves a void within the heart which fills with pain. At the seminar, Professor Kosky raised the issue of feelings as a very important aspect of youth suicide. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suicide is more than just a feeling. You may feel hopeless and have this terrible feeling that things are not going well and that maybe there is no hope, but the thoughts that come to you about wanting to kill yourself because you cannot deal with these factors are also critically important.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these thoughts turn into the action of self destruction, they become a possible tragedy. So we should not separate feelings but should look at issues in a more holistic fashion . . . in terms of thoughts, feelings and actions. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7930">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are countless events which could turn those thoughts into actions of self&hyphen;destruction. There is one which I would like to draw to the notice of the House, and that is the undocumented impact of dark, negative and violent lyrics heard in some of the heavy metal type music which is on the market and which is listened to by our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Forum</EMPHASIS> of April 1997 entitled `Pop music and the death of culture'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Modern music has made some very radical changes in the past few decades. In 1953 the number one song was `How much is that doggie in the window?' and ten years later the Beatles were singing `I wanna hold your hand'. Things quickly declined thereafter, however. Songs by the Rolling Stones such as `Lets spend the night together' led to more graphic ones.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Death metal groups like Cannibal Corpse, Nine Inch Nails and Slayer dish up grisly tales of violence and death. Consider a few titles from Cannibal Corpse's albums called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crucifixion</EMPHASIS>  and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anti&hyphen;Christ Superstar</EMPHASIS> . Manson, an ordained minister in Anton Levy's Church of Satan delights in promoting murder, suicide and hatred of religion. Band members wear a T&hyphen;shirt saying, `Kill your parents'. Consider a few lines from various songs in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anti&hyphen;Christ Superstar</EMPHASIS> , which reads, `You can kill yourself now because you are dead in my mind.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These songs of nihilism and hate are certainly a far cry from the kind of popular music of few decades ago. Professor Kosky's warning of the danger of thoughts turning into action can all too easily turn into an icy reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a tow truck driver in my area who has had the terrible job of collecting motor vehicles which have been used by young male suicide victims. On one occasion he reported back to his boss, a personal friend of mine, that when he pressed the button on the cassette deck, out blasted at full volume heavy metal type music with messages of death and hate. He also went on to say that this was not the first time he found this kind of death music in such motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to believe that there is not a connection. Suicide is a complex and deadly confluence of circumstance and negative thoughts in the life of a young person. When it is understood, as research shows, that children listen to music over 30 per cent of the waking hours, the danger of negative and destructive thoughts turning into tragic action gets closer to becoming a tragic reality. Such violent, hateful, nihilist and doom laden music is freely available for our children to hear. Added to alcohol and drug abuse, it is a deadly cocktail. It is worth observing that illicit drugs appeared in any quantity on the Australian scene in the early 1960s, as did the beginnings of violent and hateful messages of death and destruction in our children's music. It was about this time that our suicide rate began to climb tragically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly urge our government to seriously and urgently investigate the lack of effective regulation in the music industry. This will at least protect our young people from one source of destructive negativity and hate. It is up to us to continue to research this complex issue and take positive action when we do find a situation which demands our attention. As the elected members of parliament, we are the only Australians who can act to stem the importation of such music for the protection of our young people. To do nothing would be a gross abdication of our responsibility to those young Australians who, because of other circumstances in their lives, are vulnerable and are at risk that their negative thoughts turning into the action of self&hyphen;

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Other than acknowledging and recognising the importance of the aspects of youth suicide summary report as further beginning a process in this country to address the appalling statistics of youth suicide, I found the report somewhat disappointing. Let me qualify that. I am appreciative of the fact that the seminar was just one day and that for personal reasons, I was unable to be there. Be that as it may, my disappointment is that only one major point, out of at least the four that are required, was identified and that was the national inquiry. For me, it simply reinforced the view I have held for many years now that, when children are concerned, this parliament is as ignorant as most other influential groups in this country. I will provide evidence to support that perhaps unpopular and minority contention a little later in my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to be perceived as deliberately provocative. This issue is far too important for that. I simply believe that the direction indicated by the seminar does not go far enough. No&hyphen;one is the fount of all wisdom, and I am no exception, yet I do not believe I am wrong and I am yet to be convinced that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summary report correctly indicated that the rates of suicide per 100,000 of population show that, since the 1960s, the rate of young male suicide has almost trebled and the rate of young female suicide has doubled. The report also indicated that, for young males between 1979 and 1995, there has been a fivefold increase in deaths from hanging. The report also acknowledged the multitude of complexities that impact upon the circumstances that lead to youth suicide. But what it did not do was explain and identify the circumstances happening in this country affecting children and adolescents in the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s. The report stated that, for young males in Australia between 1979 and 1995, there had been a fivefold increase in deaths arising from hanging. The question that needs to be asked is: what circumstances in this country during this period changed that may have directly or indirectly contributed to feelings of depression, isolation and so on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1979, I was a principal of a primary school in Adelaide with about 900 students. I mark this particular year very clearly because in South Australia this was the beginning of the severe decline in the value South Australian society placed on the care and education of children, particularly young children. I soon became very aware that this was not just a South Australian problem. It was an Australian problem, an English speaking world problem and, finally, a developed world problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a given, in my view, in the care and education of children, that is steadily but ever increasingly being devalued in Australia and elsewhere in the world. That given is as follows: that between the ages of seven and 11, the quality of schooling is the most significant determinant of the future success of an individual. It is more important than gender, socioeconomic status, ethnic background or religion, which compared to quality schooling have received far greater priority than they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The London Educational Authority after a four&hyphen;year longitudinal study, one of the few ever done with children in primary schools, concluded exactly this in 1986. But state governments throughout Australia have ignored that given for the past 20 years. The age group five to 15 are the forgotten people in Australian society. The allocation of resources to this group that actually goes to supporting young people on the ground has seriously deteriorated over the last 20 years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7932">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some will point to increases in funding. But I tell you, precious little of that funding went to kids themselves. The year 1979 saw the beginning of a `Primary means first' campaign in South Australia to increase resource allocation to primary schools. It failed. In the early 1980s, another campaign entitled `Into the nineties' commenced and received overwhelming support from schools and parents. Similar campaigns occurred in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That campaign and the individuals who drove it, a group of 12 primary principals, was white&hyphen;anted and discredited by no less than the education bureaucracy and the Secondary Principals Association, who, like some powerful individuals in the teachers union, TAFE and university, saw it as a threat to their favourite resource allocation and fought it tooth and nail. However, this campaign had some success in that the bureaucracy was forced to announce a primary review. Schools, however, are still waiting 10 years on for any substantive implementation of those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important point I make here is that advocacy for young people five to 12 disappeared. The separate bureaucracies for early childhood and primary education were dissolved. Individual after individual at a senior level who argued for a fair go for primary aged school kids was given redundancy, retirement or simply chose another occupation. Advocacy for young people aged five to 12 was gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can anyone in this house point to a group in Australia that effectively represents the needs of children aged five to 12? There is none. That is a major problem that needs to be addressed. It requires national leadership that up to the present time has gone missing. At the national level, it requires a ministry for children and youth affairs, a point made to this parliament several years ago by the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already stated that educational leadership went missing. Political leadership has gone missing too, but it is even more widespread than that. The churches ignored the needs of young children. They were more concerned with dwindling membership, widespread child abuse which was coming to public attention at an alarming rate and looking after their particular sectoral interests. Mainstream structural and resource problems were just overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unions ignored the needs of young children. Like the churches, they were too preoccupied with dwindling membership, as well as union amalgamations and rightly preserving the jobs of their members. They did not see children five to 12 in their ballpark of interest. The welfare sector forgot the link between the mainstream young and the special groups of adolescents and young adults they tried to represent. The needs of the very young were just ignored. The business sector, which had seldom shown any interest in the very young, simply continued their merry blind way on to what was going on all round them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The women's movement made us all aware of the legitimate needs of women. It failed miserably in recognising the needs of children aged five to 12. Ethnic and indigenous leaders, to the best of my knowledge, made little or no attempt to represent the five to 12 age cohort of children. Their commitment was on other fundamental and, for them, crucial issues. The green movement forgot about the needs of young people, even though these same young people greatly assisted their propaganda. The list of non&hyphen;concern goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I state this not to slam these groups, most of whom were involved, in a period of great change, in fundamental and crucial issues highly important in our time. I simply point to the reality that, in addressing fundamental issues of change, there was no time and no energy for kids.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7933">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1980s, we saw a phenomenal growth in child care, recognising the increasing need for women to enter the work force. Instead of calling it parent respite, which it is, we called it child care. Now I defy anyone in this house to say that the rationale for this was the care of children; it was not. The rationale was to allow parents the opportunity to work and there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that. It makes good economic sense. Whether it makes good social sense for children is somewhat debatable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But again, to take the year 1979 as a starting point, other phenomena were occurring in this country. Unemployment was beginning to become chronic and endemic, and settling around a 10 per cent figure to which orthodox economics could do and would do nothing. As unemployment became entrenched and youth unemployment soared to around 40 per cent and higher in rural and regional Australia, another phenomenon was taking place. As people were getting out of work, overtime in this country soared to 20 million hours a year. That is the equivalent of 500,000 forty&hyphen;hour a week jobs, from 1978. Note the time scale. For the 150 years prior to 1979, working hours in the English&hyphen;speaking world decreased and decreased, yet in 1979, for the first time, the graph for working hours goes the other way. Overtime for males increased by 80 per cent and for females there was a 100 per cent increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At exactly the same time, effective resources for primary schools were being reduced. Parent opportunities to be with their children were also greatly reduced. As more and more parents placed children in child care, parents became less involved in school and community activities, tired by long working hours, depressed by job insecurity. The other group in our community, teachers, who spend as much time with children, were being demoralised by what was occurring in primary education. Children were becoming more and more isolated. The two groups they relied on so heavily, parents and teachers, became preoccupied with their own very real problems. Marriage breakdowns, drug and alcohol abuse, violence and all the other negative issues of today's society all contribute to the isolation of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget the media's role in this. A Sydney study a few years ago recognised that up to 96 per cent of the print media's depiction of our children was negative, and the&mdash;precious little&mdash;positive depiction of children is not too flash either: pretty young girls, handsome young boys, presenting mostly non&hyphen;achievable roles for other young people. Cute, but of no substance whatsoever. Yet we are confronted with an ever&hyphen;increasing crisis with young people in Australian society. All of us are being shown as being quite impotent in dealing with the problem. Young people do not just commit suicide. It is a culmination of years of neglect, wrong diagnosis, wrong emphasis, wrong solutions, and lack of political will and community will, that makes particular young people just end it all. The report correctly identified the dearth of data concerning young people. This is another indication of neglect and wrong emphasis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have addressed thus far a failure in relationships with children by parents, teachers and interest groups in Australia, including government, and also the failure of an effective advocacy group for children in the age group five to 12. I would like to continue that theme of failure to relate to young people as it impacts on the age group 15 to 19. Rightly or wrongly, we all describe each other by occupation. Young people are no different. Yet dramatic change has impacted upon the opportunities to get a job. The teenage labour market has collapsed. Technology, especially in financial institutions, has removed entry level jobs for young people. Downsizing, outsizing and outsourcing, in both the public and the private sector, have removed entry level jobs for young children, young people. It is short&hyphen;sighted policy but it is reality. Young people are more adversely affected by those changes than any other group.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7934">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When young people are in the transition from 15 to 19 years of age, three institutions have a large impact upon them&mdash;schools, training providers, in which I include universities, and employers, both private and public. Do schools have a strong relationship with training providers and business or government? Do training providers have a strong relationship with schools and business or government? Does business or government have a strong relationship with schools or training providers? We all know what the answer is. It is a resounding no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three groups in the real world have no real knowledge of each other. The dialogue that does occur between these three groups is noted for its infrequency and for the predictability that each one of the institutions will denigrate the other two. That is not particularly helpful to young people. One has only to talk to young people themselves who have sent off numerous applications for jobs, only to be rejected, to know the distress that causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government, business, training providers and schools can no longer operate in isolation from each other and expect young people to survive and this country to have a positive future. Children and young people need consistency&mdash;it is a basic human need. It is my experience with children that, whether their parents relate to them strictly&mdash;spare the rod and spoil the child&mdash;whether it is by family consensus or whether it is completely laissez&hyphen;faire, the child is always well adjusted when the message they receive from their parents and teachers is totally consistent and is communicated to the child. It is inconsistency and lack of communication that destroys children's modes of behaviour. It is no different if these children see the same inconsistencies coming from schools, training providers, business or government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report acknowledges that fatal trauma of young people is higher than the quoted figures. What surprises me is that the figures are not substantially higher, given what young people have been exposed to in our society over the last 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The setting up of a national inquiry will assist the database so sadly and irresponsibly missing. But this tragedy of youth suicide needs much more than that. In brief, three other matters need to be addressed. One is advocacy, one is resources and one is effective communication between groups that have an impact on children and youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the advocacy issue could be begun by the setting up of a ministry of children's and youth affairs at the national level and taking seriously not just youth suicide but all the problems confronting youth and children. We have never done this in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the resources issue could begin to be effectively addressed again by national leadership, placing much needed accountability on state governments for the negligence&mdash;and village hall mentality on many occasions&mdash;regarding children's and youth affairs, particularly the issue of resource allocations that actually find their way into the school to benefit children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, all groups seeking funding from government would have one other criterion added to that agenda of ethnicity, the disabled, and so on. That criterion should be children and youth. What are they doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the important work of the standing committee in making a further beginning on this tragic issue. Clearly, I am perhaps on a different wavelength to most&mdash;whether that is the correct wavelength, perhaps only time will tell. I thank members for their attention.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), and share his concerns about youth. I also wish to highlight what I consider the critical element missing today for young people between the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7935"> ages of five to 12 and 15 to 19. I see this essentially as a time factor. Parents are no longer willing to spend the time with their youngsters. The opportunity for child care is readily available. But the genuine need for nurturing is still there for the children to share their ideas, for parents to be there to listen, and for children to have the opportunity to talk and to have taken seriously what their place and space is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met some young people at the recent youth forum conducted in Canberra and it was interesting that these 18&hyphen; and 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds identified the need for parenting courses as a necessity for parents to have a mature approach to raising children. This is something that I feel we need to identify. Coming out of the mouths of babes, as one of a more mature age would suggest, is the identification of the flaws in perhaps their relationships with their own parents or the flaws they can see in other people's relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the critical pieces of information that has been received relating to this report on youth suicide. The identifiable causes, or the conditions that preceded a suicide, were often the lack of time&mdash;or the lack of effort&mdash;given by parents towards recognising the child's cry for help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased today to have the opportunity to speak to the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS>, although its contents are very disturbing. Before talking about the issues contained within the report, I would like to congratulate the committee secretariat and my fellow committee members for the work that they have put into this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report should shock all Australians. Suicide, particularly where it concerns our youth, is a subject many would prefer not to talk about. It is a distressing issue and one which, all too often, gets pushed aside: it is put in the too&hyphen;hard basket. But we are forced to face the realities of life at this time. Youth suicide is a reality. No&hyphen;one in this house could deny that the current rate of youth suicide in Australia is unacceptably high. If just one person took their own life per year, that rate would be too high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in stressful times. There appears to be more pressure on our young to succeed, both at school and in the workplace. There are also more social demands on the youth of today, and the recent concerns over heroin trials and the easy availability of drugs within our community are ringing alarm bells for each and every one of us. The problem is coming closer every day, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is probably someone within your own personal experience who has either attempted to commit&mdash;or has succeeded in committing&mdash;suicide, who has had available to them drugs or illegal substances, including alcohol and other abuse substances. There are other options for our young, but these are not highlighted as much as the negative aspects of suicide and drug abuse are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments need all the help they can. They need advice, realistic advice. They need first&hyphen;hand knowledge from people who have experienced these critical times in life and survived. It is the survivors who can mentor and assist others in the crisis that they are facing at this particular time. Quite frankly, what we found was that youth did not have anywhere to go. Often the peers knew of a child's attempt, and the uncanny disappointment, frustration or depression that was the critical factor, in many cases, that led to suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report goes some way to addressing the needs of our young. It pinpoints the major factors that influence our young and suggests ways in which this and succeeding governments should deal with the problem. I am pleased to say that there are helpful associations out there. Community groups are willing to link and network and assist in the prevention of suicide.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7936">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) recently launched the Lifeline Australia youth suicide prevention project. This service, which has received $3 million in funding, will extend the range and availability of telephone counselling services to youth. Youth need to share their concerns with someone who is easily contactable. If parents, carers, family members or peers are not there, that telephone link is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other measures and programs being introduced, totalling $31 million over the next three years. They include $6 million to the states and territories to improve access to counselling services in rural and remote areas, because this was where the need was seen to be critical, as more youth suicides occur in rural and remote areas. There will be $3 million to provide programs for parents&mdash;and I really feel that is probably not enough. Parents are everywhere, and they need to be able to access those facilities when they are facing troubled times, depression and financial concerns. So that they do not need to turn to drug or substances to ease the pain, they need friendly advice and assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is $2 million for education and training of health professionals. Recognising the symptoms of depression is critical. If a child presents itself to a GP, which is not always the case because they are usually accompanied by a parent, they may not be willing to express their innermost feelings and the doctor may not be able to identify depression as the cause. However, other health professionals and counsellors in schools should be able to pick up those critical points where a child is suffering, and suffering in silence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is $1 million for research into childhood mental health and factors which lead to adolescent suicide and attempted suicide. While young adolescent males are the most successful at youth suicide, it is disturbing to find that young girls attempt suicide at a much higher rate. This cry for help needs to be identified and assistance needs to be there at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that funding, there is $19 million for the national youth suicide strategy. This includes the Here for Life program initiated by the former administration. The work and activities of that program have created a very positive community support network in areas where it is established. I am aware of one that is being established and is working very well in the Logan area. The networking of community workers is coordinated through the Royal Australian Society of General Practitioners. It has made significant progress towards bridging the gap between informed and trusted GPs and local youth so they can access and communicate with them through their personal interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the opportunity for GPs to go in and talk about current issues. Where young people might not be able to talk about it with their parents if they are not there, they have the time allocated during their school routine to talk about critical issues. They might sound silly&mdash;I remember being asked for questions when I was at school and we had to write them down so as to remain anonymous. Quite frankly, some of the answers we got from our adults, who were not GPs, trivialised or did not really listen to our concerns. But I am assured that this program is critically listening and answering the needs of those youth in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am hopeful that the benefits and expertise of this program can be transferred and translated into my electorate through the Redlands Youth Network. The network has built up a strong support base for many young people in need of help in the area. They have introduced a wide range of programs to assist these people. The group also runs activities, particularly during school holiday periods, to give the youth something constructive to do with their time and not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7937"> give them time to get into trouble. The Redlands Youth Network has the full support of the local council and I have supported their activities in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will continue to support such groups. In an effort to overcome the problems confronting our youth, we will endeavour to proceed and succeed. However, it is one thing for these programs to be set up. What we as federal members need to be doing is telling our constituents and health professionals what is available. All the money in the world is no good to the 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old in my electorate, or in other electorates around the country, who has been cut off and isolated from society. How is he to know what programs the government has put into place? Who he can call? Where he can call? He or she is too busy searching through the bins at the back of Woolworths trying to find a feed for the night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was given an offer recently by my local ambulance drivers to join them one night on a tour of the electorate so that I could see what they see. I will be taking them up on the offer, but I can say that what I have already heard about the homeless youth in my local retail shopping centre is disturbing. Having realised this was a major concern, I have met with the Wynnum and Redlands Youth Suicide Prevention Committee and Bayside Adolescent Boarding Incorporated. These groups, along with the Redlands Health Service Centre and the referral and assessment program, or RAP, are working towards achieving positive solutions for youth in my electorate of Bowman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This group came to me with a list of proposals including better promotion for telephone counselling services, an infocard for all youth in the area, a resource kit for teachers and youth workers and, most importantly, consultation with youth to help them help themselves. This report has gone to many groups in my community in Bowman and we are looking forward to facilitating programs and encouraging the youth to access the services that are provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth of this country are our nation's future. We need to look after them. We need to help them the way we were helped as we grew up. We must remember that the pressures of today's world are in many cases greater than they were for us as teens. We must be sympathetic to their problems, not judgmental.</PARA>

I was very pleased to speak at the time of the tabling of the report and am equally pleased to have the opportunity to further add to the discussion today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefit for me in coming back into the debate at this point of time is the time that I have had since the issuing of that report to hold discussions, both formally and informally, with a range of people throughout my community on the subject of youth suicide. That is not to say that that had not been spoken of before, but the report has really jolted a lot of people into concentrating on it more and thinking more deeply about what we should, in fact, be trying to do to address this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of this committee, I took advantage of getting in excess of 100 copies of that report and I sent copies to a very broad range of people within my electorate. I asked them to look at it, read it, and come back to me with comments. And the comments have been very interesting and useful.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7938">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no doubt that youth suicide is a serious concern for all of us, not only as parliamentarians, as members of particular political parties, but also as members of our community. Our community, holistically, collectively, has to start to address this problem as seriously as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we have got to keep the issue in perspective and face up to it with a certain degree of reality. We have also got to admit that it is not unique to this country. In fact, only last weekend or so I read in one of the weekend newspapers a very large article about the very issue we are talking of. It was a newspaper from Bangkok&mdash;the main daily major up there&mdash;that a friend had given me to read over the weekend. The very subject of youth suicide was being talked about there, and there was a very large article in the paper about how their society is coming to grips with it and what sorts of things they are starting to consider to address the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when we are talking about youth suicide, we need not necessarily get carried away with the Australianism of it, but focus on the problem itself. It certainly knows no borders in terms of ethnic or social bordering and it crosses over a range of people within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the suggestions coming forth in the committee's paper are important and I, along with probably every member of the House, am sincerely looking forward to government action on them. However, I believe that we also need to start looking further into the question of suicide amongst our young and start asking some of the more difficult questions. I think that these relate to the sorts of pressures that are faced by young people today in our society. Have we, as a community, actually thought about how we value our young people? Do we value them enough? Do we value them fairly? Do we put blame on them for difficulties that they may be facing today which are not necessarily of their making at all but are of the making of our generation and generations before us? I am using the word `blame' in a fairly light fashion. I am not saying that we stand there and throw it at them, but are we inferring it in some of our actions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are facing the severe and heartbreaking problem as a nation of unemployment. This issue is not being dealt with by our nation collectively. I believe it is the country's biggest issue, and one of the most difficult to solve. Should we be blaming our young people if they cannot find employment? Is that what we are doing? I am being very bipartisan in these comments. In some of our actions as a government, as parliamentarians, as business people, as leaders within our community, are we really imputing blame to our young people that is not theirs? Are we considering the impact of those decisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pace of change in today's world is already frightening enough to many of us along the road of life. From our point of view, some of our polling in past years has indicated a particular fear, a hesitation or a lack of understanding in the community of the pace of life and the pace of change. A lot of people, both young and old, have difficulty in dealing with that and in keeping up with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sound a bit prophetic, when a young person starts out on that road of life, how do we know how these people feel about actually jumping on to that spinning disc of life? Are we actually giving them enough credit to understand the difficulties that they are facing in sorting out their lives in front of them? The age when youth suicide unfortunately occurs is when these decisions have to be faced by these very young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How on earth can we support them at that time in their lives, given the pace of that spin? Is it their fault that they have trouble in working out where they fit? I sometimes sit and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7939"> wonder how difficult it must be. How often have we all said, `I wouldn't be young again for all the tea in China, given the difficulties in our world today.' When we talk about youth suicide, we really need to have this broad view about it: what is it and why is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a society, another issue that concerns me is our speed to judge. Only a few short years ago&mdash;probably in the last three to four years&mdash;within my own community, we had an unfortunate period when people were quick to judge groups of young people congregating in the community. There was almost hysteria in the local press at the time so that, if you were not a young person and you saw a group of them in the street, you actually walked around them and avoided them. They were to be feared because they were congregating, loitering&mdash;all of these new modern words. Yet what did we do when we were their age? We congregated and we loitered, for want of better terms. I can remember doing it many times on train stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In today's age of technical advancement, young people spend a lot of time on their own, or with a very small number of people, in front of computer screens or video games and other technology. When on earth are they going to learn to socialise? We have to promote that; we should not condemn them. As a society, we need to sit back and ask whether we are correct in judging in the way that we sometimes do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to allocate dollars to the question of youth suicide. But as important as that is: what role do those other factors play? Are we giving due credit to considering those other things? Are we sufficiently addressing mental illness amongst the young? I do not believe that we are. In fact, if I hear one more time any government of any colour say, `We can't afford to do that', I will despair. There are certain things that we simply must afford to do. We cannot let our young people down, nor any part of our community for that matter, when we talk about `need of home'. Homelessness cannot be addressed without spending money. Mental illness cannot be cured, assisted or supported without spending money. This is an undoubtable fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we create buckets of goodwill in terms of money towards youth suicide&mdash;which I do not for one moment denigrate&mdash;that on its own is not going to achieve a thing, if at the same time we have mentally ill, homeless young people roaming the streets with no support and no hope for their future. Without this holistic approach, we are really cheating our young people and putting ourselves under a delusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth suicide knows no boundary, social or economic. You can have a youth successfully suicide from one of what we would judge to be the best or the worst of families, depending on how you make that judgment. You can have youths successfully suicide whether they go to church every weekend or whether they do not. You can have youths successfully suicide whether or not they have been in the child-care system or whether or not they have had a parent home at 5 o'clock every day. We have to get away from the categorisation of blame. We have to look at all of the underlying reasons why pressures upon our young people are driving them to this terrible choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that frustrated me as a member of this committee, and I have said this before and I will say it again, is that whilst there is a lot of data around, it is not comprehensive. It is not good enough to tell me, as a parliamentarian and a decision maker, hopefully, that young men in rural areas succeed in suicide more than others&mdash;without telling me why, and we do not know why. Nobody has told me whether the young men in rural areas committing suicide are doing it because their parents' farm has been repossessed, or because they are homosexual and terrified to tell anybody, or because their girlfriend has walked out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7940"> on them. All we know is, and I am being terribly general here, that young rural men suicide successfully more often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that we need to consider carefully is the fact that 60 per cent of those who succeed in suicide have attempted it before. If we know that, why are we letting that 60 per cent group do it successfully the second, third, fourth or fifth time? What is wrong with the counselling service? What is wrong with the follow up? What is wrong with the collation of data around that individual?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just after this report was tabled I had a lady from my electorate come to see me. This is a family with a lot of socioeconomic problems, a lot of pressures on the single parent. She had had two daughters. The elder daughter succeeded in suicide a few short years ago. The younger daughter, a month or two before the mother came to see me, had also attempted suicide, but had not succeeded. A mad, frantic phone call to the authorities had someone visit her that day to intervene immediately, but the follow-up counselling was 3&half; weeks later. That is just not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a lot of cases, in 3&half; weeks time a young person may not remember why they did it. Who knows the understandings of a confused young mind? I am not being critical of government when I say that. We have to demand that resources be put where they are required, and I do not think it is good enough for a family in that situation to be forced to wait that period of time. There should be an automatic scooping up of that family, and they should understand immediately that whatever support is required around them is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mother was as much in trauma as the daughter. The mother got no assistance, and none was offered. I am sure that this is not a unique situation; I am sure that it happens in many electorates around the country. If we are going to be sincere about this then I really think we need to start making these sorts of demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reaction that has come to me from my community has been the need to demystify youth suicide because in some ways we are too scared to talk about it. If we talk about it too much we might put it up as a pretty good option. The people who have been talking to me&mdash;parents, members of the clergy, young people&mdash;have all said we need to get down to tintacks here. If youth depression is a problem then we need to understand how to recognise it and how to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of those discussions, I am organising a forum on Friday of next week and Professor Kosky, who was one of the experts who came to our committee, has agreed to come over from Adelaide for this two-hour seminar. I am getting up to 200 people to come to this forum. In fact, we are going to have to close the door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why I am doing this is because the community demands that I give them an opportunity to hear a clinician, in very non-clinician terms, say what it is we are talking about when we talk about youth suicide. I have a lot of faith in this seminar because everyone can come&mdash;youth workers, parents, teachers, the clergy, young people, scoutmasters or whoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this is that I think these people need to be able to sit down at that level, hear the expert, discuss it with him, and amongst themselves, and go out, I believe, better armed, better informed and more confident in understanding what they are dealing with. This forum is only a very small thing that I can do. The bottom line for me in this whole subject is the consistency we require in approaching the subject. The Here for Life program did a lot of good. The current government's program is going to do a lot of good. But while young people remain homeless, suffering mental illness, unemployed, lacking direction in their future, lacking 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7941"> security and knowing where they are going and why, all of those dollars will only have half value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My message to this parliament is that we all should do what we can to make sure that all of those issues are addressed, right across the board, and not isolate youth suicide as some unique part of social policy. It is the result of a lacking in all of those major areas of policy generally.</PARA>
