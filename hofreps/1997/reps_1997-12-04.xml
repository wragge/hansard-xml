<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the second of three matters on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  this morning. The one that we now have before the chair is the one relating to some recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Procedure on the operations of the House. I am pleased to say that, since we were elected, this government has continued the process of reform of the standing orders of this parliament to facilitate the better and smoother running of the parliament but, most importantly, to provide further opportunities for members to speak and to voice the views of their constituents. Members will remember, for example, going back to the early days in the election of this government, that we abolished the Keating roster system which, under Mr Keating's regime, meant that ministers would front up only every second day. We changed the sitting times so that the&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, their interjections only demonstrate the lower standards that we have long had to suffer from the other side. We changed the sitting times of the parliament so that the parliament's question time in the House of Representatives could be televised. You might remember that Mr Keating was opposed to televising question time. The Senate did so, which forced the House of Representatives to make it available. He moved question time to 3 o'clock so that the ABC would not play it, and the reason they would not play it was that they wanted <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS>  on. Those were the standards of the previous government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The details of the proposals before the House today come as a result of some propositions put by private members to the Procedure Committee. Mal Brough, for example, thought that there ought to be more speaking opportunities and, in fairness, so did Roger Price, who in a notice of motion also proposed the concept of constituency statements. The government has generally taken the attitude that if there are constructive suggestions then they should go to the Procedure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12031"> Committee. The Procedure Committee has representatives from all sides on it and they should make recommendations. We have also had the Procedure Committee go back over all the reports that were sitting on the shelf during Labor's years and we asked the Procedure Committee to give us an update on all the things that the Labor Party failed to respond to. We have responded now to, I think, every issue that has been raised in the last decade and, where we have seen it reasonable to do so, we have adopted a lot of those changes. You might say that these are not major matters, and in one sense they are not but in another sense they do mark and symbolise the continuing commitment of this government to raise standards and to provide opportunities for people to speak. We think that is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Standing Committee on Procedure circulated a questionnaire in the middle of last year seeking the views of members on the issue of providing further opportunities for people to speak in the Main Committee. Eighty per cent of the members who responded to the questionnaire felt that present speaking opportunities were insufficient. So there was clearly a strong demand that we should do more. The two greatest preferences were for a half&hyphen;hour adjournment&mdash;86 per cent of respondents&mdash;and an additional one hour every Monday and Tuesday for constituency statements to be made. That was 63 per cent. Following further consultations with government members&mdash;the chairman of the committee, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), and the Chief Government Whip (Mr Andrew) in particular&mdash;and the opposition, it has been decided that provision will be made for an adjournment debate and a new procedure, constituency statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adjournment debate and constituency statements will be on a Thursday, and it is proposed that there be three speakers a side for up to three minutes on a Thursday for these constituency statements&mdash;referred to as members' statements in the formal standing orders. It is proposed that there be a half&hyphen;hour adjournment debate at the completion of business on those days. So the day will start with constituency statements and finish with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adjournment. The adjournment is in the usual form&mdash;five minutes for half an hour. All other things being equal, that will provide, therefore, 12 further opportunities.The three&hyphen;minute statement is an innovation for the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is interested and has put forward a constructive suggestion. It seemed to me that it was worth a try. This is for a trial period. It is proposed to apply for the autumn and winter sittings in 1998. Let us see how it goes. It does give members a bit more of an opportunity than the 90&hyphen;second statements to make a more substantive, constructive contribution. That is not to say that the 90-second statements do not provide a useful vehicle for statements. Many members have been using them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think the members generally feel that in a 90-second statement, they have to prepare every word and then they have to get up and go as fast as they possibly can to get the last word out so it is on the public record. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, standing orders that require politicians to speak more succinctly, clearly and quickly is probably not a bad idea. Anyway, we think three minutes is a bit of a compromise and a response to an innovative suggestion. I do not think we should be shy or backward in advancing innovations in the way in which we manage the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have indicated to the government that we agree with these changes. They are a welcome addition and they do extend a wider role that reflects the views of members and gives them an opportunity to speak about their constituencies or matters that affect them and use the Main Committee for that purpose. We do agree with the proposals that are before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the opportunity that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has given me by way of his preamble to this, I would like to note that, whilst we welcome the fact that the government has introduced these changes in the way in which parliament is run, he can hardly claim that this is a government that has lifted the standards of the place. There were two examples that he used in relation to question time. Maybe there is just a bit too much subtlety in the Leader of the House. Maybe this is exposing the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for those little games that he is playing in terms of getting the numbers out there at lunches, dinners and all those branch meetings&mdash;collecting the numbers against the other P&mdash;Peter Costello. This is Peter Reith after him.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REITH" NAMEID="WI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr Reith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I thought we were discussing changes to the procedures in the House. Obviously some latitude should be given, and you in your discretion have in the past provided it to the Manager of Opposition Business. But it is a sad commentary on the Manager of Opposition Business that when there is a sensible reform before the parliament, he wishes to so digress from the topic before the chair. It is clearly irrelevant. I only make the point because surely just for once the Manager of Opposition Business could put aside juvenile party political comments and just say that this is a good idea and he is going to support it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the House. I do uphold the point of order. Even with the festive season very much upon us, I think it is incumbent upon the honourable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Hotham to address the substance of the motion before us, and I invite him to do just that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am addressing the substance of it, Mr Speaker. I was also responding to the issues by way of the introduction of the Leader of the House. He was saying that when this government came to office, it was going to lift the standards. One of the issues that he talked about was the change from the roster system at question time. You would recall that. I think in the circumstances that I am entitled to respond to that. I ask the Leader of the House: I am entitled to respond to that, aren't I?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just make the point that whilst we did have a roster system for ministers in this place, we were always here in accordance with our roster. This is a government that changed the roster but the ministers are never here. The Leader of the House used the example of the Prime Minister, who was away at the cricket test at Lords for a whole fortnight of sittings. He could not even get to Newcastle to speak to the workers that BHP had put on the scrap heap.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="O'CONNOR" NAMEID="WU5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WU5">Mr O'Connor</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was rostered off.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was rostered off at Lords. Here was the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs being attacked for a fortnight in this place and the Prime Minister was on the phone from the Australian dressing room saying, `Stick with him. To dump him would show a sign of weakness.' This was the Lords connection. So do not give us this cant and hypocrisy about how you have improved the standards with ministers. What takes the longest time in this House at the beginning of question time is not the prayers being read but the Prime Minister announcing changes to ministerial arrangements and telling us who is not here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the ludicrous position the other day when we actually asked a question of a minister representing someone who was not here and the Leader of the House did not know who he was. Where is the Leader of the House in terms of drumming these people into order? We had a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Mr Anderson). Here was the Leader of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12033"> House looking blank down the spaces and  getting the hapless Warwick Smith up, only to have Warwick Smith halfway up to the dispatch box when the Leader of the House pointed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and said, `This is you,' and the minister for primary industries said, `Would you repeat the question?' So embarrassed was his leader that he got up to take the question himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for lifting the standards, give us a break. If you are going to change the standards, at least apply them. Make sure that if you have gone off a roster system and you want to claim credit for it, at least have your ministers in the House and, more importantly, get them to answer a question. Can we recall the minister for primary industries ever having answered a question? There are people on his side of the parliament who laugh at the fact that he never answers a question.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REITH" NAMEID="WI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr Reith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on a point of order, this is a truly irrelevant contribution from the Manager of Opposition Business, who prides himself on wasting the time of the chamber, whose rabbiting on only exposes for all the shallowness of his contributions and his complete lack of interest in these two sensible reforms. There is a third one, which relates to the fewer number of bills you have to present, but we do not have to occupy the time of the House with that. But on any fair interpretation of the words of the standing orders, this is totally irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Manager of Opposition Business is totally disinterested in any reform and is yet to even address or refer to the matters before the House, and we have been going for 11 minutes. He has not even had the common courtesy to properly acknowledge the contribution of the two private members in the chamber now&mdash;one from our side and one from his own side&mdash;who have made constructive suggestions which have brought the government to this positive response. I think, in fairness to the honourable members who have sensibly worked outside of the usual party political nonsense, he ought to at least say something positive about the work that they have done.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister and uphold his point of order. I notice that in his natural enthusiasm the member for Hotham did indicate, initially, a general support for the Leader of the House's proposition. I respect that natural enthusiasm, but I do ask him to constrain his comments to the thrust of the motion before us.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do support the amendments. When the Leader of the House came and proposed them to me, I was very quick to get back to him and say that I welcomed the changes. When he raised the issue of the requirements about the signing of bills, which is one of the issues that he did not refer to when he was talking about these changes, he made some quip about the fact that that should not worry us because it is only the government that introduces bills. Perhaps he has not noticed that we have been a bit active on this side of the House in introducing private member's bills. We welcome this initiative because it does streamline the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been an active opposition in using the forms of the House to get from the government what it has failed to act on. I would remind the House that, through the utilisation of private member's bills, we moved bills in relation to the automotive industry&mdash;and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) is with me and spoke on that bill&mdash;the textile, clothing and footwear industry and the anti&hyphen;dumping procedures, and this government was forced to bring on at least one part of the measures&mdash;the treatment of China as a market economy. I know the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who is sitting over there, is squirming about this issue down in his electorate because of the threat to the Burnie paper mill from dumped paper product. So we have been particularly active in the introduction of private member's bills and trying to force this government to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I can recall that when we sought to have the textile bill brought on in the House it was people like the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) and the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), who had been traipsing around 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12034"> their electorates saying they supported a tariff freeze, who voted against it. We will continue to remind their constituents, through proced ures such as private member's bills, that they cannot have the luxury of saying one thing in the electorate and then voting against it in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the adjournment procedures, I think it is a welcome addition to the procedures in the Main Committee. I do want to acknowledge the role that the member for Chifley (Mr Price) has played and his constructive contribution in suggesting a development and enhancement of 90&hyphen;second statements&mdash;that is, giving members the ability to raise matters of a constituent nature and having three minutes in which to do it. We welcome the fact that that has been picked up.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shown this morning why it was absolutely necessary to introduce these changes because, quite frankly, it does not matter for how long you speak, it is the quality of what comes out that matters. I am afraid that length has not made up for quality this morning. In all seriousness, the member for Chifley (Mr Price) and I have found ourselves in this parliament working on a number of issues&mdash;not at cross&hyphen;purposes but in the same vein, albeit from a different angle. I think it proves that in this place you do not have to be on the same side of the chamber to be trying to do the best for your constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This extension of time has been brought about simply because there has been too little time for private members to represent the interests of their constituents adequately in this place. We get elected here to not only represent national views but also the views of those local people who come to see us on a daily basis. I welcome the government's move towards this. It is a constructive measure. It means that the important roles we play as representatives of our community, as representatives of the Australian people, can be better fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing so, you will notice that the time limits are five and three minutes. Once again, this proves that you do not need a long time to say what is necessary. As long as you have that there, you will find that people can actually have a constructive role to play and the wider community can be part of that. Once again, I congratulate the government and thank the member for Chifley for his contribution in ensuring that this has come to fruition. For once, towards the end of the year, nearing the festive season, it is very good to see that we have bipartisan support on something in this place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support these changes. I thought the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) was particularly generous in picking up the suggestion of constituency statements. I also acknowledge the contribution of the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough). I am not often critical of committees, but I think the Procedure Committee did make a mistake in the questionnaire it distributed. It asked, amongst 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12035"> other things, whether members of this House would prefer to make five-minute statements or three-minute statements. Of course, when given a  choice about whether we want to speak for five minutes or three minutes, we would always go for the five&hyphen;minute option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was missed in the questionnaire&mdash;and I think it is perfectly understandable&mdash;was the proposal that there would be, if we chose to speak for only three minutes, an additional 20 a side per week for constituency statements. If that had been pointed out to honourable members, I suggest the response would have been greater for the three&hyphen;minute option. That aside, I have to say again that it is very generous of the manager of government business to acknowledge that and to trial it. I sincerely thank him for it. I hope that it will be utilised by members. I hope that, when we look back on how well or poorly the procedure is working, we will have an opportunity to maybe revisit the number of constituency statements that can be made.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">On 6 March this year, the government, with the cooperation of the opposition and the Independents, implemented a trial procedure for the conduct of divisions in the House of Representatives. The trial was in response to a report of the Standing Committee on Procedure on the conduct of divisions which was tabled in the House earlier, in November 1996, by the then chairman, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan). It was made clear at the time that we would run the trial, see how it went and, if the changes were useful, consider making them a permanent feature of the House's procedures. Having now conducted the trial for some time, we have come to the conclusion that it has worked very well. It has been a useful reform and should therefore be incorporated into the standing orders on a permanent basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just very briefly, the trial provided for a change to the counting of successive divisions so that they are being counted on an exceptions only basis so as to limit the time involved. We also introduced a requirement that a division does not need to proceed if there are four members or fewer on one side. Previously, standing order 204 required only one member on one side before the Speaker could declare the decision of the House forthwith without a division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also changed the appointment of tellers. The Speaker was given greater liberty to appoint the number of tellers appropriate for a particular division. Standing order 201 required the Speaker to appoint two tellers for each side, but the change which was instigated does not specify the number of tellers which must be appointed, thus allowing the Speaker to use his or her discretion when appointing the number of tellers. The recent practice of appointing three tellers from each side has worked well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chamber research has calculated for me the average time taken to conduct a division throughout the year. The time has fallen from 5.29 minutes in March this year to 3.34 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12036"> minutes in November. So the objective of the trial, which was to create a more streamlined and time efficient system for conducting divisions, has been fulfilled. The government,  therefore, proposes the reforms and therefore the amendments now before the chair in the notice of motion which I have provided to the opposition. I understand that the opposition will be supporting the motion before the chair. I welcome that support. I thank them for their cooperation in making, again, another sensible change to the procedures, to the benefit of everybody. I also acknowledge the discussions and constructive contribution of the Independents, including the member for Moore (Mr Filing), in making this happen.</PARA></SPEECH>

Whilst the trial has not been without some difficulties, those figures that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) read out are the ultimate testimony. We want streamlining, and on those figures it would seem that we have achieved it. In the main the hiccups I think have resulted more from what constitutes the break in the intervening period than the difficulty we thought we might have had about people who sought to change a vote in between.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst not opposing the motion, because I think the trial has run reasonably successfully, I just want to make a couple of comments. The first is&mdash;and the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) mentioned this in passing&mdash;that there is still in some instances some confusion about the process of multiple divisions. We saw in particular, I think on two occasions, the situation where a couple of members from the government had problems knowing exactly where to go during a division. In my view there is sufficient confusion on the part of some members, bearing in mind that many would come in and merely sit with their own party members and not necessarily be fully 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> informed as to what they were voting for. There is still some confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am still not sure that we have accommodated the situation where a member who has been absent for a division then races to the division that immediately follows, where there is obviously a much shorter ringing of the bells, enters the chamber and obviously needs to inform themselves sufficiently of, firstly, the division and, secondly, if there is a division over amendments, the substance of those particular amendments. We must bear in mind that members who might be in the Main Committee, for instance, participating in debate may not be able to keep on top of a particular debate in the House as amendments are introduced. It is still, to my view, not satisfactorily resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one instance there was dissent to a ruling of the Speaker while I was in the Main Committee. It was extraordinarily difficult&mdash;I was waiting to speak in the Main Committee, which was still going on while this important motion was being debated in this chamber&mdash;for me to come into this chamber, try to participate in that debate and obviously retain my speaking order in the Main Committee. I imagine that, had I not dropped out of the speaking list up there and come down to listen to the debate, I would not have been in a position to have made a rational decision on the division that ensued. How could you without knowing what the arguments were on a motion like that? The opposition had moved what was, in effect, a very serious motion&mdash;one of the most serious and important or fundamental motions in the plethora of motions or instruments available to members in this place. For members then to come into the chamber and inform themselves sufficiently to make a rational decision on that basis is very difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously that is not one case where you would have multiple divisions one after the other. But I just signal the problem where members&mdash;who are not necessarily subject to the whip, who might be Independent members or for that matter who might be a government member wanting to exercise their right to cross the floor&mdash;may not be sufficiently able to inform themselves on one of those multiple 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12037"> divisions in the time available. That is one of the lingering problems associated with the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My preference is for electronic voting. I recollect the interest of the former Speaker,  the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), in electronic voting. I think electronic voting is inevitable. It provides, in my view, a greater opportunity for members to be able to make a decision, perhaps without having to perform that extraordinarily difficult task of walking across the floor to vote against their own colleagues in the same party. Probably one of the most intimidating things for a member wanting to do that is the physical act of actually walking across the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that neither of the two major blocks in this place would be very interested in entertaining any changes that would make it easier for people to cross the floor and vote against their own party. The Manager of Opposition Business, from the perspective of being in opposition, may like to see that. But when he is eventually, I suppose, in some distant year back into government he may regret having entertained those sorts of ideas, because obviously once you are in the executive the last thing you want is people crossing the floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I support the motion but still indicate the reservations associated with those changes. I know the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has been sincere in trying to entertain solutions to some of the problems associated with that. This is probably one of the better compromises in reducing the time necessary to have divisions, and I note the time change. I would be interested in knowing whether the Leader of the House could let us know whether that included instances where divisions were decided without the necessity of a count being taken, because that may have had the effect of reducing the average time taken. He may care to comment on that in his reply.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendment insisted on by the Senate be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the second time we have addressed this issue in particular in recent days. The government considers as very undesirable this precedent that would be set by this amendment, which provides for the payment of interest on overpayments of surcharge resulting from a person's failure to provide a tax file number. It is unfortunate that the Senate is insisting on this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The non-payment of interest, when an assessment is amended after the subsequent quotation of a tax file number, acts to encourage the quotation of tax file numbers. The Commissioner of Taxation is required to write at least twice to every member whose tax file number cannot be identified, advising them of the consequences of not quoting their tax file number. In these circumstances, while the decision whether or not to quote a tax file number is one for each individual, the government considers there are no valid grounds for a person to withhold their tax file number. I just want to emphasise that: we do not believe, being very open and forthright about this matter, that there are any valid reasons why a person would not quote their tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The payment of interest could discourage persons from quoting their tax file number, which is not in the interests of the community. We see in this proposal by the Labor Party 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the other senators an amendment which is not in the community's interest. It is inconceivable that this will be in the long-term best interests of the community. It highlights the fact that the opposition and, in this House, the Labor Party in particular are interested in delaying, not in addressing, the issues the Australian people are concerned about: putting in arrangements to administer this country effectively, wisely and prudently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing prudent about this amendment. There is no real logic to it. We believe that this precedent is highly undesirable. In the interests of providing some certainty to the superannuation industry regarding the legislative framework, however, and to ensure collections for the current financial year the government does not propose to force the issue at this time. The government will, however, seek to amend this provision of the legislation later. It is highly undesirable. There is no cogent reason for it. It is against community interests. It shows that the opposition&mdash;the Labor Party, in particular&mdash;are not interested in governing Australia in the interests of the common good but with their delaying tactics are trying to make the taxation system worse, more complicated, than it already is. The government will seek to amend this provision later.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the words of Maxwell Smart, this is another triumph of the forces of goodness over the forces of darkness. It represents to me a very different experience from the Victorian parliament. Life is considerably different here. I was talking to someone last night about this issue. They observed that the tax office is accustomed to charging penalty interest rather than paying penalty interest. So to that extent it represents a different set of circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people out there will be blissfully ignorant of this legislation and of the discussion we are having in the chamber this morning. They will not submit their tax file numbers by 15 December for their superannuation fund to put forward to the tax office. They will not submit their tax file numbers even after prompting from the tax office, although it is an extraordinary piece of prompting by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12039"> the tax office because the tax office has to have their tax file numbers in the first place. I understand the tax office will be writing to people and asking them: `Will you provide your tax file numbers?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information that was obtained through the economics legislation committee hearing on 26 February this year said that there would  be a collection rate for tax file numbers of the order of 65 per cent. That left over two million Australians who would not be providing their tax file numbers. The Taxation Office then provided assurances, which were outlined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 21 November, indicating that they could locate another two-thirds. That leaves some 700,000 taxpayers whose tax file numbers would not be known. If those people earn average weekly earnings of around $35,000, you have superannuation guarantee contributions of $2,100 for each of those people. That would lead to a surcharge per person of $315. Against that background you could see the tax office collecting of the order of $220 million in the first year alone from low income earners, the people whom it said would not be affected by the superannuation surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was against that background that the Democrats and ourselves insisted that there ought to be some provision for the payment of interest where the tax office subsequently returned that surcharge to those people on obtaining their tax file numbers. We believed that was an appropriate and fair outcome. This is a bit like a scene from the movies, where Batman is invited to an audience with the Joker, or James Bond to a meeting with Goldfinger, or Elliot Ness to a meeting with one of the mafia bosses. I could go on but you get the general idea. The mafia boss gives assurances of his good faith, but when Elliot Ness gets to the door he is told to hand over his gun and go into the discussions unarmed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our point is, if the government's intentions are honourable, why does it insist that you surrender your weapons? So it was here. If the government believed that only a small number of workers were not going to hand over their tax file numbers and that the tax office could track down the rest, why was it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not prepared to see the interest repaid for the relatively small amount of money that it was going to collect from those who had not handed over their tax file numbers? The truth is it was going to get a windfall from this. The impact of the surcharge was not going to be limited to high income earners at all. It was going to fall on low and middle income earners. The government does not believe its own rhetoric about only a small number being affected. If it did, it would not have had any problems in accepting this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the acceptance of this amendment we are going to see the superannuation surcharge bill go through the parliament, as it relates to defined benefit funds. The Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) suggested that the opposition was not being cooperative in relation to this matter. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have sought to expedite the package of this legislation by exempting it from the Senate cut-off, accepting the idea that the Senate committee should report quickly and so on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is your budget strategy to have this surcharge go through the parliament. It has a ridiculous collection method. The example I used previously is the emergency services superannuation scheme in Victoria which has something like 23,000 members. The managers of that fund have to go through and calculate the surcharge and do all the book work and paperwork for some 23,000 members when ultimately only 60 of those members turn out to be liable for the surcharge. In the words of Noel Davis of Clayton Utz:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are probably in a position, therefore, where the costs to this country being imposed by the Government through this bad legislation will exceed the tax revenue in the first year. Now, if that is not bad Government, I don't know what is.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">He says that it is not an equitable tax. This area of administration is borne out in the form 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12040"> that has been provided by the government through the tax office to those who administer the superannuation funds. I invite honourable members to have a look at this extraordinary form&mdash;this from a government that says it wants to cut small business red tape by 50 per cent&mdash;which those who are administering the schemes are required to complete by 15 December. They are hit with this lengthy form and given a few weeks to complete it. This government say they are going to cut small business red tape by 50 per cent. They are really strangling small businesses with red tape by requiring them to complete this form by 15 December. According to the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, there are 144,000 small businesses that will have to complete those returns&mdash;12 pages of up to 188 questions, many of them repeating what the tax office already has on file, and nine pages of instructions. Everyone has to complete the form, including the battlers whom the surcharge is not supposed to hit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no way that this form can be completed without the help of a superannuation professional. According to the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, accountants will spend about three hours completing this form. That will cost around $200 per fund&mdash;overall about $30 million in administration fees. There are enormous inefficiencies in the layout, content and rules governing the use of the form. It has to be handwritten&mdash;it cannot be photocopied in any shape or form. All copies are to be scanned electronically by the tax office and the rule applies to every single fund member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year it is to be completed by 15 December. From next year all these forms have to go in by 31 October. That will completely skew the process of collecting tax returns. Most accountants involved in the preparation and collection of tax returns do the returns for their low income customers in the first few months so that they can get their tax returns back quickly&mdash;often they are entitled to a rebate; often they need that information to continue to be eligible for social security entitlements and so on. The more complex forms&mdash;those, for example, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involving superannuation funds&mdash;are left until later. They are not done until March&mdash;accountants are entitled to have until March to complete tax returns for such people. This is proposing, however, that you must have the tax return ready by 31 October because you need to know all that information in order to complete this form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will telescope the workload which presently takes accountants about nine weeks to three or four months. It is going to have a very adverse impact on the way tax returns for these superannuation funds are collected. I understand that in some cases it has led to some of those small superannuation funds&mdash;the mum and dad superannuation funds&mdash;being closed altogether. Going through this kind of paperwork makes the whole exercise not worth while, so they have abandoned it completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge legislation is a mess and a disaster. It is now going through the parliament. It is on your heads. Judging by some of the responses of government members to the superannuation surcharge briefing and how it affects individual members of parliament&mdash;slashing 13 per cent off the retirement incomes of new members&mdash;it is probably going through just in the nick of time. It is now the government's problem. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12042">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am proposing to give this bill passage in the House whenever we vote on it, but I foreshadow very strongly that, in its present form, proposed section 45 of the repeals and consequential provisions is not acceptable to the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I went on to outline in that speech the reasons why and the fact that this bill contained what I described as a `nippy little industrial relations' stunt. I tell you this, Minister: your minister responsible for this bill has been quietly boasting&mdash;boasting, I tell you&mdash;around the place that, in the preparation of this bill, he stuck down the back, knowing that no&hyphen;one would notice it&mdash;his words&mdash;a nippy little industrial relations provision that gets rid of a few of these people, as the terms of it provided, by deeming them to have resigned if they do not accept the offer made for transfer to the new body in the form that it is offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said five weeks ago this was unacceptable and that, when it went to the Senate, it would be considered in committee and that the Labor Party would be bringing forward proposals. Then you come in here five minutes ago and read that introductory speech. I know you are not the minister responsible for carriage of this; I know you have just read the script that has been prepared for you by the minister. But, mate, you have been absolutely dudded because what you just said about Labor slipping in there with a last&hyphen;minute stunt is completely given the lie by what I said five weeks ago. My advice to you is to go back to your minister and tell him to smarten up his act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without any dissent or discussion, we went through the previous amendment that was agreed to in the Senate. Let me just say to you that that did not just happen by accident either. There was a case where the minister assured the whole world that he had the support of the industry for the shift to the transaction levy. We said in the same speech we had a question mark over this and that the Senate committee would also have a look at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you have no idea of the furore that has been going on in the meat and livestock industry for the past three weeks as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> group after group have come forward and said to us, `Hey, this is not what we understood,' and `Hey, this is not how we were consulted,' and `Oh, by the way, nobody is listening to us,' leading to the point where your four government members on the Senate committee proposed to send this bill off and scrap it till March next year, which led to a counter campaign on all of us to say, `Oh, we need it through for all the obvious reasons.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I am not blaming you personally, but I am making this very clear, and it is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript, that what I take offence at is that the opposition has been hugely responsible in getting this legislation through. Our simplest and easiest course of action would have been to agree to the recommendation of your Senate members' majority that this be postponed until next March, and we could have created all sorts of mischief in doing it. As I said in my original speech, we accept that this is a development that we support and we will give the legislation passage.

If it is a nippy little industrial relations provision when we do it, what was it when you did it on many occasions in your own legislation? As I said in my remarks, these provisions are essentially identical to a feature of many other acts over a number of years which were sponsored through the parliament by the previous government. When we do it, it is a nippy little industrial relations provision but, when they do it, somehow or other it is acceptable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I use a simple phrase: not so. I noticed that you qualified your little contribution, Minister, with the words `essentially the same'. It is not the same. It is true that lots of previous legislation has set down that people moving from a structure being closed down to a new one will be offered equivalent employment opportunities. What is new and different here is the little Jeff Kennett stunt that you picked up, which was what happens if they do not take them. If they do not want to make the move, if they do not want to take what is deemed by their boss or somebody to be `an equivalent opportunity', what has generally been done in the Commonwealth Public Service and in its instrumentalities is that attempts are made to find alternative options. But no&hyphen;one has put in legislation `they shall be deemed to have resigned'. You find me previous Labor legislation saying that they will be deemed to have resigned. That is the stunt, and you know it is. I will tell you

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What should, with some integrity, have been a quiet little discussion in the chamber this morning about some amendments that the Labor Party foreshadowed here five weeks ago it had reservations about, that the Senate has worked its way through and that should have been quietly passed through the House, has resulted in this debate between you and me, because the information you have been given by the minister is just not right. I am certainly not going to stand here and let you purvey that view on the transcript of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; not without challenging it, anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line here is that of course we support these amendments, which do exactly what we foreshadowed. These are not little stunts that we claim to have suddenly raced into the Senate with; they are amendments that were agreed to by the government and agreed to by your majority on the Senate committee. If you are not happy with the performance of your government members, who have the majority on the committee, that is up to your minister and your members on the committee. That is not my problem. We have carried ourselves with absolute integrity through this. We have said exactly what we would do. We have foreshadowed exactly the items we wanted questioned. We have enabled a Senate committee to go off and look at them and, with the full support of the government members, these amendments have been brought in in exactly the form that I foreshadowed five weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those comments on the record, I make the point that the way this whole operation has been carried through has not been much to the government's credit. We understand the point you were making that it is normal for the contractual arrangements in these changeovers to be a rolling three&hyphen;year process but the sunset clause is two years. We understand that that is the fact of it, but these arrangements will have to be built around the two&hyphen;year sunset clause which we have just dealt with in the previous legislation, and that is not impossible for anyone to do. More importantly, it is what the government members

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assuming that these amendments are accepted by the Senate, we are moving to the shift to the transaction levy structure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, the government committed itself to providing full cost recovery for the classification services provided by the Office of Film and Literature Classification from 1 July 1998. The measure was expected to raise $1.2 million per financial year. Commencing on 1 November 1997 the government introduced regulations to increase the relevant classification charges. An attempt was made to disallow these fees, but unfortunately Senator Harradine voted with the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1997  and the  Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1997  seek to further implement the measure announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget. Taxation legislation is required to achieve this effect, as the government has received constitutional advice that it cannot otherwise include the cost to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Office of Film and Literature Classification of providing ancillary services such as research, policy development, ministerial support and payments to the states and territories for enforcement and related purposes in determining the appropriate level of the charges. The inclusion of these matters in the cost structure of the OFLC for the charges' taxation determination purposes increases the amount of revenue the government expects it will receive from $1.2 million to $2.15 million per year. The opposition believes that it is inappropriate to charge the industry for these public interest functions of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) noted in his second reading speech that the level of charges had been agreed following consultation with the industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is aware that the fees for classification and other services which came into effect on 1 November this year are of concern to some of the users of OFLC services. In particular, concern has been expressed about the effect of the fee increases on the classification of material that has a    limited market appeal in Australia. In these cases the unit cost attributable to classification charges is higher than in media which has wider appeal and thus attracts a lower unit cost due to its much larger distribution volume.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has, for example, been suggested that a popular first release cinema film, where a significant number of prints are distributed, should attract a higher charge than a film that has more limited appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where, as at present, fees are set on the basis of the cost of providing the service there is limited opportunity to provide for a differential level in setting fees for the same category of material. This is because the cost associated with the classification of the material is not dependent on its end  use or its popularity or otherwise. The fee must be directly related to the cost of providing the service. However, when charges for classification services are imposed as a tax, there is a much greater capacity to differentiate between material for the purposes of the imposition of the charges.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the minister said in his second reading speech. The truth is the new charges have been vigorously opposed by independent and smaller film producers. To meet the concerns of independent distributors, the Attorney&hyphen;General is proposing to appoint an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12045"> independent person to review the charge structure. The report is due to be completed by 30 April 1998. The Attorney&hyphen;General said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I therefore propose to appoint an independent person to review the charges structure with a view to seeing whether greater equity can be provided to applicants who submit material for classification that has a more limited market appeal. I have requested that report be provided to me no later than 30 April 1998 and the structure of the charges proposed in this measure will be reviewed in light of that report.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We on this side believe this is a classic case of the government's cut first, think later policy. This independent advice should have been sought well before any charges were imposed. It is the opposition's view that consideration of the bill should be delayed at least until such time as the independent person has reported. Only then will the parliament be in a position to determine what safeguards should be enacted in order to protect the independent distributors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1997  also provides that the level of the charges and taxes can be varied by way of regulation. The government argues that this is because the charges will have to be regularly adjusted with a view to the cost structure of the OFLC. However, this also gives the government considerable flexibility to increase relevant charges so that they bear no relationship to the cost structure and therefore cease to be a cost recovery measure. The opposition believes that this situation is intolerable and is an open invitation for the government to increase the charges at its whim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 1 of the amendment bill also removes some formal requirements in making applications for classification of material for the investigation and prosecution of an offence. These amendments overcome the failure of two prosecutions earlier this year due to the lack of compliance with all the formal requirements of an application of the material concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's position is that the  Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1997 , and part 2 of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1997 , relating to the imposition of charges, should be opposed, and that part 1 of the amendment bill, relating to enforcement applications, should be supported. We will not be moving the relevant amendments dissecting the bill, or dividing in the House; we will do that in the Senate. I am merely flagging that that is the position the opposition has adopted with these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit of a concern to us on this side as to what the government is doing. As I said earlier, it is really a `cut first, think later policy'. That seems to be consistent with what this government is doing in a lot of areas. It is driven by the bean counters, it is user&hyphen;pays on nursing homes, on child care, and on a whole range of things. We on this side of the House believe that you do not necessarily have to have full cost recovery on a whole range of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the position. I do not intend to speak any longer. Short and sweet is the way I like to put these things. As I say, we will not divide on this matter&mdash;the government should not take that as an indication that we are not serious&mdash;we will do that in the Senate. We might have the arguments in this House, but we do not have the numbers. It reminds me of my days at the New South Wales ALP conference, arguing the Left's cause. We generally had the arguments but could rarely muster the numbers. We will leave the mustering of the numbers to the Senate, hopefully, on this occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

Currently, the annual cost of operating the Office of Film and Literature Classification under that scheme, including payments to the states and territories under the national classification scheme to assist with enforcement and related activities, is approximately $5.4 million. That is a lot of money. In my short time in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12046"> place I have found that we seem to lose touch with just how much money we are talking about. To anyone in Lindsay, $5.4 million is a lot of money. That amount will drop to $2.2 million, after the introduction of the fees that were put in place on 1 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has already been an overall saving to the Commonwealth of $2.15 million per annum. But the Commonwealth still has to find operating costs of $2.2 million to satisfy industry structure and operations. It is fairly self-evident to everyone that, when you are publishing a film, computer game, magazine  or video, you need to put some kind of description on that item which the public have confidence in and which they can purchase either for their tastes or for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operating cost was something the government could not recover under cost recovery. When you look at the latest report of the Australian Film Commission, you will see that it claimed the cinema industry alone took $537 million at the box office in 1996. If the cinema box office takings is the only section of the industry, the additional charges under this bill come to 0.4 per cent of the industry's takings in order to operate in a publicly acceptable manner. But it is not the only section of the industry. There is also the adult industry in Canberra, claimed to be worth $30 million, with a mail&hyphen;order list of 600,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not make up the industry completely either. There are also magazines. Only one publication, which requires classification, claims a weekly distribution of 280,000 copies. So it is a fairly large multimillion dollar, possibly billion dollar, industry for which the government is seeking to recover costs, and it is the beneficiary in this area. It is important to stress that, because the people in my electorate of Lindsay are rather tired of paying tax. They are not able to access a number of business exemptions, negatively gear or apply any other sort of business measure towards taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The constituents of Lindsay have to pay their tax, and they like to see their tax spent appropriately. They have seen the previous government overspend in 1991 by $16.6 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion and $17 billion in subsequent years. The minimum amount the previous government overspent in one year was something like $10 billion. That was in the final year, when it looked like they were losing office. They finally reined in their spending. But at one stage the Commonwealth's debt had blown out to $108 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to pay that back. We were not even aware of the $10 billion blow&hyphen;out which the former Treasurer and now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was claiming was not in existence. We were in surplus by February 1996. We are slowly getting Australia's finances in order. It has been a mighty struggle. We have done the hard yards. We have paid the price, and we are about to enter into a period of prosperity. Finally, the people of Lindsay will be able to see government getting tax off their backs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the costs. The charge for classifying a magazine will now be $210. Cinema films of 90 minutes or more will be $1,610, and videos for sale or hire will be $950. On an international comparison, these costs work out to be around $106 per million Australian citizens. To compare that with the United States, which spends $94 per million people, or the UK, which spends $109 per million people, we are within the range of efficiency and cost effectiveness in this government operation. That is something on which this government always concentrates: the fact that our citizens pay tax but that we spend taxpayers' money wisely, efficiently and in the appropriate areas with those who can afford to pay. Let me also point out that New Zealand currently has a classification system that costs $500 per million people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry are obviously opposed to a cost because it will eat into their profits. They claim that they are pragmatic advocates of a sensible industry policy, but I reckon they have their hands in the taxpayers' pocket. If you put your hands in the shareholders' pockets, you are likely to get a gaol sentence or an extended holiday in Majorca. I would like to expose some of this dole bludging behaviour for what it is. I think a similar debate is that of parallel imports. For years the music industry promised financial assist 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12047"> ance to emerging Australian artists on the condition that the government did nothing to free up competition in their industry. It was agreed, and for years no money was forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to assist emerging artists in Australia, air play is needed. They need to have their music played on the radio waves of Australia or somehow have exposure given to their music. That is the best support you can give to emerging artists. I suggest this industry needs some direction, which the government may well look to providing in the future in order to give the results that industry  claims they can achieve by tax havens, exemptions or protection from competition. It is a matter of laying the costs where the costs are carried, and there will be some who benefit from the costs. This bill goes some measure towards achieving that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no single solution for Australia's problems. Every action has a cost and a consequence. If you put money here, it is money that is not there. The people of Lindsay have a right to see their taxes spent wisely and for their greatest benefit. In fact, there is nothing more farcical than seeing the state government of New South Wales dipping $60 into people's pockets to give them back $50 to start back at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think government can do it more efficiently than industry in terms of regulation, cost&hyphen;effective measures or suggestions for keeping costs down. It is simply a cost recovery measure that will pay for all the expenses of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, which is a very necessary government service which protects consumers in terms of awareness of what they are buying. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two bills that we are debating today in a cognate form are very important bills which provide for the imposition of charges for the classification of publications, films and computers games and for related services. The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R391">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  contains administrative provisions relating to the collection of charges and the waiver of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charges, and prescribes time limits for the making of classification decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also simplifies the material to accompany an application for classification made for the purposes of investigating or prosecuting an offence under the laws of the Commonwealth, the state or the territory. This is good legislation, and the government makes no apology whatsoever for introducing it into the parliament. Some people have asked, `Is the government aware of the impact that the increase in charges may have on the production of Australian films?' There have also been erroneous suggestions that competition in the industry may well be inhibited.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is aware that the fees for classification and other services, which came into effect on 1 November this year, have been of some concern to some of the users of the services of the Office of Film and Literature Classification. We, however, believe that it is very important that there be full cost recovery. My understanding is that the annual operating cost of the Office of Film and Literature Classification amounts in total to $5.4 million. But at the present time&mdash;even following the increase which took place on 1 November&mdash;only $3.2 million in annual fees is raised. Effectively, this means that the taxpayer gives a subsidy of some $2.2 million per year to cover the cost of the administration of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, and as a government we feel that this is inappropriate. The films which are being considered by this office largely are commercial and it is appropriate that those people who are seeking to have commercial films should, in fact, pay full cost recovery. This measure will make some savings to the government and it will reduce outlays, and I believe that it is correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been suggested that the industry may not have been adequately consulted, but I believe that there has been extensive consultation throughout the Australian community and, indeed, with the industry over the past 18 months on the subject of fees for classification services. It really comes as no surprise that those people who will have to cough up the extra $2.2 million are not wildly enthusiastic about it, but it should be noted that in many cases the people who use the services of the office have a high turnover and are well able to afford the increased charges which will result. The formal industry consultation meetings were held in December 1995 and September 1996 and with each sector of the industry separately in March this year. There has been widespread consultation, and I believe that any suggestion to the contrary is erroneous, a red herring, and ought to be rejected. Some people have also suggested that the government is going back on a commitment not to impose new taxes. In this case, we are simply seeking full recovery. We do not believe that the office ought to operate in such a way that it is subsidised by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12048"> taxpayer generally. This is a proposed law change which is designed to recover $2.15 million and to relieve the taxpayer of the burden which he or she is now carrying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people recognise that there ought to be a national classification scheme of available entertainment products. Most of us who are parents realise the importance of the G classification and, with other classifications of films and other entertainment products, it is very important that people who are buying or hiring a product know the classification at which it comes. As a parent I must say that I have been somewhat concerned over some of the classifications given to films even in the G category, and possibly there ought to be a closer examination of what is permissible in the various categories. In my view, the classifications as currently awarded do not accurately designate the gravity or nature of the material portrayed in many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can remember going to the local cinema with my two children when they were aged four and two and I saw a G film dealing with what was generally quite a nice family story of people looking after a dog. But there was simulated sexual intercourse and simulated fertilisation on the film and puppies resulted. Personally, I felt that that was beyond the pale. It was unnecessary; it did not add anything substantial to the story, and it made me very concerned about the nature of films currently included in the G classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget decision made by the government. We are aiming to make sure that from 1 July 1998 we achieve this full cost recovery for the Office of Film and Literature Classification. The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) will continue to look at charges which are imposed with a view to making sure that those charges are appropriate in all the circumstances. At times, the opposition has also suggested that the government may have some public interest obligations to fund some of the services of the office. However, it ought to be recognised that largely these are commercial services. And again I come back to the point which I have made over and over again: these charges ought not to be a burden on the taxpayer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have said that we already booted charges up on 1 November and there ought not to be any further increase. We are bringing in a taxing structure&mdash;unlike the present fee for service&mdash;and this will enable greater equity in charges applying to small business dealing with niche or specialised material, and this is a matter that the government will look at very closely. The Attorney&hyphen;General will ensure that an independent review of the charges structure will take place. We have made a pledge to this effect, and it is certainly a pledge which will be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ought not to be a controversial bill; it is a sensible bill. While it is dealing with a relatively small amount of revenue raising, the core principle included in the bill is absolutely important. We are saying that the people who are using the services of the government ought to pay for them. There has been some element of cost recovery up until the present time. However, some $2.2 million is still being put into the budget of the Office of Film and Literature Classification as a taxpayer funded subsidy. We do not believe that that is right. We believe that people who use the services should pay for them because, in many cases, the people who use those services are well able to afford to pay for them. I am very pleased to support the Attorney&hyphen;General in these two bills and I commend them to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the members who have spoken in this relatively brief debate&mdash;the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) and the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). There is one issue that I want to take up which was mentioned by the member for Lindsay. I disagree quite strongly with her suggestion that it is appropriate to describe the member for Banks as short and sweet. His speech may have been short, but sweet is not an adjective I would use in regard to the speech either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is another set of bills that the opposition is opposing. Quite unlike the opposition in recent times, they actually do know what their policy is in relation to this legislation. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12049"> Legislation in the Attorney-General's portfolio is usually debated in this House without it being clear what the Labor Party position will be, it being left to the senators to resolve that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills are opposed except in respect of the enforcement provisions in the amendment bill. They appear to be opposed only for two reasons. The first seems to be that the opposition has a view that it is inappropriate to charge industry for the public interest functions of the OFLC. The second seems to be that the charges proposed to be effected under the legislation should be opposed because there has allegedly been a lack of consultation with industry. On that basis, the opposition says that the bills should not be introduced until a review of the charging structure has been carried out, as I foreshadowed it would be in the second reading speech. I will just deal with each of those grounds for opposition in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public interest functions of the OFLC really relate to what can be described as an industry or industries. The government does not believe that it is either fair or appropriate to use public funds to subsidise businesses involved for commercial gain in the production or distribution of publications, films or computer games. The government does not think that it is at all unreasonable that the industry should be expected to pay for the services and benefits it receives from the national classification scheme. The scheme is administered by the Office of Film and Literature Classification and provides benefits to the cinema, video, publications and computer games industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the industries I have referred to have a high turnover each year. For example, the Australian Film Commission has released statistics on the value of the cinema industry in Australia in the years 1994, 1995 and 1996. Those figures revealed that that industry took a total box office in 1996 of $537 million and that the box office take increased by 12.8 per cent over the preceding three-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adult film and video industry has estimated that it is worth $30 million in the Australian Capital Territory alone, and it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> claims a mail order list of 600,000 people. One of the top selling publications which requires classification claims a weekly distribution of 280,000 copies. The industry has acknowledged the benefit the national classification  scheme provides to consumers on the content of entertainment products it distributes for commercial gain. The classification and consumer advice labels are broadly recognised in the community and are primarily used by parents with young children when selecting entertainment materials for themselves or those in their care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to provide these benefits to the industry, it is necessary to operate a set of national content standards. These are applied by an impartial decision making body in reflection of prevailing community standards. These operations and related aspects of the national classification scheme are administered by the OFLC. Those who benefit from the services and the activities of the OFLC should pay for its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of consultation with industry, like the member for Fisher, I can assure the House that while there may not have been formal consultation meetings with industry on these bills, there has been extensive consultation with the industry over the past 18 months on the subject of fees for classification services. No-one should be surprised that industry does not support the introduction of increased charges. Industry can be expected to protest and continue to protest about any increase in charges for the services  provided by government. As the member for Fisher mentioned, formal industry consultation meetings were held in December 1995 and September 1996 and with each sector of the industries separately in March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A survey to ascertain the views and concerns of all OFLC clients and relevant industry bodies was completed in June 1996. An in&hyphen;depth review of the OFLC pricing policy was conducted in consultation with industry by an independent firm of accountants during 1996. Many of the suggestions put forward by the industry during these consultations were given effect to in the 1 November 1997 regulations, and the fee structure which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12050"> resulted has been carried forward in the proposed charges structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the formal consultations with industry, I am advised that senior officers of the OFLC maintain regular and ongoing contact with its clients and with industry representatives. Senior officials of the Attorney-General's Department also maintain contact with industry bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry bodies who have been consulted include: the Motion Picture Distributors Association, which represents the large cinema studios; the Australian Visual Software Distributors Association, which represents major video and computer game distributors; the Eros Foundation, which represents the adult industry; and, since its formation in August 1997, the Australian Independent Distributors Association, which represents independent film distributors in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that this open door approach has resulted in numerous informal meetings with OFLC clients and industry representatives in which a wide variety of issues, including issues relating to classification fees, have been discussed. Implementation of full cost recovery for the OFLC means that the industry should expect that the OFLC will be efficient and effective in delivering high quality and impartial services on behalf of the Australian community, services which represent value for money to its clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure ongoing industry input into the operations of the OFLC, it is proposed to establish formal consultative mechanisms. This will give the industry opportunities for providing input into the charges scales and appropriate performance standards for the office. To this end, my department has commenced consultations with interested parties on the best method of achieving this result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that some industry representatives are seeking changes to the structure of the classification charges in order to reduce the unit cost of classification for products which have a limited market appeal, or which have been produced in Australia. This proposal will be considered when the charging structure is reviewed in consultation with industry early next year. I again thank those

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my comments on this legislation previously, I referred in some detail to the report submitted to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in mid&hyphen;September on the Australian iron and steel industry and expressed my great disappointment that it had not been dealt with. Members will recall that that same day I was able to ask the minister a question on the report at question time, to which he indicated two 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12051"> things: firstly, that the report would not be tabled, which meant it could not be debated in the House at all; and, secondly, that he would not be responding to it. That came as a disappointment to those of us who worked on that report. But, more importantly, it would come as a disappointment to the wider community who see iron and steel making and adding value to our iron ore as matters of great national significance. The government's determination to ignore it has deep consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report goes to the question, to some degree, of what was happening in the industry in the period up to mid&hyphen;1995. In 1995, BHP's strategy was: to establish an arc furnace in Newcastle; to have the capacity to make pig iron or directly reduced iron at Port Hedland, based on North West Shelf gas and the abundant iron ore resources there; and to develop new technology for the casting of thin strips of steel at Kembla. This would have given BHP, more than likely, world leadership in the most cost&hyphen;effective production of high quality flat steel products, and rod and bar as well if it so wished. That strategy was well thought out, well planned and had enormous implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy occurred then when the contract at Port Hedland for the development of their hot briquette iron plant was let on a cost&hyphen;plus basis. Since that time, we have discovered that that contract was badly managed. I am convinced in my own mind that BHP knew at least a year ago that they were in serious trouble with that project and that the cost of their production of that material had escalated quite seriously. We had a game, if you like, of smokescreens and red herrings as to what was going on within BHP steel division when it was not the steel division's issue, it was always to do with the minerals division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Mr McMaster was appointed in about August of last year to review the steel division, there is no doubt that one of the first things he would have done would have been to go to Port Hedland and look at that hot briquette iron plant because it was so fundamental to future BHP developments. I do not believe a person of his ability and experience 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would not have recognised the difficulty that plant was undergoing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two major components of that project, the very large reactor vessels and the very large structural steel developments, were both undertaken offshore&mdash;the large reactor vessels in Korea and the structural steel in the Philippines. Neither were tendered in Australia. In other words, Australian manufacturers were not able to bid for either of those two projects. We now discover that both were very late and both were faulty. Both components were then repaired&mdash;and I am not sure whether those repairs have been completed&mdash;by Australian companies at Port Hedland. While Australian companies were not good enough to do the actual tendering, they are now being used to do the repair work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this situation is a national tragedy. What has occurred here has done this country great damage. I do not wish to in way interpret or judge how that happened, as I do not understand it&mdash;and, quite frankly, I am not sure who does. But I do believe that some people in BHP knew this a year ago and it was not disclosed. There should be a stock exchange inquiry into what happened with that project. I do not believe BHP shareholders were advised of the circumstances and the liabilities the company was facing at the time it knew of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the cost blow&hyphen;out on that project was over $1 billion was finally admitted in the week this report was made available to the minister. What was supposed to be a $900 million project for that plant construction, plus another $300 million or so for the associated infrastructure work&mdash;in other words, a $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion project&mdash;is now a $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion project, and it is eight or nine months late. We do not know how long it will end up taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that the end product, the hot briquette iron, is no longer competitive. It is no longer competitive to make steel in Australia. So our prospects of becoming a major player in manufacturing and exporting metal rather than iron ore have been lost. That is why it is a national tragedy. Again, it was not BHP's steel division that was responsible for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12052"> that project. BHP's minerals division was in charge of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that they let a cost&hyphen;plus contract beggars the imagination. No-one in this country has had cost&hyphen;plus contracts for 20 years, because they are a recipe for disaster. BHP has not yet even explained to its shareholders, the government or the community what on earth took place and why. There really should be an inquiry, a decent inquiry, by the stock exchange and, if not, the government should initiate one because this has such ramifications for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report picked up an important issue for Newcastle in the last 1&half; years or so regarding a process which has been called a foreign trade zone and various other names. I understand the government will be making an announcement about that next week. Firstly, let me make it clear that this is not about steel. The foreign trade zone proposal did not arise because of the BHP close&hyphen;down. It arose back in 1995 because of excess land and we were looking at what needed to be done to attract additional jobs to anywhere in Australia&mdash;but it just so happened to be Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foreign trade zone proposal is now being adopted by the government, I understand, as a manufacturing in bond proposal. That has great and exciting prospects&mdash;with a couple of qualifiers. Manufacturing in bond is not duty free. It simply means that duty is deferred until the product is finished. At the moment a person who imports into Australia a component that requires duty to be paid on it pays the duty when the component first arrives. It might be three, six months or nine months before they finish manufacturing that component with other components, at which time they can sell it and then recover the duty. So their duty is tied up in manufacturing for a very long time. That is a major disincentive. It increases the cost of manufacturing and disadvantages Australian manufacturers vis-a-vis people who import fully made&hyphen;up products. If the product concerned is being exported and duty is therefore not payable, the complications of duty drawbacks are quite extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put forward to the government was this concept of a foreign trade zone and it was put 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forward, as I said, well before BHP's announcement this year. The government is not picking up the foreign trade zone, but it may pick up the manufacturing in bond proposal. My concern is that, if they simply adopt an electronic lodgment of customs documentation, it will not benefit us in the way that it could. Whilst electronic lodgment of details will be beneficial and it will reduce some of the overhead costs, the fact is that we have a customs system which was designed last century. Modern computer systems, stock control systems and management systems, particularly in terms of quality and `just in time' systems&mdash;all of the things we have done in manufacturing and in distribution systems&mdash;have not been applied very well to our customs and duties system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really need major upgrading and modernisation of the customs system so the transactional cost of components is reduced. What was being put forward to the government offers that potential. I strongly urge the government not to fall short. This is not about simply transferring information via e-mail but about integrating the stock control systems of importers with the management systems of Customs so that we have a fully integrated system that allows compatibility and interoperability. What it costs Customs to keep track of the voluminous amounts of often very small, discrete components imported by companies very often exceeds not just the duty to be paid on the product but in many cases its value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal, if fully adopted, has the potential to position Australia well in the new millennium in relation to new manufacturing technologies. There is a future in manufacturing. It is a different future from the past, and it is dependent not on low wages but rather on high skill, on high quality and on sophisticated materials handling. At the moment we have the high quality work force and the sophistication but we do not have the material handling technology in our customs and duty system. I urge the government to adopt the system fully.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Eighteen months ago I gave my first speech in this House, following the coalition's landslide election victory on 2 March 1996. In that speech I indicated how my electorate of Capricornia had suffered under 13 years of `hard Labor'. Under the previous government, the Labor Party, Capricornia missed out on one thing after another&mdash;everything from major infrastructure projects to the better cities funding. The money was pumped into the neighbouring cities of Gladstone, Mackay and Townsville. The Labor Party never spent a cracker on Rockhampton and Capricornia, leaving us very little opportunity for further development. Why was this the case? It was because the Labor Party considered Capricornia to be a safe Labor seat and they treated Capricornians with contempt. The people saw through this and have given the Nationals an opportunity to put things right. We have already seen the benefits, and I will discuss this in more detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituents had suffered from a lack of federal road funding, landcare and infrastructure. They also suffered from massive interest rates, bureaucratic imposts on small business, a one-sided industrial relations regime, a socially unacceptable child support scheme and high unemployment. In the past 18 months a lot has changed under this government. Our roads are gradually getting repaired and the many accident black spots in the district are almost a thing of the past. We are making plenty of headway in repairing the land and we have put in place a number of schemes to look after the land and to continue to nurture it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The infrastructure is starting to come together, with funding to raise the dam walls in two communities which have suffered without sufficient water storage for far too long. Other new dams, such as the Comet and the Dawson Valley dams, are on the way. These will help rural areas which have been drought affected for more than seven years. Urban people do not understand or grasp what it is like to struggle without good quality 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> water. To a lot of my rural constituents it is almost a way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is changing under the coalition government. We have recognised their plight and we are doing something constructive about it. In addition to providing resources and infrastructure for the future needs of the rural sector, this government has extended drought exceptional circumstances for a further 18 months to assist these people to get by. We have also provided the rural sector with a $517 million agricultural package which will address a number of issues affecting the rural community. It is what they have been asking for and it is what they have desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fiscal management of this government is to be applauded. As a result of tightening the belt and cutting out excess government red tape, we have managed to get interest rates down to their lowest levels in decades. The high interest rates caused by the former government left many people in despair. Mortgagees and small businesses are the big winners, as they are paying a fraction of the interest they were paying five years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of getting our finances in order, the country is on its way to reducing the debt left by the Labor Party. This has also shielded us from the potential financial fallout that has occurred in Asia. Small businesses have been given a lifeline by the government reducing the bureaucratic red tape and providing them with incentives to help boost their operation. At the same time, we have provided the small business franchisees with a lot more security against the big boys. This is what they asked for and that is what the government has delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Major changes to industrial relations was always to be a big hurdle to climb, but we have succeeded. Workers in their thousands are now accepting Australian workplace agreements all over the country. Companies have been able to reduce the union imposts on their small business, and the companies and workers are financially better off as a result of the government's industrial relations policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my maiden speech I mentioned that one of the biggest social problems in my elector 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12054"> ate, and I believe it is the same in other electorates around the country, is that of the child support system. It is unfair and inequitable, particularly to the non-custodial parent. Changes were needed to bring about some equity. We have made some changes to help bring some commonsense to the problem. Although I would have liked to have seen more changes implemented, I am happy this government did recognise part of the problem and has put in place some sensible changes that will make it more equitable for both custodial and non-custodial parents. However, there is still a long way to go and I shall continue along with my colleagues to push for further reforms to this archaic system that was obviously introduced by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my concerns is the actual cost of a child. This government has funded an inquiry into the cost. The inquiry will be completed hopefully before the year is out. I believe this will provide me and my colleagues with the facts that we need to substantiate a more level playing field for non-custodial parents, some of whom are paying more than $200 a week for one child. It does not cost that amount of money to raise a healthy child. Even a pensioner living on their own has to get by on less. So I believe we can complete the task we have set out to achieve in the not too distant future and rectify what has been a major mismanagement of the child support system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all the government's improvements to the business sector and the reduction of interest rates, unemployment remains the major problem throughout the country. This is probably the one issue that we as a government have not got on top of. It is not for the want of trying, of course. There is not one politician in this place who relishes the stagnation of employment. We all want to see people in a job of their choice, but unfortunately employment creation is sluggish. This hiatus must be improved upon if we want our community to survive and thrive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the stumbling blocks to more employment is the native title issue. Although in Capricornia we have a number of prospects coming on-line in the not too distant future&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">such as the gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea, a nickel mine, a couple of other coal mines and a potential power station&mdash;most of these projects are being held up awaiting the outcome of the native title debate. This uncertainty is stifling employment. The quicker the native title debate is resolved, the quicker employment opportunities will be created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, at the same time, we have a further problem that has to be considered: the downturn in the mining industry, which is mostly due to the financial problems of our Asian neighbours, who are our biggest trading partners. This means that, while we will create new jobs with new enterprises, some established companies will be laying off staff and cutting back on production. So the end result will probably see employment in the mining and associated industries remain static rather than improve. This is disappointing, but it is far better than losing jobs completely without generating replacement opportunities. As we have said, some of the mines are in a situation where some of our Asian neighbours are cutting back on the purchase of coal and those sorts of things. They have a choice: they can either downsize slightly or close the gates. I am more than sure that the majority of people would possibly look at that slight downsizing rather than the complete closing of the facilities altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I campaigned strongly during the March 1996 election to establish sound infrastructure projects and I shall continue to push for creditable infrastructure projects to be developed in Capricornia. The original infrastructure plan I instigated on winning Capricornia was developed around the structure that Rockhampton already boasted. These areas have been a part of Capricornia's lifelong identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rockhampton is recognised as the beef capital of Australia. Rockhampton holds a major Beef Expo in the township every three years which attracts tens of thousands of interstate and overseas visitors and traders. The Beef Expo this year was worth millions of dollars to the local community and this must be built on in the future. The project, well-known as `Cattle Industry Park', is one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12055"> that I consider future development should fall in line with. As a result of this I have encouraged the farming sector and other interested parties to provide a plan to upgrade the facility. I have shown the plan and the project site to the relevant minister as well as to the federal National Party task force. They all agree that it is a magnificent concept, will create jobs and will provide an excellent facility that could potentially attract many more thousands of interstate and overseas visitors. The outcome will inject more money into the local economy and will create many more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cattle Industry Park project is basically centred around the idea that people could come in and see live cattle sales in progress and see what the cattle industry is all about. It would be a great attraction for the central Queensland region. I am more than sure that this government will have a closer look at it. I would like to think that there are possibilities for federation funding and/or that the state government may come on board and get involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cattle industry makes an enormous contribution to the Capricornia electorate and to the Australian economy. The central Queensland cattle industry exports nearly 20 per cent of the total primary commodity production in the region, servicing the economies of North and South&hyphen;East Asia and Japan. Therefore, it is appropriate that we showcase our best local product with a major facility that displays our produce as it should be displayed. The existing facility is well worn and ageing, the cattle pens are rotting and the seating has outlived its usefulness. When the cattle industry has its expo, it currently holds it at the local showgrounds in Rockhampton. The area is depleted and needs a lot of work. We would probably be better off building one complete new facility rather than continuing to try to repair the old one, throwing good money, in some ways, after bad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another project I would like to see come to fruition in my electorate is the extension of the Rockhampton airport to international standard. This will make Rockhampton an attractive destination for international travellers. On the coast, at Yepoon, we have the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Capricorn International Resort, where many people go for holidays. It is a fantastic area with its beach, water sports and golfing. It is a great attraction to our overseas visitors. If the Rockhampton airport is developed, that area alone would be very attractive to them. They can also gain access to the Great Barrier Reef and to outback towns like Longreach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The upgrading of the airport will also provide excellent opportunities for exporting fruit, flowers, redclaw crayfish and other produce to our international neighbours. Since the possible imminent development of the Nathan Gorge dam in the Dawson Valley a lot of small business people, particularly those on the land who have been suffering from drought, have started moving into aquaculture. They are looking at the market, are seeing what is wanted overseas, and are starting to put things together so they can cater for those markets. If we can get the length of the runway at Rockhampton airport extended it will be a great boost to our region. It will also benefit our defence forces and the defence forces of our neighbours, who regularly use Shoalwater Bay, the defence training area slightly north&hyphen;east of the city of Rockhampton. The extension of the airport will provide many jobs directly and indirectly both in the construction phase and thereafter. It will boost tourism and exports and provide much needed jobs in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rockhampton is also very well developed in relation to its educational entity in central Queensland. We have many fine, highly respected primary and secondary schools as well as the Central Queensland University and its campuses around central Queensland, in Sydney and in other areas. The Central Queensland University received a significant increase in funding from the coalition government which has allowed the university to expand and offer excellent educational facilities for many more local and international students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Central Queensland University is also undergoing corporatisation, which is the path to self-sufficiency. I wish them well in their further development. The Pro&hyphen;Vice&hyphen;Chancellor up there, Lauchlan Chipman, is doing his best and I am quietly confident that when they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12056"> have finished their restructure on the way to corporatisation that will make the university&mdash;if it is not already&mdash;one of the leading educational facilities in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Capricorn region is made up of the Bowen Basin, a very rich coal producing area which provides part of Australia's export market. Sadly, even though the area is in the heart of Capricornia, the previous federal representative never pushed Rockhampton as the support city to the Bowen Basin. Therefore, we have missed out on a considerable amount of regional funding over many years. It is my intention to turn this around.    </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the March 1996 election I have done a lot of work  with the chamber of commerce, the local government councils and those sorts of organisations, particularly in Rockhampton. The coal mines&mdash;Blair Athol, Moranbah, Blackwater, Gregory&mdash;are in the Bowen Basin region. It would be easier to transport goods from Rockhampton to those places, but Mackay got in at that time and strongly pushed itself while Rockhampton City Council did not. So we are in a situation where a lot of the mines use Mackay as their service centre. It is very disappointing that the previous councils did not, back in those days, push on and strive to get that business. But we are working to try to turn that around&mdash;especially as Rockhampton is so much closer than Mackay to some of the mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many projects from the infrastructure package that we have put together have been instigated. A lot of them have been completed, right down to the Capricornia aged care survey that I commissioned. This document is very important to the development of the aged care facilities in our region. In that survey we identified that a lot of people are moving from the southern states up to the warmer parts of Queensland, particularly Rockhampton, Yeppoon and those areas. With the massive influx of people we need to make facilities available for people in aged care, nursing homes and those sorts of things. The survey has gone a long way towards addressing a lot of the problems we are going to have. I am quietly confident that with our survey now completed we can further develop that region and put the best facilities in place 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for those people who wish to use nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past few months we have been looking at a new infrastructure program. As I said, a lot of the things we have put together have been completed, right down to the Mount Morgan dam wall. People at Mount Morgan have been wanting water for many years. It has been a Labor Party stronghold, but they have done nothing for the region. Within nine months we had secured the funding and we are going to raise that dam wall in Mount Morgan as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we have gone through many infrastructure projects. They are almost all completed. In the past few months I have called on the area consultative committee to go and speak to all the local government councils and receive submissions from them on putting together a new plan which will take us into the future. I am a great believer that if we have a one&hyphen;, five&hyphen;, 10&hyphen; and 20&hyphen;year plan then Capricornia will be all right. The end result of all my actions is to make Capricornia one of the most profitable and progressive electorates in this country. I am more than sure that the people who have seen the things we are trying to achieve have seen that it is not about politics; it is about people working together.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the appropriation bills, I understand that funds raised from the Telstra float are being used as a means of trying to pay for the compensation needed for the industries most affected by the delays in the signing of the regional forest agreement, especially in Tasmania. These funds were passed onto the Natural Heritage Fund and will now affect the protection and management of the national estate in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania won some money despite delays and prevarication on the part of both the state government and the federal government. But throwing money at Tasmania is not going to solve the state's enormous unemployment problem. Nothing is being done for the long term in this state. There are no provisions for ongoing research and development of the timber and paper industries, there are no start&hyphen;up funds and there is no tax encouragement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12057"> for existing companies to continue value adding to their products. We are still in the `ship it out as quickly as possible' mode because it is `cheaper' to process elsewhere. That is not an appropriate response to Tasmania's appalling unemployment and population drain problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the groups involved in the development of the regional forest agreement. They include the Forest and Forest Industries Council, the Forest Industries Association, Forestry Tasmania, the CFMEU, which represents all the workers associated with the industry, and a group&mdash;now a national organisation&mdash;which has led from the grassroots, which has kept us abreast of the issues and which has represented the families and timber communities most affected by all the discussions: the Forest Protection Society. All these organisations have put in enormous time and effort over the last 10 years or so to bring together all the players and to ensure that Tasmania had an industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forestry is one of our key industries. The Forest Protection Society has been at the forefront of the debate over the last few years. Last Friday was the 10th anniversary of the formation of the Forest Protection Society. Often seen by some of the greener city people as conservative, the society is actually composed of people from all around Australia&mdash;from most political perspectives and from both rural and urban areas&mdash;who wish to promote the balanced use of our forests. Many of these people work or live in communities which depend on forests and timber industries for their livelihood. They all share the belief that timber products, the jobs that forest based industries provide and sound management of forests are beneficial for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Forest Protection Society is a grassroots organisation which talks directly to its members and helps them to understand the many complex issues that have surrounded the debate for so many years. It teaches them to be strong on their philosophy, it teaches them how to spread their message in a calm and confident way and it helps them to listen to other people's point of view and gently 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> point out the anomalies in some of the more fringe arguments. I joined the Forest Protection Society because I believed it had a very important bipartisan role to play in restoring public awareness and confidence in the forest industry. It also allowed me to put an informed opinion at the height of the woodchip licensing debate as to how the federal discussions were affecting the workers on the ground trying to make a living and the difficulties that meant for their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Forest Protection Society actually means forest protection. It, like some of the Greens, has a very intimate knowledge acquired over more than 100 years as to how the forest works. The differences in views are really not that great&mdash;only by interpretations and definitions do they differ. One of the main aims of the FPS is to ensure ecologically unique areas of Australia's forests are properly managed, and it wants sustainable forestry practices to be used, such as hardwood and softwood plantations, to provide additional, high quality wood resources for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference lies in the Greens' concern to put environmental issues and trees into a package exclusively separate from natural evolutionary processes. The FPS believes people are as much a part of nature as the trees. It is all a matter of emphasis. Those of us who have grown up in the country and worked in the timber areas believe that conservation is for people rather than from people. FPS believes that productive conservation is a cornerstone of regional communities across Australia who rely upon the wise use of our natural resources, native forests being one of those natural resources. Let us look at the FPS's mission statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our aim is to secure long term access to natural resources to generate employment and a future for regional communities and to ensure our unique Australian forests are scientifically evaluated and sustainably managed for the benefit of future generations and genetic diversity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think that indicates an attitude of not caring about the forest's future. On the contrary, I think it means that those most closely associated with it, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year, have the most interest in looking after it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12058">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 10 years, this organisation has grown by leaps and bounds to having 12,000 members Australia&hyphen;wide in some 58 branches. In Tasmania, there are about 2,000 members and we now have 11 branches all around the state. I believe the organisation will continue to be a grassroots advice system for change in the forest industry. Abiding by its mission statement, it can only improve the life of timber communities around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state, I would like to recognise the work of Barry Chipman, the FPS state coordinator, who has not only developed the organisation in Tasmania as a successful education and lobby group on forestry issues but also grown himself as an efficient and effective officer who can comfortably talk to people at any level&mdash;a pretty good effort for a `boy from the bush' who for most of his working life has been a timber worker. Barry works tirelessly and now spends much of his life on the road, covering his branches and ensuring his members are looked after well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Tasmania state branch we have 11 different groupings. The southern Tasmanian branch president is Geoff Wilkinson, the northern Tasmanian branch president is Raoul Dixon and the north&hyphen;eastern branch president is Ken Hall. Then we have the Meander Resource Management Group, whose president, Rodney Stagg, has an excellent branch with a number of good projects, one of which we hope to have funded soon. This branch has fifth generation residents working to maintain their heritage of forest farming. I was pleased to launch this branch in 1993. Another one in my electorate is the Liffey District Resource Management Group, with Mark Shelton as president, and its members are working to create a better understanding among the broader community of their way of life. The other two in my electorate are the west coast branch with Gordon Sutton, who is working to regain people's access to world heritage areas in the south-west, and at the east coast branch Glenn Arnol waves the flag for all those in the timber dependent communities of the south-east.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three north&hyphen;west branches of Hellyer, Circular Head and Bischoff&hyphen;Heemskirk have Christine O'Connor, Andrew McMaster and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Phillip Polson respectively as branch presidents. I have met with them on a number of occasions in Canberra and in Tasmania and they have an excellent record of keeping the information flowing to their members. Huon Valley branch's Jenny Woolley is not in my patch but I hear she is doing a great job. They are a good and dedicated group of people who want to ensure only that there are jobs in the timber industry for the future and that Tasmania gets the best deal it can for its timber resources. All these people and their families have been associated with timber production for generations and are working to ensure they still will be for years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of projects that the FPS is involved with is legendary. Only this last weekend, I was on the west coast at the opening of the Nora Bridge on the Mount McCall Road. This allowed the road to be used to take people down to look at the famous Franklin River. This was a real community project which started with West Coast FPS member Bern Bradshaw overseeing and contributing his labour and Gordon Sutton, who is the president of that branch, helping out. Bern, Gordon and Barry Chipman set about collecting material and expertise from the people who live and work around Queenstown. It was a big job that without their efforts would have cost in excess of $35,000. As it was, members and friends built it for a fraction of that price. The quality of the bridge is first class and reminds me of the bridges of old that were built by the pioneer foresters and miners. It is a fitting tribute to the old times that this bridge should be rebuilt using the same methods of the past, with the same sort of cooperation and mateship that existed then. There is as much heritage in the old skills and constructions as there is in the natural environment. It is important that we recognise this and understand why people are so passionate about their family history. Aren't we all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like also to take this opportunity to welcome Chris Althaus as the new national director of the FPS and his team of Heike Phillips as the national coordinator and Neredah Crane as the national secretary, and I look forward to an ongoing and mutually 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12059"> beneficial relationship with our national body. The FPS is like a family and everyone is concerned for the wellbeing of their fellow members. They are the sorts of people who will help you out when things go wrong, who will find some assistance for a good cause and will be always available for advice. I find it a very rewarding and interesting society to be part of. I congratulate them on their 10 years existence and look forward to working with them for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to touch briefly again on the Tasmanian regional forest agreement. I am extremely thankful it has finally been signed. We could not continue to leave the industry in limbo while the government tried to gain some brownie points for itself. But I think we have to be wary of the concessions in it that were not part of the original agreement. Nor had they been assessed in the same detail as had occurred during the development of the agreement. I believe there will be some more of that brought out in the future. That is something I will be following up during the review period, and I will be looking at it and hope to be speaking about it some time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This does give us the opportunity to move on and start new directions for the industry, such as timber certification and further value adding of our timber products. Australia is a country that relies on its sustainable resources, and we must encourage everyone to become better at using the resource. But just locking up supply is not going to improve anything&mdash;least of all our understanding of these processes. I certainly hope that the parliament can work together to ensure that we do not have such divisive argument again as we have had over some of these.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the appropriation legislation gives members the opportunity to examine the progress made by the coalition government in tackling the very important, urgent issues that this nation must address, and also allows me to mention briefly some of the achievements that I see have occurred in my part of Australia, in the electorate of Indi. The major achievements of the government are that it has tackled the very serious deficit, the $10 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion deficit, left by the previous government, and next year we will have a surplus. So, after two years, two budgets, the deficit will have been eliminated and there will be a welcome surplus. The effect of that management of the economy, having to make difficult decisions, is that we have been able to have a substantial influence in reducing interest rates. We now find that families with an average home mortgage are about $200 to $300 a month better off in my electorate and throughout Australia. This is a wonderful thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, as I said in the House yesterday, with increased competition due to coalition policies to increase competition in the finance sector, and also because of the management of the economy by the coalition, small business can now negotiate its small capital loans and gearings at much more competitive rates. For example, a $100,000 overdraft home secured type of loan that many small businesses now use is now about $4,000 a year cheaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax cut was a very welcome boost to families who had been having very difficult times in the previous 13 years of Labor with high interest rates and increasing costs due to inflation. Small business has benefited by a number of major reforms. The trade practices <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal</EMPHASIS> for small business is a welcome initiative and a very great dynamic. Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, you must feel very proud to have noted that the  Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  went through the House last night. I congratulate you and Peter Reith, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. We hope that the Senate does not obstruct it, as Labor Party members and other non&hyphen;government members in the Senate have obstructed other major reforms, to the detriment of Australia. Remember that we are now moving into 1998 at a time when young students graduate from universities, TAFEs and secondary schools and are looking at jobs. The difficulty they have in finding employment can be sheeted home to the behaviour of the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens in the Senate for making it more difficult for small business to create new jobs. I mention unfair dismissal as just one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12060"> example of their shameful obstructionism. They will be found out during next year, whenever the election might be, because their accountability will be very much to the fore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many more apprenticeships in the pipeline, and next year we will see, across my electorate and many other parts of Australia, the introduction of vocational training in schools, jobs pathway programs and increased assistance to apprentices and employers, particularly those in small business, to cut through the red tape, simplify things and provide a one&hyphen;stop shop to enhance the prospects of creating apprenticeship opportunities, particularly in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other initiatives that have been taken. I was very pleased to see that we were able to receive into the Murray&hyphen;Darling area&mdash;of which my electorate is a very significant part&mdash;a very substantial part of the National Heritage Fund from the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra. That money will be used very well to help rehabilitate our rivers, creeks and streams and the land and soil. It is certainly a turning point for the environment. I acknowledge very much the coalition government's commitment in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on that subject, I will mention a very serious situation that exists in the Murray&hyphen;Darling, partly in my electorate and partly in adjoining electorates. That is that there is a claim over a substantial part of the river and tributaries of the Murray River by about 200 men, women and children belonging to the Yorta Yorta tribe. It is a pity we have not got cameras or I could show a map of the extent of their claim. Instead I will describe it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their claim extends from Cohuna to Jerilderie across the New South Wales&hyphen;Victoria border. It runs through places like Berrigan, Corowa, Rutherglen and Chiltern. It extends as far south as Euroa and covers areas including Benalla, Wangaratta, Rutherglen, Shepparton, Rushworth and the like. The details of the claim these people have put forward are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Applicants claim native title rights and interests, and (as to land) possessory title, in areas of land and waters&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as being within their traditional boundaries, which are those I have generally described in the area of the Murray&hyphen;Darling I spoke about. They also claim all the natural resources found in the claimed areas. The claim goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Applicants' claim includes a claim to all water which, from time to time, may be found within the claimed areas, whether such waters are, at any time, stationary or flowing, or located in natural or man made water courses, dams, etc. Such claims extend to the banks and beds&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">of the rivers in the claimed area&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">underlying or supporting such waters and all natural resources found therein. The claims do not extend to casual waters found in the claimed areas from time to time eg. non&hyphen;permanent pools following heavy rain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a relief but, as I have indicated, the claims do extend to those other substantial water resources. The determination being sought by the applicants is that native title exists in relation to the whole of the claimed area, including land, waters and all the natural resources in that area. The determination being sought also seeks a declaration that the native title held by the people making the claim confers:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) rights of possession, occupation, use and enjoyment to all of the claimed areas to the exclusion of all others, save those people (if any) indicated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in their court documents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">alternatively</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) rights of possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of part or parts of the claimed areas, to the exclusion of all others,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(save those indicated . . . )&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in their documents of claim. Generally, they did seek an injunction which, thankfully, was not granted. In granting rights of interest in relation to any of the claimed areas, that would have restrained authorities, agencies and local authorities administering water in the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of this claim cannot be overlooked. It has already occupied some 100 sitting days of the Federal Court. There have already been some 200 witnesses called. There have been some 60 site visits by the court, and I understand that taxpayers have provided in excess of $2 million worth of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12061"> legal aid to the applicants. Some of the respondents were recently given some assistance by way of legal aid, but in the early parts of the claim, under the former government, they were refused any assistance at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that authorities such as the Murray&hyphen;Darling Commission have expended something like $600,000 in legal representation and an irrigation authority on the New South Wales side has expended something like $700,000 in legal costs. More recently, I understand there were 16 barristers appearing before the Federal Court, addressing the court and making submissions on a particular day in respect of that claim. So you can see that it is a very serious claim under the present Native Title Act. It involves huge cost and is being taken very seriously by authorities and agencies of the crown in the states involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer again, in the context of the comments I have been making, to a comment made by Robert Gottliebsen, the editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS>, in his column of 1 December 1997, which is headed `Nub of the Wik debate'. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all the debate over Wik, the nub of the problem is rarely stated. If Aboriginal communities have effective right of veto over the creation of major areas of wealth in Australia, almost certainly much less wealth will be created. Already, miners have switched some of their exploration activity overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If less wealth is created, there will be less money available for social security, pensions and the other benefits that Australians expect from their Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To those not directly involved, it would appear that there should be plenty of scope to satisfy the aspirations of Aborigines who want contact with the land without giving them power of veto over wealth creation.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I thought his comments were very relevant to the debate on the appropriation bill, because this bill deals with the allocation of taxpayers' money to help provide the services that citizens in this country have come to expect, such as health and pensions. But we should remind ourselves that governments do not create money themselves. Governments take money from people in the form of taxes; they then use those moneys and set priorities to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pay for services that the people in the nation want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My comments regarding the Yorta Yorta claim&mdash;a claim which is over a substantial part of the waters of Australia's greatest river, the Murray River, and its tributaries extending throughout New South Wales and Victoria&mdash;should be seen in the context of the nature and extent of that claim. The Yorta Yorta claim is, in some respects, for native title rights to the exclusion of all others. As such, it has a direct effect on the ability of this nation to continue to produce goods and services, trade in them, export them and earn income from which governments derive their taxes so that they can provide services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind members that the Murray-Darling Basin is the major source of food production in Australia. It is, I think from memory, the source of about 40 per cent of Australia's total food exports. Obviously, that production depends very much on the management of the water resource, which is finite, very precious and has to be managed very well. Of course, it does rely on the governments, state and federal, administering responsible laws for the good of all people in this country. For a long time it has been well settled that the parliaments of the states have the right to administer and decide on the allocation of water resources and the way in which they should be saved and used judiciously for the benefit of not only the states but the whole nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This claim by the Yorta Yorta people strikes at the very heart of that system. It seeks to create new, special rights exclusive to the 200 claimants and it flies in the face of the administration of water and the law, which has been well settled in this country. Indeed, years ago, before the states passed their laws dealing with the control and management of water, people who had freehold titles, for example, were regarded as having exclusive ownership of water, such as ground water, in the state of Victoria. It was only when the parliaments passed the laws vesting the control and management of that water resource in the Crown that the freeholder lost the right of controlling the use of that water themselves. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12062">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say that there was no compensation paid at all to anyone when that legislation was passed in the state parliament. The vesting in the Crown occurred because it was seen to be in the public interest. Despite the very substantial loss of asset, the Commonwealth and state freeholders went along with this legislation, because the community accepts very readily the need for a finite resource such as water to be managed on behalf of all the people by the elected government, accountable to the parliament and the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This claim by the Yorta Yorta people strikes at the very heart of that custom and of that well settled position in this nation and in the states. As I have said, it has already advanced through a hearing into the Federal Court and is well on the way to a determination by the Federal Court. Undoubtedly, unless the law is settled by the amendments which have been proposed by the coalition and which are now before the Senate, there will be grave repercussions, great uncertainty and perhaps huge claims in the future which, in the long run, the taxpayer will have to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention those things because I am gravely concerned about the debate in relation to Wik and the 10&hyphen;point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Unfortunately, from the point of view of many people, commentators, critics and, in some cases, the media have neglected to report widely and thoroughly to the Australian community on the nature and extent of the claims being made across Australia, such as the claim I have mentioned over the land and the waters of the Murray River and its tributaries. I believe that is a very, very serious omission. I call on responsible members of the media to take it upon themselves to report&mdash;they do not have to take sides&mdash;on the facts of these claims and the nature and extent of them so that the Australian community will be able to judge fairly the depth of concern that should be had in respect of the present inadequate Native Title Act, passed by the Keating government, and the need for changes and reforms in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I just report that, up to a few minutes ago, I was endeavouring to find out what was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happening in the Senate with respect to the eighth point&mdash;which deals with the management of inland water&mdash;of the Prime Minister's 10-point plan. I was alarmed to be told that at this stage the Labor Party appears to be opposing the Prime Minister's proposal to settle once and for all that the management of water should be in accordance with the well settled administration by the states and territories. That will not take away any native title rights. It will preserve the right to claim compensation if native title can be proved, but it makes it absolutely and abundantly clear that the decision on the allocation of water and permits and all those things cannot be interfered with by a claimant or anyone, whether they be white or black.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my alarm, I have been told that indications have been given in the Senate that the Labor Party will continue to oppose the Prime Minister's proposals. That is quite extraordinary. I think the community should be alerted to that and should ask serious questions of the Labor Party as to what it is really up to. What is its agenda? Surely it cannot be allowed to leave parliament this week and get away without having to be brought to account and explain how it intends to administer the water and what it intends to do in places like the Murray-Darling, which I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that, when people start to question these members of parliament and make them accountable, they will also be asked to explain why they have obstructed other measures to help deal with the very serious situation of youth unemployment. For example, why did they obstruct until the last minute the work for the dole provisions, which have been very welcomed? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Those amendments are, of their nature, technical and of a drafting sort. We have had various discussions in the Senate, and this is one aspect of tidying up or dealing with the various propositions that have been advanced.</PARA>

There were some matters disagreed with, but I suppose that is the nature of politics. I appreciate the consideration that we have had from the Australian Democrats, in particular from Senator Andrew Murray, in sitting down and dealing with these issues on their merits. I wanted to record that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not be opposing this motion. The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is now being pared back to what I guess is a bare minimum for the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) to be able to get through and have some sort of success with. Most of these matters being rolled through are technical matters with which we have no disagreement. We did not support some amendments, and we regret that other amendments to which the minister alluded are not proceeding at this time. We thought they were good amendments, but the Democrats have come to an agreement with the government about not proceeding with them. That is a pity, but it is not a matter that is effectively before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak briefly to the consequences of one part of the Workplace Relations Act as a whole, with this bill included, that we have expressed concern about in the House and in the Senate and that we are still concerned about: that is, the continuing operation of the Office of the Employment Advocate and, in particular, his role concerning Australian workplace agreements. I have over time made a number of very specific remarks about the performance of the individual and have raised questions of accountability that I will not rehearse again today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always said that the provisions for the interrelationship between the operation of Australian workplace agreements and the Office of the Employment Advocate&mdash;that is, the provisions for secrecy and for non-reviewability&mdash;have had the potential for profound concern. We have a number of aspects that continue day by day to reinforce that concern. Today I want to refer to the fact that these secrecy provisions have created the legislative framework that have allowed the Dubai industrial mercenary project to go ahead. Without that legislative framework, this sinister project could not have occurred. Let us not be in any doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one interesting question that I understand the media has asked the minister and me: has the Office of the Employment Advocate approved the Australian workplace 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12066"> agreement circulated by and apparently in operation between Fynwest and these ex&hyphen;military personnel? The answer is that nobody knows and we will not be able to find out. That is another element of this secrecy. Without it, the project could not have proceeded. It is living proof that some of the concerns that we have been expressing are absolutely valid. Some of the other concerns are validated by other activities that are not relevant to today's discussions. I will not waste the House's time with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have covert strike&hyphen;busting operations, it is absolutely crystal clear, as it was always to anybody who read the bill but probably wanted to see the public evidence of it, that the secrecy provisions of the Workplace Relations Act as they relate to Australian workplace agreements and the operations of the Office of Employment Advocate made these sorts of activities possible. It is not a development that is healthy for Australian society or for Australian industrial relations. It is part of an emerging pattern of worrying trends in Australian industrial relations and in Australian society. I think Australians are entitled to be and should be concerned about this propensity for secrecy, this propensity for non&hyphen;reviewability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the Employment Advocate refused these things but, I have to say, he has a very weak microscope and nobody can assess effectively how well he has done. Even if he were a person in whom I had more confidence than the current incumbent, it is the structure, the process, that causes me concern. We have in yesterday's revelations and in those which are still to come the proof that operations such as those in Dubai&mdash;those covert, strike&hyphen;busting operations&mdash;are facilitated, made possible, and the legislative framework for their operation created, by the interrelationship between the Australian workplace agreements provisions and the Office of Employment Advocate provisions of the act. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not need to disparage a person who is doing a professional job for your cheap political reasons. You do not need to attack somebody who is doing their job, who is not in a position to defend themselves against your claims. Why employ cowards' castle to attack a public servant just because they are doing their job? He has done a good job and people on your own side have said so. The reason you want to abolish the Office of Employment Advocate is that the unions have told you to. That is always the reason with you people. When it comes to public policy on industrial relations, you just do what the ACTU tells you to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The availability of Australian workplace agreements to enterprises is an option for people, but they are an option in a new system which allows the employers and the employees to come to an agreement that suits them. The whole idea of an agreement is that you have an agreement only if both sides agree. Australian workplace agreements are a new form of agreement making which can be convenient to parties if it suits them; it is really up to them. If people want to work for a labour hire company and undertake training overseas, they could do so under the award, under an Australian workplace agreement, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12067"> under a certified agreement, under a state agreement&mdash;any way they like. Why shouldn't they be able to set up an arrangement that suits the employer and the employee? That is the whole idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the Labor Party does not like it is that they hate the idea of people having agreements which do not allow the unions to tell them what to do. That has always been the case. I can show you Australian workplace agreements. There was one, for example, in Queensland which provided the employer and the employee with the opportunity to come to an agreement. As a result of them coming to an agreement, they were able to make a more efficient, more productive meatworks, and that meant that a lot of people could get a job that they would not otherwise have got. If somebody gets a job because of our Workplace Relations Act, we have done a good job in providing that policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are choices for people to make. It is a pity that the Labor Party, under various disguises, is advocating the abolition of a very good option for employers and employees. It is an entirely voluntary one. A requirement of those agreements is that they meet certain minimum standards set by the award, provided those agreements meet standards whereby, basically, people are not worse off as a result of them, compared with the award. That is a very fair deal and, rather than attacking that proposition, the Labor Party should be supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made some sensible technical amendments. The government has secured passage of much of what we were after by sensible discussions with the Democrats. Things were discussed on a practical level, not on the sort of ideological rhetoric we get from the Labor Party. I thank Senator Murray for being prepared to sit down and make some sensible changes that will help people in the way in which they run their businesses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regrettably, there are a number of policy areas that illustrate the Howard-Fischer coalition government's inability to administer policy and program properly. It now becomes a matter of not only having to argue proper policy&mdash;argue against the ideology that drives policy&mdash;but to bring to account a government that even when it puts in place programs that it believes have some positive effect cannot do so with certainty, cannot do so efficiently and cannot do so effectively. It is also becoming a government that is characterised by its twisted logic and targeting of programs. I want to give a number of illustrations in this appropriation debate of programs that can illustrate those points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already this week we have had a discussion about the allocation of programs such as Green Corps and work for the dole. I want to include another&mdash;job pathways.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Cunningham says that it is the same for his electorate. One has to pose the question: why is it so? I especially ask this after listening to contributions in debates over the last couple of weeks. For instance, on 27 November the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi), when speaking to an MPI, said in conclusion in his contribution:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Out of the 76 schools in Australia which are participating in that program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he is talking about the jobs pathway program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29 are from the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, my area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the school based apprenticeship program. He goes on:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12068">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will now be benefiting in school based apprenticeship programs. This government has taken an integrated approach to education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The electorate for Deakin was also the beneficiary of one of the one&hyphen;stop shops for apprenticeship action. At that time I illustrated that I have no beef about resources and programs like this being placed in an electorate such as Deakin. But I would argue that, on the basis of relative need, if it is good enough for these programs to be allocated in electorates such as Deakin, it is equally, and probably more likely, necessary that there be programs allocated to electorates such as Scullin, given that an electorate such as Scullin, a northern suburbs electorate of Melbourne, has high degrees of disadvantage and high degrees of unemployment&mdash;all the categories that these programs are supposedly trying to tackle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the debate about the new arrangements for the youth allowance, it is no use imposing upon those young people that the government believes can benefit from staying on at school a necessity for them to do so by taking away their eligibility for unemployment benefits if the schools that these young people are going to have to attend are not properly resourced to look after their needs, because they have special needs and that has to be acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier in the year when commenting on the actual distribution of Green Corps projects&mdash;I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) to get me wrong; I know that he has passionate views about Green Corps and its value&mdash;I agree about the value of the Green Corps program and what it can do for the environment. I have no problem about that, but please do not dress it up as a labour market training program when over half the people who have gone into that program, even in the limited numbers that are going into the program&mdash;I am not going to argue about that and I think it is a shame more resources are not put into that program&mdash;come from other employment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It creates work all right but the government should be fair dinkum and resource it to an even greater degree. One of the fundamental problems that the Howard government has not understood is that the public sector now and in the future will always have an important role in direct job creation. Forget about getting all the fundamentals of the economy right and getting the level of economic growth right; these will all have to be supplemented by direct action by government. This government fails to understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that I want to refer to&mdash;it has been a controversial matter for most of this session and is likely to continue to be controversial&mdash;is the whole nursing home saga. I want to refer to the confusion that has reigned because of the government's inability to, firstly, get its policies right but, secondly, even in the various versions of its policies, explain them properly. The people that they need to explain those policies to in the first instance are those most affected&mdash;the frail elderly and their families. But, regrettably, there continues to be too many examples of the way in which people are confused&mdash;I am not sure what mark we are up to in the different variations of this policy but it has to be in the double digits&mdash;because these policies are just not explained properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give a few examples. A couple of weeks ago a hostel in my electorate was blessed by Catholic Archbishop Pell of Melbourne. When Archbishop Pell was out at Villa Madonna, he described the government's aged care policy as a shemozzle. The basis of his concern was that the Villa Maria Society was opening a facility with 51 beds plus one respite bed&mdash;I have had the opportunity to inspect the facility, and it is a very fine facility&mdash;and when he spoke on the Wednesday and the following Monday, the society was hopeful that it would be able to accept residents into its new aged care facility. It had in fact guaranteed places to 20 people who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12069"> had been referred to it by the assessment teams. But, as a result of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) going on Ray Martin's show and announcing a variation of the policy, in the two days subsequent to Ray Martin's show the department issued variations on the original policy announcement and the Villa Maria Society was informed by the department that of those 20 people only two would be eligible under the new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Villa Maria Society, which controls approximately 400 aged care beds in Victoria, has been involved in this sector for quite some time. It is a society that tries to keep abreast of what is going on. The society is terribly confused about having to take direct action in accepting people into their facility. I share with the House that in early discussions I had with the society this group saw merit in what the government intended when they intended to have accommodation bonds. I chose to disagree with them, but I respected their view. The really telling thing for the government is that here we have a respected aged care provider&mdash;an organisation providing aged care&mdash;that had some sympathy for the view of the government but which is now in despair because the government has not been able to clearly enunciate what it is really on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it hard to believe that it was the fault of the society, which, for its troubles, has got a bit of a touch up from the department which said, `Oh, no, they hadn't been advised earlier on that because the hostel would be considered as an aged care facility from 1 October it could accept both low and high category residents.' There had apparently been some misinterpretation&mdash;given that the society is very careful about what it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not only people like them who are confused but also people like the Victorian Minister for Youth and Community Services, Dr Napthine, who illustrated in the Victorian parliament how confused he is&mdash;even after the minister went outside the parliament earlier this week to make a further announcement about where we are at with this policy. So we had the state minister yesterday in the Victorian parliament revealing that he did not understand who it was that did not have to pay the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up&hyphen;front accommodation fee and who did have to pay and did not understand the way in which the assets test would apply to those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If all these people are confused, why should the opposition be subjected to the taunt that we are scaremongering? We have been trying to find out what is actually going on. The government has not done the right thing and has been rather foolish by taking those questions as being political and not taking them seriously&mdash;not taking the opportunity those questions gave to clearly announce or to clear up or to clarify what it is actually on about. It simply is not good enough. As I said from the outset, this is not an argument about whether one agrees with what the government is doing; this is now down to the despair of people not knowing what the government is about and the government not being able implement what it promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter I want to go to is the announcement in the budget of the therapeutic group premiums now that we have finally seen an agreement about how this may or may not operate from its start&hyphen;up date of 1 February. I remind the House that initially there were six groups of drugs under consideration. After discussion with the relevant professional bodies, it has now been decided that those groups should be reduced to four.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have come across a paper, which was produced by the Health Group Strategies Pty Ltd and the Institute of Health Economics and Technology Assessment and written by Paul Gross and Roger Fortescue, which analyses the overseas experience. In the debate over Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2), the minister was quite happy to illustrate that this was not a new idea, that it was something that had overseas precedence and tried to say that on that basis everything would be okay. But this paper goes and looks at the overseas experience and analyses what actually happened. It is very illustrative because it goes to a form of decision making that is quite worrying, a form of decision making that the opposition has tried to highlight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier on the government had to respond to the fact that the factor F scheme for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12070"> pharmaceutical industry was soon to expire. They had to make an announcement about what they envisaged would happen in the period post the agreement that was in place. We have discovered that that announcement was made in isolation. It was seen as just a pure industry policy announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure members that previous Labor governments never implemented factor F in isolation from pharmaceutical industry aspects. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme plays an important role in the way in which drugs are accessed in the Australian market. Labor always acknowledged in what it did that, because that is a very carefully monitored and very carefully controlled mechanism which can radically distort the market, the considerations that are made in ensuring that the drugs that are most effective and the safest are made available to Australians that need them at an appropriate cost can impinge on pharmaceutical companies' ability to undergo their business. One of the important aspects of factor F was in the trade-off in matters to do with the length of patents and allowing generic pricing to come on board. All these things were done as a balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry minister responded by announcing a new version of factor F and then, a few weeks later, as part of the budget there was an announcement that radically changed an aspect of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This announcement was done in isolation from those industry considerations. Not only was it done in isolation from those industry considerations; it appears to have been done in isolation from the effect that the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme would have on other areas of our health scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at the experience overseas, especially the very similar scheme that has been in place in British Colombia in Canada, one finds that an analysis of what happened after a therapeutic group premium or a therapeutic reference pricing scheme was introduced highlighted that it led to an additional $10 million being outlaid for additional visits to doctors. Confusion about the use of the drugs and patients using, on the basis of the price signal, a new drug or a less effective 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drug led to additional costs from additional visits to doctors and additional emergency admissions to hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has not been highlighted in the argument about this new scheme is that we are talking about drugs of similar clinical value&mdash;not bio&hyphen;equivalence&mdash;like generic drugs. We are actually talking about the same drugs just put together in a different form and manufactured by different people. These drugs in these premium groups are different drugs, and they will have different effects on different individuals. That is what we need to protect against, and we have to acknowledge that for some people the higher cost drugs will be most appropriate. They should not be put off attempting to have those drugs on the basis of cost. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate on these appropriation bills. Today I am not trying to save the whale, the rhino or the mahogany glider but trying to save a sediment dwelling organism in the world heritage area listed under the Ramsar Convention, and that is the Boondall Wetlands Reserve. Without these organisms, the Boondall Wetlands Reserve will cease to exist. This would be devastating because local residents have invested so much time, effort and money into saving the wetlands from developers in 1990 for it to be a heritage for our future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Measuring half a millimetre, these sediment dwelling organisms are fundamental in the marine food chain that supports life in the Boondall Wetlands. The wetlands has an area of 1,245 hectares, and is a valuable resting and feeding site for migratory birds from as far away as Siberia, China, Japan, Mongolia and Alaska. The reserve has also been identified as an extremely important breeding ground for juvenile fish, crabs and prawns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Boondall Wetlands was the focus of the 1996 Ramsar International Convention, and it has the potential to become a major regional centre for conservation, environmental education and outdoor family recreation. Scientists became concerned about the decimation of the sediment dwelling organisms in the Boondall Wetlands in 1995, when a large 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12071"> proportion of small animals living in the sediments disappeared. Those which have recolonised in the area have also disappeared before they have reached maturity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October 1995 a detailed environmental study of the Kedron Brook estuary, one of the four estuaries feeding into the Boondall Wetlands Reserve, found that there had been such a dramatic decline in numbers across almost the entire range of sediment dwelling organisms and that the estuary was in fact dead. Subsequent studies last year revealed that there had been a similar catastrophic decline among the organisms along the foreshores of the reserve. This decline repeated itself in the winter and spring of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these sediment dwelling organisms are not revived, juvenile and adult fish will be deprived of major food sources, which will impact on the commercial and recreation fishing industry; the habitat of the mud crab, the sand crab and prawns will cease to exist, again affecting commercial fishing; and the food stocks for water birds will be reduced. Research of bird populations in the Boondall Wetlands Reserve has revealed a major decline in migratory birds feeding on the mudflats as a direct result of the dramatic decline in abundance of their food sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence suggests we may be dealing with more than a normal pollution problem, as typified by many Australian urban estuaries. In other estuaries, a range of species recognised as pollution tolerant are normally present, some in large numbers. Ecologist Sue Quinnell recorded 50 species of larger, conspicuous invertebrates along the mudflats of the Boondall Wetlands late in 1994 and up to mid&hyphen;1995. Today, at least 75 per cent of all these species have been lost and have not been replaced by other species. What is causing the disappearance of these sediment dwelling organisms? The Boondall Wetlands has for a long time been a hot spot for receipt of pollutants, but even in the 1970s when the area was polluted by raw sewage, research showed it to be a biologically rich estuarine area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Marine Conservation Society suggests that the ecological problems at the Boondall Wetlands may be caused by a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> toxic chemical contaminant in the sediments, possibly a pyrethroid. This has serious implications for the maintenance of a healthy ecosystem and will have a major effect on the internationally significant migratory bird population. In addition, many seafood species are dependent on the sediment dwelling invertebrates. Quite clearly, a broader concern about the implications of the marine food web in the whole of Moreton Bay is properly justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Ian Macdonald, accompanied me on a tour of the Boondall Wetlands to listen to what the scientific community and local residents thought. We were able to give an undertaking to support the Australian Marine Conservation Society's proposal to investigate the collapse of the ecosystem. The study will be undertaken in partnership between the Australian Marine Conservation Society and the Centre for Environmental Risk Management and Policy from the Faculty of Environmental Sciences at Griffith University. The aim of the study will be to determine the cause or causes of the decline of sediment dwelling invertebrates at the Boondall Wetlands Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on current evidence, the scientists will start with a hypothesis that the dramatic decline in sediment living organisms is due to the introduction of the use of a chemical, bifenthrin, in July 1995. Bifenthrin can be purchased through any supermarket, hardware shop or plant nursery. It is mainly used for the treatment of termites. Most builders spray the ground with bifenthrin before they lay the concrete slab of a new home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If bifenthrin is the culprit, then the collapse of the ecosystem at the Boondall Wetlands may not be an isolated event. Rivers and estuaries in all parts of Australia might be affected. This is disturbing news. If this or a similar chemical compound is identified this will be of national and possibly international significance. If it is found to be a chemical compound, a review of Australia's hazardous chemicals management procedures will have to be considered both by industry and government. As one of the driest nations on earth, Australia relies heavily on the wise use of our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12072"> waterways which in turn feed into our wetlands. Our wetlands are tremendously important for both Australian culture and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A wetlands conservation plan sponsored by the Mountains to Mangroves Catchment Management Committee and Nudgee College will work towards the preservation of the land. Together they put a submission to the Brisbane City Council and now have a voluntary conservation agreement in place. The land under agreement is a further 27 hectares at Nudgee College that adjoins the Boondall Wetlands Reserve. It will not be developed and Nudgee College will develop an ecosystem on the school campus which will be used to educate its environmental science students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The students at Nudgee College are not the only ones interested in the local wetlands. The Australian Marine Conservation Society is using a $16,000 federal government grant to sample organisms within the Nundah Creek system&mdash;another of the estuaries leading into the Boondall Wetlands Reserve. They have found that the brackish water around the saltpans and melaleuca forests is a rich breeding ground for juvenile fish and prawns which then find their way out to mangroves and into Moreton Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust is going to this wetlands policy, which is designed to conserve, repair and manage the wetlands wisely. The Nudgee College wetlands conservation plan has received a grant of almost $15,000 from the Natural Heritage Trust. The goal of the project is to create an extension to the world heritage listed area. It is planned to identify key sites in the conservation area requiring immediate management and to prioritise degraded parts of the conservation area for rehabilitation. Students from the college will undertake wetlands management and conservation as part of their training for a certificate in conservation within the vocational education studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A track system, canoe portage points, boardwalks and other low impact infrastructure will also be designed and constructed by the college's vocational education students. Upon completion, these facilities will be made available to local community groups. All of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these objectives and activities will go a long way towards delivering a better environment for our future generations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the appropriation bills is a good opportunity to raise a number of issues. I commend the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Grace), for her very thorough research into that particular environmental issue. I wish to focus primarily on industry policy or specifically the lack thereof from the point of view of the current government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the greatest immediate economic risk facing Australia is the Asian economic crisis. In that context, the government is to be soundly condemned for turning its back on Europe. I say that in the context of the government's failure to participate in the world exposition movement. On Monday, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) reversed, after considerable pressure, the decision not to participate in Expo 2000 in Hanover. That pressure came from not only members of the federal opposition and foreign governments, including the German government, but also members of the Queensland parliament, including the Queensland Premier and very active pressure from Peter Beattie, the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland. The reason they are so concerned is that Queensland wants to host Expo 2002 on the Gold Coast. This comes after Queensland so successfully held an Expo in the late 1980s under Sir Llew Edwards, who is again at the helm of the bid for 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was short&hyphen;sighted in the extreme for the federal government to assume that the world exposition movement would come to the Gold Coast in 2002 when we have shunned them for both Expo 1998 in Lisbon, Portugal and Expo 2000 in Hanover. The admission that they made the wrong decision in respect of Hanover must necessarily mean that they made the wrong decision in respect of their non&hyphen;participation in Lisbon in 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first mail&hyphen;out for the Queensland bid, the Prime Minister is pictured in the letter to subscribers to the plan and he is boasting proudly that Australia has been a party to each major world exposition event. It is only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12073"> under this very narrow, confined, parochial government that we are taking ourselves out of the action. The government really should, as a matter of urgency, reverse its decision not to participate in Expo 1998 in Lisbon. It had better get moving because on 10 December, I understand, Australia will be going to Paris to present its case to the Bureau of International Expositions, a very significant body. Australia's bid is going to be significantly prejudiced if the government does not reverse the Lisbon decision before that date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say by way of underlining the point that the competitor for Expo 2002 is the Philippines. The Philippines are going to be not only in Hanover in the year 2000 but also in Lisbon next year. They will be among the 138 participating nations and organisations, including major powers and minor powers but not Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a real indictment of this government. It is negative. It is contractionary. It is penny&hyphen;wise and pound&hyphen;foolish to the extreme. We had the opportunity of presenting in a positive and rather exciting fashion what Australia has to offer, whether it is our wines, our diamonds from the Argyle diamond mine, our opals from Coober Pedy, our technology and software programs that we are developing or, importantly, our tourism. We had the opportunity to be positive, to be forward looking, to present Australia in a proud fashion. But where are we under the leadership of the current Australian government? We are nowhere. We are not even on the playing field. That is a real indictment of the government. If they do not reverse that decision, as Peter Beattie has pointed out, it is going to be a tokenistic bid at best when the government presents its case for Expo 2002 on the Gold Coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose one positive I have seen is that originally the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, was going to present Australia's case, but that has now been given to the new Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Andrew Thomson). The fact that the Minister for Sport and Tourism has been given the job, while it may reflect some dissatisfaction with Minister Moore's ability to present Australia's case, which I must say 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regrettably I share, emphasises the significance to Australia's tourism of being a part of the exposition movement. At a time when we look like suffering a significant decline in tourism because of the economic climate, to not be a part of the European exposition movement&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARTIN" NAMEID="8I4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr Martin</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He certainly should do that. I fear, however, that that will not be put back in. In any event, it is a real tragedy. I should say that it probably reflects a wise decision on the government's part not to send Minister Moore over there. He strikes me as a very pleasant sort of fellow and he presents as probably the ultimate survivor. I would suspect that there could be a nuclear war engulfing Australia and very few creatures would survive, but I suspect that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism would be among those who does survive. He is a real survivor, but the job of industry policy is unfortunately beyond him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its election campaign this government promised to create 200,000 new manufacturing jobs. What has it done? It has taken $4 billion from industry support, it has slashed assistance to exporters&mdash;it will not even back them in the exposition movement&mdash;and it has cut research and development by $500 million. The Prime Minister got up in question time yesterday and attempted to get stuck into us because we favour an interventionist industry policy. We do so without apology and openly. We enthusiastically embrace a positive role for government and the idea of a partnership between government and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been roundly condemned by three major reports&mdash;the Mortimer report, the Goldsworthy report and the report by the Economic Intelligence Unit. All three reports had common features: we need proactive government in terms of development of industry, investment attraction subsidies, greater incentives for research and development and industry specific planning. They were common threads through all three 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12074"> reports. The government is nowhere to be found in its response. I think last week we had a reply to a question without notice from Minister Moore that he thought he might feel like responding to the Mortimer report next Monday. Next Monday is the time when parliament, all going well, will be adjourning for three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, rather than having a positive, driving mentality, as a government should have in a position of leadership, the government is a negative, shrinking and paranoid government which is not prepared to put its response on the table and let us participate in the debate. Surely as parliamentarians, rather than politicians, we all have an interest in advancing this very legitimate and very significant debate. Ideologues have not prepared these reports, but literally captains of industry who have been successful in their own enterprises are putting forward some very thoughtful and constructive suggestions for what we can do, and should be doing, as a parliament to promote industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government is negative, paranoid, shrinking and a complete vacuum when it comes to getting amongst it and getting its hands dirty. Minister Moore perhaps looks the most spic and span of any member of parliament when he comes into the House, but that is a symptom of a man who is obsessed with personal appearance and not with doing the task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In marked contrast to the Liberals, Labor has embraced the primary thrust of these three reports. Certainly, we entirely endorse the comment by Mortimer that government `should go beyond the narrow view that Australia should accept simply what the market determines'. For instance, what is going to happen over the next 12 months with the Asian economic crisis? I think all would concede that both the decrease in the demand for the products Asia is producing and the decrease in the demand for our products will mean that there is a significant overcapacity for production in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are they going to do when they fundamentally need cash? They are going to try to export themselves out of their economic difficulties. They effectively are going to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dumping their products on Australia. How does the so-called free market cope with that distortion which is going to take place over the next 12 months? This government will say that it is an event in the natural life of a market and that we should stay out of the equation and see which of our businesses survive and prosper&mdash;a policy of natural selection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the danger and real risk is that, if the government allows such a fundamental distortion of the marketplace to occur without any direction in industry policy, we risk losing some very significant industries. For instance, our motor vehicle industry will be under threat; the white goods industry, which is very important to South Australia, will be under threat; our information technology industry, which is very much in its infancy stage and subject to a real opportunity for growth, as indicated in the Goldsworthy report, will face this dumping. Again, the government does not have the means to deal with it. Unfortunately from the point of view of the Australian people, it is going to be found very much wanting, to our detriment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, Labor has a policy of strategic intervention&mdash;working in partnerships with industry in the context of mutual obligations. In consultation with industry we are going to set targets on jobs, reinvestment, export and research and development. Anyone working on any project&mdash;whether it is a paper, some productivity regime or installation of new capital equipment&mdash;will know that unless you have targets you have no motivation or excitement to work towards. In consultation with industry, Labor is looking forward in a positive, constructive and enthusiastic way to what it can do to develop industry to achieve those targets. Disappointingly, this government, unlike Labor, has absolutely no target for how it is going to bring down unemployment. That really is an inadequacy on its part and a reason that it should be condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only positives that have occurred in the area of industry policy are the result of pressure from the opposition. Indeed, Simon Crean, our shadow minister for industry and regional development, has played a significant 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12075"> role in that. For instance, the saving of the ship and book bounties was the result of opposition pressure. Maintaining protection in consultation with the car industry and the textile, footwear and clothing industries again is a result of the stance taken by the opposition. Effectively, the government had nowhere to go. As to the strengthening of an anti-dumping regime, you again have to look at the impetus of the opposition and a private member's bill moved by the opposition. The only positives in the area of industry policy have come from the opposition. Fundamentally, this government really has abrogated its national responsibility to get involved and to assist our industry to cope with and deal with a rapidly changing world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The doctrine of calculated neglect, as I call it&mdash;that is, `get out of the way and leave things to market forces'&mdash;is totally inadequate. The government is seeing that. There is no forward planning at all. For instance, the export facilitation scheme is going to expire in the year 2000. In August this year, the minister for industry advised me that the government still does not have a replacement for that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mortimer, Goldsworthy and the economic intelligence unit all stressed the need for forward planning. How are our motor vehicle component manufacturers expected to undertake planning? In a few weeks time it will be 1998. How are they expected to program themselves for after the year 2000 if the government still does not have a replacement for the export facilitation scheme? Again it is a demonstration of the inadequacy and dramatic short&hyphen;sightedness of the government. It really is a lazy, incompetent and mentally retarded government because of its adherence to a rigid dogma.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you compare what they are achieving, or not achieving, with what Labor achieved, you will see that the difference is stark. For the three years up to 1995, under Labor, Australia had 13.5 per cent economic growth; the OECD average was 6.5 per cent. According to the monthly indicators, the first time that Australia's growth rate went below the OECD growth line was under this government. That is a real indictment. We were significantly ahead of the OECD and the European Union. We are now below them. All that has occurred under this government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Growth in gross domestic product in the five quarters since the election has been only 3.2 per cent.

That is because of the government's negative, paranoid, contractionary and retarded thought process and its complete incapacity to deal with the challenges that this nation is confronting and the complex world that we now live in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These appropriation bills give me an opportunity to speak on the progress of my electorate of Eden-Monaro since the people in my electorate gave me the honour of being their representative in this parliament on 2 March 1996. In my maiden speech in this place on 2 May 1996, I said that my constituents were keen to get on with the job. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are eager to contribute to the growth of Australia's wealth. They know this is paramount in solving the many problems they have been left with. They know they cannot have the best protec 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12076"> tion for the less fortunate, for the sick and the elderly, unless we have a prosperous country. A country cannot provide those services if it is borrowing more and more.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the 20 months since the coalition came to government, we have made great progress in this regard. Much as the other side hate being reminded of it, let us go back to where we were when we came into government in March 1996. We were faced with a $10.5 billion deficit&mdash;the deficit that was supposed to be a surplus. We were also faced with a debt to government of over $90 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a number of places in my electorate, I compared that to buying a small business which had a turnover of a bit over $1 million a year, which had been losing in excess of $110,000 a year for the previous five years and which had a debt of $1 million to service. I say to a number of chambers of commerce that if you were looking at a business with that sort of record you probably would not buy it. But we did buy it because the people of Australia knew that they had to have a new proprietor of that business, and they put us in charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we took on that business, which was losing $110,000 a year, had a turnover of only $1 million and a debt to service of $1 million, and in three years we are going to turn that business into a profit&mdash;quite a remarkable achievement. You do not do that just by sitting back and hoping that you are going to sell a few more things. You have to get in and do some major reform to that business to make sure it works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you think about that small business with those sorts of characteristics, you will realise that $1 million debt alone would be costing that business around $100,000 a year in interest payments just to service that debt&mdash;not to get rid of it but simply to service it. It would probably be even more than that based on the interest rates that were around when we came into government. It would be pretty damn difficult for any sort of business with that sort of turnover to survive when it is trying to find $100,000 a year simply to service the debt. That $100,000 would be far better spent doing other things. Similarly, the $90 billion&hyphen;odd debt that we ended up with is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> costing us a fortune in interest payments, which could be better spent doing other things for the shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I use the comparison of a small business because Eden-Monaro is the sort of electorate where small business is the predominant employer. If small business is not doing well, then you are not doing well across the board. We do not have the great big corporations. The towns around Eden-Monaro survive on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made that comparison so people can understand just how bad the situation was when we came in. We are going to turn that deficit into a profit next year&mdash;a remarkable turnaround. We are able to do that because we have made some fairly major structural changes in the 20 months that we have been in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Continuing the theme of small business, small businesses have noticed in that time that the interest rates they are paying have changed dramatically. As I said in the chamber the other day in another debate, I remember that, in about 1990, my business, which was keeping 20-odd people employed, was paying 21.75 per cent on its overdraft&mdash;quite a staggering figure. The amount of money that was going out the door purely and simply to service the interest on that overdraft to keep the business going was quite remarkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we have come to government, interest rates have come down 2&half; per cent. That is a significant amount to any small businesses on the sorts of loans and overdrafts they would normally be running. I would like to see that come down a lot more. We have seen home mortgage rates come down about four per cent because there has been good competition at the home mortgage rate level. With the changes we are making in the financial system, we are creating that better competition. We will see those rates for business coming down, because competition is the only way to do it, as we have seen with home mortgage rates. But the rates have come down 2&half; per cent, which is a big plus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial relations is the other major area where we have made big changes. We would like to have gone further, but who was opposing us in that regard? The ALP, the ones who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12077"> are stopping small businesses having better flexibility with their industrial relations. Most small business owners cannot believe that the ALP are so blind to the obvious and that they are opposing the legislation to make it easier for small business employers to employ. They are holding the legislation up and opposing it all the way along the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made big steps forward in the area of red tape. We said we would reduce red tape. We have made changes to the ABS statistics and the way in which small businesses have to fill out those forms. But there is a major challenge for the states and local government to do their bit in this area because small business has to work under state government regulations and local government regulations where a lot of red tape is applied. I say to state governments and local governments: if you are going to help small business further after all the things we have done at the federal level, you need to get some of the state and local government red tape off their backs as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made changes to capital gains tax to allow rollover. The only superannuation many small businesses have is their business. They cannot afford to be putting money away. They have got it all tied up in their business. I know that only too well, because for the last 15 years that has been the case for me in my own business. When they get to retirement age, the only thing they have is that small business that they want to sell. The introduction of the capital gains tax rollover benefit is an enormous plus for small business. They will start to see the benefit of this over the next couple of years. We have introduced it, but you do not expect all small businesses to run around and retire tomorrow. People will be retiring out of small businesses gradually and they will see the benefit of that major change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party have opposed all the way along the line most of these changes we have made that benefit small business. I find that quite staggering. In opposing getting our budget deficit down, opposing getting our government debt down and opposing industrial relations, it seems that the Labor Party only want to listen to the noisy minority 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> groups and the other person pulling the strings above them&mdash;the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative that people in Eden-Monaro see to those major changes we are making is being put forward by our opponents. The only summation they can come to is that Labor are going to go back to the big spending and big borrowing regime that was there for the five years prior to them being thrown out of government. That will see interest rates up and industrial relations back to the Whitlam days&mdash;all of which is bad for small business, which will be bad for the people of Eden-Monaro.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my maiden speech I also talked about some of the major issues that were prominent at the time and had been for a number of years. One of them down in the south-east corner of my electorate is the timber industry where we saw year after year political decision after political decision. The conclusion to that was the increasing demise of a great industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the first things we did very soon after we came to government was restore the woodchip export licences that had been cruelly taken away by the former Labor government. We had a situation where there was timber to be accessed, but there was no point in accessing it because there were not the licences available. They had been stopped and reduced to a point where it was not profitable for those companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We changed that but, unfortunately, enormous damage had been already done by the time we came to government. As one business in my electorate said, they had an agreement, which was signed by the Prime Minister of the day and by the Premier of the state of the day, making certain guarantees through to the year 2009, but it was not worth the paper it was printed on. It was quite an amazing situation. They say, `How can you explain to overseas clients that you have a guarantee in writing from the Prime Minister and from the Premier, but you can't deliver?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another Prime Minister came along and said, `No, we renege on that.' So those clients overseas went elsewhere and started to source markets in other parts of the world. It has damaged our reputation almost irreparably. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12078"> was an outrageous thing that occurred at the time and it had a devastating effect on a major part of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are attempting to recover some of that trade through the regional forest agreement process which is currently under way, but certainly I continue to have some concerns in that regard because the state government have a different agenda. They do not want to put the priority in the science area; they want to put the priority in the political area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw the regional forest agreement in the south-east of New South Wales pre-empted a year ago by the Labor Premier of New South Wales. He went off declaring national parks when this process was only halfway through. The scientific process was to do all the flora, fauna and economic assessments and then come up with a solution at the end. But halfway through the process, what did the Premier do? He declared a whole heap of national parks and pre-empted the process. That is not scientific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as a federal government, are determined to get a scientific outcome. We will be putting forward the socioeconomic studies as a major priority in the final negotiation of this RFA because many communities in the south-east depend on that industry. We can have a great reserve system. We can conserve the areas that need conserving; we can also have a very sustainable industry as well. I am determined to see a scientific outcome rather than a political outcome in that regional forest agreement, which will probably be finalised sometime early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address a few other matters in the Monaro part of my electorate, which has been doing it very tough over the last four or five years. It has had virtually four or five years of drought. Even though, it still produces a great product&mdash;some of the best fine wool in the country. Many farmers are doing it hard. We are currently working with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to, hopefully, get some assistance for some of those people who have been doing it very tough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an unusual area and it is a very difficult area to put the science together to see exactly what the impact has been, but I am 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pleased to say that we are getting there. After a lot of frustration from the New South Wales government not providing the sort of information that was necessary&mdash;it told us three months ago it was not available&mdash;in the last few days a lot more information has been able to be provided by the state government so that the minister can make a scientific and logical decision about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is growing confidence in that area of the Monaro as well, which is very good. I was in Cooma last Friday night talking with many people. Bank managers have been as busy in the last three months as they have been in years. That is great for a regional town which relies fairly heavily on the rural climate around it. One thing that has given great confidence to that town was the announcement some weeks ago of a new export meatworks in Cooma&mdash;over $10 million worth of private investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These investment decisions are now being made because the private sector are feeling confident about the future. They see the foundation work that we as a federal government have done in the last 20 months in creating the right climate for investment. It is only that investment and that wealth creating that will produce those real jobs that we and the people in Eden-Monaro want to see for their kids in the future. The new export meatworks is a great confidence booster for Cooma. It will be up and running in the early part of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will mention briefly the dairy industry, which is also a major industry in my electorate. It is also going very well. Bega Cheese has really gone well in the last couple of years in the export market. It is taking advantage of the liberalisation that we are doing in the trade area. A number of populist people around the place think that you have to put up barriers. The ALP want to put up barriers when it suits them politically. But that industry is seeing the benefit of that liberalisation across the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has to export most of what it produces. Our population is very small. So we are the great winners in that liberalisation of trade across the world. Bega Cheese is now exporting something like $15 million worth of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12079"> cheese a year to 25 countries. That has all happened only in the last couple of years. It is also looking at great expansions&mdash;big new investment&mdash;in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have a great deal of time left to go through all the other parts of my region. In fisheries we have made reforms to the South East Fishery to sort out the problems that the Labor Party just would not touch. Tourism is coming along very well along the coast, in the mountains and in the Australian capital region outside Canberra. They are all linking together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quickly want to mention youth unemployment, which has been a problem area. It is this growth in industry which is really going to be the final solution to that. The work for the dole scheme that we introduced has gone down very well in the electorate. Once again I cannot believe that the Labor Party opposed that because the majority of people support it. They think it is only fair that people who are taking taxpayers' money via welfare should do something in return. It keeps a work ethic there for those people. It gives them something to aspire to and helps them look for real jobs later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are fortunate to have work for the dole scheme projects in my electorate, right along the coast and up in the mountains. That is a very positive thing. Apprenticeships and traineeships are all part of that strategy to get young people from school into work before they fall into the unemployment queues and then have difficulty getting out of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very excited about the future for my electorate. The foundation work we have done in the past 20 months will provide the strong base for growth and development in the coming years. It is remarkable that we have been able to achieve what we have in such a short time, considering what we inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember, we inherited virtually a bankrupt business, one that had been losing the equivalent of more than 10 per cent of its annual turnover each year for the past five years. We are turning that into a profitable business within three years. That will benefit the shareholders&mdash;the Australian people, my constituents in Eden-Monaro.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most remarkable thing is that the Labor Party has opposed the very moves that are fixing the problem all the way. The people of Eden-Monaro are staggered that the Labor Party would try to prevent us putting the budget into surplus. They are staggered that the Labor Party have opposed our debt reduction, because debt reduction means less taxpayers' money being spent on interest repayments and more being spent on services. Why would they oppose that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Eden-Monaro are staggered that the Labor Party would oppose industrial relations reform. The people want it to be easier to employ people. So why is the Labor Party opposing that? The people of Eden-Monaro could not believe that the Labor Party opposed the work for the dole scheme; they could not believe the ALP opposed cracking down on welfare rorters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I said in another contribution recently that John Howard must just cringe each time he thinks about the extent to which he won the

What has happened now&mdash;and it has been reflected in the polls&mdash;is that John Howard, the Prime Minister, lifted the high bar so high, expectations were just so high when he came to office, that his dismal contribution to fixing those problems has left Australians very disappointed. That is why he has been able to squander such a large lead in the polls and now finds himself lagging as the preferred Prime Minister of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On Tuesday, 18 November, I was ejected from this House for 24 hours. That was okay, but it denied me an opportunity to speak on the bill that proposes to privatise the national transmission network. The national transmission network carries television and radio signals for the ABC, SBS, some commercial radio and television stations, and community  services such as Radio for the Print Handicapped. But, unfortunately, its network does not reach all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in rural and regional Australia do not receive SBS television, Triple J radio or the ABC radio's Classic FM. Indeed, many people in my electorate do not receive these services which other people take for granted&mdash;for example, residents in the Wollombi Valley as well as people in the Muswellbrook, Scone, Merriwa, Murrurundi and Quirindi local government areas. I will tell the House that, when the FA Cup or World Cup soccer championships are on SBS television, it is pretty frustrating for residents of Wollombi Valley and for those who live in the Upper Hunter. They find it most distressing that they are not given the opportunity to watch these very significant sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I have to ask myself is this: will the sale of the national transmission network enhance the prospects of these areas getting SBS television coverage in the future? Indeed, will they ever receive SBS television if the sale of the network goes through? Certainly, the planned sale has already had an impact on the prospects of the people of the Wollombi Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in Wollombi were so close to getting SBS television that they could taste it. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> These are the same residents who are fighting to retain their local licensed post office, who have no banking services at all, who have only a limited mobile phone network and little of anything else&mdash;but they do have a great community spirit. I promise the government that, with my support, these residents will continue to fight for these basic services, whether the government proceeds with its fire sale or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But the residents of Wollombi were to get their SBS coverage. Negotiations with land-holders to run the relevant powerlines, et cetera, across properties were well advanced and a timetable for the installation of the service was in place. What happened? Unfortunately, one of the land-holders decided he did not want the cable running across his property after all. That is his right, and we respect that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that means that the National Transmission Agency now needs to go to another land-holder and begin negotiations all over again. What has happened? The National Transmission Agency has written to the secretary of the Wollombi Progress Association, Mrs Francisca Maul. I might digress and say that Francisca runs a very successful tourist accommodation facility in the Wollombi area&mdash;an award winning accommodation house known as Mulla Villa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Transmission Agency has written to Mrs Maul informing her that, because of the pending sale of the network, the National Transmission Agency is no longer in a position to begin new negotiations with a new land-holder. I do not know why this matter cannot be dealt with by novation or some similar method. The National Transmission Agency must have contractual arrangements in place with other entities. Surely, the proposed sale should not stand in the way of the people in Wollombi with respect to their SBS coverage. But it has. I have written to the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) and asked him to have a look at the case. I implore him to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What about the prospects of the people of the Upper Hunter? They are looking very grim indeed. I understand there are about 24 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12081"> regions in the country that still do not have SBS coverage. I further understand that the Upper Hunter is about No. 23 out of the 24 on the priority list. Again, I have to ask myself whether the sale of the network is likely to enhance their prospects. Is it likely that a privatised carrier is going to have any real interest in extending services to what must be non-profitable areas like the Upper Hunter&mdash;large and thinly populated areas like the Upper Hunter? It is just like all the arguments we went through with respect to the Telstra sale. Is the trigger going to be there to provide the incentives for the private sector to extend services into rural and regional Australia? I fear not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These are regions that have already suffered so much since the election of the Howard government. They have been whacked by child&hyphen;care funding cuts, labour market program cuts, cuts to public hospital funding, the abolition of the dental health program, cuts to the national highway program, and so the list goes on. I will have something else to say about the national highway program a bit later on, if I get the time, following the now minister's effort in question time yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I have written to Minister Alston on the Wollombi Valley issue and I have taken the opportunity to raise the Upper Hunter issue with him as well. Once again, I implore him to look specifically at the Wollombi issue, which I think can be so easily fixed. It would take one phone call to the National Transmission Agency to tell them to get on with their negotiations with the new land-holder, regardless of the sale. I would have thought that would be very easy to deal with, and he would be doing the residents of Wollombi a great service. By the way, the residents of Wollombi do not vote for me. I only got about 22 per cent of the vote at Wollombi. So I could probably argue that they are his own people. I implore him to not only have a look at the Wollombi case but also have a look at the situation in the Upper Hunter where people again do not enjoy SBS coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said when I began that, on 18 November, I was suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. That followed a rather

Here was the Prime Minister portraying himself as the friend of the coalminer. Indeed, there probably would never have been a dispute at Hunter Valley No. 1 if it were not for the Workplace Relations Act. What hypocrisy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the Prime Minister and this is the minister for workplace relations who condone the tactics of intimidation and harassment adopted by both Arco and Rio Tinto&mdash;tactics that we recently saw exposed on Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program; tactics that have no place in Australian society; tactics that have stress levels in Upper Hunter and Hunter households at boiling point; and tactics that are forcing miners' wives to write to the Prime Minister, pleading with him to back off with respect to his stand on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do they get from the Prime Minister? No response, in effect. They get a response from some obscure bureaucrat in his office, informing them that he has passed on

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. Earlier in the week on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> , Prime Minister, you were asked whether a native title claim could have any chance of affecting suburban backyards. You said, `I don't think that suburban freehold is in any way affected. I think that is the law, but I am not certain.' Have you seen a most useful booklet released by Senator Herron 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebutting the myths: some facts about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs</EMPHASIS> ? Have you seen page 16 of the booklet, which lists the following myth, `My backyard isn't safe from an Aboriginal claim'? It then goes on to describe the facts&mdash;and, remember, this is from Senator Herron. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, the High Court of Australia . . . said that native title had been extinguished by inconsistent grants such as freehold. Most private houses and backyards are on freehold land where a native title claim cannot succeed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Prime Minister, why do you continue to peddle the falsehood when your own Aboriginal affairs minister says it is a myth?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="12082" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am absolutely delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question. I have not read that booklet, but I have read your interview on John Laws this morning. Your interview on John Laws contains a number of very revealing admissions. Let us go back a week ago, while I was overseas in Vancouver. Senator Minchin and the Deputy Prime Minister quite rightly said that for more abundant caution the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  should confirm what we all believe the law to be, and that is that the grant of a title conferring exclusive possession should be regarded as having extinguished native title. The Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Minchin did not start a fear campaign about backyards. The Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Minchin were stating the fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find absolutely fascinating, in the light of the Leader of the Opposition's gyrations on this subject, is that last week he was saying it was a fear campaign and this morning on the John Laws program he said that it would be all right to have a clause that ruled out native title in a suburban backyard. That is what he said. Let me just go through the transcript. This is Laws, `What I am saying, Kim, if the content was simply freehold extinguishes native title, would you sign it?' `In backyards, yes, obviously,' comes back the answer. You were saying that last week we were running a fear campaign. Now you are saying that you would be perfectly happy to agree to a clause that confirms what we last week wanted to confirm.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12083">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me go on one step further. What the Leader of the Opposition failed to realise this morning when he made that admission is that, if you are to be consistent with the decision of the High Court in Wik, if you really understand the decision of the High Court in Wik, you will not only say, `Let us have a confirmatory clause that rules it out on suburban backyards,' but go one step further and say, `Let us have a confirmatory clause that rules it out where any title granting an exclusive possession to the titleholder operates.' That is what the High Court decided in Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court did not say in the Wik decision that the grant of freehold alone extinguishes native title. What the High Court said in the Wik decision is that the grant of any title conferring exclusive possession extinguished native title. That includes not only suburban freehold but also commercial leasehold. It includes the residential leaseholds that operate here in the Australian Capital Territory. It includes many agricultural leaseholds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I find the admission of the Leader of the Opposition this morning absolutely extraordinary. What he was really saying, until this morning, was that it is absolutely unnecessary to have any clause dealing with freehold or any other title that confers exclusive possession. Now he is saying that it is perfectly okay to have it. I will tell you why it is perfectly okay to have it now. He realises that the campaign that he was running last week was absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that throughout the whole course of this debate the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have argued that we ought to uphold the Wik decision. So, if you want to uphold the Wik decision, what you have to do is have a clause in the amendment bill that confirms that, wherever a grant of exclusive possession has taken place, that operates to extinguish native title. That is the purpose of our legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way that you can give absolute certainty is to amend the law&mdash;to pass an act of the Australian parliament that confirms the law as laid down in the Wik decision. If you are really serious about looking after suburban 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> backyards, you will also look after the backyards in Canberra, you will look after all the agricultural leases that confer exclusive possession and you will look after all the other titles that were intended to be looked after by the Wik decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I know that, representing the electorate that he does, he would be very proud of the fact that, as Christmas approaches this year, as a result of the government's economic policies home buyers in his electorate will on average be paying $3,000 less in mortgage interest payments. As retail trade picks up and as we saw in the national accounts yesterday, the Australian economy will be growing at one of the fastest, if not the fastest, rates in the developed world. As a consequence, inflation is now back to the lowest level it has been in Australia since 1962. Home mortgage rates, at present around six per cent, a little over the standard variable, are the lowest they have been since 1969&mdash;since man walked on the moon. Australian families are the great winners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1994-95 the Australian economy was unable to sustain four per cent growth because our current account deficit had blown out to over six per cent of GDP. Inflation had gone up from 1.9 to 4.5 per cent. As a result, the Reserve Bank increased interest rates to slow the economy at the end of 1994. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12084"> raised interest rates by 2&frac34; per cent. If this government had just sat there and done nothing, we would have remained in that position. We would have remained unable to get the Australian growth rate up to four per cent and sustain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big structural shift in the economy was this government's utter determination to take Australia out of the path of deficit and debt and put Australia back into the black again. One of the greatest achievements of this government is that we will be to say that last year, this year, next year and the year after this government will not be borrowing. We will not be driving Australia into debt. We will not be running up obligations for our children. We will be repaying Keating&hyphen;Beazley Labor debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a magnificent achievement. We will be repaying the Keating-Beazley Labor debt and making sure that we bring down the interest payments on that debt&mdash;interest payments of $9,000 million a year. Think about it. The Australian taxpayer has to pay $9,000 million a year to service the Keating&hyphen;Beazley Labor debt. That is $9,000 million a year they cannot spend on their roads. It is $9,000 million a year they cannot spend on their hospitals. It is $9,000 million a year they cannot spend on their schools. As we bring back the Australian accounts the opportunities for Australia will be so much more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one regrettable thing over the course of this year is the utter failure of the Labor Party to come to grips with economic policy. We would have hoped that over the course of the year they would have learned something. We have the member for Hotham, who wants to make the economy uncompetitive so he can cash out benefits with tariffs and rents and tax syndicates for selected friends. We have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has given his name to a new science&mdash;the science of `Garynomics'. We have a Leader of the Opposition who is dreaming of nationalising telephone companies, taking us back to the days of Chifley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have probably only two people on the front bench of the Labor Party who have any inkling of economic policy. One is the member for Melbourne, the great lion of the Left, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who is at least thinking seriously about economic policy&mdash;seriously enough to warn the Australian Labor Party not to go on a trip down memory lane with Pauline Hanson. For that we salute him. We have the great lion of the Right, who is trying to understand economic policy, the member for Werriwa, who does actually have some good ideas but he just doesn't have the strength to put them out. As Alan Wood reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 22 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of Labor's bright young hopes, Mark Latham, has been heard to remark to colleagues, `oppositions are allowed to be irresponsible'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he at least knows what ought to be done but believes that they should be irresponsible about it. Then we have the prize economic recruit to the Australian Labor Party. Peter Walsh, where are you when you are most needed? He used to describe the Australian Democrats as `the fairies at the bottom of the garden'. Well, the fairies have now stormed the citadel and taken over the Labor leadership. Senator Cheryl Kernot&mdash;who will always be remembered for a press release on 24 July 1997&mdash;is now the economic adviser to the Labor Party. Her press release was headed, `Low inflation means high unemployment'. So what we ought to do, according to her, is get inflation ripping again. That is what we need in this country&mdash;another bout of inflation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, are reforms to trade practices law which will protect small business from exploitation by some larger businesses progressing as planned by the government? When can small business expect to see these proposals made law? Are there any reasons for small businesses to be concerned at the possibility of delays or changes to these reforms? Have similar proposals in the past been delayed or abandoned? If so, by whom and why? Small business operators in my electorate of Paterson, and indeed across the Hunter, have these genuine concerns and need reassurance after being abandoned by Labor for the last 13 years.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="12085" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Workplace Relations and Small Business" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Paterson for his question. I acknowledge the strong representative voice he provides for the small business community in the Hunter region. It must be a refreshing change for them to have someone who is prepared to walk into the parliament and be pro&hyphen;small business for a change. As we go to Christmas, there is good news for the small business community. The House of Representatives has passed the small business law which the government has advocated to give a better deal for the small business community. They have waited 13 long years to see that happen, so obviously it is a very important step in providing a much better deal for them. I am 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pleased to be able to inform the House that the government is on track to achieve our objective, and that is to have a 1 July 1998 start&hyphen;up date for this new law to provide this new protection for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member in his question implied&mdash;even if he did not say it explicitly&mdash;whether anybody was standing in the way of this sensible reform. Sadly, the truth of the matter is that the Labor Party stands in the way of achieving this important reform. It is disappointing because when we brought down the package they basically said that it was a good idea. Since then they have been playing catch&hyphen;up politics&mdash;just for the sake of doing and saying something they are now running a series of amendments which are basically designed to derail the government's tremendous package for the small business community. It is very interesting to hear what they have to say about their amendments. It really is a bit of a corker. I quote from the shadow minister who, on one aspect of our reforms, said in the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would replace that with the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition of a small business. Why? We have been in discussion with some of the major corporations in this country that have small businesses as part of their tenancy arrangements. We have been talking to Lend Lease and to Westfield.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are entitled to speak to representatives from those two great Australian companies, but it is a bit like them saying that they have a passive policy of assistance for the small business community. You have to wonder how the Labor Party in advocating amendments can say, `We are moving these because big business have told us that it is going to be really good for small business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at their proposals. The Australian Retailers Association estimates that 70 per cent of retailers in regional suburban shopping centres would be excluded from our proposition if Labor's amendment got up. Labor are proposing an amendment which is being pushed by the big business community and which big business say would be good for small business&mdash;and 70 per cent of small businesses would miss out in regional suburban areas. I am told by the Australian Hotels Association that over 4,000 small business persons who own a hotel would be excluded 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12086"> if Labor's amendment got up. This is not a pro&hyphen;small business policy; they are actually trying to derail our package and explicitly trying to remove a benefit for the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets worse. The Labor proposals would even take away from some businesses the existing rights that they have under the Trade Practices Act. Not only would you remove opportunities for protection of small business under our package, but you would actually deprive people of existing  rights. It is absolutely incredible. Their retail tenancy proposals are full of loopholes. Do you know who gets the benefit of the loopholes? The landlords. These people opposite are a standing joke in the small business community. The member for Newcastle summed it up very well. He said to the House that, when Labor was in place:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and I would say to him that this is a blatant rort of Medicare by the New South Wales Labor government and we do not intend to tolerate it. Medicare agreements have very specific provisions. People have to be admitted on the basis of clinical need. People elect at the beginning whether they go public or private and only change for unforeseen circumstances, not foreseen circumstances. Thirdly, Medicare agreements have prohibitions against cost shifting and this is a blatant cost shift by the state onto the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also means that we have, effectively, a two&hyphen;tier system of health whereby, if you can afford it, you get special treatment or faster treatment and, if you cannot, you do not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have written this morning to Andrew Refshauge, asking for an explanation of the circumstances around this event. I would say to him that the simple fact is that we will not tolerate Medicare paying for surgeons and we will not tolerate Medicare paying for pathology and radiology when these should be paid for, under the hospital agreement, by the New South Wales government. Given the protestations of New South Wales that they do not cost shift, they have been caught out here quite blatantly. The Commonwealth has very substantial powers to address this.

I understand that the minister does intend to approach his counterparts in the state and territory ministries to arrange an early national response by government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key points arising from the Australian Animal Health Council report are that the theory proposed by the New South Wales interests that national eradication of Johnes disease in sheep is achievable through a voluntary destocking program has proven, on a wider objective evaluation, to be very problematical. Clarification of the feasibility of the destocking&hyphen;based eradication theory will require more in depth examination of a range of technical, economic and management questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a strong argument has certainly been advanced against a do nothing approach. A consensus has emerged for a cooperative national approach to managing Johnes disease in sheep. A market assurance program and better diagnostic technologies are clear priorities for national funding. The Australian Animal Health Council has proposed an integrated program of follow&hyphen;up studies, to determine the soundest option for a national management strategy. These will take 12 months to complete. The issue, therefore, arises as to whether the New South Wales

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Aston for his question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, there has been some discussion publicly about what the Labor Party might do in this regard&mdash;and I have referred to it previously&mdash;the former finance minister Peter Walsh said that the only result of Labor's policies would be an increase of general taxation and `that would take money from, among other things, low income families with few assets and dependent kids'.

Members of the House may be aware that the New South Wales government, within the last couple of days, have admitted the failure of their education and training policies by abolishing an education department which they themselves established. They are looking for reasons to explain this, and they blame the Commonwealth. Nobody in New South Wales is being fooled by this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even those who run education policy in New South Wales&mdash;the New South Wales Teachers Federation&mdash;are saying that this is an admission of failure by the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government has failed in pushing ahead as rapidly as it should with its reforms to the apprenticeship and traineeship system. It has failed in reporting to parents on school results.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, Mr Aquilina, has stated that the changes have been necessary because the Commonwealth has reduced funding to TAFE and schools in New South Wales.

I would also highlight the upgrade of the Pacific Highway, on which I understand the Prime Minister may be travelling over the Christmas 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period. We are going to continue in that 10&hyphen;year program to upgrade the Pacific Highway where over 1,600 people have been killed in the last 10 years, and we are going to improve that. The New England Highway is also being improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that, in the coming week, in partnership with the road transport industry, many members from both sides of this House will be supporting the forthcoming RTF Drive for Safety promotion. I understand that the shadow minister is also going to participate in that promotion, which is wholeheartedly supported by this government and the road transport sector. Next year the government shall also hold a national road safety summit to bring together experts in the community to plan our national strategy for the next century. A national road toll of no more than 1,600 should be possible if all parties work together following on from the good results that have been achieved over the last couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would encourage members to get the message out to the community, to make a conscious effort towards a safer holiday season.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and I thank him for being a first&hyphen;class Chief Government Whip for the government parties. I am pleased to be able to say to the House that today we continue the reforms of the processes of the House. We are at this task all the time. If somebody has a good idea and we think that it will help the House, then we usually take it up. And that was another example. The member for Longman, one of our new members&mdash;a first&hyphen;class representative of the people of Longman&mdash;is evidence of the talent and depth that we enjoy in the coalition parties&mdash;and I had better now mention the rest! Today we made small changes in one sense but they are big changes if you think it is important to give members an opportunity to speak for their constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have provided, for example, an adjournment debate in the Main Committee. So that is six additional opportunities on a Thursday. We have also taken up the novel idea of constituency statements. Mr Speaker, to show you how reasonable we are, that was actually a proposition from the member for Chifley&mdash;a very good fellow. He ought to be on the front bench. They have got one decent member and where do they put him? As far back as they possibly can! This is in a long line of good changes that we have made. We abolished the hated Keating roster system. We brought back question time to 2 o'clock. Members will remember that Keating did not want question time televised. Keating put it on at 3 o'clock because he knew that the ABC, if they had a choice between question time and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS>, would always show <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS>. So we make question time available to people who are interested in the affairs of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Labor Party the Procedure Committee toiled away at good reports to make suggestions and they would give them to the now Leader of the Opposition, the then Leader of the House. What did he do with them? He would put them in a back drawer and forget about them. We said to the Procedure Committee, `Go back over every report 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the Labor Party ditched and pull out all the good ideas and we will implement them,' and we did. We provided for a citizens right of reply, a very important sensible reform promoted and initiated by none other than the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members who were only around when Labor was in have probably never appreciated what it is like to have ministers who get up and answer questions. We have had that. The statistics tell the story. Cynicism is so rife on the other side that they respond as they do, but we should look at the statistics. The total number of questions asked this year&mdash;we will have a couple to add on&mdash;is 470. Last year&mdash;the 1996 election year&mdash;it was 1,150. So that is another 300 for this year. Compared with the 1993 election year under Labor&mdash;it was 1,150 under us&mdash;it was 429. That was when former Prime Minister Keating used to say, `Question time is an indulgence that the executive gives to the opposition.' Not only would they not answer the questions but they were riddled with contempt for the parliament at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, we need to do better to keep answers succinct and clear as, of course, we work to, but we are saints compared with the other side. The average length of question and answer in 1992 was 5.8 minutes. The average length of question and answer in 1997 was 3.8 minutes. Just to cap it off, in March this year, when talking about higher standards, the member for Chifley said that he had some good ideas and he was going to advance them to the government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I do look forward with keen anticipation to the Leader of the House bringing forward new standing orders that would reflect the promises made to the people of Australia for higher standards . . . </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question because it gives me an opportunity to remind him and to remind the House that under my government more has been done to remove the threat of violence in the Australian community than under any other federal government in Australian history, not only in terms of the historic gun reform laws but also the campaign that we have launched against the scourge of domestic violence in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very warmly welcome the opportunity of saying something about the views that I and the members of my government hold about violence as a solution to problems in the Australian community. I genuinely take the opportunity of saying that, in all aspects of life in Australia, my government&mdash;and I hope 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the opposition&mdash;will always abhor the use of violence as a solution to disputes. It has no place in the Australian way. It has no place in the resolution of disputes in Australia. We are a law&hyphen;abiding community. My view strongly is that the laws of this country in relation to all activities, be they  industrial activities or personal activities, should be observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problem of the Leader of the Opposition is that he cannot reconcile himself to the fact that the legal framework for industrial relations has changed forever under this government. It has changed forever in favour of more productive outcomes. It has changed forever in favour of outcomes that benefit employees. It has changed forever against the tyranny of union thugs. It has changed forever against the personal intimidation of compulsory unionism. It has changed forever against tilting the balance in favour of those people who would be unproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one group in the Australian community that the Labor Party always goes into bat for when push comes to shove&mdash;they forget about the unemployed, they forget about the battlers and they forget about the Australian national interest&mdash;it is the industrial elite of the Australian community and the members of the maritime union of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to have in front of me a list of average weekly full&hyphen;time adult total earnings produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in February 1997. It shows for all industries that the average is $38,110 a year. For P&amp;O waterfront workers, it shows figures of up to $124,228 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't it amazing? Can't you just imagine the amazement of the unemployed, the amazement of the low paid battler in the western suburbs of Sydney or in any of the other low socioeconomic suburbs of Australia? Can't you wonder their amazement at the disconnect between the Australian Labor Party and their interests and the utter instantaneous embrace of the interests of the wharfies whenever those interests are in any way questioned or threatened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it very clear that my government supports in full the application of the rigour of Australian law against any violent behaviour&mdash;whether it occurs domestically, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12098"> whether it occurs in the community or whether it occurs anywhere on the industrial scene. I remind those who sit opposite that the only two Australian Prime Ministers who have used the armed forces of this country to settle industrial disputes have been Ben Chifley and Bob Hawke. The last time I checked, they belonged to the Australian Labor Party. I am proud of my government's industrial relations reform, and I will be even prouder when those reforms lead to a more productive and beneficial Australian waterfront to the true benefit of the Australian national interest.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 November 1997, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tabled in the House of Representatives on 27 June 1997. The Government had earlier in the Parliament affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports presented during the present Parliament within three months of their presentation and to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's commitment follows the undertaking by successive Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and Government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 27 June 1997. It also lists reports for which the House has received no Government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives. The Government's responses to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We on this side of the House all recollect last year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) getting up in an extraordinary performance in which he boasted the record of his government for their first 10 months in office. I recollect on the way out calling upon him at that stage to make it an annual report. So pumped up and ebullient was he that he said, `Well, absolutely. What a good thing to do. I'll be in here annually.' He is not. There is no particular secret as to why that would be so. Look at the quote he made last year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In looking to the future, we know that we have established a secure base camp as we climb a high mountain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I venture to suggest that we have no progress report this year because in the intervening year the Prime Minister has set off from his base camp, lost five climbers off the first precipice and half his climbing gear, been cut off by a blizzard, been forced to skin and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> barbecue the huskies and turned around to see his fellow climbers&mdash;two of them in particular&mdash;heading off back down the mountain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a very bad year&mdash;a bad year symbolised by three press quotes. The first is from an excellent article by Lindsay Olney in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Republican</EMPHASIS> headed `Travelling PM on the last train to Klutzville':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The images lingers still: Howard rained out of his long awaited day at the cricket, Howard tripping in the White House Rose Garden, Howard boring Shirley McLaine to sleep, Howard going inexplicably to the baseball to meet an Australian relief pitcher for the Yankees who was four times his size and not even playing that day . . . so it went on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who can forget Howard picking up a model of a new car only to have it fall apart in his hands? Then Hugh McKay said a little later in the year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three characteristics Australians seek in their political leaders are strength, integrity and inspiration. One of their great disappointments is that, on all three counts, Howard appears to be falling short.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, Paul Kelly&mdash;and this was after the devastation of his government and seven ministers gone in 20 months. There has never been a record of that in any history of governance in this country in our century's tradition. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard leads a government that is staggering under its own incompetence. This suggests a depth of political and administrative ineptitude that is generic rather than specific. It brings to a climax much of the private complaint from those who deal with this government that it lacks either the process or the talent to master the issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All three of those quotes go to the heart of what is the failure of this government. It starts with the failure of leadership; the failure of understanding good public policy; the failure of understanding due process. This is a government that is an opposition. The fundamental weakness of this government all boils down to this: it is a government of attitudes, not policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw a demonstration again in question time today of their attitudes&mdash;not their process&mdash;in relation to industrial relations. There is not a decent set of public policy prescriptions. It is a case of cheating a little, harbouring obviously within their ranks probably 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12106"> direct initiatives and certainly direct sympathies for activities that are completely un&hyphen;Australian and unprecedented such that one group of Australians, having been purged from the defence forces, probably completely unnecessarily&mdash;or in the process of being so purged&mdash;are inveigled into setting themselves up in the Middle East in order to be brought back in to wreck the lives of other ordinary Australians. It is a government of division, a government without process, a government of total indecency when it comes to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three events of this week symbolise this government. The first is the complete inability of this government to arrive at a just and decent outcome in relation to its native title legislation&mdash;workable legislation in relation to native title that gives all players certainty. There has been a complete inability to do that. Secondly, we have had the 12th backflip on nursing homes in the space of about eight months&mdash;a completely incompetent policy process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third is that which we have been discussing during today's question time, where we teased out more and more the fact that the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) obviously has an operation going on beneath him in his show. He has no understanding of the appropriate severance arrangements and what is required of Defence Force personnel when they are on leave but still connected with the Defence Force. The minister has absolutely no comprehension of that. But, as far as all those opposite are concerned, they are prepared to stand up and cheer it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental problem this country's citizens have in terms of confidence is a sense of insecurity. Where is the security in all these three things? Where is the security for people in their old age? Where is the security for that generation which fought World War II&mdash;this government are always interested in wrapping themselves in the flag&mdash;and made sacrifices for this nation? They have operated according to one set of understandings of what their life in retirement will be like and have now been spat on by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so far as we believe the polls&mdash;and they are getting better and better&mdash;suffice it to say that in the last election that generation record 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed a 66 per cent vote for this government. That makes this a double betrayal. There is at least one thing that we in politics ought to be left with, and that is a sense of gratitude for those who support you. Sheer basic gratitude would have put those opposite in a position where they would have done something decent about that but, no, that was not to be&mdash;no, we will not have any of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to this other issue, that related to native title, earlier in the week. Can members recollect seeing the Prime Minister sitting there on television earlier this week with a map of Australia, saying that a brown stain would spread across that map unless his urgent procedures were put in place and that what this means is veto? That was the word he used. That statement was an absolute, unmitigated untruth! There is no veto!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one veto in any form of land tenure in this country on mining activities&mdash;only one&mdash;and that is the Western Australian freehold title. The Western Australian freehold title does give freeholders the right to veto mining activities on their property. That is all&mdash;no more. Nothing associated with native title produces a veto, but that is how the Prime Minister started this debate&mdash;with attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things we understand about this Prime Minister is that at some point in time he always says the right thing. At some point in time there is a set of words that we can point to and say that was the right thing to say. He said, `On the waterfront we'd never use troops. Absolutely; we'd never use troops on the waterfront. I would never do that.' That is the right thing to say, a good thing to say. What do we find? He is in it up to his gills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister starts off this native title arrangement by saying, `I'm going to talk to all sides. I'm going to get an agreement that is fair and reasonable. That is what I am going to do. I'm going to get a workable, fair and reasonable agreement that represents all sides.' That is where he started off, and he put in place 10 points. We had our seven points out before his. There are coincidences between the two. There were points of agree 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12107"> ment between us and the government at that time when we started down that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened then was government by attitude&mdash;not government by good public policy or decent process. We know what the legal advice of this government is. We know that the position the Prime Minister was ultimately forced into on native title by his backbench&mdash;and his rabid, anxious, angry National Party backbench, who see their support frittering away in Queensland&mdash;is a position which cannot be upheld. The Prime Minister abdicated leadership in this country in favour of his backbench to produce a solution that he knows, if it goes through, the High Court will fix up&mdash;of course. They would fix it up and then, hiding behind the High Court, he would say, `We thought it was the best thing to do at the time, but this is what the High Court has done', with uncertainty for miners a couple of years out, uncertainty for pastoralists a couple of years out and uncertainty for native title holders a couple of years out as they are all set in a bearpit to fight amongst themselves over the meaning of this legislation and whether or not it actually reflects due process in the acquisition of somebody's title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister junked this piece of legislation into the Senate and told them to sort it out and now wraps himself with the threat of a double dissolution as he stands out there. What we know is underpinning all this&mdash;and we know it absolutely; it is not a matter of speculation on our part&mdash;is that his principal legal advisers have told him that the bill is unconstitutional and that the bill, if it has any chance of succeeding, has to collapse the Racial Discrimination Act. We know that his advisers have told him those two things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time a few conscience&hyphen;ridden people on the government's back bench ask the Prime Minister, as does the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), in their caucus meetings as to  the status of that advice, and they are given, it has to be said, equally as evasive answers as we get in this House. But we know these facts. We know that the bad process in relation to this legislation will result in people being pitched into conflict with each other, and the Prime Minister does 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not care. This is a Prime Minister who thrives on the division of this nation. What this nation needs above all is unity. And it needs good public policy process. And it needs good administration, competent administration. But what it gets from this Prime Minister and this government are shonkiness and shoddiness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go through the extraordinary record of this government during this year of lost ministers, including in the small business area. It has to be said that in all of these losses there is a silver lining. We managed to get Labor's small business policy out of the loss of the last minister. That was a pretty good achievement. From the pressure that we have managed to put on this Prime Minister, we have actually managed to get about half of the Labor Party's industry policy out of him. We will get about another quarter more on Monday when he announces the manufacturing in bond issues and some of our initiatives in the information technology area. We will get that out of him then. We get a bit of good public policy, provided we sit on him hard enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have not yet been able&mdash;I am afraid to say, and confess failure to the Australian people&mdash;to get out of him good public policy as far as nursing homes are concerned. We have had to put up with this Prime Minister and his various minions, as they come into this place, standing up and saying here that there is a crisis of capital funding in nursing homes. If you were a man from Mars and came down here to inspect the processes of this nation and heard the leadership of the nation standing up and saying that there is a crisis in administration at least in capital programs in nursing homes in this country, you would expect to be able to turn to the budget papers and see reflected in those budget papers evidence of the desperate struggle&mdash;evidence of public funding being pushed up and the minister saying, `Oh, I feel so helpless. We have to do more. And the only way to do it is to soak these old folk coming into the nursing homes.' You would expect to see that in this exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, what do we see? We see the opposite&mdash;$500 million out: `How do we address a crisis? We eliminate public spend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12108"> ing.' That is a pretty interesting mechanism. They could have at least had the decency to get up and use some other basis for the argument. But you must not expect that anybody in this country takes this government seriously or that the government actually knows how to administer this nation seriously when there is such a massive mismatch between words and deeds. This gets back to government as attitude, not as policy: `Provided you say something that sounds good, you have done something. Provided you say that there is a crisis and somehow or other what you are doing addresses it, you have actually done something.' There is not that systematic thought process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they have actually produced is a situation now where, if you happen to be a pensioner and you own your own home, and it is therefore included in the assets test for getting into a nursing home, you will be paying the 85 per cent of your pension and, assuming that you get $200 a week for your home, which is not an unreasonable thing to assume if you are renting it out, you are going to pay several thousand dollars worth of tax and then you have that annual up-front fee of $4,500. A pensioner of this country is going to be up for $14,000.</PARA>

It is the argument, `There's a hole in the bucket, dear Henry, dear Henry.' It is that proposition. They get up and say, `Of course they don't have to sell their home; but look at the holes.' You can take the bucket as the home. The holes in that poor bucket are so immense that the whole bottom has gone and they have to sell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which has manifestly lost the trust of the Australian people. This is a government which overcooked its budgets completely unnecessarily and destroyed a raft of good public policy in health, in aged care, in child care, in education&mdash;across-the-board. They destroyed a raft of superb public policy as they overcooked that budget. They unnecessarily depressed the Australian economy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> while they did it. They have finally got back to Labor growth levels&mdash;and hope to God that we hold them&mdash;after 20 months in office and have pronounced themselves proud of that.

Their only effective policy has been pinched from Labor because it was good public policy that founded it. They will get their reward next year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously this is going to be just a little uncomfortable for the Australian Labor Party, given their reaction. I am somewhat disappointed with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the comments that he just made in relation to this matter of public importance. I am disappointed, because there is a general view I think across the parliament that the Leader of the Opposition is a fairly decent man&mdash;at times an honourable man; a reasonable man. I can handle, as a fairly new kid on this block, comments that may be factually inaccurate. But I cannot handle untruths. I have great difficulty with lies. What we heard from the Leader of the Opposition was a raft of untruths, a litany of deceit, an attempt to tell the Australian people that in fact what they had received over the last 12 months was something worse than they had received after 13 years of Labor. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that I am in the far back row, I think I have an equal voice to that of the Leader of the Opposition in this parliament. The attempts of the member for Dobell to quieten me will have no effect whatsoever. The rhetoric coming from the Australian Labor Party over the last 12 months is yet another indication of how hopeless a state they left Australia in, in March of 1996. They continue to illustrate the fact that they are out of touch, particularly with mainstream Australia. If anything can be said about the Leader of the Opposition it is this. He is a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12109"> man who has both feet firmly planted in the air. He cannot stand for anything. He doesn't know what to stand for. He flip-flops around the place on everything ranging from privatisation to nursing homes policy to the treatment of indigenous Australians to the welfare of mainstream Australia, which continues to be trampled on by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to government in March 1996 the Australian Labor Party handed us perhaps the most significant and inopportune budget deficit in Australia's history. They handed us $11.3 billion in one year. Beazley's legacy to the nation, the legacy that he continues to refer to in the midst of his rhetoric&mdash;complete rhetoric&mdash;about the history of the Labor Party, is an annual debt of $9,000 million that is paid to bond holders in Australia and overseas, people who have purchased our debt and who at the end of the day are getting the benefits of Australia's hard earned taxpayers' dollars.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 12 months we have provided to this nation outstanding policy. We have provided to the people of this nation the lowest underlying inflation rate for years&mdash;1.5 per cent in September 1997&mdash;and wages growth of up to five per cent, which means that for every dollar an Australian earns they get a better spending rate. We have provided them with the lowest interest rates since man walked on the moon&mdash;since before Patrick Rafter was born, if we have to get to that level for the Leader of the Opposition. We have provided to small business savings of up 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to $4,000 a year on their business loans. We are providing families on an average mortgage with benefits of $293 a month after tax in their pockets&mdash;every month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are trying to stimulate an economy that was moribund when it was passed on to us by the Australian Labor Party. Housing construction, a great barometer of the strength of the economy, is up 8.5 per cent after falling consistently since 1994. Business investment as a proportion of GDP is at a record 13 per cent, meaning confidence at last is back in the hearts and souls of business working Australians. The proof is in the pudding. The OECD says that our employment and economic growth in 1997&hyphen;98 will be ahead of the legendary G7. That indicates to the broad community that at the end of the day Australia is back at work. Despite the best intentions of the Australian Labor Party, we are back at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have taken significant steps to address some of the legacies that were passed to us. In the area of privatisation we have done some significant repair jobs. The Labor Party flip-flopped, in its traditional policy way, on the sale of the AIDC. It took us to take the tough decisions to get rid of that financial legacy, which could have proved a significant problem for future generations of Australians. We took the tough decisions on the sale of the airport. We took the tough decisions in the reform of National Rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our most significant reform, which will give significant benefits to generations of Australians, is the sale of the first tranche of Telstra&mdash;1.8 million Australians have invested in Telstra. Ninety-three per cent of the workers in Telstra&mdash;the people whom the ALP seeks to represent&mdash;invested in Telstra. Ninety-three per cent of the workers bought shares. According to ABN AMRO, that is the highest employee take-up rate anywhere in the world for an initial public offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The singlemost impressive part about the Telstra sale was that for the first time 600,000 mums and dads out there bought shares, and the Labor Party hates it. The Labor party hates the thought that people are given an opportunity to invest in their workplace, that people are given an opportunity to invest in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12110"> their own company, that people are given an opportunity to invest in Australian business icons. The Labor Party hates it. The Leader of the Opposition did everything he could to oppose the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are flow-off benefits to our attempt to reduce the significant debt legacy that the Leader of the Opposition left to us from $9,000 million a year so that we can put money into education, put money into job creation, put money into a whole range of good initiatives that will help stimulate jobs and economic growth. The Leader of the Opposition continues to oppose at every point any attempt by this government to reduce the debt that he left us, debt that is going to curdle the milk of the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a litany of great policy announcements and initiatives from this government over the last 12 months. I will name just a few. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) got the Australian workplace agreements through the parliament and the Workplace Relations Act started on 1 January this year. Remember the Labor Party's job destroying unfair dismissal laws? They opposed that provision. They continue to oppose the provision that is going to give small business across the country a break from unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secondary boycott provisions were reintroduced to stop union bosses calling unnecessary strikes. We have had the lowest industrial disputation for years&mdash;the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees to August 1997 has been lower than in any of the 13 years under Labor. We have flagged and introduced significant and landmark changes to the Australian Public Service. In addition, we have introduced significant reforms in relation to fair trading, including the creation of the Banking Industry Ombudsman and changes to the industry franchising code&mdash;protecting small business and giving them a helping hand. We introduced significant tax benefits to small business from 1 July this year, including the right to retire on the hard earned proceeds of your business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government committed to the welfare of families. From 1 January this year we gave $1 billion in tax cuts to Australia's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> families&mdash;70 per cent of all Australian families are benefiting from this. In the area of savings we are going one step further than the Labor Party ever wished they could. From 1 July this year there will be a 15 per cent rebate on up to $3,000 of savings interest accrued. Self-funded retirees get a tax rebate equal to the value of the pensioner tax rebate. From 1 July, low and middle income Australians will have received a tax rebate of up to $450 per family on private health insurance, which means that more Australians are staying in private health insurance now than they ever did under Labor when they tried to crucify private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In social security we created the one&hyphen;stop shop, which gives better service to all Australians. In particular, we have cracked down on social security fraud&mdash;$19 million a week has been saved from the $51 billion of our $134 billion budget. We are saving by trying to reduce payments while still providing a helping hand to the people who need it. In relation to the environment, through the Prime Minister's mighty efforts we have created a differentiated target scheme which we are confident the rest of the world will accept in the interests of protecting the global environment. The Green Corps program provides 3,500 placements for 17&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. On 14 March we announced our national literacy and numeracy strategy in schools. From 1 July we saw the most significant reform in communications for years. There have been a raft of other initiatives. Perhaps the most significant initiative, the one that is giving hope to Australians, is the 10,000 work for the dole places that have been created across Australia. I cannot say it better than Kristy McCarron, who said on page 3 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is there no report from the Prime Minister this year? We all know the answer: this is not a year to be proud of&mdash;the Australian people know it. The fundamental reason is the lack of leadership. We have a very distinct leadership differentiation between the major parties in this country and you can sum it up like this: those of us on this side of the House have a leader we are all proud of; those on that side of the House have a leader of whom at least some of them are ashamed. That is a fundamental differentiation and it is a fact that a growing number of Australians are ashamed that John Howard is their Prime Minister, including a growing number of traditional Liberal voters. There are a lot of reasons for that and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)  went through them in broad principle. In 10 minutes I do not have time to go through all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pick up one of the themes he mentioned and deal with it specifically. It is in an area of my responsibility that has been prominent in the debate in this House in the last two days, and that is the way in which this country is being divided internally. It is being demeaned internationally and divided internally. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the member for Paterson for calling the quorum. A few of these people could do with the education of hearing some of these things that need to be said, because we were talking about the demeaning of this country 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> internationally and, most fundamentally, its division internally and particularly its division in the area of industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four stark examples will suffice, although there are many more one could give. Let us start with the question of Hunter Valley No. 1 mine where we have this government being cheerleader for Rio Tinto in its most divisive, outrageous industrial campaign. At Gordonstone the government was for a little while drawn to say, `We don't condone the use of those industrial thugs,' but not today. Today they thought it was okay; they were supporting it. We had the situation in Cairns where the former adviser to ex&hyphen;Minister Sharp said the Cairns confrontation, in which 27 Australians lost their jobs, was organised out of Peter Reith's office, as he put it, out of the office of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. He said it was a bit premature but at least it was a test run. Now we know what it is a test run for. It is a test run for this Dubai industrial mercenary project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every now and again, when the government is trying to pull a stunt, one of its dumbest members lets the cat out of the bag, and I can tell you, having once been a senator, that one of their dumbest members is Senator Julian McGauran. He is not quite the dumbest member of his party but he is close. He said that the federal government was looking for a showdown on the waterfront.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The waterfront would be to the Howard government what the coalminers' strike was to Margaret Thatcher. It's a showdown we're looking for.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is one in every family. In fact, there are two in that family. But there is one in every family and there is one in every National Party and here we have one. It is a clear example that this government treats Australian workers as the enemy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The waterfront is a classic, and we saw today how deeply they are involved. The Prime Minister failed yesterday to condemn this proposal, failed to condemn the use of industrial mercenaries on the waterfront, when the Leader of the Opposition gave him the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12112"> chance. Today he changed tack and started to support what was happening at Gordonstone, what happened at Cairns and what is happening in Dubai. He failed to give a guarantee that there was no government money, he failed to give a guarantee that there were no ministers involved and he failed to give a guarantee that he would come back to the House, inquire into that and report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) making it absolutely clear that there was some Defence involvement&mdash;he does not know how much. But we can say this: it was run in the official <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Army</EMPHASIS> newspaper twice and we have good reason to believe the Department of Defence has been providing access for the recruitment to take place&mdash;they have granted leave for people to participate in blatant breach of the arrangements for people taking leave in Defence&mdash;specifically contravening those regulations. We know that the Minister for Defence has got form on this matter. He wrote to the secretary to his department requiring a previous contractor to this government to take out AWAs for the employment of people on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business ducking and diving to avoid saying whether his staff knew anything about this dispute. I had some information from a pretty good source before question time that the minister's staff knew, and I have to say I was dubious until question time when he said, `I'm not going to conduct an inquisition into my staff. Maybe they knew; I do not know.' What you have got is the old `I don't know nothing' formula. He must be practising to be Prime Minister, because that is the Prime Minister's traditional role. We know now what has happened. He said to his staff, `Don't tell me anything about this. Make sure it happens, but make sure I can get up in the House and say, "I don't know."' `Minister, what about your staff?' `Well, I don't know.'</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12113"> every matter of public importance. This is the last MPI in this parliament this year and I have got to tell everybody who is listening that this weak MPI has got to be the absolute bottom of the barrel with no debate associated with its title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had this matter of public importance raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who combined bluster and volume of voice with a lack of fact and a lack of input. He made comments about government by attitude, not policy. I can tell the people of Australia that the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government is governing with policy, and they are good policies which are producing results. We had the Leader of the Opposition talk about it being a question of words or deeds. The Howard&hyphen;Fischer government is providing the deeds, and the people of Australia know it. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government is destroying superb public policy. I tell you what: if their superb public policy over 13 years did not need destroying, I will eat my Akubra. We had to do our best to actually resurrect Australia and drag it up out of the morass, the economic disaster left to us by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subject of this matter of public importance allegedly is the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to provide a progress report. I know that half the opposition are dills and that unless they get a report card they do not know what is going on. But the people of Australia are not dills. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the people of Australia do not need a report card to know that the number of employed persons in Australia is up. In June 1993 there were 7,650,000 persons employed in Australia. In November 1997, just a few days ago&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see how afraid of the facts this Labor opposition are. You get someone standing up and giving them the information on the realities of what has happened in this economy, and all they do is try to gag free speech. They have called for a report card, but the people of Australia should be well and truly aware that we are now well on the way to a growth figure of six per cent. We are in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a situation where the number of employed persons is up by more than 11 per cent from June 1993 to November 1997; where average weekly earnings in 1993&hyphen;94 were $609.10 and in 1997&hyphen;98 are $706.40. I say to the men and women of Australia who are earning that average weekly wage: don't forget the favoured sons of the Labor Party, the favoured sons of the union movement, the wharfies, who earn up to $124,000 a year. Average earnings are $706 but the elite, the wharfies, get $2,500 a week in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before I was interrupted, the people of Australia are not dills. They do not need a report card to know that there have been five interest rates reductions under the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. They do not need a report card to know that their housing loan interest rates are the lowest they have been for 30 years. They certainly do not really need a report card to know that in January this year the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government introduced tax savings for families of $1 billion. They know that their pay packets contain more every week because of the tax cuts which the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government have provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday and today a lot of nonsense has been spoken in this House about the defence services. The people in the defence forces know that the defence reform program introduced from 1 July 1997 has produced savings of $770 million, which could go up to $1 billion, with increased effectiveness and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ordinary people of Australia&mdash;not the dills in the Labor opposition&mdash;know what is going on. They know about the expenditure on the Pacific Highway. They know that this government is reintroducing the black spots program. Talk to the people in my electorate: they know what is going on in terms of the Pacific Highway and they know what we are doing with trade and exports. We have record trade in Australian furniture and wine at the present time. We now export milk from Cairns to Hong Kong every day. We have had tariffs reduced in India and other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are finding is that the small business sector of Australia has benefited enormously&mdash;there are fringe benefit tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12114"> benefits and capital gains tax benefits, for example&mdash;from the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. That is the report card.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can well understand the situation the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) found himself in. It was very easy to realise that there was nothing of substance taking place in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) on a couple of aspects. I agree that this is probably the most inane matter of public importance this parliament has seen this year. It is really of no substance at all, and one really has to think that, on the last day of this parliament, when they have their last opportunity, the Labor Party could have come up with something better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a couple of points. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Brand (Mr Beazley), spoke about the government dividing the nation. I do not think anyone has divided the nation more effectively than the Leader of the Opposition with his stance on the Wik bill. Here we have a bill which is far less far&hyphen;reaching than the legislation that his own government brought in in 1993, and yet 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Labor Party is opposing it. The hypocrisy is enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have the member for Brand talking about property rights for Aboriginals. It is quite clear that no&hyphen;one has said that native title equates to property rights. If this is what the Leader of the Opposition is advocating, he is advocating a hereditary race based land tenure system for Australia. What could possibly be more divisive than that? In terms of dividing the nation, the Leader of the Opposition ought to have a very hard think about his own performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the recurrent themes through this debate, as the government has sought to pat itself on the back and the opposition has sought to denigrate the government, is confusion. You see the government making an issue of the waterfront, as though the waterfront were actually vital to Australia. The waterfront is one of those issues which is very peripheral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was on a committee that looked at waterfront reform, and we found that the greatest need for reform was not on the waterfront but between the waterfront and the warehouse. After all, Australia is the world's leader in bulk shipments of all sorts. People come from across the world to Australia to see how bulk shipments are done here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are talking about here is the liner trade, and that report I participated in showed that the real problem was not on the waterfront. Yet the government insist on making this an issue. `If we can only fix the waterfront, everything will be all right', they say. That is a lot of nonsense, and Australia knows it is a lot of nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you are seeing the hypocrisy of this taken to extremes. In Western Australia, at Dampier, where there was very good accord on the waterfront&mdash;all the users of the waterfront were very happy with the service being provided&mdash;the state government called a tender and gave it to a company which was obviously going to use cut&hyphen;price New Zealand labour. The company was granted a monopoly situation on the wharf. There was never anything to stop this company coming in and competing with P&amp;O, as it was. The company could have come in and competed. But no, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12115"> the state government completely breached all the Hilmer report recommendations and gave this company a monopoly. That action was totally endorsed by the federal government, clearly in breach of Hilmer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will this bring a better performance on the waterfront at Dampier? No, it will not, because the situation at Dampier was at all times very good, with good accord there. It is not going to improve anything at all. I say to this House: the way forward for Australia is not low wages. The way forward for this nation is to be a high wage, high skill nation. For that we need high levels of education and training. I say to this House: we are going backwards in all these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that this massive deskilling of Australia started under the Keating Labor government. It started in the caucus, when Keating said that the future lay in the service sector. The service sector is political code for tourism: low paid jobs, part&hyphen;time jobs, jobs for women and kids. It does not provide jobs for blue&hyphen;collar workers. So across this nation you have the blue&hyphen;collar workers out of work and their wives working part&hyphen;time. Then you wonder why their kids have gone feral. That is the problem in Australia. We have to get this nation working again, but it has to be at worthwhile jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not so long ago, less than a decade, you would see adverts in the paper regularly for projects like the Alaska pipeline, for example. There was worldwide advertising for tradesmen for that project. The advertisement would say `preference given to Australians' because those responsible knew of the skill of Australian tradesmen. But not any more. The truth is that, for development that is taking place in this country, you cannot get skilled tradesmen anywhere. You cannot get a boilermaker for love or money, because we stopped training them. Nothing that is done by the government will affect that at all. We still have the de-skilling of this nation&mdash;and it seems to have been accepted by both parties. I tell this House: the waterfront is a subterfuge. It is not the vital issue, and it is not the only issue, in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both sides of this chamber say, `Drugs are the issue; if we could only fix drugs.' Drugs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are a symptom. This government could fix the problem of drugs in this country tomorrow if it wanted to, if it had the will, just as the previous government could have done. But it will not do it in the way it is going about it; it will not do it by throwing more money at enforcement. I believe that it is important that the problem of drugs be fixed&mdash;not for the people who die from drug overdoses, in my view, as that is a decision they take&mdash;because of the associated corruption that insinuates into every level of society, not just the police force. That corruption goes through the bureaucracy, and also through the courts. We could stop that tomorrow. All we have to do is take a sensible position on drugs, legalise their use, and prohibit the selling of them. It is so simple, and it is quite clear that it would work. But with the way we are going about it, nothing will change&mdash;and you have to believe at the end of the day that no-one really wants it to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is taxation. The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) is always worth a bit of a giggle, I guess. He talked about taxation issues. The Labor Party had years and years to reform taxation, and it did nothing. But this coalition government does not want to reform taxation; it just wants a GST. Everywhere in the world where a GST has been introduced, it has led to a greater tax take for government. I asked a question in this House about the benefits of a debits tax and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) wiped it off. He said, `Oh, we're not even going to consider it.' Now it has been suggested that we have a debits tax. This basically is a tax at a very low level on transactions&mdash;0.34c in the dollar; one&hyphen;third of a cent in the dollar could entirely replace income tax and sales tax. What greater incentive can you imagine for the workers of Australia than for you to do that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect those figures are fudged a bit, because there are businesses which would fail&mdash;such things as the foreign exchange rackets. I do not mind if they get wiped out. I do not think they serve Australia at all well. But the fact is that they then would not be there as an income base, so you might have to adjust the figures. However, the debit tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12116"> deserves to be studied because of its simplicity, because it cannot be avoided, and because it will force the multinational companies who now pay no tax to pay their share of tax. If you want tax reform, there are many ways you can do it other than by having a GST. You can get more people working so that more people pay tax. You can get foreign companies to pay tax; for them, at present, tax is highly optional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government talks about the great successes of small business. I am out there in my electorate every day with small business&mdash;and small business is not doing well. Small businesses have not seen the good times&mdash;they are an illusion. They are not seeing it as good; they are still doing it very, very hard indeed. They are waiting for all the good news that the government talks about to eventuate. The government talks about reduction in red tape; there seems to be a remarkable increase in red tape. I do have one minute left to me, but I will cut my remarks short because it appears that the Prime Minister is in the House and I am sure he is going to make a statement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an opportunity for me as Prime Minister to express my gratitude to a number of people. The first person that I want to express my thanks to is my friend and colleague the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer. Tim has been, in every sense of the word, an outstanding Deputy Prime Minister for this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country. He has also been a highly successful, much admired, well liked and well travelled&mdash;and quite properly so&mdash;Minister for Trade. His indefatigable efforts on behalf of Australian exporters are widely recognised in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also extend to the deputy leader of my own party and Treasurer, Peter Costello, my very warm thanks, not only for his work as Treasurer but also for the contribution he makes as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. It is a position that I, at various stages in my political career, have held, and I know the particular pressures and the particular responsibilities of that role, and I want to express my gratitude to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in that vogue, can I express my thanks to the Leader of the House, who I know is hurrying in&mdash;he has arrived&mdash;for his very, very effective conduct of the affairs of the House. He has done it well, he has done it with style, he has done it with good humour&mdash;and he has done it, might I say, in a way that has advanced the cause of the government and, therefore, the cause of the Australian community. So I just want to say that to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I also say to two people who have occupied the position of Deputy Leader of the House&mdash;one of them being the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who resigned from the ministry some two months ago; and, more recently, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, who is now the Deputy Leader of the House, the member for Wide Bay, Warren Truss&mdash;I wish to extend my thanks to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To you, Mr Speaker, I want to thank you for the contribution that you have made to the House. It is not an easy job being Speaker, and you have displayed good humour throughout the year in often difficult circumstances. I wish you, your wife and your family a very warm and happy Christmas. Could I also likewise extend those greetings and those thanks to Garry Nehl, the Deputy Speaker; to all the chairmen of committees; and to all the other deputy speakers for their respective contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Ian Harris and Bernard Wright&mdash;the Clerk and the Deputy Clerk&mdash;have given 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12117"> tremendously professional service to us both in opposition and in government. I know that I speak for all members when I express my admiration for the contribution that both of you have made. I want to include in that expression of thanks the members of your staff: the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, the Tabling Officer and the PLO assistant&mdash;Jeannie Hall, Suzanne De Smet and Grant Woodbridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also express my thanks to the staff of the Bills and Papers Office who come into very regular contact with all of us; to Jim Pender, Peter Mason, Ian Cochran and Don Piper of the Table Office; to David Elder, the Serjeant&hyphen;at&hyphen;Arms, and to Dalma Dixon, the Deputy Serjeant&hyphen;at&hyphen;Arms; and to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff. It has never ceased to amaze me in the 23&hyphen;odd years that I have been in this parliament how remarkably skilful the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff are at reproducing our comments. I think that is a remark that draws unanimous empathy and understanding from all members of the House. They really do it with great skill and great professionalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank the House of Representatives Transport Officer and the Transport Manager, Narelle Frost, in particular, who is leaving after a long period of service. I wish her well. I know that those expressions of goodwill come from all members. I thank all the other people who keep this place going. It is a huge establishment with a very big staff, and it ticks along with great efficiency. I want to thank the staff of the Joint House Department, particularly the telephonists, the cleaning and the maintenance staff, Comcar drivers and the Australian Protective Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find the staff around this building unfailingly polite and pleasant. Whether it is the attendants in the House, the attendants in the corridors or those who work in the dining room, I have always found that to be the case. It has never ceased to amaze me why people occasionally express irritation. That has not been my experience. I find them to be very polite people. I want to take this opportunity to express to the staff of the building a word of heartfelt thanks for their courteous, helpful and cheerful assistance and service through the year. I hope all of them, including their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> family and friends, have an extraordinarily happy Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank the members of my own staff for the very hard work that they have displayed during the year. I thank the head of my department, Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton, and the officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It has been an extraordinarily busy year for the government. Next year will be no different; it will be a busy year. It seems as though the years in this place get busier as one goes by after another. But this year has been particularly busy, and it is not over yet. There will certainly be a bit of water to flow under the bridge between now and when this place finally rises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting aside the busyness born of political disputation, there is a busyness born of the natural momentum of government that achieves a remarkable number of things. We are coming towards a number of historic events in the experience of Australia. We are coming towards the celebration of 100 years of the birth of the Australian nation as a federation. We are coming towards the time when there will be no people left alive who have witnessed and participated in some of the great events that shaped the making of Australia in the early part of this century. All of us are going to focus increasingly on the values of our society. We are going to focus increasingly on our history, and we are going to focus increasingly&mdash;in particular, at the convention on the constitution which will be held in February next year&mdash;on the institutions that are important to the Australian way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary institution came under an enormous amount of public strain and public criticism throughout the year. Without in any way reopening the inevitable political debate that emerged over matters relating to the behaviour of individual members or the systems under which they operate, it is probably appropriate to say that all of us, starting with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and through our respective parties, have a collective responsibility to do everything we can to lift the esteem in which the parliamentary institution is held.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12118">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the character of the Australian people, it is never going to be the case that the institution is held in quite the esteem that we would like it to be. Whilst in one sense that is a disappointment, in another sense one of the great national reservoirs of commonsense of the Australian people is a certain scepticism of those in authority. It is part of our Celtic inheritance. No matter who is in office, that is no bad thing. We should balance our frustration that on occasions we are not as well appreciated as we would like to be with a recognition that it is one of the great protections of democracy in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Democracy depends for its survival on good institutions. It also depends for its survival on an astute people. Australians are not a gullible group. That is one thing that I believe marks us out as rather different from some of our friends across the Pacific. I remember having an interesting discussion with President Clinton when he was here in October last year. We talked about some of the similarities and some of the differences between the Australian people and the American people. I think the Australian people are a little more sceptical about things than some of our colleagues elsewhere. I do not think that is a bad thing; I think it is a good thing. It is something that has worked to our advantage, no matter who has been in office and no matter which political party happens to occupy the commanding heights of Australian politics at any given time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we come towards the end of the year and particularly as we focus in the early part of next year on some of our institutions, I think it is important to value the contribution that parliament makes. I do not expect everybody to agree with this, but I am one of those people who is a great believer that the great protection for democracy in our country is not so much in what you write down in the constitution but, rather, in the strength of the institutions. We need a vigorous, free parliamentary system, an incorruptible judiciary and a free and sceptical press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On occasions, none of us are going to like the things that are said about us by the press, but equally it is indispensable to our system of government that we should have it. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also indispensable to our system of government that there be free and open exchanges between the political wing of government and those other wings. There also has to be a respect for the roles of the parliament, the judiciary and the press in our system of government. There has been some debate&mdash;and I do not intend to extend it in these brief remarks this afternoon&mdash;about the role of the courts in our system. But they are certainly a very integral part of our system, and one of the things that Australia can be very grateful for is that we have inherited a judicial system which we have added to and shaped and moulded ourselves but which has been remarkably free of corruption. Indeed, may I say that federal politics in this country has been remarkably free of corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same may not be said about some other levels of government to quite the same degree. I could not say that, if I could borrow a phrase, quite so fulsomely about other levels of government, but I certainly can say that in the time that I have been in federal politics&mdash;and that has spanned the period of the Whitlam government, the Fraser government, the Hawke government, the Keating government and my own government&mdash;I have not seen any real evidence of what you would call corruption in the accepted and proper sense of the word. I think that is a remarkable tribute to our system. It is also, I suppose, a function of a federal system of government and the fact that federal governments do not have direct responsibility for making decisions about property and other rights that sometimes lead to peccadilloes and worse at other levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have an opportunity early next year and in the next few years to focus on our institutions&mdash;to hang on to those things that we believe are worth preserving and to mould, change and discard those things that ought to be. Whatever comes out of the deliberations next year and whatever comes out of the ensuing deliberations on the constitution and the question of whether we should retain our existing arrangements for a head of state or alter them to a republican system, I have absolutely no doubt that the best interests of the Australian people will be preserved 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12119"> by maintaining in full the parliamentary system that we have now, the respect for the separation of powers involving the judiciary and, inevitably, the contribution that the fourth estate makes to the vigour of our democracy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) started quite appropriately by thanking members of his team&mdash;his Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and deputy leader of the Liberal Party, and then on through his colleagues&mdash;and I should start the same way. This has been a good year in opposition for us, generally speaking&mdash;a really strong year in developing the appropriate roles that an opposition plays in this place. The appropriate role of an opposition is to challenge the government in the development of its policy administration, and the classic role of opposition has been performed well by us during this year. It has been good actually getting up to speed in a very short space of time. That has, in no small measure, been due to the people who have served us well in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My principal thanks must go to my deputy, Gareth Evans, who has been an absolute fountain of activity, good work and useful initiatives. He has indescribable energies. Nobody else I have ever come across in politics on either side of the House has his capacity for hard work and, indeed, he has a gargantuan appetite for it. It is an important thing to us that he has done that so effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My thanks also go to Simon Crean, who has performed the role of Manager of Opposition Business admirably. It is a difficult role. Basically speaking, I think all members know that as far as the opposition and government views are expressed in this House, by and large, they are organised not by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition but by the respective managers of business. Simon has taken to it like a duck to water and has done very well indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other group of individuals responsible on both of sides of the House for keeping up the performance of the parliamentary institution are the whips. Our principal whip is Leo McLeay. I made an unkind joke about Leo's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12120"> age last year, so it is one year unkinder now, Leo. He is an extraordinarily experienced whip. He has done extremely well in that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always been of the view that whips are inappropriately placed in the Australian political system, which is one of the reasons why when I was in government I advocated the notion of chief whip and whips attached to them. I am a bit more for the British system. I think the whip is an integral part of government and opposition management. The British situate their chief whip in the cabinet; that ought to  be the case here. They give them a residence as well. The whips are absolutely critical in ensuring that the attitude of what is happening on the back bench and the wisdom that often emerges from there are injected into government or opposition decision making. It is not so necessary in opposition, but in government I think it is absolutely vital. I say that simply in terms of advocacy; we never did it when we were in government, but we did try to elevate the role somewhat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leo McLeay has been very ably assisted by Rod Sawford and Ted Grace, two very experienced people on our side of the House, and they have done very well indeed. They were helped by their staff, Joan Connor in particular, who has handled more touchy political egos than I have had hot dinners, and I have had a few of them. She is an invaluable servant to our side of the House. Another fellow who brings the views of parliamentarians to the leader's attention and plays a very important role in our system is the chairman of caucus, Peter Morris. I pay tribute to his role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention the front bench. Our front bench is a mixture of people who have had to go through the process of humility, having been ministers and now being in opposition. Often it has been the case, no matter who is passing from one side of the chamber to the other, that the ego takes a pounding when the performance is not there. That has not been so with those people who have participated in previous governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely critical to have that past experience. One of the problems the government have had in being out of office for so 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> long is that they have found that difficult. One of the advantages they have had is that they have in their Prime Minister a person who at least has had some experience of previous occupancy of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the Westminster view more than the American view: the American view is that once you are out, you are out; the British view is that members of parliament, opposition leaders and prime ministers persist in the system for a lengthy period of time. I think that underpins and strengthens the system. I think that our political leadership exits parliament too readily and there ought to be more of that continuity. If it is the Prime Minister's desire that parliament should be a better place&mdash;and I am sure he holds that view sincerely&mdash;it would be better served by a leavening of longer serving members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now is not the time, in the valedictories, to speak about our members who are going at the next election, but we should mention the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who got a guernsey in the previous speech, Barry Jones, Clyde Holding, Peter Morris, Ralph Willis, Peter Baldwin and David Beddall. If you actually look at the group of people that will be leaving us at the next election, you can see that there is an extraordinary loss there of real political weight. I guess that amplifies the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank our enthusiastic team on the new front bench, those who have come in and served for the first time on the front bench. The best way to start in politics in terms of honing your political skills is to be an opposition frontbencher. The second best way is to be an opposition backbencher. The very worst way is to be a government backbencher. My deepest sympathies go to them in this Christmas season. It is a dreadful job, having to explain your government. It does not matter which government it is; it is an appalling job having to explain them without the capacity to get up and attack. I think that both our new frontbenchers and our backbenchers have had a good year in that regard and I thank them for the work that they have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition value our staff. We do not have many of them. We are operating with 17 less staff than the government had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12121"> when they were in opposition. The loss of staff is exceptionally difficult to cope with. Therefore, they are massively overworked.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FISCHER" NAMEID="DG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ministers' staff have been reduced too.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Your consultancies are doing pretty well and so are your liaison officers, frankly. But these are valedictories, so we will not go into that area. The point I was making was basically that we have to make do and that imposes a very substantial burden on our staff. I must thank my staff in particular, including my chief of staff, David Epstein, and all the other people on my staff who play a very significant role in providing good advice to me and service to the front bench generally. We have a very small media office in Greg Turnbull and John Flannery but they do extremely well indeed. They are exceptionally talented media advisers and they are well supported by Louise Cullen and Liz Iser.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could list all the other members of my staff but I realise that there is a time limit on us here. The roles that they perform for me, particularly my personal secretary, Karen Bissaker, are absolutely invaluable. From them to the rest of the opposition staff, they are much put upon by their shadow spokespersons. They have just one offsider in the work that they do and it is exceptionally difficult and time&hyphen;consuming work. When there is a bit of investigation to be done, I am most impressed by the amount of information that can be turned up in exceptionally short order, in very great detail and with very great accuracy. We always follow the rule that I was taught by a student newspaper editor: print only two&hyphen;thirds of what you know. The work that they have done in that regard is exceptionally useful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now pass from those who have served the opposition to those more generally who have served the parliament. I thank you particularly, Mr Speaker, and your deputies, for the job that you do. You hold this position with great presence, and you have made some interesting and innovative rulings. I cannot say that I have shared your interpretation on all occasions, but I do not think anyone can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fault you for trying. You have graced the office since you have been there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lyn Barlin left us during the course of the year. I thank Ian Harris for the work he has done and Bernard Wright in taking over. They really do keep this parliament functioning very effectively. They are great servants of the government and the parliament. When I say they are servants of the government I do not mean in the sense of being acolytes of the government by any stretch of the imagination. But, really, the job of Leader of the House and the rest of it is really quite easy. The simple fact of the matter is that the organisation of the business occurs along there. That is where it happens, as well as in the `office in there'; that is, the Parliamentary Liaison Office. That is a most important thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking of officers immediately behind the chair, I make special mention of Jeannie Hall, the PLO, who I understand is leaving to go back into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. She started when I was Leader of the House and has continued for these 20 months under the current Leader of the House, Peter Reith. She does a terrific job. She is an enormously efficient person. She did a terrific job for us when we were in government, for the government now and for the parliament as a whole. It has been a notable work on her part. I thank the Table Office staff and Chamber Research Office staff who support the various officials I have been talking about. I thank the Serjeant&hyphen;At&hyphen;Arms, David Elder, his deputy, Dalma Dixon, and their helpful staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Hansard staff. We are generally speaking in this place, depending on the hour of the day, more or less coherently. However, when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is produced, generally speaking we are totally coherent. It is not therefore an accurate record of the proceedings of the House but, nevertheless, it is a flattering one and for that we thank them for the work they do in translating our best endeavours. A member of my staff was campaigning in Wales in the recent general election in England. He knocked on a door and spoke in English to the person who answered, who said immediately, `Do you speak Welsh?' Apparently, that is a point they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12122"> make in Wales to people who are doorknocking. He replied immediately, `I don't actually speak English, either. I'm from Australia.' Certainly, whatever our particular standard is, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> makes us look a great deal better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to thank the House of Representatives Transport Office staff, particularly Brian Flanagan, Narelle Frost and Craig, for their outstanding and courteous service. No good things are happening for them, I am afraid to say. I understand they are going sessional from this point on, which basically means that they will not get from us a living wage. I do not know whether that will mean they will stick around, but it is becoming harder and harder to work in the public sector these days and they are amongst those who are experiencing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the other House of Representatives staff, including the printing staff. Special mention must go to the Parliamentary Library staff for their grace and forbearance of some of the pressures the opposition have visited upon them. They are a genuine national treasure and I feel they raise the quality of the political debate in this place significantly&mdash;not to mention the quality of people's performances in the various BAs and BXs that they do around the place. But their service to members of parliament has been very substantial over the years and their tolerance is enormously great. I want to place on record respect for their professionalism and impartiality. They do a wonderful job for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joint House staff also need mention at this time of the year, particularly Marlene Armstrong and the telephonists, the cleaning staff, maintenance staff, gardeners, marketing and visitors staff. I would also like to mention the Health and Recreation Centre staff, who have had absolutely no impact on me, and the staff in the cafeteria and Aussies cafe&mdash;who have had more. They do a remarkable job for us all the time. I would also like to mention the shop operators, bank staff, Qantas office staff, hairdresser and all the other Joint House staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Comcar drivers have survived another year&mdash;and I hope they continue to do so. Let me place on record my thanks to Alan Mac 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kenzie and Rick Boyland in Perth who drive me very regularly. They are safe Comcar drivers, safe in many respects&mdash;both in their training and in their discretion. They are an important part of the process. We must be careful that, in our passions for efficiency and low spending, we do not start to make ourselves ridiculous as a people by putting ourselves in a situation where what in any country would be regarded as a normal service disappears altogether from the face of the operations of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish the compliments of the season and best wishes to our political opponents. This is where the valedictories move over to their more popular office designations as hypocrisies&mdash;or fulsomenesses. I must say, fulsomely, that I do give my best regards to our political opponents. I think the parliamentary system in this country is a good one and that it does in fact perform well for the nation. I think the Prime Minister had a deal to say in his remarks about the nature of parliament and how it might be improved. I think it has, to some extent, in its processes been improved over the last decade and a half. The House of Representatives has gained for itself via its committee system a far more extensive overview of the development of public policy, and that is a good thing. I think the Main Committee has been a good thing too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that, by and large, there is a jealousy of the roles and prerogatives of parliament in this place and that that is exercised on both sides of the House, by government members as well as opposition members. I do wish our political opponents, who keep one side of this essential democratic process going, all the very best for Christmas, particularly the Prime Minister and his family. He will need relaxation, as all prime ministers do. It is a hard job, it is a tough job and it is a job for which he gets little thanks in the nature of the Australian system and the character of the Australian people, who are tough judges of their political leaderships&mdash;and long may that continue to be the case. I wish him well for his annual holiday at Hawks Nest, and I wish that too to his deputies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad that we have the Deputy Prime Minister staying at home for Christmas these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12123"> days. It took a long time and a good woman to get him to do so. It is a good thing that that has happened. He will now operate a normal Christmas and those serving Australian personnel overseas will also be able to, courtesy of these developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank too the Leader of the House for his role of manager of government business. We take umbrage frequently at our treatment on this side of the House, but we recognise that that is an integral part of the political process. He has a job to do and legislation to get through, and he does his level best to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish all members of this House a safe and happy Christmas as we go back to our families. I hope that we enjoy the next few weeks respite with them and the opportunities that we have of making acquaintances again with our friends. We are the loneliest and most isolated profession in this country. I once saw a disturbing psychological study of politicians. It would depress us all to know the damage 20-odd years service in this place can do to one's psychology and personality&mdash;and it was a very well informed study, I have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does point to the fact that you tend to lose your friends very quickly in this place. You do not lose them because of the things you do; you lose them because of the things you do not do. Neglect is inevitable. We are the busiest people in this country bar none&mdash;we are sometimes described otherwise in that regard, but we on both sides of this House know the truth of the matter&mdash;therefore, we do deserve a good break over this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I extend to the Australian people the same courtesies extended to this side of the House. I very much wish for them a happy and safe Christmas over the next few weeks, and a fruitful and productive life in the new year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those opposite&mdash;the backbenchers, the middlebenchers, the frontbenchers and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)&mdash;I wish you the very best for this season and look forward to the resumption of activities some time a little later next year, because of the Constitutional Convention in the first fortnight of February. It will be a delight to walk into that old chamber again for at least that first fortnight. Those of us who had the privilege of starting our federal parliamentary careers in that chamber know that it is certainly an incredible building. I do not care, though, to return to my office, which was 2&half; metres by 1&half; metres&mdash;even when I was the glorious shadow minister for veterans affairs, a privileged position. But we will all be back in the Old Parliament House at the start of February and it will be interesting to see those events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry that there are no Independents in the House. In the Thredbo motion there were one or two Independents. I know these are busy times. I extend my best wishes to the Independents for a safe Christmas. To my staff&mdash;the chief of staff, Craig Simmons, my electorate staff, all of my staff&mdash;I thank them for their great help. I thank Bruce Gosper, who is departing for Washington, the departmental liaison officer. He goes with my best wishes. He has given great service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a time of rejuvenation, renewal and reconnection, especially with the family and extended family over Christmas. I wish everyone well in that regard. To those of you still in Canberra on 18 December, there is a Christmas concert in the Great Hall. Proceeds go to the Smith Family, the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul, which I sponsor with the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), the Speaker, the President and whoever is the leader of the Democrats after Friday. It is a tremendous night. It is not a night of Christmas carols as such; it is a really good use of the Great Hall for charitable purposes, including Thredbo this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those of you still around and on deck on 24 January, you are welcome to join me&mdash;all of you&mdash;on Tumbatrek at 9 a.m. in Thredbo at the bottom of the chairlift. We are going to give Thredbo a real boost, the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12125"> Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn), me, Jim Lloyd, my friend from Gosford and others. We will do a celebrated climb of Mount Kosciuszko and help give Thredbo some more funds for their community centre&mdash;the government having given $100,000 after the sad events of Thredbo this year. Indeed, I extend my sympathy to the Australians affected by Thredbo, by the fires and by the cyclone in Townsville early this year. Our thoughts are with them at this Christmas time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me pick up on the point made by the Leader of the Opposition. There are still many Australian service personnel at many locations around the world at Christmas-New Year. I guess the largest grouping right now would probably be the RAAF at Panang. Whether it is Flight Lieutenant O'Reilly and his son Ben, who I hope will ring Macca on Sunday morning, or whether it is the peacekeepers in the Middle East and various others, you do outstanding work on behalf of the Australian armed forces and on behalf of Australia. We extend to you in those isolated locations our very best wishes at this time. I cannot always visit you now at Christmas-New Year; that is correct. But I do in fact try to get to them when I am visiting those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To all our families&mdash;our spouses especially; there are one or two of them in the gallery; not my spouse, but they are wonderful spouses&mdash;I thank you very much collectively because you carry a huge burden. You are underprofiled, but we appreciate your work. Lastly&mdash;why do I leave them till last&mdash;there is the media, the press gallery.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to join in making a few comments of appreciation to those people that have helped me in my role as Manager of Opposition Business. It has been an interesting year, and people have remarked upon it. It has had some low points and high points. Fortunately for us and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), we have had some significantly high points. One of the low points, for example, was when Kim was actually gagged from responding to the republic debate after having delayed his response out of respect for the death of Princess Diana. Another low point has been that we still have not seen our response and the way in which it was handled in relation to the stolen generation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My opposite number is not here. The member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) has often asked me what I have done to get an opposite number like the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John Moore. I think I answered something along the lines that I was born with good parents and I have been blessed on both accounts with my opposite number. The Black Jack incident was a particularly good exercise for us because I think it helped identify the apathy, and there was the pleasure of having seen him confirm, we think, that this is the worst government we have ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another episode that was interesting during the year was the dressing gowns and the failure to receive them by the government when TCF workers were concerned about their future. We always have great pleasure in jiving away&mdash;I see the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) leaving&mdash;at those who see themselves in his place. One is a self-proclaimed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12126"> one, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp). And of course there is the P1 and P2 game that we all take delight in seeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the year we have lost two respected people who have assisted us, John O'Callaghan, who was in Kim's office but who helped us all with question times, and Lyn Barlin as Clerk. We have already expressed our thanks to them on other occasions but I would like to put on record my appreciation for their contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I want to acknowledge the role that you have played. It is a difficult role and we have had our differences. I have been at the receiving end of a number of them and have seen myself outside, as have many people on our side of the House. But I wish you and the family well for the festive season. As the Leader has commented, there have been some interesting and innovative ways in which you have made some interpretations. I do not know whether you are going for an early reprint of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> so that we can get them in. We did take particular note of the ruling that you made when the Prime Minister was not asked to withdraw a particular allegation. Again, I think it was against the Leader and the Deputy. It was not withdrawn because the Prime Minister believed it to be true. This is something that we have taken a bit of notice of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank you for your continued hospitality and also for some lenience. A bit of lenience we got. It is difficult to get our message across in question time. We have tried to comply as best we can with your admonition to shorten the questions. I must say that it has not been applied on the other side in relation to the answers, but at least there has been an ability for us to get our message across by visual props, and that has been useful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has had to leave for a moment. He advised me of that. I would like to extend my best wishes to him. We have an interesting sparring role but we have been able to manage to agree on a number of things. I know he has lost one member of staff to you, Mr Speaker, in Hugh Logue. To Kate, who has replaced him, I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want to place on record my appreciation for the contribution that they have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the Prime Minister, who is no longer here, last year he actually wished me all the best. This year, I suppose, it is a mark of the way in which the place is run that he has chosen not to. Nevertheless, I wish him and Jeanette the very best for Christmas and a happy Christmas together. I know that probably the only thing he has in common with our former great leader Gough Whitlam is a love for some Latin expressions. I don't know how he is going to sum the up the year in Latin. I guess he might draw on Her Majesty. When he talked about that week earlier this year and listening to Gough last night talking about the Latin quotations, I thought it was about the only thing they had in common.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the opposition whip, Leo, I want to place on record my sincere thanks. You have been a constant source of support. The deftness of Leo's touch was shown recently in this place in his intervention during the Hanson incident. When people look back on that in terms of its impact and the way in which the House was able to deal with it under his guidance, I think it will also be seen as the precise moment the One Nation party began to self-destruct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank Rod and Ted, the deputy whips, and also Alan Griffin and Bob Sercombe, who are now assisting with the new counting procedures. In particular to Joan Connor in Leo's office, her invaluable knowledge and support has been great to my staff. My own staff, Phil, Karina and Pat, have been a tremendous support to me. I would like to extend again our sincere thanks to Jeanie Hall in the Parliamentary Liaison Office and also to Suzanne. We do appreciate the cooperation that comes through them because it certainly helps to keep us on the mark. Jeannie is still rewarding those in my office when we do things appropriately. I think they have moved up to strawberry frogs. I must say that I have never received one. I don't know whether this is professionalism or the fact that I don't deserve one, but my office is greatly appreciative, as I certainly am, of the role that you have played.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12127">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the Clerks&mdash;Ian Harris, Bernard Wright, Ian Cochran&mdash;you again have been a tremendous support to us. The Leader has made mention of this. All of us draw on and need the wealth of knowledge and information you have at your fingertips. We have put you to more use this year because Labor has used the opportunity to put forward some alternative proposals: the small business, the TCF, the automotive and the anti-dumping procedures bills&mdash;a number of private member's bills. They have all been large and complex pieces of legislation. But the Clerks have all delivered, to paraphrase the term, `on time, on budget'. When the auto tariff bill was put before lawyers from the automotive industry, they did not change a thing. To all of you and to the staff, including Laraine Brennan and Elizabeth Robertson, I thank them on behalf of the opposition. I continue to receive nothing but the highest of praise possible for the totally professional commitment they provide to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, to Neville Gathercole and to Marcus in the office, we thank them for their prompt and courteous support. I would also like to make special mention of the Transport Office&mdash;Narelle Frost, Brian Flanagan and Craig Snell. We understand that the Transport Office will now only operate during sitting weeks and two days prior to sitting. Due to the Jetset parliamentary service the work of the Transport Office has decreased and, therefore, there is the necessity to cease full-time employment of these staff. But do I want to thank them sincerely for their continued courteous and prompt service. We will miss it on this side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst thanking the Transport Office I would also like to make particular mention of the Qantas office here in Parliament House and the service that they too have provided over many years. To Doug and Margaret, we wish them well in their new locations. We are sorry that the office has been downsized. To Margo, we look forward to our continued relationship in the new year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to thank the Table Office, especially Pat Sherman and Sue Van Deyke. We make regular demands on their time with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments, and the efficiency with which the forms come into the House is extraordinary and commendable. To the attendants who service us all: they are a great group of people. I want to thank all of them. They are always friendly, courteous and professional. They provide an extremely efficient and effective service and nothing is too much of an ask for them. It is always good to have a pleasant exchange of views with them in the corridor, particularly around the football season, and when we come into this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Library is a tremendous research facility for the parliament, in particular the opposition. It  is terribly important for us as an opposition to understand and appreciate the role they play in our contributions. They are effectively the department of the opposition. I would like to reinforce my view of last year: I do not think there is a better research facility in this nation than the one that is provided to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many I could thank in Hansard. We do appreciate the role of the Hansard reporters. Many of us on this side take more interest in the greens now; there seem to be a few editorial changes. We thank them for their accuracy and the way they clean up the words. Their forbearance and dedication have been tremendous and it is a great professional outfit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the staff in the dining room, in particular Kate, who has been there a very long time. They continue to serve us well. They have to deal with us when we are in dreadful moods or hubris. They have to deal with that from both sides of the parliament, given that we all congregate from time to time in the one dining room. Their ability to deal with us and cope with it is a great tribute to their understanding not only of the place but also of the human dimension of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want also to thank the Health and Recreation Centre staff. I do get some advantage from them. A group of us get there fairly early in the morning. We usually catch up on a bit of gossip, but the facility is a great asset to this parliament. It is important to keep us physically alert as well as ensure that we do not necessarily overexert ourselves. I think everyone knows Lizzie. She is always avail 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12128"> able to accommodate a haircut at the shortest of notice.</PARA>

I also want to thank the families of members and their staff on this side of the House for putting up with the absences, particularly the very late nights, and the hours that we have to work. This is a place that requires tremendously long hours and absences from home. I wish them well in getting together over the Christmas break when they do not have those distractions.</PARA></TALK.START>

I thank the Australian public for putting up with the outbursts, as they see them&mdash;we get comments from time to time&mdash;but the rigour and hard fought dimension of this place is an important part of our democracy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the work that you have done over the course of the year. I want to particularly pay tribute at the close of this year to the work of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It is a funny job being Prime Minister, I imagine; practically everybody in the country thinks they can do the job and that they can probably do it better than the person who is holding the office. You get advised on a daily basis by the newspapers how it should be performed. You get advised by a wealth of people who have probably never engaged in politics as to what you should be doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), I probably work closer with the Prime Minister than any other person. I know the stresses that the great office involves. I know the difficulties of the choices that have to be made, the pressure of the incessant media, which is something that has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changed politics dramatically over the last decades, the travel that is now involved and the expectations. I want to pay particular tribute to the Prime Minister for his leadership through the course of this year, for the leadership he is showing in the very difficult circumstances of the current Wik debate and for the way in which he has over the course of his term as Prime Minister managed to overcome some personal difficulties with health in his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to pay tribute to the Deputy Prime Minister. He is one of the great characters of Australian politics. We are constantly asked about the Deputy Prime Minister and the colour that he brings to the office. He obviously has had great challenges in his personal situation and in his party. I pay tribute to the calibre and the quality of the way in which he has managed to deal with those throughout the course of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the opposition: what we ask of an opposition is that they be worthy opponents. I have enjoyed our time during the year. I enjoy the company of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and I enjoy answering questions. I would ask that he be allowed to ask a few more questions next year. To the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean): all we ask is that we have worthy opponents, and during the year it has been like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that you always notice when you go to international events and meet your counterparts is that there are very few prime ministers or treasurers that go into parliament on a regular basis and answer questions. If you look around the region, you will see that very few elected people hold these offices at all. When they go into the parliament it is a very rare event. It is spoken of in hushed terms as a major event in the course of their year&mdash;that they may have to go to the parliament and answer questions on a particular issue. If you look around the world, I think there would be very few parliaments in which ministers would attend every day and answer questions.</PARA>

Certainly not in the UK, certainly not in presidential systems and certainly not in our region would you see senior ministers appearing in a parliament and being prepared to answer questions on any issue. Of course, the government has made it so&mdash;all ministers attend every day. That does have a difficulty in terms of their time constraints, but it is the stuff of politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view has always been that the House of Representatives is the great political chamber in this country and I still believe it is where governments are made and broken. I still believe it is where reputations are made and broken. And I still believe it is the stuff of politics. Notwithstanding the media and all of the other avenues that have now opened, this is still the fulcrum of Australian politics&mdash;and, frankly, I think that is right. I think the Leader of the Opposition probably thinks that is right, too. I know the Prime Minister thinks that is right, and ever may it be thus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute to the parliamentary staff; I will not go through them all. What I admire about the parliamentary staff is their professional detachment, that they can sit here in the midst of the fury and be professionally detached and independent. How they do it, I do not know, but it is an exceptional skill, and may it ever continue. I admire very much the unending politeness of the clerks and, indeed, of all of the staff that are here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank my own staff&mdash;Pat and those in the Melbourne office and those in the Canberra office headed by Phil and Lizzie. I want to wish Tony Smith all the best as he goes to his wedding in two weeks time. We know the difficulties that the parliamentary role plays in relation to our families and it is the same for many of our staff. To the whips: you do a great job. To my parliamentary secretary, Senator Ian Campbell, and assistant minister, Rod Kemp: I appreciate your support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have not lived through an Expenditure Review Committee, you have not lived through a government. I have now been through two of them in the course of one year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ought to say on a personal level that I am lucky to be going into this Christmas with a three year old who is beginning to understand her first Christmas. It never ceases to amaze me the wonderment of children at Christmas; how it brings home to you the importance of the Christmas story and our families. We spend far too much time away from our families. This must be the one job in the world where you are expected to live in one town and work in another. I do not think any other occupation would demand that of somebody in a senior position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, our families put up with an awful lot. I want to thank my own family for everything that they put up with, but I want to acknowledge the families of all of the members. They do it tough; they have to answer and account for things they have little or no control over. I do not think I would ever plead for more understanding for the members or the ministers&mdash;I just think you are in cloud&hyphen;cuckoo&hyphen;land if you ask for that&mdash;but I would plead for the families who do not choose these occupations and, frankly, do not have much of an upside in a very difficult lot.</PARA>

Having been here for some time and having had that done to me by whips, I know how angry it used to make me, and I hope that my colleagues are more charitable with me, Ted and Rod than we may have been with the people who had these jobs when we were in that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank in particular Ted, Rod, Alan Griffin and Bob Sercombe for the help they have given me over the last year in their capacities as whips and assistant whips.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank Joan Connor and Ann Stewart in my own office for, first of all, putting up with me and, secondly, for putting up with my colleagues. As the leader said, Joan has dealt with more egos than he has had breakfasts. Ann, as she has come on board in this office over the last few months, has found that the Whip's office operates a lot differently from how the Speaker's office operated when she worked there with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also thank both my leader and Simon Crean for the kind words that they said about me, and say how nice it is to work with people like Simon and Kim, both of whom have a great affection for the way parliament works. I think in Kim Beazley you have a person who is a parliamentarian in the old&hyphen;fashioned mould of a parliamentarian. I think that is what made him a great Leader of the House and is what will make him a great Prime Minister. Simon Crean has learnt that role from him very well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also quickly thank those people from the parliamentary staff who have helped us over the year&mdash;Kate in the dining room, and Narelle, Brian and Craig in the transport office. One of the things that has been consistent in the nearly 18 years that I have been here is that you always see Brian smiling at you on the way out of a night and smiling at you in the morning when you come in. As Kim Beazley said, it is a shame to see that economic rationalism has caught up with them and that they are losing their jobs. We hope that they are able to come back as part&hyphen;timers and we hope that they will be happy in doing that. Can I also thank the drivers who look after us here, and also all of those people who make our job easier to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank people on both sides of the House for their friendship over the last 12 months. I wish all members and their families a happy and holy Christmas. As a number of people have commented here in this valedictory debate, the people who pay the real penalty for us in this job are our families. They are the ones who do it tough, and at least this year we will have a bit of a longer break with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I thank you for the friendship that you and I have had over the year. I have now found out what a terrific job you had and I think you have found out what a lousy job I had. We have both found that the reversal of roles has been an interesting experience. Thank you for your friendship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I thank all my colleagues once again for their forbearance over the year. We look forward to a good year next year and, hopefully, when we are doing the valedictories next year, we might have had an early election and we will be over there and we will be telling you fellows how you had better enjoy it on this side again for another 13 years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow. If that is the case, there is still transmission time required for the paperwork to come across from the Senate for the House of Representatives to deal with the matter, so we could, however, still be in for a very long day and a late night. I am proposing to briefly discuss this with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean). As we had said earlier, we propose that we will sit at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. There are some government bills. There are some bills to be introduced. There is some government business. We can deal with that in the period between 10 o'clock and 12 o'clock. I propose a lunch period through till 2.30 and then we can resume at 2.30.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that tomorrow we might have an opportunity for an extended adjournment debate, because there would be members wanting to get things on the record before we rise for the Christmas break. So I would expect to have that in the afternoon, and any other government business. Depending on our assessment of the time, I could foresee us then adjourning the House during the afternoon, with a resumption in the early evening or in the late evening, depending on our expectations of matters coming across from the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed, upon the completion of these valedictories, salutations, felicitations and the like, that there would be an adjournment debate as well tonight, Mr Speaker. I think there are some honourable members proposing to make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I begin my remarks by thanking the members of the opposition, who have provided members on this side of the chamber with infotainment during the year. I thank them for their cooperation and agreement on some issues&mdash;I would like to say more, but that is not the case&mdash;throughout the year. It is, of course, of assistance to the proper management of the House to be able to pass simple issues in the House without too many accusations and chest beating and claims of political 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conspiracies. When that has occasionally happened, we do thank the members of the opposition for their cooperation, and members who are without party, otherwise known as the Independents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), I thank them for their contribution to the parliament and wish them best for Christmas and the new year. To the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean), he has had a usual year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a stop press note from the PLO that there are still some bills to introduce this afternoon before the adjournment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Manager of Opposition Business was chucked out three times last year and he was chucked out three times this year, so basically he has neither progressed nor regressed.</PARA>

To your staff, Mr Speaker, and to all those associated with the job that you do, our sincere best wishes and thanks, and our thanks also for the job you have carried out during the year.

It is sad that she is going to be leaving this job, but it is an incredibly demanding job, and people do come and go a bit as PLOs. I think members on both sides would join with me in thanking her and recognising how Jeannie has carried out her tasks with great distinction. Jeannie, you will be sorely missed by us all, particularly those in my own office. Yours is a stressful job. I commend you for your loyalty and commitment and your ability to retain your sanity, despite having to deal with us all on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis. We wish you the very best for the future and offer you our most sincere thanks. I do that, as I say, on my own

Thank you to Marlene Armstrong, the switchboard supervisor, and all her staff, who provide a very valuable service, which I use on a regular basis, as I know all members do. The telephonists are the first point of contact for members of the public who ring in looking for us, and so that is an important job in maintaining contact with constituents and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank the cleaning and maintenance staff, who allow us to retain some standards, the gardeners, the gym staff, the staff in the cafeteria, the staff at Qantas and the airline offices, the staff at Aussie's&mdash;the two Doms, and Sarah, and Ming&mdash;and the staff in the Ministerial Wing Support Section who service our offices so efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to make some remarks about some with whom I have been close during this year for the management of various responsibilities I have.

It is one of those behind the scenes jobs that require a bit of touch, skill and political understanding. He has all of those things and did a good job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chief Government Whip, Neil Andrew, and his whip colleagues&mdash;Stewart McArthur, Peter Slipper, Noel Hicks and Larry Anthony, as well as their staff, particularly Geraldine&mdash;I thank them. Neil is a very good person to work with, and I do appreciate that close working relationship. It is a demanding job. He does it very well. It is good that we have a person of his calibre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same vein, Alan Cadman is here. He is a parliamentary secretary. He is a bit of a jack&hyphen;of&hyphen;all&hyphen;trades. But in this last 12 months, he has been the Chief Government Whip. We decided to promote small business into the cabinet, and to give it a lot of fire power. So, naturally, the Prime Minister turned to Alan Cadman. Alan, I do appreciate the good work that we have done together. I think that has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been a very successful arrangement, and I thank you for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Lynton Crosby, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party; his newly appointed deputy, John Burstin; and all of the staff of the secretariat: I thank them. They, of course, provide an invaluable service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my own parliamentary colleagues&mdash;to the Prime Minister: I thank him for his leadership in what has been a very good year for the country with the big reforms we have introduced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the departmental staff, can I say too&mdash;and it is really a comment for all those departmental people who are involved in the machinery of government at the parliamentary end&mdash;I thank them for their work.

I make special mention of Stephen Jauncey, who unfortunately is leaving the department soon to take up a career in the private sector. His sharp mind will be missed by all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I thank my electorate staff, the unsung heroes, the shadow members for Flinders. I thank them for the work that they do for me personally. It is greatly appreciated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise in this debate in the parliament, bringing these valedictory sentiments. I would like first to acknowledge, sir, the role that you have played in this parliament. I bring you the greetings not only of the backbench but of myself and my family. Your friendship with me goes back over at least 12 years, and yet you have not allowed the mutual regard we have for each other to in any way prejudice the decisions you have made on behalf of the whip's office&mdash;and, in fact, as all members have recognised, you have been very even-handed in the judgments you have made as Speaker. I have sat here frequently in awe of the spontaneity that is demanded of the Speaker in making judg 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12134"> ment, and I freely acknowledge the way in which you have given wise judgment at not only short notice but next to no notice. I hope that in this Christmas and New Year period you enjoy a very restful and refreshing time, because you certainly deserve it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would extend similar sentiments to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), and their families. This is, as all have said, a very demanding vocation. But this is a place in which we gain an increasing respect for each other. After having spent 14 years in this place, I have yet to recall anyone who has come in and left more polarised than they were when they arrived. In fact, I think quite the contrary happens; you tend to come to this place and discover that there is room for cooperation that you had not envisaged possible when first you entered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I share in the sentiment that has been expressed by so many in these valedictory speeches and say that I extend to all in the parliament, both the government and the opposition, in this Christmas period the sentiments of the season. I want particularly to acknowledge the Leader of the House, Mr Peter Reith, the member for Flinders, and Cate Clunies&hyphen;Ross, his assistant&mdash;for, without them, my task would be all but impossible. I have had nothing but the utmost of cooperation from the Leader of the House, as you would expect. And I must say that Cate Clunies&hyphen;Ross came into her position as I came into mine, and she has been very helpful in responding to any request from the whip's office and has been an integral part of the team. So to Cate and Gerard I also extend all the best for this time of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my fellow whips&mdash;Stewart McArthur, Peter Slipper, Noel Hicks and Larry Anthony&mdash;the role of being whips in government is, in fact, a great privilege. I have been part of a team that I think has been very effective, and it would not have worked without the cooperation of those four gentlemen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly, I must single out Mr Macarthur, who has been a friend of mine in this place since the day he entered, which was just a few months after I had entered the parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. I am very pleased to say that cooperating with him has made my task a very easy one. And Mr Cadman, who has already been acknowledged in the valedictory speeches, has been gracious and generous enough to make sure that any information that I, as the incoming chief whip, needed from him, as the outgoing chief whip, following his promotion to parliamentary secretary, was freely given. I should also acknowledge the role of the Senate whips, particularly Senator Calvert, in cooperating with the House of Representatives, from a government perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary for me to equally acknowledge that, in the role of Chief Government Whip, I have had a close working relationship with the Chief Opposition Whip, Mr McLeay, and with his team, Mr Ted Grace and Mr Rod Sawford. Everyone knows that Leo McLeay is no soft touch; not even the dried sultanas and almonds from the government whip's office have been sufficient to win Leo over. But what needs to be freely acknowledged at any time, particularly at this Christmas season, is that on no occasion in the last six months has Leo McLeay ever said one thing to me and done another. He has been absolutely a man of his word, as I expected he would be, and I freely acknowledge that. We have a very effective, I hope, working relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit difficult being Chief Government Whip working with the Chief Opposition Whip because, if we are not being cooperative and the place gets into turmoil, clearly we are in trouble. And if we are being cooperative, then the backbench on both sides tend to see us as being just a little too amiable. But, in this difficult situation, Mr McLeay nonetheless has made it possible for there to be sufficient difficulty in gaining what you want to retain some respect from the backbench, and sufficient cooperation for the parliament to run smoothly. I am grateful for that, and I extend to him and his family the greetings of the season.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said, this chamber would not work without the cooperation of the clerks. I freely acknowledge how helpful they have been to both sides of the chamber, and I wish them all the best.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12135">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particular greetings must go to the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Jeannie Hall, who leaves us. Jeannie has been incredibly cooperative and professional in making sure that the business of the day is delivered. Next to the Leader of the House, I suspect that I spend more time in Jeannie's office than anyone else. It is always in an atmosphere of cooperation, it is always in a very professional way, and Jeannie has been not only professional and cooperative but friendly in ensuring that the task assigned to all of us is, in fact, delivered&mdash;and delivered in as amiable a manner as is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my honour, as Chief Government Whip, to be Chief Government Whip in a party that has a very large backbench. It would be less than honest not to acknowledge that, from time to time, these have been turbulent times, as there have been for all governments seeking to make progressive, responsible and not always popular decisions. I think the backbench of this coalition government has exercised a great deal of patience in the face of a number of difficult decisions. I am grateful to them for their patience and their cohesion. I wish them all a very restful Christmas and the opportunity to return in 1998 refreshed and once again able to serve their electorates as they have throughout 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that there are a number of people who have been overlooked. I acknowledge the role of every staff member in this parliament. I acknowledge particularly the role of my own staff. I must single out Geraldine Rath, Mary&hyphen;Jill Johnston and David Little for particular mention. Without exception, I have found every officer of this parliament to be courteous and efficient in the way in which they go about doing the tasks assigned to them. I am grateful for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the season of gratitude. The whole message of Christmas is one of goodwill and thankfulness. I happen to think that we, as Australians, all have a great deal to be grateful for, no matter which party may happen to be in power. This is also a time when we focus particularly on the strengths of family bonds and on renewing friendships. I extend to all members of the House and to all the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who are in partnership with us in this building and who help to make it possible for us to do our job the season's greetings and good wishes for the new year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very conscious of the advancing hour. I will do my utmost to be as brief as possible. Mr Speaker, I would like to thank you very much for the relationship that we have developed since this parliament started, when you became Speaker and I became Deputy Speaker. We entered the parliament together on 1 December 1984. The 13th anniversary was on Monday of this week. In all that time there has never been one cross word between us. I want to acknowledge that. In particular, I appreciate your assistance, your cooperation and the very good relationship we enjoy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly endorse what every other speaker in this debate has said about the clerks, the drivers and all the people who render such wonderful service to this parliament. I will not repeat what other members have said, because I am certain that all those people who have been mentioned by previous speakers know the goodwill that I have towards them and the high regard in which I hold them. I want to thank Harry Jenkins, the member for Scullin, who is the Second Deputy Speaker, and the 10 members of the Speaker's Panel who assist both the Speaker and me in the smooth running of this chamber and the Main Committee. It is a good team which works very well together. I am very grateful to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is inappropriate in a situation like this not to talk about your family, if only briefly, and I will. I am particularly fortunate to have the full support of my wife and my family. I believe it is because Suzanne is so active in the electorate when I am here for so much time that I have developed the ability to be in two places at once. I cannot walk on water, but I am in two places at the same time. She holds the record in Cowper of presenting three flags to three separate organisations in the one evening when I was here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take a few minutes to talk about my staff, because they are the front line. I think the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) mentioned his shadow members for Flinders. I do not have very many staff, so I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12136"> will name them individually. As Deputy Speaker, I have Betty&hyphen;Ann Daly, who has worked within this parliament for a long time. She worked as your clerk for many years, Mr Speaker. She is affectionately known as BA. BA does a wonderful job as the Deputy Speaker's clerk, with the great stress of changing speakers lists at the drop of a pen. She does an excellent job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate I have three staff members, as do all members, except for the Independents, who have more. Pamela Langford has been with me since I was first elected. She is my chief of staff, member's delegate, office manager, immigration expert and adviser to people in the electorate on so many issues. I want to include Diane Leahy, who worked for Ian Sinclair for some eight years before she came to me six or seven years ago, and Bethany Langford, who is my research and media assistant. All of these women who work in the Coffs Harbour office are subjected to an enormous amount of stress. We never ever catch up with the work; we never catch up with the correspondence. It is always on their shoulders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly, in recent years there has been a growth in the number of people who are concerned or upset about things. They tend to express their frustration on the people who are trying to help them. My staff members&mdash;as I am sure are the staff of every member&mdash;are subjected to rudeness and abuse, which is not part of their job. They are not paid to deal with that, but they do so with extreme goodwill and a great deal of tolerance, sympathy and understanding. It is a hard job to look after people. I will forever say that the `p' in politics stands for people. I want to take this opportunity to thank those staff members and acknowledge the fantastic job they do in serving, as do all of our staff, the people of Australia. That is why we are all here.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to reiterate the good wishes which, on this occasion, flow from both sides of the House. It is a fairly unusual exercise, given the way in which this parliament is designed for an opposition to attack the government and for ministers to attack members of the opposition. I want to particularly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pay a tribute to the officers of the House because we who live in it on a day&hyphen;by&hyphen;day basis often undervalue the importance of the Westminster system. It is a system which has stood the test of time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to pay a tribute to you, Mr Speaker. Of all the difficult jobs in this House, there is probably none more difficult than that of the Speaker. You try to keep us in order when we are disorderly. You try to encourage younger members. You try to balance the difficulties that go with this institution and, at the same time, keep in touch with the standing orders and make decisions often on the run. On the whole, in what is a very difficult situation, you have upheld the traditions of this very important and high office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to mention, as a travelling companion, your role as the Speaker of the parliament in leading the IPU delegation from this parliament. That also has been a difficult and taxing task and I think you have given leadership to the Australian delegation. Despite the fact that we are not the largest or the most significant delegation in that assembly of parliamentarians, I think we are valued for the stance that we take and the roles that we play there. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to thank you for the job that you have done, for the leadership that you give this House and for your valiant and often frustrated attempts to keep this place in order.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to remove superannuation from the allowable award matters set out in subsection 89A(2) of the act. The bill will ensure that businesses will no longer have to meet the complex and confusing standards imposed by the current regime which requires them to comply with award superannuation obligations on top of another set of requirements provided for in the superannuation guarantee legislation. The result will be a single set of superannuation requirements which will be simpler for businesses to administer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Workplace Relations Act will complement the new choice of funds arrangements provided for in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997  and, in combination, these bills deliver genuine superannuation reform. The amendments to the Workplace Relations Act will prevent the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from dealing with disputes about superannuation by arbitration. The commission will not be able to prevent or settle disputes about superannuation by making awards or orders or maintain the settlement of such disputes by varying awards or orders. The amendments will also have the effect that superannuation provisions will be removed from existing awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An amendment to subsection 89A(7) of the act will prohibit the making of exceptional matters orders about superannuation. The proposal to exclude superannuation from awards is not new. When the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Bill 1996 was originally introduced in May last year, the allowable award matters did not include superannuation. The amendments, subsequently agreed with the Australian Democrats, added superannuation to the allowable matters, but it was always intended as part of that agreement that this would only be a temporary measure, and that superannuation would be removed from the allowable matters as part of the `choice of funds` legislative package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to complementing the government's `choice of funds' legislation, these amendments will also enhance the process of simplifying awards. The removal of superannuation provisions will remove a layer of complex detail from awards and relieve employers of the burden of complying with an extra set of obligations which have done nothing more than add to the complexity of superannuation administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will enable employers to continue to use existing notional earnings bases in order that they do not incur additional superannuation costs as a result of providing choice of fund. The government will introduce provisions in the next parliamentary sittings to enable employers to continue to use existing earnings bases following the removal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12138"> of superannuation as an allowable matter under federal awards. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill implements two key initiatives of the coalition government, namely, choice of superannuation funds and the savings rebate. It also builds on the government's program of reducing compliance costs for small business by introducing a CGT assets register and changes to the withholding tax arrangements. The bill also includes a number of other 1997 budget announcements which enhance the integrity of the tax system relating to franking credit trading and dividend streaming and private company loans.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Savings Tax Offset&mdash;Savings Rebate</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings rebate will reduce the tax paid by Australians on their savings and investment income. Our approach is universal&mdash;it is open to all Australians and all types of savings. It will particularly benefit Australian families, older Australians who have saved for their retirement and individuals who have built up their businesses and derive a return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rebate will apply from 1 July 1998 to undeducted superannuation contributions made by employees and the self&hyphen;employed and net personal income from savings and investment, including net business income, up to an annual cap of $3,000. In the first year it will apply at a transitional rate of 7.5 per cent and increase to 15 per cent thereafter. This will deliver a tax saving of up to $450 per year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rebate is substantially broader than the government's 1996 election commitment to provide a savings rebate and replaces Labor's plan for l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts that were never paid and its complex and inequitable substitute of matching compulsory employee contributions with government contributions. Labor's proposal would have provided no assistance to those who were retired or were otherwise ineligible to contribute to superannuation. The rebate will provide an incentive to save in a way which is fair, allowing individuals to choose the form most suited to their needs, recognising that individuals have to save for life cycle needs as well as for retirement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Choice of Superannuation Funds</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget reforms to give employees greater choice over which superannuation fund or retirement savings account will receive superannuation contributions made on their behalf by their employer. The government announced enhancements to this policy on 25 November 1997 which significantly reduce the administrative burden on employers and provide more flexible and responsive arrangements to address the retirement income needs of all Australians. These enhancements follow extensive consultation and have met with a positive reaction from industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The choice of fund arrangements are designed to give employees greater choice and control over their superannuation savings, which in turn give them greater sense of ownership of these savings. The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will enable employers to continue to use existing notional earnings bases to which they are entitled in order that they not incur additional superannuation costs as a result of providing choice of fund. The government will also introduce provisions in the next parliamentary sittings to enable employers to continue to use existing notional earning bases following the removal of superannuation as an allowable matter under federal awards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12139">
<PARA STYLE="Para">CGT Asset Register</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also implements and extends the small business deregulation task force's recommendation to introduce an asset register for capital gains tax purposes. The bill will allow all taxpayers to transfer all or some of the information they are required to retain for capital gains tax purposes into an asset register that has been certified as correct by a suitably qualified person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where information about an asset is entered into an asset register, the original record must be kept for five years from the date the entry is certified, rather than for five years from the date of disposal as is currently required. This will eliminate the need for taxpayers to keep source documents for lengthy periods of time. The new rules will apply to entries in an asset register that are certified on or after 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Payments of RPS, PAYE and PPS Deductions to Commissioner</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill introduces a new three&hyphen;tiered system for remittance obligations under the reportable payments system, pay as you earn and the prescribed payments system to commence on 1 July 1998. Small remitters&mdash;businesses with total deductions not exceeding $25,000&mdash;will have the option to remit these payments on a quarterly basis rather than on a monthly basis. This will provide over 300,000 small businesses with the opportunity to defer the remittance of $500 million in withheld amounts in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new simpler system, large remitters&mdash;who have total deductions in excess of $1 million&mdash;will be required to remit electronically and within an average of seven days, which is in step with commercial trends. Medium remitters&mdash;who have total deductions in excess of $25,000 but not exceeding $1 million&mdash;will be required to remit monthly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Distributions from Private Companies</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is being amended to ensure that payments and loans made by a private company to a shareholder or a shareholder's associate are treated as assessable dividends to the extent that there are realised or unrealised profits in the company. The provisions contain exclusions from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this treatment for repayments of genuine debts, payments and loans to other companies, payments that are otherwise assessable, ordinary business loans made on the company's usual terms for arms&hyphen;length loans of that type and loans meeting minimum interest rate and maximum term criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The payment or loan treated as a dividend will not be frankable, but making the payment or loan will result in a debit to the company's franking account in the same way as if the dividend had been franked. The provisions will also apply to payments and loans made by a private company to third parties where there is an agreement that the third party will advance, loan or credit a similar amount to a shareholder, or an associate of a shareholder, of the original lender. Loan guarantees will also be taken to be payments under this provision. The amendment will apply from today, the date of introduction of the amendments into the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Franking of Dividends and Other Distributions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will implement some of the measures announced by the government in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget to prevent franking credit trading and dividend streaming, namely, the introduction of a general anti&hyphen;avoidance rule and anti-streaming measures. These measures are designed to protect the integrity of the company tax imputation system. The remaining measures announced in the budget will be introduced into the parliament as soon as possible. Subject to a transitional measure explained in the bill, these amendments apply from 7.30 p.m, AEST, 13 May 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Income Tax Deductions: Constitutional Convention</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, the government announced the introduction of a limited tax deduction of up to $1,000 for expenses incurred in the course of contesting election to the Constitutional Convention. The deduction will be available from 1 July 1997 for the 1997&hyphen;98 year of income only.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Income Tax Deductions: National Nurses' Memorial Trust</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide for income tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12140"> deductions for donations to the National Nurses Memorial Trust which are made after 3 September 1997 and before 4 September 1999.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Sales Tax: Malaysian Visiting Force</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill amends the sales tax legislation to give effect to sales tax aspects of the status of forces agreement between the government of Australia and the government of Malaysia which was entered into on 3 February 1997. The amendment will apply to any dealing from royal assent of the amendment. The agreement allows visiting force members, civilian component and their dependants to import a number of items into Australia free from duty. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R409">Insurance Laws Amendment Bill</XREF>  is an omnibus bill that amends three separate acts relating to the supervision of insurance activities. The most significant feature of this bill is that it will enhance the security arrangements applicable to the authorisation of Lloyd's of London underwriters in Australia and, as a consequence, significantly improve the regulatory protection for Lloyd's Australian policyholders. The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1997 also makes a number of other technical amendments to insurance legislation, some of which I will outline below.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Lloyd's of London</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lloyd's is a major international insurance market based and operated in London where 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> individuals, known as `names', and corporate members form syndicates to accept insurance risks. Lloyd's is a significant participant in the global reinsurance market and an important participant in the Australian insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all insurance underwriters in Australia, Lloyd's underwriters are subject to the Insurance Act 1973. However, in recognition of the unique structure of Lloyd's, provisions governing the authorisation and conduct of business of Lloyd's underwriters are specifically set down in part VII of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lloyd's underwriters incurred large property and liability losses which threatened the future viability of the Lloyd's market. During the last four years, Lloyd's has responded to this problem by developing and implementing a major `reconstruction and renewal' plan which will enable Lloyd's to rebuild into a strong and viable market. The amendments set out in this bill will change the regulatory requirements for Lloyd's underwriters in Australia so as to accommodate the initiatives in Lloyd's `reconstruction and renewal' plan while at the same time substantially enhancing the regulatory protection for Lloyd's underwriters' Australian policyholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the key protection for Lloyd's underwriters' Australian policyholders is the requirement that Lloyd's lodge with the Treasurer a covenant given by a bank. The value of the covenant during any financial year is the amount of premium income sourced from Australia by Lloyd's underwriters. Some major shortcomings have been identified with this security. In the first place, Lloyd's underwriters are reliant on a third party, namely, a bank, to continue to conduct business in Australia. In addition, while the covenant is intended to support outstanding claims liabilities in Australia, its value, based as it is on premiums, has no direct relationship to those liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the strong potential for losses to far exceed the value of premiums written, there is a distinct possibility that at any point in time the amount available under the covenant may be insufficient to fully support the outstanding claims liabilities. Furthermore, in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12141"> the event Lloyd's underwriters ceased business in Australia, Lloyd's would no longer receive premiums and, consequently, the value of the covenant would rapidly diminish. However, Lloyd's underwriters would likely retain substantial outstanding claims liabilities in Australia for many subsequent years, and these claims would, under the present arrangement, be left with little or no asset security support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Insurance Laws Amendment Bill  is designed to remedy these shortcomings in the current security arrangements for Lloyd's. The bill will replace the bank covenant with new security arrangements involving the creation of trust funds. The trust funds will hold secure tangible assets in Australia to a value determined primarily by reference to outstanding claims liabilities of Lloyd's underwriters. The use of security trust funds in this way will ensure that at all times Lloyd's Australian liabilities have adequate financial support in Australia, thereby significantly improving the protection afforded to Lloyd's Australian policyholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also introduce new regulatory powers for Lloyd's similar to those already available in respect of body corporate insurers, such as the power to obtain additional information, to carry out an investigation, to give directions and to require actuarial assessments. These powers will both improve the ability to protect the interests of Lloyd's Australian policyholders and enhance competitive neutrality by bringing the supervision of Lloyd's more closely into line with that which applies to insurance companies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Technical amendments to insurance legislation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1997  also makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to insurance legislation. The bill amends the Insurance Act 1973 to streamline the processes for form setting and lodgement of accounts and statements with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner by authorised insurers in Australia. These reforms will produce considerable administrative and cost benefits for insurers, without compromising prudential requirements.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various amendments are made to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 to improve the operation of that act. The amendments will remove certain technical difficulties, clarify interpretation of the act by inserting additional definitions and increase consumer protection by strengthening broker disclosure notification requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also amends the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to, among other things, increase the scope of that act to include non&hyphen;commercial marine pleasure craft. Presently, marine pleasure craft are subject to the Marine Insurance Act 1909. The Marine Insurance Act 1909, however, is primarily designed for insurance relating to the international carriage of goods and does not contain many of the consumer protection provisions which are available under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. This amendment will enable owners of non&hyphen;commercial pleasure craft to receive the level of protection in insurance dealings which is available under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. Other amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 set out in this bill will improve information flows between contracting parties and refine the insured's duty of disclosure. I also provide the explanatory memorandum to the bill. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Elections</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends a number of election provisions in the 1936 act to remove the requirement for elections to be in writing and given to the commissioner. This will make these provisions consistent with self&hyphen;assessment. Some elections involving two or more persons are now referred to as agreements. A technical correction will be made to the anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions in part IVA to exclude any such agreements from the scope of tax avoidance schemes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rulings</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the 1936 act to extend the time for amending an assessment to give effect to a private ruling. This change to the amendment rules will apply to those cases where a taxpayer requests a ruling within the four&hyphen;year time limit but the commissioner does not provide the ruling until the period for amending the assessment has expired. This change will apply to any ruling request made after 30 June 1992, when the private binding rulings system commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to clarify the definition of year of income for private ruling purposes. The amendments will apply from the date of royal assent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends a technical defect in the company current year loss rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (the 1997 act) which relates to the calculation of the film component of a company's tax loss for an income year.

Corrections will also be made to provisions in the 1936 act that set out the rules for calculating the amount of the deduction for car parking expenses incurred by self&hyphen;employed persons. These amendments will apply to expenses incurred on and from 12 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Superannuation</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill amends the 1936 act to ensure that an invalidity benefit rolled over to purchase an annuity or superannuation pension retains its tax&hyphen;free status.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Bankrupt estates&mdash;treatment of registered trustee in bankruptcy</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill amends the trust provisions of the 1936 act to ensure that the taxation of bankrupt estates administered by a registered trustee will be given the same tax treatment as estates administered by the official receiver. The amendment applies to assessments for the 1996-97 year of income and later years of income.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Public trading trusts&mdash;eligible investment business; meaning of security</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill amends the definition of `eligible investment business' in the provisions dealing with the taxation of income of public trading trusts of the 1936 act to ensure that the definition specifically includes secured loans. The amendment will apply from 16 December 1985, the effective date of those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Demutualisation of insurance companies</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill amends the wording of the provisions in the 1936 act which cancel the franking account balance of life and general insurance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12143"> companies when they demutualise. The change will clarify the meaning of the provision and it is necessary that it applies to mutual insurance companies and mutual affiliate insurance companies that existed at 7.30 p.m., by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 9 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Spouse rebate</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill amends the spouse rebate provision in the 1936 act so that benefits paid to a non&hyphen;dependent spouse are taken into account in calculating his or her entitlement to the rebate. The amendment applies for the first whole year of income that begins after the date of commencement of the amending act and later years of income.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Foreign source income measures</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill makes two minor amendments to the foreign source income measures in the 1936 act. The first amendment will correct a drafting error in the definition of `associate'. The second amendment will correct a deficiency in the existing law which does not allow a foreign tax credit for Australian tax paid by a foreign investment fund where the calculation method is used to calculate the income accrued from the interest in the fund. The first amendment applies from the date of royal assent. The second amendment is to ensure that taxpayers are not subject to double taxation and will apply from 1 January 1993, the date the foreign investment fund measures commenced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Franking rebates for life assurance companies, superannuation funds, registered organisations and pooled superannuation trusts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill amends the provisions in the 1936 act which relate to the calculation of franking rebates for life assurance companies, superannuation funds, registered organisations and pooled superannuation trusts so that, where these entities are in receipt of trust or partnership income, their franking rebate entitlements are the same as they would be if the income was received directly.

This will ensure that the assets of the public entity will not be taken into account in determining whether the trust satisfies the $5 million threshold test. The amendment will apply to disposals of assets from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Reportable payments system</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Provisional tax</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill amends the provisional tax rules in the 1936 act so that a refund of provisional tax credit that is due to a taxpayer from a credit assessment can be applied only against provisional tax due and payable. Currently, where a credit amendment is made to an assessment, the credit is applied against provisional tax notified even though it is not yet due and payable. This is inconsistent with the treatment for normal assessments. The amendment will correct the anomaly. The amendment commences on 1 July 1998.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to increase the attractiveness of the Australian Capital Territory to potential investors by removing the perceived disincentive to business and other investment, brought about by the limit of land tenure to 99-year estates, as distinct from freehold title enjoyed elsewhere in Australia. The strengthening of land tenure security in the ACT for both residential and business purposes will deliver on an important election commitment. Section 9 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 provides that no crown lands in the territory may be sold or disposed of for freehold estates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 provides for land in the ACT to be National Land or Territory Land. National Land is land so declared by the Commonwealth minister as land used or intended to be used by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. Land that is not National Land is Territory Land. The ACT government manages Territory Land on behalf of the Commonwealth and may grant, dispose of, acquire, hold and administer estates in Territory Land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACT government has sought an amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 to enable it to issue leases for a maximum term of 999 years. The Chief Minister, Mrs Carnell, has cited the 99-year limit as antiquated and unduly restrictive. ACT business representatives have supported the proposed amendment. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Effect of the bill</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment will increase the maximum permissible limit for the grant of new estates in Territory Land to 999 years. The bill will not provide for automatic extension of existing estates. A leaseholder seeking a term longer than 99 years will need to apply to the ACT government for a new grant. The ACT government has indicated that only a modest administrative charge will apply to the grant of new leases to existing leaseholders, provided no terms of the lease, other than the lease period, are changed. The proposed amendment removes the reference to `or such longer period as is prescribed' so that no terms of estate greater than 999 years will be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations currently applicable which relate to 999-year leases granted for tertiary education or church purposes prior to the introduction of self&hyphen;government in the ACT, will be unaffected by the proposed amendment. The act is proposed to take effect upon receiving the royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment will have no direct impact on Commonwealth revenue or outgoings. However, it is intended that the amendment will bring positive effects to the ACT economy by increasing the territory's attractiveness to investors. I commend the bill to the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I first of all, just for the record, advise the House that this delegation was very ably led by the President of the Senate, Senator Margaret Reid, with the support of my colleagues the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) and the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), who will be speaking later in this debate, and with the support of Senator Sandy Macdonald. We would like to place on the record our appreciation to the many people who helped organise this delegation. In particular, I would like to place on record our appreciation to Anne Hazelton for the great work she did as the secretary to the delegation. The Australian High Commissioner to South Africa, Ian Porter, and his staff did an excellent job in arranging the program and Matt Anderson, one of the High Commission staff who accompanied the delegation, did a brilliant job in making sure that the delegation's program ran to time. We had an excellent opportunity to learn a lot about South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to meeting the President of the National Council of Provinces and the Speaker of the National Assembly, we had several opportunities to meet with a number of the South African Parliament's committees and also with Professor Asmal, the Minister for Water Affairs and Forestry. Members might be interested to know that Australia's exports to South Africa have grown 300 per cent in the last four years and they are expected to exceed $1 billion this year. So it is a country 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very important to Australia economically. It is a country that is obviously in a period of transition, having only had non-racial general elections in April 1994. It is a country that is implementing a large number of reforms to its economy. There is a revolution in the way the government is seeking to deliver services to South African citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very impressed with the efforts the government is making in extending clean drinking water and electricity and affordable housing to many of its citizens. For me personally, our discussions with the Deputy Chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Alex Boraine, were fascinating. It was a tremendous inspiration to many of the Australian delegates to sit down with representatives from all of the different parties and racial groups in South Africa and to see the way they are seeking to work together, despite their wide political differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other highlight of the trip was a visit to Robben Island with the ANC Chief Whip, Henry Makgothie. It was a great honour for the members of the delegation to have a chance to visit the prison at Robben Island and to see the cell where Nelson Mandela spent so many years. As the shadow minister for health, I also had an opportunity to visit a medical centre in the Cape Flats and to see an adult literacy project in Khayelitsha which has been funded by AusAID.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, could I mention that we also had a brief opportunity to visit the grave of Breaker Morant. Sandy Macdonald and other members of the delegation are keen to do what we can to see that grave restored so that the many Australians who visit Pretoria might also have a chance to visit the grave of an Australian who has been immortalised in a great Australian film, filmed in South Australia. With those comments, I will pass on to my colleague, the member for the Northern Territiry (Mr Dondas), who will say a bit more about the delegation's visit and, in particular, about our work at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Mauritius.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12146"> the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to South Africa and the 43rd Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference held in Mauritius in September. I know that time is short, other members have commitments and the hour is late. The South African bilateral visit was very informative for the members who were part of the delegation. We learnt a lot. At the same time, I believe that future South African delegations that come to Australia will have a better understanding of what they are attempting to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 43rd Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference held in Mauritius was a very good conference as far as I was concerned. Some members of the delegation thought that there may have been a bit more meat to the conference. But, as I explained to them at the time, the important thing was the level of fellowship and the opportunity to meet members from other supporting Commonwealth countries to the CPA conference. The honourable member for Dobell and I presented papers at two different times and on two different panels. We were supported by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and Senator Sandy Macdonald.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In brief, I would like to place on record the delegation's thanks to the Mauritius CPA, whose arrangements were of a very high standard. The conference and its facilities were also of a very high standard. The only complaint that the delegates had was that we were on buses for far too long. We were moving between point A and point B for most of the day. But it gave us an opportunity to look at pretty Mauritius.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to place on record my thanks to Anne Hazelton, who was the secretary to our delegation. She worked tirelessly to ensure that the members of the delegation knew of the proceedings and the program as it evolved and were informed if there were any changes. I would like to congratulate her for really looking after us. At the same time I would like to put on record my very sincere thanks to the other members of the delegation, who really made the trip for me and my wife very enjoyable. These trips give us the opportunity to meet not only other members from other Commonwealth countries but also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fellow colleagues from the Australian parliament. You build up a bit of camaraderie, and we became very good friends during that conference. I commend such conferences to my colleagues on this side of the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I stand to make some comments on the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to South Africa and the 43rd Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Mauritius. In 1984 I was the President of Young Labor, and I had Eddie Funde, who was the then ANC representative for Australia, to speak at a conference. That was then a controversial issue even within the Labor Party because the African National Congress was seen by some&mdash;a very small minority at that stage&mdash;as being a terrorist organisation. Now it is recognised that it was a national liberation movement with the support of the overwhelming majority of South Africans. Ten years after that event Nelson Mandela was democratically elected President of South Africa. That is an extraordinary example of how quickly political change can occur. It is also an illustration, as we were reminded during our visit to South Africa, that that change comes at great cost and struggle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just about every parliamentarian we met in South Africa could tell you a story about imprisonment, exile, torture or oppression under the apartheid regime for themselves, their families and their communities. It is an extraordinary achievement that in the three years since democracy was introduced there has been tremendous progress in giving people access to basic facilities such as water, electricity, housing and education. The shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), has mentioned that we attended an adult literacy program that Australia was funding through AusAID. In Khayelitsha we looked at some of the health programs. It is quite astonishing that in South Africa the immunisation rate of children is higher than it is in Australia. Those sorts of achievements in just three years say a lot for the commitment and the ability of the leadership of that nation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12147">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will always remember going to Robben Island with Henry Makgothie, who was imprisoned for a long period at the same time as President Mandela. The experience we got from talking to these people, who had not one hint of bitterness in them&mdash;not a hint&mdash;was very humbling. Put into perspective, the traumas that we go through as Australian parliamentarians are nothing. We are very privileged to be able to participate in an established parliamentary democracy such as we have in Australia. I will always cherish the memories of my first visit to South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to place on record my thanks to our hosts, the South African government, and also to the Mauritius CPA branch for the way they hosted the CPA conference, which was very successful. Also I would like to place on record my support for and thanks to the people associated with the High Commission in South Africa, who really did look after us extraordinarily well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegation was very well led by the President of the Senate, Senator Reid, who acted at all times in a totally bipartisan way. The delegation really did work very hard in terms of the number of meetings and the discussions that we had so that we ensured we got the maximum out of the meetings which were scheduled. It was a very cooperative effort and, indeed, it is true, as the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) has said, that friendships were established across the board between all the members of the delegation. I had not had contact with Senator Reid before, I knew the member for the Northern Territory but I had not had contact with Senator Sandy Macdonald, whom I would now regard as a friend, and their respective spouses got on well with me and the member for Dobell as the Labor Party representatives on the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also put on record my thanks to Anne Hazelton, an extraordinary woman with extraordinary capacities in terms of diligence and attention to detail. No matter what the time of night or day, Anne made sure that everyone was looked after. Fred Peppinck, who works for Senator Reid, also did an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extraordinary job of looking after the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to continuing to support South Africa's progress in coming years. I was at a luncheon last week for a South African parliamentary delegation. Given the very positive role that Australia played in supporting the struggle against apartheid, it is critical that we continue to play a positive role as South Africa emerges as a critical nation on the African continent.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last weekend I attended a function in my electorate which gave me great confidence in the future of the Geelong region. I attended the launch of the City of Greater Geelong's campaign to change the image of the city to promote its economic development and to enhance its social development as well. The theme of that campaign is `Geelong&mdash;Smart Move'. I pay tribute to the Mayor of the City of Greater Geelong, Councillor Gerry Smith, and his fellow councillors for initiating this important campaign, and I commend the skills of Mr David Withington, the architect of the campaign, who has worked diligently to bring this campaign to its present state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated, the theme of the campaign is `Geelong&mdash;Smart Move' and it is designed to give further momentum to Geelong's resurgence and to build pride and confidence among the city's residents and businesses. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12148"> This theme encapsulates Geelong's many natural strengths and positive outlook. It is a smart move to live in Geelong, to invest in Geelong, to relocate your business to Geelong, to educate your children in Geelong, to buy Geelong products, to hold your conference in Geelong and to holiday in Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign has three simple aims: to attract more people to live in the city; to attract new businesses, trade and investment to the region; and to promote the benefits of shopping locally and buying local products and services. A bold and colourful logo has been designed to link the various elements of the campaign and among the early initiatives are local advertising, signs and merchandise to build awareness and support in the community, a range of products to boost business networks and opportunities, a campaign to promote the Geelong waterfront and its major events in Geelong and throughout Victoria and, as I said, a `Buy Geelong' campaign. Early next year Geelong will take on the Melbourne market in earnest with lifestyle messages targeted at potential new residents and the promotion of other sectors will follow as the broader campaign is developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the campaign is designed to be owned by the whole community. Many different organisations, corporations and individuals are working in partnership with the council to make it happen. I was extremely pleased with the degree of community support displayed at the opening of this campaign. I guess we could say: why live in Melbourne when you can live in Geelong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A city like Geelong, with so many strengths and with new-found confidence, can succeed only when the community works together in this way. That degree of cooperation was amply demonstrated this year during the debate over future levels of tariffs in the automotive and TCF industries. Geelong united behind these industries in opposing the seriously flawed Industry Commission recommendations that would have cost tens of thousands of Australian jobs, many of those in my region. In the face of this united opposition, the Howard government implemented Labor's plan for these industries and an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nounced a five&hyphen;year tariff pause from the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's neglect of regional Australia is a talking point not only right across this country but also in the seat of Corio, where we have borne our share of the cutbacks to important regional programs. If the federal government wants to make some amends for its neglect of the region, there are two projects it can directly involve itself in. Firstly, the Princes Freeway between Melbourne and Geelong is vital to the economic development of the Geelong region, but the road is substandard and badly in need of an upgrade. As recognised in the parliamentary committee report handed down last week, economic criteria should be the prime consideration in such decisions, and I call on the government to act now and provide funds in the 1998&hyphen;99 budget for the reconstruction of this freeway as an urgent priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the development of Avalon airport is also of vital importance to the economic future of the Geelong region, and I call on the government to undertake more of an active program of assistance, including a positive response to the request for the airport to be declared a trade zone. Geelong is a resilient and innovative community, and now it is again demonstrating as a community its desire to project a new image and to develop. This resilience is supported by the many natural advantages and strengths enjoyed by Geelong. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="12148"><TITLE>Land Title: Electorate of Cowan</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish tonight to address the issue of land title in my electorate of Cowan, in particular in the Landsdale region. To give some background, some 20 or 30 years ago people who were thinking about their security and their future purchased land out at Landsdale and worked it hard as market gardens, with the thought that the metropolitan spread would get up to there sooner or later. In fact, 20 years later it did. These market gardeners bought their land in good faith and worked their land pretty hard, breaking their backs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With residential development in that area, they particularly wanted to sell their land to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12149"> residential developers but, when the time came to do that, the misuse of market power by a major government organisation, or part&hyphen;government organisation, called Telstra intervened. What I mean by that is that, when they wanted to sell their land, Telstra put up their hand and said, `We need a 1,000&hyphen;metre buffer zone.' There were no easements on their title and no easements on the planning. On any plans that I have seen for that particular region it was all zoned residential. So we have no official agreement and no official request from Telstra. We have none of that at all in place. What we have now is some sort of silent code that land will not be developed in that particular area because Telstra needs a 1,000&hyphen;metre buffer zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that to move the Telstra base would cost $200 million, so they have to stay. But what about the compensation for these landowners? I think that they should be compensated in some way. At the moment the landowners have applied for rezoning of the land through the local council. The local council has passed it on to the state government planning department, and the state government planning department is taking a very long time, which is a real misuse of their own power. They should be dealing with this particular issue very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra on every occasion are using brinkmanship. They have a commercial advantage in this particular relationship but they are refusing to negotiate. In fact, we are getting pompous letters from mandarins in Melbourne denying any responsibility at all. What will happen ultimately is that the state government will approve the planning application for residential development. Telstra will have to apply for their buffer zone and they will then have to pay due compensation. Why can't Telstra now get to the negotiating table and negotiate a compensation settlement for these landowners, who have had this land for long periods of time and worked very hard hoping to get that advantage 20 years into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why can't Telstra now come to the negotiating table and negotiate with these particular landowners? They are ignoring the issue. They sit in their offices in Melbourne and write pompous letters to these landowners 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saying that they will not negotiate, but they will be forced to negotiate sooner or later. It would be to their advantage now if they were to come to the negotiating table and negotiate with these landowners, yet we have Telstra saying that they do not need to do that. In the land title issues that are being discussed in the other place at the moment we are talking about just compensation. These landowners are people who have had this land for a number of years, who bought it in good faith thinking there would be residential development in a number of years time. They have done that. They have worked hard, they have produced for the country, they have paid their fair share of taxes, thinking that they would be able to do that. No other advice that they had received said that they could not do that. Now Telstra are saying that they want this 1,000&hyphen;metre buffer zone, which is fair enough. Let them have the 1,000&hyphen;metre buffer zone, but let them pay just compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that these executives in Melbourne got off their proverbial backsides and got to Perth. They should stop writing pompous letters about not having any responsibility; they should take some responsibility and pay just compensation. I think it is time that Telstra stood up to their responsibility and showed how great an Australian company they really are and paid just compensation to these landowners, who have worked this land for over 20 years.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="12149"><TITLE>Mature Action</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Friday before last, I attended the 10th annual general meeting of Mature Action, a skillshare program operating not only in my electorate but more generally in the north&hyphen;eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Mature Action is a unique skillshare. Between 1986 and 1995 it was the only skillshare project to have an exclusive mature age focus. The clients assisted by Mature Action are in the age group 35 plus. The work of Mature Action peaked at an annual client level of the order of 375. Its success rate in outcomes was around the 63 per cent mark. Its target participants are amongst the most disadvantaged job seekers. I quote from the annual report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12150">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a competitive labour market, older workers face entrenched discrimination from employers, both in terms of hiring and training.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the work done by this skillshare was fairly valuable in the local community. Now we see that, as a skillshare program, next year the program will be defunded. As with all decisions that the government seems to make at the moment, there is uncertainty on it. Originally the date for defunding was 1 December. This was extended to 6 March 1998 and is now set at 30 April 1998. Even given that type of uncertainty, over the last 12 months Mature Action has still proceeded and has provided good service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect we should look at is the history of Mature Action. Mature Action started in the middle of 1986 and arose out of a community needs study. It was auspiced by the former member for Jagajaga, Peter Staples, and operated out of his office. Mature Action started through the work of two social work students from Phillip Institute in Bundoora, and now, in its closing chapter, we see that the wheel has turned. Phillip Institute has become part of RMIT and the Bundoora campus of RMIT is the old Phillip Institute campus. Now Mature Action has struck up a strategic alliance with RMIT to try to get a cut of the brave new world of labour market programs. That brave new world has been characterised by a whole mass of indecision about when it would start. It was supposed to start on 1 December, just gone, but the commencement date is now 1 May 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RMIT have placed a tender to be part of the FLEX program&mdash;the flexible labour exchange. They will be using a lot of the expertise that Mature Action has developed. Given that Mature Action was able to achieve a great degree of community input, one has to ask whether we will see the same level of community contribution. Mature Action had the support of the local governments of the cities of Banyule, Darebin and Whittlesea. It had contributions from local industry&mdash;material and sponsorship of participants in training on&hyphen;site. It had the support of local service organisations. It had networks and links into other community organisations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the brave new world of labour market programs is not all this community contribution going to be lost? As part of RMIT and its labour market programs, Mature Action will be competing against organisations that are private labour market program providers in the business to make profit. It is hard see how it will be able to keep what was an essential element of Skillshare programs: the involvement of the local community. Local people were on the committee of management.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to give the people of Lindsay an update on a survey I am conducting to find out who is for and who against the Badgerys Creek Airport. I undertook the survey because I was wary of representing special interest groups to the detriment of the silent majority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government made an art form of the practice of favouring noisy special interest groups to the detriment of the community as a whole. At a time when unemployment, interest rates, foreign debt and small business bankruptcies soared, we had a Prime Minister&mdash;Paul Keating&mdash;who kept himself busy with fringe issues like the republic and his place in history. This was despite the fact that the average Australian was more concerned with keeping their job, paying their bills and getting their kids through school.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12151">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like so many of my colleagues, I was elected on 2 March 1996 to offer a change from the type of arrogance that we had seen under the previous government. I am pleased to report to the House that the feedback so far has been impressive. The people of Lindsay are glad that they are finally being asked for their opinion. Instead of being lectured on what they should think by people who do not know and do not care, they find that I am actually surveying them for their opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Labor members of parliament at both the state and federal levels have changed their position on the Badgerys Creek airport issue to suit the political climate of the time, my position has remained consistent. I campaigned in the 1996 election for a new EIS to be conducted on the Badgerys Creek site because much had happened in the surrounding area since 1986. People I met during that campaign expressed great concern that, if re&hyphen;elected, Labor would build the curfew&hyphen;free international airport that Laurie Brereton promised and which he said was absolutely non&hyphen;negotiable. It is still part of Labor policy. Conducting a new EIS at the time of the March 1996 election seemed a commonsense approach on this issue. That approach was endorsed overwhelmingly at the election. Commonsense, however, is not all that common within the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March 1995 the Carr government passed a motion condemning the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his action to delay the construction of the Sydney West Airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those voting in favour of the motion included the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, the member for Penrith, Faye Lo Po and the member for Badgerys Creek, Diane Beamer. These are all people who now claim to be totally opposed to the construction of the airport. They claim to be concerned about the effects of an airport at Badgerys Creek, and yet just three months before Labor was tossed out of government they were certainly in a hurry to have that airport built. As is the case with many things, Labor will do and say anything to get a vote: `whatever it takes', as Graham Richardson says. In the minds of many in the Labor Party in New South Wales, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it was as though the proposal to build an airport at Badgerys Creek was only thought up on 2 March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time since the proposal to build an airport at Badgerys Creek was first put forward by the Hawke Labor government in 1986, the people of Lindsay will have an opportunity to put their opinion forward and say clearly what they would like to happen. So far the debate has been dominated by squeaky wheels and noisy lobby groups who have political axes to grind on this issue and do not consult the average local resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has done plenty of lecturing to the local community, first in favour of the airport being built and then against it. Finally, the people of Lindsay are having their say. After one week nearly 300 surveys have been returned, with the numbers being dominated by people living in St Clair, Penrith and Glenmore Park, where people are most likely to be directly affected by having an airport operating at Badgerys Creek. It is equally important that residents of suburbs which are less likely to be directly affected&mdash;Llandilo, Berkshire Park, Castlereagh and Cranebrook, for example&mdash;also have their say on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vast majority of surveys to date are against the airport, and I will be guided by this survey in my representation of the people of Lindsay in this place. Therefore I urge them at this stage to take their opportunity to be a vocal majority, to be democratically represented. I urge all residents of Lindsay to take part in the survey and make their views heard. Democracy only works if you use your vote.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="12151"><TITLE>Electorate of Namadgi</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very much appreciate having the opportunity to speak tonight for the last time in 1997. It has been a pretty remarkable year for all of us in many ways. At the risk of repeating myself, the situation in my community has been pretty tough through 1997. Many people have found themselves in financial and employment circumstances far from those they were expecting. The demands on our service clubs, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12152"> our community agencies, our Salvation Army workers and so on have continued to grow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know and as I have said many times, it is very sad that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;and I am sure that he does not need reminding&mdash;made that decision to not reside in the Lodge. May I remind him that it was a symbolic decision that has been noted very strongly in our community here in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite those difficulties and with things having been grim, our community has been, and is, determined to get on with it&mdash;I think the saying is `life goes on'. An example in recent times in my electorate has been the celebration of the 10th Tuggeranong community festival, which occurred in the last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With seed funding from consecutive ACT governments and wonderful support from our local businesses and licensed clubs, this year's event was a great success. The calendar included events such as yachting, bowls, cycle racing, a gymkhana, a fun run, a multicultural fair, an arts show, community service awards, a street parade, a park concert and fireworks, a premiere of the Wiggles movie&mdash;and nothing was more delightful than seeing nearly 500 youngsters from organisations such as the Salvation Army, the Smith Family and so on come along at the invitation of the local cinema to watch that movie premiere. That was quite a delight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the hard working committee, headed by Mr Mike Crozier. He gave an enormous commitment, as did his colleagues&mdash;too many to mention here, I am afraid. But we have to note that they are all volunteers and carry out their duties with great enthusiasm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the risk of missing someone out though, I must give special thanks to the Tuggeranong Rugby Union Club, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Valley View</EMPHASIS> newspaper, ACTEW, the SES, the Australian Federal Police, the ACT Bushfire Service, Finemore Transport, Pacific 6 Cinemas, Tuggeranong Rotary, Tuggeranong Netball Association, Arts ACT, WIN TV and Radio 2CA, all of whom played major roles in sponsorship and support. However, as I say, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it was not just them. There were many, but they were the notable groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a very busy year for all of us. In my electorate, the need for assistance has been greater than ever. I want to place on record my appreciation for the professionalism and friendliness with which my staff&mdash;as you mentioned earlier in your case, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;have carried out their duties. To Andrew Barr, Jenny Fowler, Ruth Stanfield and Jeff House, my thanks. As all members would agree, without the dedication of loyal and hard working staff, our job as members would be impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks also to the many volunteers who have willingly given of their time. To the work experience students who have shared their time with us this year; it has been a valuable experience for us and, I hope, for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My thanks also to those people in my electorate who have offered their support and camaraderie through a hard year&mdash;the community groups and the individuals who have got themselves involved in the electorate of Namadgi. My thanks also to my parliamentary colleagues for their continuing support and encouragement; and also to all of the hard working members of the Labor Party in the ACT who continue to offer their support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I finish with thanks to the staff of the Department of Administrative Services, who always acted with high levels of professionalism and courtesy to me and my office. My thanks also at the end of the year to the wonderful staff of this place, both those within immediate vision and all of those within every reach of the building, for their assistance throughout the year. It has not gone unnoticed, and it is more appreciated than I am sure many of them realise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak in the House about the Family Law Act 1975 and its unfortunate consequences for my constituents, coupled with some impact of the child support scheme, In particular, I would refer to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12153"> Family Law Act 1975, part VIII, property, spousal maintenance and maintenance agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this act was introduced, there certainly was quite a different social structure in Australia. In part 75 of the act, the court is to take into account whether the parties have separated or the marriage has been dissolved and whether the standard of living in all the circumstances is reasonable; the extent to which the party whose maintenance is under consideration has contributed to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other party; if either party is cohabiting with another person, the financial circumstances relating to the cohabitation; any child support under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has impacted particularly on one individual in my electorate. Over the last 22 years, when we consider the very much evolving independence of women, very much an insistence on gender equality, many of these guidelines are seen to be archaic. I was a strong supporter not long ago of changes to the widow allowance, particularly for older women who were, if you like, in transition with the change of structure in their social approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened in this particular instance is that this fellow has divorced, he is paying child support, and now he finds that he is having to pay spousal maintenance. He is not able to begin another relationship. He has lost what was a very fine home. I do not think, from recollection, he is even able to rent; I think he has to board. He is quite a senior manager. The impact of these factors is quite profound. This spousal maintenance does not require his ex-partner to even so much as, to my understanding, look for work or attempt to retrain and become more inde</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">pendent. That seems to me to be something which, in all the circumstances, is grossly unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on to just have a look at the impact of the child support scheme on this same individual, he makes the point to me that there is difficulty with assessment of costs of children in Australia. There is the basket of goods approach, and there is the expenditure survey approach. Let us just look at the variation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take as an example a two-year&hyphen;old. If we use the expenditure survey approach, it is $163 a week. If we use the basket of goods approach, for low income it is about $80 and for medium income it is about $131. When we take into account the formula for the child support scheme, we can see there is a huge variation. Another thing to take into account is the insistence on making calculations on gross income. It should be remembered that if you underestimate you pay a penalty and that if you overestimate you pay a higher amount&mdash;and there is no recognition of that. I think one can see the impact this is having on my constituent. He makes the point: `Why can't we simply have a PAYE fortnightly calculation?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise that because I think in the last 25 years we have seen great change. I think it is time that we acknowledge that. In our current situation there must be an opportunity for people to have a new beginning. As the member for Chifley (Mr Price) has acknowledged, too often we are dealing with the corpses of dead relationships. I believe that is something which this government and this parliament must address. The formula, coupled with other issues of family law, should be attended to. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three things that need to be said about the report that is now before us, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sharpening the focus: report on a seminar on the Simons committee report</EMPHASIS> . The first is that the ministerial statement which gives the government's response to the Simons report has now been tabled. On 18 November last, on page 10578 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) responded to the Simons report; consequently the seminar, which was part of the process to determine the direction of Australian aid, is now at another phase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to echo the views expressed at the seminar, and earlier on by the minister, by extending to the members of the Simons committee our congratulations on their efforts. The report itself, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One clear objective: poverty reduction through sustainable development</EMPHASIS>, is an excellent analysis. It is an analysis that was badly needed because there had not been one since the report prepared by Gordon Jackson 13 years before. It is interesting that there were many areas of contrast between the Gordon Jackson report and the Simons report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were very fortunate at the seminar, which is actually the focus of this debate today, because we had present each of the members of the committee. It is also worth saying that the members of the aid community were excellent in the way they were prepared to participate in public analysis of the proposals that really embrace not only NGOs and development assistance aid, but also economic aid and the whole range of areas where Australia is involved in helping other countries. It was interesting that at the seminar, as in the minister's statement, there was no questioning of the view that Australia has an ongoing commitment to providing development assistance aid to other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area where there is a problem, and it is one which we cannot ignore, the more so because of the currency volatility in our area, is in the area of economic aid. At a time when there is reason to look at Australia's economic relationships and when the Development Import Finance Facility, the DIFF, has been suspended, we should look at economic aid and see where we go with that. I hope that in the government's response to the Mortimer report there might be consideration given to an alternative to DIFF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are various levels of aid. These are issues that emerged at the seminar and emerged in other dialogue about the Simons committee report. One of those aid issues, and it is a difficult one, was put by Mr Wolfensohn, one of the speakers. He was perhaps the most vocal on the issue. He put the point, and it is a point that I accept although I know it is questioned by others, that if you can advance the economic level in a country, if you can advance the number of people who are in the middle class, and if you can provide more job opportunities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12156"> for a community, you are not only going to make that community better off economically but going to advance the cause of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, if you can advance the economic level in a country you are going to advance the cause of those people examining where they are and what their position is in society, and you are going to help even the issue of freedom of the press. I say that because today, if people are able to afford TV sets and earth stations and so on, that means that they have greater access to information</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we do not just dismiss the area of economic aid. It is a field. I call it economic aid but, in a way, it is assistance to Australian industry. As one who has been involved for many years in the trade field, I think there is an advantage in our being able to help Australian business people into other countries, not peculiarly because of the profits they make, but because of the job creation that it gives, both in those countries and back in Australia. Carefully tailored, there is purpose in providing financial incentive to Australian business to provide aid abroad. That is the one area where we have not concluded our consideration of the Simons committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Simons committee report essentially gave the emphasis to poverty reduction. The minister in his response has confirmed that that is the government's prime objective. In our report we pointed out that poverty reduction really needs to be interpreted in a very broad way. I do have concerns about the way in which we look at poverty reduction because there are obviously advantages in helping people to help themselves. In its way, that relates to the point I was making a moment ago about economic aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have to do is to encourage people to help themselves. In other words, if you can help people to fish, they are going to be a hell of a lot better off than if you are just going to give them fish. So what we want to do is create a climate where people can not only look after themselves at a subsistence level of agriculture, but where they can transfer from a subsistence level to producing food and fibre at a more sophisticated level so that they have a surplus to sell to generate the cash flows that enable them to improve their own living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same applies to some of the basics. I remain most concerned that in the definition of poverty we do not deny the capacity, for example, to help people put down wells, to improve water supply, to improve sanitation, to provide sewerage. There is a group called the RedR Society, who are a group of engineers who do tremendous work. Having been involved in and looked at their work, I am convinced that, in many ways, the work they do is helping the health of people in developing countries more than many of those who are working directly in the health area. If you can provide access to clear clean water, if you can provide an opportunity that prevents women in many instances walking many kilometres just carrying buckets of water on their heads or their shoulders, it helps those villagers to lift their standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, poverty alleviation is not just a matter of looking at the monetary terms, at cash flows; it is a matter of looking at lifestyle and providing conditions of life and living which are going to give opportunities to people to live in a better way. So when we are looking at this one clear objective, the title given the Simons report, on poverty reduction we do need to have a very broad definition of poverty reduction. That is one of the recommendations we have produced in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sharpening the focus</EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12157">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe it is essential that you look not just at poverty in the monetary sense, but at ways by which you can improve people's lifestyle. From that, of course, you have to look at the relationship of women in particular in many developing communities. One of the tragedies of so many societies is that women are just not given the educational opportunity. I was reading a paper the other day which had figures from India which showed that while over 70 per cent of the male work force are literate, less than 20 per cent of women in the work force are literate, which is appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have to do is recognise that in many societies women have been given a less than equal opportunity. I think it is important that we look at the facets of how, in our aid program, we can help towards providing a better opportunity for women and children&mdash;of either sex&mdash;so that they too can have a better living standard in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did produce a very good answer to the Simons report. Obviously the big area of doubt is whether enough money is being provided. It has been an ongoing debate for years. It is not peculiar to overseas aid. I know that in all communities there is a feeling that they want more money for whatever the particular local project might be. I have just been doing some correspondence in my office and most of those letters relate to people who want money for schools, for research, for health, and they want other doctors. There are all sorts of programs we want money for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us, as members, are aware with every moment of our working lives that we always have this conflict of where money should be provided. But I do not think people need to underestimate, as I believe some of the rhetoric of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has, the contribution that foreign aid makes to Australia's wellbeing. We are not just citizens introspectively looking at ourselves and our own neighbours. We have to play a positive role in the wider world community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, it is very important that we maintain adequate funding for Australia's development assistance program. I am pleased to see that the minister has given his commitment to this objective, although the quantum of funds available is not necessarily the amount that he would like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to go into the details of the aid program other than with respect to PNG. I am particularly concerned at where we are going in PNG, quite apart from present problems associated with Prime Minister Skate. I think we need to understand that PNG does have a unique relationship with Australia. She has been the major recipient of our aid. I believe that the transfer from budget to project aid is the way to go, but there are a lot of ifs and buts still in the manner of administration of the country of PNG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am worried about law and order and not just in the cures at the police level. I am also worried about the job creation necessary. Young people are returning to the villages. It is no use letting the Rascals of today and tomorrow in Lae and Port Moresby and all these other towns take over the sinews of government. Our aid program needs to be directed sympathetically to providing those people with a chance for the future. I know the minister has identified some of these issues in his statement. He has talked about the relief aid to overcome the famine, which has been appalling. He has also talked about the ongoing assistance that we are providing to PNG. I believe PNG is the appropriate country which should continue to see the major level of Australian assistance. There are many other countries that are deserving too, but we do have that unique relationship with PNG that we cannot walk away from.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12158">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sharpening the focus</EMPHASIS> is a very good report. It is the result of an excellent seminar and I commend those who participated. I believe, as the ministerial statement says, it is a vehicle which does give us a better chance to sell to the wider Australian community the purposes and advantages of maintaining an adequate level of funding for Australian aid. It has worked well under AusAID; it worked well before under AIDAB. I believe it will continue to work well in the future. I would hope that the observations which have emerged from the aid report, particularly in terms of assessing the value of Australian aid, refocusing aid management, giving an Australian identity to our aid program, and assessing one program against another&mdash;particularly in terms of sectoral priorities&mdash;are factors which are important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to recognise, however, that assessment of the value of aid is something which perhaps has not been done sufficiently in the past. I believe that it is worthwhile, as the minister has said, to set up a permanent advisory committee to advise the minister on aid and development issues. That committee will enable him to hear directly from the broader community about Australia's aid efforts. We need to make sure we get the best value out of it and, certainly, from those wonderful people and the non&hyphen;government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend the NGOs. So many of them give an enormous amount. I think we are very fortunate in Australia that we have not only those who commit official government funds to aid but those in the Australian Volunteers Abroad scheme and so many other volunteers. These people do an enormous amount without thought of adequate return. That dimension of Australian aid enhances the quality and character of who we are as Australians. I commend them and certainly would like to thank them for their participation in our seminar. It was a very effective and successful seminar. I commend the minister for having picked up so many of the ideas that we discussed on that occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate. The seminar was one of a number held by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.

I also would like to endorse the comments that the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) just made about those working in the aid field. Whether it is through the official aid agency AusAID or the NGOs, they do a tremendous job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Foreign Affairs rightly identified the existence of mass poverty as the single most important economic and social issue on our planet today. Eliminating the disparities between the world's rich and poor is one of the crucial international challenges of our time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the overall success of development in recent decades has been very significant: many more people live longer, fewer mothers die in childbirth and fewer infants die from preventable diseases. But the numbers living in poverty have continued to grow. Too many people&mdash;indeed, 1.3 billion too many, as the minister has noted&mdash;live in extreme poverty and are denied their basic rights to health, decent shelter, clean water supply, sanitation and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a nation can make a contribution to the elimination of many of these things. Eliminating poverty is affordable and achievable. The major UN conferences of recent years have drawn together a broad framework for cooperation that should deliver sustained progress, but to succeed we clearly need to mobilise greater political will across the international 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12159"> community. It is far too easy to put the questions of the elimination of poverty into the too&hyphen;hard basket. I am afraid that that is what many countries do: they recognise that there is a problem there, they see that they have other domestic problems, and they put this international problem in the far too&hyphen;hard basket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of development assistance by countries such as Australia does reflect a basic and fundamental obligation, an obligation deeply embedded in our core national values. It is our duty to care about other people, in particular those less well&hyphen;off than ourselves. We have a moral duty to reach out to the poor and the needy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the foreign minister announced the establishment of the review headed by Mr Paul Simons, he rightly said that Australia has an overseas aid program of which all Australians can be proud. In his press release on 28 May last year, he put the following on the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has an aid program it can be proud of. Millions of people around the world are now better off thanks to the help they've received from Australia. Our aid program administered by AusAID and delivered by Australian companies, individuals, non&hyphen;government organisations and academic institutions is highly effective.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a very large degree of continuity in approach, both in the Simons committee report and in the government's broad acceptance of its recommendations. The introduction to the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not advocate revolutionary change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is typical of Australia, of course. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic arrangement of the aid program is sound. The design and management of the program should continue to be the responsibility of a single, independent agency. The countries of East Asia and the Pacific should continue to be the primary focus.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Similarly, the response is not a statement signalling dramatic change. It is essentially a further step in the ongoing evolution of our overseas aid program, a program which enjoys strong bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition welcomed the establishment of the Simons review. In ever&hyphen;changing international circumstances, the continued review of Australia's overseas aid program is critically important for maximising its effectiveness and for making sure that we maintain its primary focus of contributing to lasting poverty reduction, while advancing Australia's national interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's overseas aid program should, in cooperative partnership with developing countries and people, assist in building foundations for broadly based, equitably distributed and sustainable economic growth. We should encourage responsible national economic policies, including support for the development of efficient, accountable and fair government administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our aid program should give priority to breaking down barriers to the participation by the poor in economic and social development, and especially support activities which enable women to contribute and to benefit from development. We should also seek to increase the productivity of the poor by facilitating access by them to productive assets and credit, and access to supporting activities including health care, education and training, and appropriate agricultural technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In broad terms, these are the goals which find expression in the Simons report. In a number of respects, however, the report and the government's response to it fall short of what we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12160"> might have hoped for. One of these is the issue of human rights. Aid to reduce poverty must be based on fundamental human rights principles, including the right to development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Simons report is unquestionably weak in the human rights area. It speaks loosely of support for good government. One is always interested in what the term `good government' means. I recently had an interesting conversation with the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). He was questioning what is actually meant by `good government'. It sometimes seems as though it is one of these weaselly phrases that people throw in which covers all things. We support good government but we are not quite sure exactly what people mean when they use the term.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is significant that the Simons report does not have a single recommendation on human rights, and the government's response is little better. For our part, Labor is determined to give a high priority to support for, and enhancement of, the full range of human rights for people in developing countries. To do so is a central and integrating element of our approach to overseas aid. Although there is no mention in the report, or in the minister's response to the report, of human rights, I must say in all fairness that I do strongly support recent directions outlined by the minister to strengthen human rights assistance in our aid programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all members of parliament, I am often challenged on the aid question. One group in the community argues that Australia does not give enough overseas aid and claims that what it does give is poorly channelled. Another group points out the real or imagined economic problems we have in this country and suggests that, really, charity begins at home. Well, as I heard someone say the other day, `Charity does begin at home but it need not necessarily stay there though.' Some would say that there should be no government aid at all and that all aid should be raised through the private sector. I suppose that, as in all things, government action is a matter of competing interests, but I believe that this government has made a significant contribution to poverty alleviation through the Australian aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, those who argue that Australia should give no overseas aid overlook the fact that much of this money is spent in Australia, or by employing Australians on overseas aid projects. I know the linking of aid to trade is a contentious issue. Nevertheless, it is an issue of considerable economic significance to many Australians. I have a point of disagreement with many of my friends in the aid field because I see nothing wrong with tied aid if we can not only give some assistance to the elimination of poverty&mdash;or whatever the aid is going for&mdash;but also give some assistance in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently heard the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) talking about aid&mdash;it might have been at one of the seminars or in this chamber&mdash;and he made the very valid point, I thought, that one of the ways he could sell aid to his rural constituency was to tie it in with a trade thing. Some of the academic arguments on aid do not always agree with that. They say that it should be given to an international organisation or it should just be given. Well, I went to PNG a couple of years ago and I saw the result of untied aid there. And, ever since, I have been a firm advocate for the provision of tied aid.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12161">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, however, overseas aid is about practical outcomes and the allocation of real resources. Commissioning reports and reviews is no substitute for real political commitment to deliver the goods and to be held accountable for one's performance. As I said earlier in my remarks, we clearly need to mobilise greater political will across the international community if the world is to successfully meet the challenge of global poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, like other members of parliament, I visited many Australian overseas projects and I have always found them to be well run and of great benefit wherever they are. I guess that when the question of aid is raised with you by constituents, as it is with me, the Mekong Friendship Bridge is always mentioned. I actually doubt that any other issue has generated as much misinformation as the Mekong Friendship Bridge. I visited this bridge in 1994. As you know, it is the first road link between Laos and Thailand and will yield significant economic benefits to both countries. If anyone needs any proof of this, they have only to look at the entrepreneurial activities that are already taking place on the Thai side of the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other things that people often overlook about that bridge is that it is one of the highest profile aid projects undertaken by Australia in recent years. It was completed under time and under budget and the bridge is a showcase for what Australians can deliver in technology, design and infrastructure transfer. As such, it is very important in our expanding trade relationship with Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, population issues have continued to be an important aspect of Australia's overseas aid program. As one who is convinced that overpopulation and economic underdevelopment are closely linked, I welcome the emphasis in our aid program on population issues. The priority which the aid program affords population issues was reflected in the major role that Australia played at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in December 1994. Australia was active in encouraging the international conference to adopt the groundbreaking program of action for the empowerment of women and called for major increases in global resources for family planning and health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has, unfortunately, cut, in the first budget of the Howard government, our assistance to some of the UN programs and the International Planned Parenthood Federation and although in the last budget they were not cut again that funding was not restored. I know that there are serious budgetary considerations that everyone has got to look at but I do hope that in the foreseeable future that funding can be restored to the UN Fund for Population and Development and especially the International Planned Parenthood Federation. In the budgetary context it is not a huge amount of money but to those organisations it is and it has a significant impact on programs that the IPPF were undertaking in our region in the Pacific Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, we have a special responsibility to this area. The Americans have withdrawn recently from aid programs in the Pacific Islands. I do not think the New Zealanders are in a position to contribute much more than they do. Unless we pick up the challenge no&hyphen;one else will. I hope that the government will look at that very carefully and maybe restore some of the funding that was cut a couple of years ago. I sometimes think that Australia wants to do less with less money but Australia can do more and if we do not do more we are failing in our responsibility. We are also passing up an opportunity, especially in our part of the world, to play a significant leadership role and I think that that is a responsibility that we should take up.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12162">

Some very hard decisions have to be made on where you are going to spend the money because there are so many competing causes on which one would like to spend money. I think one of the most difficult things is&mdash;and Mr Hollis drew attention to the fact&mdash;that some particular funding that he was interested in would have been a relatively small contribution for the government to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in India and Pakistan last year and I remember in Pakistan going to a particular village on the outskirts of Islamabad where poverty was quite appalling. I think the honourable gentleman from Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) was with me. It was incredible irony that we had had a meeting with the president of Pakistan which was scheduled for half an hour but ran for about an hour and a half.

We then sat around waiting for ages and found we were not having lunch with the Prime Minister, but with the Prime Minister's husband, who was then minister for development or something like that.</PARA>

I am merely trying to identify that there are incredibly difficult choices to be made in this whole area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did promise the member for Throsby by way of interjection during his contribution that I would try to enlighten him on the subject of governance. He referred to a conversation he had had with the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) about the subject of governance and what it meant. The honourable member for Lalor, of course, often makes very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12163"> worthy intellectual contributions in this place. He has discussed this subject with me, and I think, frankly, that he gets hung up a bit on the use of language. It seems to me that governance in this area has a fairly straightforward definition. Governance really comprises any measures that we can take to assist a country that is in difficulties&mdash;Third World countries, obviously&mdash;to run the show better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That might take a number of forms. It may involve lending them some experts in the form of public servants to help plan the economy and the budget. It may be lending them parliamentary draftsmen to assist with the drafting of their legislation&mdash;although sometimes, seeing some of our drafting, I am not so sure about that. We have, on occasions, seconded or sent for visits for training clerks from our own parliament to the parliaments of other countries to assist them in their procedures and the way they run the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that governance is all about trying to develop, train and bring on a lot of those Third World countries so that the countries are run more effectively and efficiently. It seems to me that that is a very important thing for us to do in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the contribution by the member for Throsby, we heard from the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I would support three of his comments. I commend members of the Simons committee. I also commend Australian NGOs who do such an incredible job overseas, usually in quite difficult circumstances. I am particularly impressed with, for example, the volunteers from organisations such as AESOP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also agree with the key thrust of the contribution by the right honourable member for New England when he talked about the importance of making people better off in order to secure stability in their country and in the region and because that is the best way to advance human rights. I think those are important key points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, we are here this morning to talk about the Simons committee report and the seminar that was held by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign affairs, Defence and Trade into that report. As we have already heard, to some extent that seminar has now been overtaken by the reality of the government's response which was made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) on 18 November this year in a ministerial statement entitled `Better aid for a better future'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the House that the government now has established six principles in terms of the way that it will administer aid in the future. These include: adopting a partnership approach; responding to urgent needs in emergency situations; providing practical assistance; applying greater targeting&mdash;not a scatter gun approach, but really being more focused in the way we do things; ensuring that programs remain identifiably Australian; and ensuring that programs are outward looking&mdash;in other words, not just doing what we have done before but looking around the world for best practice and new, innovative and more effective ways of delivering our aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also identified five key sectors in which aid will be distributed: health, education, infrastructure, rural development, and governance&mdash;that word that the gentleman from Throsby had some difficulty with, and which I have already addressed. In the time left to me, I would like to paint a few word pictures from my own experience, because we all travel and look at aid projects when we go overseas whenever we can. I would like to give a few examples of some of the things that Australian aid is doing, because I think it is important that the public understand the sorts of uses that our aid is put to.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12164">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give an example in that first key area of health. I was recently in the South Pacific and one of the countries I went to was Vanuatu. As a result of television ads, everybody in Australia thinks of Vanuatu as a holiday destination. We got in at Port Vila at about 1 o'clock in the morning and at six o'clock the next morning&mdash;we did not have long in bed&mdash;we were on a rickety old plane going out to one of the southern islands called Tanna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tanna is hardly a nice holiday destination. At that stage, we visited the hospital. The hospital was about to close down its generator for lack of fuel due to shipping strikes. The conditions in the hospital were really quite appalling. In this country our animals are sent to better buildings and conditions when they go to the vet than the people who were being looked after in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tanna is staffed by a single doctor, who was a volunteer from Canada. The doctors in the city of Victoria on Vancouver Island in Canada have got together and sent one of their number for six months at a time to be the doctor on Tanna. The doctors do it voluntarily and it is unpaid. All the costs and so on are funded by the doctor community in Victoria. A number of Australian organisations have been there to help put in generators, other equipment and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, the basic health problems in Tanna are quite serious. Unless the standard of health is improved, then the kids are not going to be able to go to school and get their education. If they cannot get their education, then they are not going to get jobs. It is a very similar scenario in many ways to a lot of the indigenous communities in this country. But in Tanna we were providing assistance to that hospital and it was very vitally needed assistance. It is a basic building block to get the people in that location back on their feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example in the education area is Kiribati, which I visited on the same trip to the South Pacific. Kiribati is a country of about 77,000 people. Its area of land on many little islands is quite small, but it is spread over more than 3,500 kilometres of ocean. In other words, there is a huge area of sea and very little land. It is bigger than Australia from east to west, but the area of land is less than the size of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, education is a problem because they cannot afford to have schools on every island in every community. So particularly at the secondary level, they bring the children from all over the country to a single location on a particular island where they run their secondary school&mdash;and sometimes it takes three weeks to get to school. Obviously, the children board there. So apart from needing the basics of education, they need to have living facilities as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The straw huts on mud earth that the kids used to have to live in for 11 months of the year&mdash;they only go to their home island for a month during the long school holiday&mdash;were really quite appalling. Australia has built an accommodation block, which has improved the conditions incredibly. And you would think that was great. But I walked into that accommodation block with other members of the delegation. Of course, it has a concrete floor and the kids are sleeping on the concrete floor. They have no private lockers to keep their things in, they each have a suitcase or a bag of some sort. So it is very primitive accommodation, although it is a heck of a lot better than it was before. Clearly, what we have done there will help those children in terms of their standard of living. It will help them to be in better shape to learn and to be educated and therefore better fitted to take on a role later in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure is obviously a key area. I was in Laos recently and we visited a village in the south of the country. We travelled in a rather rickety 30&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Russian helicopter. In this village of 400 or 500 people, they have had to tramp several miles&mdash;usually the women&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12165"> carrying a bucket on their head to try to draw water from a very muddy, polluted river and then bring it all the way back to the village. That, of course, had the inevitable impact of disease and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Australian aid managed to do, for $100, was to sink a bore and a well in the middle of the village and provide them for the first time ever with fresh, clean, drinking water. So not only did it stop all that labour of having to walk for miles, but it provided better quality water on hand which clearly is going to improve the health standards of that particular village&mdash;and for $100. It is absolutely incredible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that Australia did was to build a dam on the local river&mdash;which flows mightily during the wet season and stops during the dry season&mdash;for a few thousand dollars, which will supply them with water to grow their crops throughout the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those sorts of basic infrastructure projects are most important. The previous speaker mentioned the Mekong bridge which links Laos with Thailand. Australia is also building a number of other bridges in the southern part of Laos because you cannot get by road from the north to the south of the country, so how do you get communications going; how do you develop the country economically; how does it get back on its feet if you have not got a road? Because of the number of rivers, one of the key things is that you need to provide bridges as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on at some length, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I see that my time is about to expire. In the few seconds remaining to me, I would like to say that nearest to home we have PNG, which is of major concern to us and I think it could be the subject of a whole new debate. I would like to commend the report to the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity this morning to contribute to this debate on the government's response to the Simons report on Australia's aid program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In his introduction to this response, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mass poverty is the single most important economic and social issue on our planet today.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have spoken in the House before about the desperate need of those who are trapped in mass poverty, particularly in the developing nations. Nineteen ninety&hyphen;six was the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty but, unfortunately, poverty was not eradicated. It is true that more focus was drawn to the needs of the poverty stricken in that year and we as a government will continue to work in partnership with the people in those countries to alleviate some of their suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many ordinary Australian families who play a financially supportive role in the alleviation of poverty through World Vision and other child sponsorship programs. Australians as a people are generous with their gifts to those in need. But one of the best ways we can help alleviate poverty in the world is to help those in poverty to help themselves. It was pleasing to note the government's agreed objective that our Australian overseas aid program will be&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . `to advance Australia's national interests by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The aid program will be focused and targeted to maximise the outcomes for investment made. I have had a long association with the Results group in my electorate who have actively lobbied Commonwealth governments, both Labor and coalition, to create the political will to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12166"> end hunger and poverty throughout the world. I would like to read a note I received from two of their members earlier this week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At last we see the Government response to the Simons report. It's great to hear that the Government has endorsed poverty reduction as the main goal of foreign aid and retained the target of .7% of GNP and that aid projects will now get greater supervision and scrutiny. Wow. What happens now?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government will provide an effective and well&hyphen;targeted aid program, focussing on the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our focus will also be on meeting the priority needs of the partner countries. Aid is a partnership between the giver and the receiver. We, in this government, are very much aware of the partnership aspects of our aid programs. The best partnerships are those where all partners enjoy a mutual benefit, and that is the aim of our aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most successful methods of obtaining that mutual benefit is through micro&hyphen;credit. The Grameen Bank has a proud record of providing small loans to people in developing countries. Many of the borrowers are women who may use the money to buy a few chickens that they can breed for eating or to produce eggs that they will sell. The money might be used to buy a sewing machine to set up a small sewing business. Other loans have been used to buy two or three cows for milking. Many of these enterprises have achieved incredible success for the borrowers, have lifted them out of the depths of poverty, and even allowed families to send their children to school. Micro&hyphen;credit gives people the opportunity to escape the poverty trap through their own efforts and own achievement with dignity&mdash;a hand&hyphen;up, not a handout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basic education is another focus of our aid program. The annual report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education is development's most basic building block and is vital for alleviating poverty. Our education efforts will concentrate on building a broad range of education assistance, with a particular focus on basic and technical education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We all know from our own experience in Australia that, without the most basic literacy and numeracy skills, people's futures are limited. This is even more so in the developing world, particularly for women and girls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For sustainable development to occur, countries need essential infrastructure and, in particular, a clean and safe water supply&mdash;a basic necessity which we often take for granted. If more of us were to travel in Third World countries, where the water supply is almost non&hyphen;existent and what is available is undrinkable, we might better appreciate the value of the water that we have in this country. In India, for example, it often is not even safe to swim in rivers because of the pollution, contamination and waterborne diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our aid resources will carefully target vital infrastructure services to ensure that private funding is not displaced, while reaching those people most in need. Micro&hyphen;hydro is one way of helping remote and small communities without damage to the environment and at minimal cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The annual report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preventing environmental degradation is essential to alleviation of poverty and ensuring development is sustainable. Very poor people concentrate on day to day survival . . . poor health prohibits them from earning income and overcoming poverty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Australia's aid program will make that investment in sustainable agriculture, improved sanitation, clean water and better management of national resources. We know that these issues 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12167"> are critical to the alleviation of poverty. Australia is committed to working in partnership with the receiving countries to address these environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the above broad based programs for economic growth, sustainable development and individual empowerment will contribute to the reduction of poverty that the Simons report has recommended. Despite the Simons report recommendation that the aid volume target of 0.7 per cent be reduced, the government will continue to recognise the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as an indicative target. All foreign aid, like all other government programs, will be considered in the annual budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to note the government has accepted the recommendations to focus our Australian aid program on the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. This is our geographical home and the focus of our region are our neighbours. Although in economic and technological terms the world is shrinking, Australia is not about to float away to somewhere else. It is right that our aid programs should be focused on Papua New Guinea and the Pacific and East Asia, and selectively in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Priorities will be on a development needs basis in conjunction with Australia's broader interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has noted that the Simons report made 79 recommendations, of which the government has accepted 64 fully, in part or in principle; nine have been rejected, of which reducing the UN target of 0.7 per cent was one; and six have been noted for further consideration. The government's response to the Simons report is responsible and fair. The recommendations rejected have been judged against the overall aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government and, indeed, Australia as a nation have a proud record of aid to the developing world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The nature and character of the Commonwealth is something that most of us do not really think about daily as we go about our lives. It is an organisation which, for some, is still associated more with the days of empire than it is with today. It was for that reason and because of the imminence of CHOGM&mdash;the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting&mdash;in Edinburgh that we decided it would be worthwhile conducting, on 20 August last, the seminar on the Commonwealth of Nations. This report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">From Empire to partnership</EMPHASIS> , lists those who participated. It sets out the actual text of the quite significant contributions made. It also comes forward with a report from our committee making some comment on the dialogue at the seminar and making some recommendations, and it is on those that I want to say a few things this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Commonwealth itself, I think its relevance to our daily lives is perhaps more through sport, and perhaps in some of the other visits that we receive, than in any other form. It is, of course, the countries predominantly of the British Commonwealth. We now have, however, one country in the African region that was a colony of another power, and there is an increasing feeling amongst a lot of countries that the nature of the Commonwealth changing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12168"> brings with it the prospect of our forgetting some aspects of that original association and bringing us into a new grouping which does give perhaps new life for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing I should say is that the role of the Commonwealth emerged, for most of us, as being far more significant and having far more meaning for Australia than many of us had expected. Certainly, from my point of view, I came away from the Commonwealth seminar feeling that, in spite of my own reservations over the years, there was an ongoing role for Australia as a member of the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth was a worthwhile international organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that as one who was a little amazed at the extent to which successive prime ministers have taken unto themselves the role of being statesman in CHOGM and seen that as a way to enhance their international egos. That probably is a bit harsh on some, but unfortunately it is true of them all. It has been quite remarkable that all of them&mdash;and I say `all of them', from my experience from Menzies to Howard&mdash;have found that the dialogue at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting has given them a stature that I think they do not feel they receive at home. That is a good thing. Apart from anything else it gives them an opportunity to talk with a lot of other heads of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes we are a bit critical of outcomes. If the Commonwealth is to achieve anything then it will be more to do with preserving what we all respect in our British heritage. When you look at Nigeria, you cannot say that it has done so. There are three matters I would like to mention here. Firstly, I would like to see the principle of the rule of law accepted so that there is an independent judiciary, there are rights for people to act on behalf of accused persons, and there is a set structure of law which is not based on providing benefits to the few but rather allowing equal rights to all within society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, our British heritage brings with it the tradition of a free press. While most of us, certainly all politicians, are fairly critical of the press and the press does need to be more responsible, that does not in any way deny the need for us to preserve the concept of an independent, free media. These days when the electronic media has provided such an enormous opportunity for people, whatever their background, to see what is going on immediately it happens, that freedom of the media becomes even more important. So, the rule of law and a free media are two very important matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue, which almost flows from those two but, tragically, does not apply in many countries, concerns democratic institutions. I am referring to the opportunity for people to determine who is going to be their government in a fair, free and open electoral system. Unfortunately, some of the members of the Commonwealth do not follow that principle either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, those three issues are the most important benefits of Commonwealth membership. I regret that some Commonwealth countries have set aside those basic principles. Yet, without those principles, coming to fair and equitable resolution of difficult domestic problems is extraordinarily difficult. At the moment Nigeria is suspended from membership. Fiji was suspended but has now returned. I hope that there can be ongoing efforts to try to lift the profile of those issues because they are the most important part of being members of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me return briefly to the conclusions and recommendations in the report. We looked at what we saw as the benefits to the Commonwealth, and there are several benefits from Australia's perspective. The sporting association is undoubted. We all look forward to the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur next year. They will provide yet again a wonderful 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12169"> opportunity for Australian athletes to compete internationally and to gain experience in another environment. That is very good and we should endorse those Commonwealth contacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are problems in any international sporting competition to do with what sports should be included and with ensuring that drugs are not seen as permissible and hence distorting what are normal competitive opportunities. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of determining what sports should be included, I have always thought that international games like the Commonwealth Games are better if confined to individual sports and that team sports are better played in other environments. Be that as it may, it is very good that there are these Commonwealth Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the recommendations we looked at other fields, including the educational field. Our first recommendation suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the establishment of a Commonwealth resources centre.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We had in mind looking at how we can provide opportunities for improving education levels and contact between Commonwealth countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another recommendations which I very strongly support, and I hope the government might support, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, the Australian Government, as part of its aid program, set aside a defined number of scholarships for students from Commonwealth countries to assist with tertiary and post-graduate education in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wanted to mention that because in our aid program in Africa, for example, we have tended to forget there are a lot of smaller countries that receive very little aid. Yet those few scholarships we have provided in the past were a very good vehicle to help numbers of residents of those countries to lift their standard of living, their understanding and their education and so go back home and lift the general quality of government and quality of life in their own countries. In education I think there is a role that the Commonwealth can play. Australia should take a lead in promoting those educational scholarships, but of course not only Australia. I would like to see all the countries of the Commonwealth offer similar educational opportunities for people of other countries. I know that in the past many have gone to Britain. Today the same opportunities exist, certainly in all of the countries of what is called the old Commonwealth. But in the new Commonwealth countries too some of the education institutions are very good and reciprocity in that field is worth while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first area was sport and the second was education. The third that I want to turn to is the suggestion that perhaps we might reinstitute a regional Commonwealth heads of government meeting. We seem to have a great plethora of international groups. We have got APEC and the ARF, the ASEAN Regional Forum. We even have the finance ministers plus six group. We have various defence arrangements and people might well say, `Well, you've got a Commonwealth heads of government meeting. What on earth do you want a regional heads of government meeting for?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons I think it is important at the moment is that Britain has withdrawn from east of Suez totally now&mdash;it has got its residual interest in Pitcairn about which I spoke yesterday. Apart from that, what we want to do is to try to look at our region. The countries of our region include some very fragile ecosystems in the Pacific islands. Many of them are members of the British Commonwealth and if we had a regional heads of government meeting&mdash;I know we have got a South Pacific Forum and a South Pacific Commission but this would be a bit different&mdash;it would provide in areas I think are important that I have mentioned before&mdash;democratic institutions, the rule of law and a free press&mdash;an opportunity for people to talk about the systems of government. For example, PNG is a member of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12170"> Commonwealth. How beneficial it would be if the people of PNG were constantly being reminded of the principles that, in a democracy such as theirs, seem to be stretched by patronage and corruption which, if the present media reports are to be believed, again threaten its very viability. I think a regional Commonwealth heads of government meeting would be worth while from time to time so we could have a look at some of the ways in which we could help each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would provide an opportunity to get Britain perhaps and the old Commonwealth&mdash;I would include countries like India and Pakistan&mdash;to look at problems in our region and see whether or not we might be able to help each other to a greater degree. That was another recommendation we included in our report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have mentioned also the promotion of democratic values. I think that is worth while. Recommendation 6, in fact, picks up those general points that I have been making. We talk about the Commonwealth Games Association. We talk also about non&hyphen;government organisations. Because we all start from the same principles, there is a great advantage in looking at Commonwealth NGOs. CARE, for example, is one of those which does a great job. I think that it is important that we find ways to promote NGOs to assist the government funded aid by working through Red Cross, CARE and other bodies which have an international association. Quite often, our Australian&hyphen;based NGOs can get additional finance and additional resources and can better address the problems that are still so regrettably abundant around the world. We believe that it is worth while to support the work of Commonwealth NGOs and we can do this in a number of ways. Again, this was an aspect that was discussed fairly extensively at the seminar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also thought it might be worth while having a regional Commonwealth trade ministers meeting. The Commonwealth is, of course, not a trade association, but I confess that it has never really pleased me greatly having members of our royal family going about promoting British trade interests. I felt that it would be far better if they recognised that they are really there, if they are promoting trade, to promote the trade of the Commonwealth rather than of any individual member of it. We felt, having looked at some of the aspects of trade, that Commonwealth trade and finance ministers might be able to meet from time to time with some benefit to all of the participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final area mentioned was human rights. We did look at problems. I have mentioned Nigeria. Many members of the Commonwealth are, regrettably, virtually one&hyphen;party states. These countries have human rights practices which are at a level which is less than what Australians would regard as acceptable. It is important that we find ways in which we can strengthen consideration of human rights issues. We felt that it was worth while strengthening the role and resources of the Commonwealth's human rights unit so that we might be able to promote and protect human rights in the member countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the seminar was well worth while. We had an excellent day's discussion. As one who has long been cynical about aspects of the Commonwealth, I felt that it displayed that Australia not only has an ongoing role within the Commonwealth, but has a contribution to make. In that respect, I would hope that, with the constitutional convention coming up, one of the issues on which there will not be a great deal of debate is that Australia should continue&mdash;whatever the outcome of our own sovereignty question&mdash;to be a member of the Commonwealth and that the Queen should remain at its head.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12171">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this report to members and to the wider community. It emphasises the extent to which we have transferred from the old empire to a modern partnership. It is no longer the British Commonwealth; it is very much a Commonwealth of partners and of equals, and I think Australia has a very important role to play in it. I recommend that the government should accept each of the recommendations included within our paper attached to the seminar proceedings.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The seminar on the Commonwealth of Nations held on 20 August 1997 was one of a number that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has conducted over the last year. As I said in speaking to reports of the other seminars, they have been excellent seminars which have been very well attended&mdash;not necessarily so well attended by members of parliament, which I think is a pity, but very well attended by some members of parliament, the academic community, the defence and diplomatic communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I doubt whether we see the relevance of the Commonwealth today. For too many people, there were elements of a colonial relationship there, and they did not regard it as a meeting of equals. A point referred to by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is that one of the reasons&mdash;or a symbol, if you like, rather than a reason&mdash;is that Her Majesty the Queen, although head of the Commonwealth, is very much seen as the Queen of England. Something that has always niggled me a little bit is when Her Majesty the Queen visits somewhere as Queen of England and promotes British industry and trade. If we are to take that role seriously, Her Majesty the Queen, as head of the Commonwealth, in a way should not play a role in promoting one country over another, or she should promote all countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth does play an important role. Currently, there are 53 members. Again, one of the points made by the right honourable member for New England&mdash;I do not want to have to agree with everything he said&mdash;was something I had thought about myself. I debated whether I wanted to attend this seminar because I was always quite sceptical about the Commonwealth. I was quite sceptical about its worth. I thought it was part of the past of Australia and I, like many people, saw our future in Asia and places like that. I thought: what relevance has the Commonwealth got for us today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very rarely is a member of parliament persuaded by a one&hyphen;day seminar held in Parliament House, but I came away from that seminar with a completely changed view on the role of the Commonwealth. Now I am a very strong advocate for the role that the Commonwealth can play in so many fields&mdash;not only the sporting links that we all talk about, but the trade links and the political links. After that one&hyphen;day seminar, I was very much convinced of the worth of&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was because of the excellence of that seminar. It is a great pity that more members of parliament did not attend, for the range of speakers and the quality of the debate was excellent. I would strongly recommend to people that they should read the report on the proceedings because there were some excellent contributions that day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Membership of the Commonwealth is entirely voluntary and a number of former British dependencies, mandates or protectorates, such as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Burma and the Sudan, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12172"> and several of the Gulf states, decided against membership when achieving independence. It might have been a very different Commonwealth if they had come in. Some countries have also left and, in some cases, later have rejoined the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ireland withdrew its membership in 1949, and South Africa did not reapply for admission after becoming a republic in 1961, finally being readmitted on 1 June 1994. Pakistan left in 1972 and rejoined on 1 October 1989. Fiji's membership lapsed when it did not reapply after adopting a republican constitution following the military coup in 1987. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in November 1995, Nigeria's membership was suspended due to concerns about persistent human rights violations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many countries which have applied to join the Commonwealth. For example, the most recent member of the Commonwealth is Mozambique, a country with no historic links with the British Empire. It was admitted to the Commonwealth in 1995 as `a unique and special case'. It is the first Commonwealth member to be neither formerly under British rule, nor that of another Commonwealth country. Nor does it use the English language substantially for top&hyphen;level political and administrative purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the seminar it was felt that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was not devoting sufficient attention and emphasis to the Commonwealth. This is particularly important with regard to trade. The importance of the economic dimension of the Commonwealth was recognised in the setting of the theme&mdash;trade, investment and development matters&mdash;of the 1997 CHOGM. The significance of the Commonwealth in economic issues was clearly acknowledged in 1996 by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is still the case that some members of the Commonwealth are amongst the poorest in the world and rightly deserve the help and support of the richer developed world, the organisation now also contains some of the world's fastest growing economies&mdash;or it did when I wrote this speech; some things change quite dramatically these days&mdash;and even some of the richest. The Commonwealth today embraces what may well turn out to be one of the world's fastest growing markets. Could it be that the very features which were seen by some as Commonwealth weaknesses in previous areas, such as a transregional character and its diversity, could now prove to be its strength?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the August seminar, the academic and author, Katherine West, spoke of the importance of the Commonwealth as economies become more globalised and competitive, providing as it does opportunities for regional and transregional networking. Even some of the most sceptical members are now expressing far more positive perceptions of the Commonwealth as a low&hyphen;cost, ready&hyphen;made transregional network, or a series of networks&mdash;according to Ms West&mdash;through which members in one region can improve their capacity to benefit from economic and diplomatic opportunities as well as other regions of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Commonwealth contains some of the richest countries, as I have said, and countries with extremely high economic growth rates, it also includes some of the poorest countries in the world. There are great variations in per capita income, economic strength, and ability to participate in international trade and investment across the Commonwealth countries. Of the 53 Commonwealth members, some 29 are defined as small&mdash;that is, having populations of less than one million&mdash;and 14 have fewer than 200,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small states are a continuing focus of the Commonwealth work and now receive about 65 per cent of the Commonwealth's technical assistance. The Commonwealth does not have a legal regime in place to address human rights issues, but such concerns were central to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12173"> Singapore declaration in 1971, the Harare declaration in 1991 and, most recently, in the Millbrook action plan arising from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Auckland in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Singapore declaration sought to strengthen the influence of the United Nations for international peace and security, to strive to promote institutions and guarantees for personal freedom under law, to combat racial prejudice in colonialism, to overcome poverty, ignorance and disease and to achieve a more equitable international society. These principles were affirmed in the Harare declaration, described by the then Commonwealth Secretary-General as `a landmark to guide our association'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that declaration, the heads of government reaffirmed their commitment to equal rights and opportunities for all citizens regardless of race, colour, creed or political belief; to equality for women; and to the provision of universal access to education for all their populations. They pledged the Commonwealth to work with renewed vigour in the protection and promotion of the fundamental political values of the Commonwealth&mdash;democracy, the rule of law, just and honest government and fundamental human rights. They decided on continuing action to help end apartheid and bring democracy to South Africa, in which they were successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The human rights record of many Commonwealth countries is poor. Although it is unwise to generalise, there are difficulties in many states ranging from comparative minor abuses&mdash;if such a thing really does exist in regard to human rights&mdash;to appalling violations of the most basic of human rights. As the seminar was told, the contemporary commonplace disregard of human rights means that a post&hyphen;apartheid, post&hyphen;colonial Commonwealth offers cold comfort to common people. Ms Gilmore, the National Director of Amnesty International, documented a number of specific human rights abuses across a range of Commonwealth countries. She also noted the wide variations amongst Commonwealth countries in regard to the international agreements on human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is one area where the Commonwealth can play a much more positive role in regard to human rights. We make much in this country&mdash;and, indeed, in much of the Commonwealth&mdash;about the Westminster parliamentary system of democracy. We make much of the basis of our law, which is the common law which has evolved through the ages in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the case&mdash;and I know this is a point that the right honourable member for New England touched on&mdash;with the education system. So often we talk about the education system. The education system, and especially the higher education system, in this country has evolved very much from the British education system. Despite what people might or might not believe about what happens in Northern Ireland, I think that the British have a good record on human rights. It seems to me that, as a member of the Commonwealth, we can set a higher penalty for violations of human rights because there are tremendous violations of human rights in many of the Commonwealth countries. I think that diminishes the work of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the Commonwealth is changing and evolving. It is a modern partnership today. It has its weaknesses, especially with regard to human rights. I think that some times some members of the Commonwealth are a little reticent to comment on the internal affairs of another country. As far as I am concerned, human rights overcomes that. I am not one who necessarily subscribes to the United Nations charter article 2 paragraph 7. Some internal affairs of countries should override that part of the United Nations convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to take note of the report of the inquiry into the role of the Australian Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections. I should say that it is not commonly appreciated that not only trade unions but also employer organisations are industrial organisations. The report is as equally relevant to those employer organisations as it is to trade unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is a very balanced and constructive document. It is really quite astounding that it is a unanimous report in circumstances where there could be thought to have been some controversy. Indeed, there were some questions and answers in the federal parliament indicating that the inquiry may have been in the nature of a witch hunt or a scapegoating exercise. That certainly was not the case. I think it is to the credit of the chairman and members of the committee generally that they were able to come up with very sensible terms of reference and produce such a constructive document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also indicate appreciation for the role of Mr David Dick, who was seconded to assist the committee. He really was very talented in his knowledge of the area. As a matter of interest, he prepared one of the best historical analyses I have seen of legislation dealing with elections in industrial organisations. That in itself is very worthwhile reading for anyone who has an interest in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the report found that the Australian Electoral Commission conducts industrial elections in a very professional and even&hyphen;handed manner. That was the evidence from not only trade unions but also employer organisations. I think it could be regarded as quite an endorsement of the work of the Australian Electoral Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were over 3,500 elections in industrial organisations between 1991 and 1996. Of that number, only 1.5 per cent has resulted in inquiries, and only a fraction of that 1.5 per cent has involved allegations of fraudulent conduct. The sensationalism that we can sometimes read in the media regarding trade union or industrial organisation elections occurs in a very small percentage of organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been noted that you can have all the penalties and regimes in the world in legislation, but that does not prevent fraudulent conduct. Fraud occurs anyway. By its nature, it is unlawful conduct. It is very difficult for a legislature to legislate to stamp out fraud. What the legislature can do, of course, is to prescribe penalties for fraudulent conduct and an enforcement regime. In the context of the report, we have recommended some strengthening of penalties and some procedures which we believe will minimise fraud, particularly as it could occur in the electoral process, by cross&hyphen;verifying the information on the outside of an envelope, for instance, with the voter roll.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12175">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that some elements of the media would have liked to have seen a much more controversial, a much more sensational document. They have been sadly let down because it is not that. As I have said, it is an overall endorsement of the role of the Australian Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several witnesses place great emphasis on the findings of the Cooke inquiry in Queensland, which was conducted by Marshal Cooke, at the behest of the Queensland government, to inquire into the activities of five Queensland trade unions. People who compare our report to the report of the Cooke inquiry should bear in mind that the Cooke inquiry was established under Queensland legislation to look at five Queensland&hyphen;registered trade unions, not federally&hyphen;registered organisations. Those five unions were referred to the Cooke inquiry because of some pre-existing controversy regarding their behaviour. So the more dramatic findings of the Cooke inquiry very much have to be seen in that context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the opportunity of reviewing the totality of the operations under the federal act, which is an entirely separate piece of legislation, the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and now the Workplace Relations Act. We were quite satisfied with the generality of how these elections are being conducted. Without exception, every organisation that attended to give evidence&mdash;and the peak body, the Australian Council of Trade Unions&mdash;was at pains to indicate their preparedness to assist in ensuring and developing a regime that gave the greatest credibility possible to the electoral processes within their organisations. They saw that it was important that the public had faith in their electoral processes. All gave balanced and sensible evidence in terms of taking the issue forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making recommendations which we believe will go some way to strengthening the procedures, we constantly have borne in mind the fundamental principles of freedom of association and the right of industrial organisations to regulate their own affairs. However, in our pluralist system of government, and our system generally, industrial organisations, be they employee organisations or employer organisations, have quite significant power and influence in the political process, the industrial process and these days the social and political debate. In that context, the public has a very substantial interest in ensuring that their affairs are regulated legitimately and transparently. So not only an organisation's individual members but also the public can have faith in the authority of their leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that one of the recommendations to come out of the report was standardisation of envelopes to avoid the situation we saw recently where a judge in one Federal Court case had some anxiety that voting papers may have gone astray or may have been filled in on a multiple basis by certain candidates on both sides in the election. We think that regime will substantially remove the possibility of irregularities occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also recommended that voting be conducted on the basis of membership cut&hyphen;off roles. That is, there should be a cut&hyphen;off between 30 and 60 days before the opening of the ballot to ensure that the membership rolls are in order and that all members who are legitimately entitled to participate in the ballot can and those who are not entitled to participate are excluded from the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we have recommended the establishment of a menu of model rules for industrial organisations&mdash;not in the sense of making those rules mandatory but in the sense of the standard articles of association which are a schedule in the Corporations Law. We believe that having such a menu of model rules will assist both industrial officials and lawyers, for instance, in advising organisations as to establishing a system for elections which as close as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12176"> possible accords with the law and accords with principles and practices to minimise the occurrence of irregularities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also recommended that, after every election that is conducted, the returning officer provide a report concerning the conduct of the ballot. That report will refer to a number of things including whether there were any rules which gave the returning officer some concern, and a recommendation that they be looked at with a view to amending or clarifying them. The report will also contain advice from the returning officer as to the number of voting papers sent out, the number of voting papers that went astray, and any other difficulties that he may have seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have recommended that there be an obligation imposed on industrial organisations to publish that report and, if they see fit, their response to that report so that their members are aware of just what occurred in the electoral process. We recommend that the filing of that report be the trigger for a three&hyphen;month period within which a member must commence an application for an inquiry. We think the current period of 12 months is too long. It can cause administrative uncertainty and dislocation for a member to commence an inquiry right on the death knell of the 12&hyphen;month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also recommended that the returning officer undertake a sample check on membership rolls. We have not prescribed a percentage but have essentially left that to the discretion of the returning officer. We think that is a means by which the returning officer will be able to get a feel as to whether the union's membership roll is in order, bearing in mind that it is common for organisations to have 80,000 or 90,000 members&mdash;indeed for there to be substantial organisations with up to 170,000 members. So getting the membership roll in order is a substantial task in itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have recommended that there be consultation between the Australian Electoral Commission and peak industrial organisations, both employee and employer organisations, with a view to developing legislation prohibiting the use of union resources in the conduct of elections. I should say that that is not a phenomenon which we have found to be widespread. Indeed, numerous legal authorities say that trade union officials, or officials of employer organisations, have a fiduciary obligation to their organisations such that they offend those principles if they spend the resources of the organisation on an election campaign. There have been numerous cases establishing that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there seems to be a problem in that while a member can under section 209 of the act obtain a remedy against the officers that they perform and observe the rules of the organisation, the section does not seem to go so far as to enable a member to seek recovery of any funds spent inappropriately by an officer. There are also other sections in the act which enable the court to make orders rectifying an invalidity, but there is a substantial question as to whether those sections enable the court to order the refund of moneys misspent for improper purposes. It would be good to work out these issues on the basis of cooperation and come up with a mutually acceptable code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, can I say that the work of the secretariat was very professional and first&hyphen;class. I think the approach of all members was balanced and constructive, and the outcome of the report is a great endorsement for the committee system of the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for your cooperation in assisting me to participate in this discussion on the government response to the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with southern Africa. At the outset, can I say that looking at the speakers list today you would think that there was some sort of a double act going on between the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and me. Let me assure you that there is not. Most of the reports or items listed for discussion today and for the speakers list come from work that the committee has been involved in over the last couple of years, be it seminars or reports that we brought down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular paper is a government response to an inquiry into Australia's relations with southern Africa which was started under the previous Labor government. Indeed, I was chair of that inquiry until the election. And, of course, both the right honourable member for New England and I have a great interest in foreign affairs&mdash;hence the number of times we are speaking today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a little disappointed in the government response to the report in that, although they were not outright critical, most of the recommendations were fairly wishy&hyphen;washy and they agreed in part or agreed in principle. There were hardly any strong aspects of agreement; in fact, there were actually four items where the government agreed totally with what the committee recommended. One was the recommendation that Australia, as part of its assistance to southern Africa, include training for small and medium business. Well, yes, the government agreed to that. That is good that they agreed to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They agreed also that Australia continue to work for a total ban on landmines. Well, yes, of course they agreed with that. We all welcome that. I think it is today in Ottawa that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is signing that. Just diverting for a moment, I must say that I really support the role of the government in the work that they have done, especially the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on banning landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the recommendation that Austrade research the potential for niche markets for Australia in SADAC countries, yes, they agreed to that. You could hardly disagree with that. And there was the recommendation that the Commonwealth government be prepared to consider any feasibility study submitted by the Western Australian government and the University of Western Australia and Curtin University on establishing a Centre for African Studies in Western Australia. Of course that was agreed to as well. One is grateful for what the government agreed to, but they were not terribly profound items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government said that they did not agree with the recommendation that Austrade participate in the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in 1997&hyphen;98. The government argues that, rather than the broad&hyphen;brush approach, they should identify certain areas. They quote a trade mission led by the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer. Yes, that is important. But I also think participation is important, as was shown recently with participation in the Hamburg fair. The government has changed its mind on that one, and one would like to think it might be able to change its mind on participation at Zimbabwe because there is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12178"> potential for trade in that part of the world, especially in the mining area. People do not see the potential for trade there but, especially in southern Africa, there is great potential for trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is not widely represented in southern Africa. In fact, the only places that we have posts at the moment are South Africa and Zimbabwe&mdash;there is a post in Nairobi as well. One of the recommendations we made is that Australia increase its representation in Africa, not necessarily, as I have said in this committee before, by opening full diplomatic missions. There are many more innovative ways that we can go about this, such as sharing posts and not having so much of the paraphernalia that goes with a diplomatic post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were strongly of the view that the post in Harare should have extra staff. The government has rejected that. I really cannot see why it has rejected that. Current and past High Commissioners there have had a wide representation role in that area. The current High Commissioner represents Australia to something like seven other African states. Some of those states are quite important and have the potential to be quite important for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One that we constantly overlook is Namibia. The potential for our relationship with Namibia is great. We are not represented there. Then there is Mozambique. Mozambique has got problems. As I mentioned in my preceding contribution, it is now a member of the Commonwealth. It has always surprised me that we do not have diplomatic representatives in at least those two countries. We also made a recommendation concerning the Organisation of African Unity. Recommendation 4 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that. . . Australia offer encouragement and further practical help to the OAU, if requested, to assist in the development of good governance in Africa, particularly Southern Africa, through exploring alternative conflict resolution strategies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have made the point before in this House&mdash;and it is not covered by this report because we dealt with only the SADC countries of Southern Africa&mdash;that, when we got the reference, there was some debate and pressure on us to have a look at Southern Africa. We felt that Africa was such a wide, diverse continent that it would be impossible to bring down a meaningful report, so we thought we should just look at the Southern African region and that string of countries comprising SADC. Even as many of us suspected, the election took over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Organisation of African Unity has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. We briefly opened a mission in Addis Ababa some years ago and then quickly closed it. I think it was open for about 12 months. A parliamentary delegation went through that country, led by the current High Commissioner to Zimbabwe. The recommendation of that delegation was that we open a mission in Addis Ababa. I led one of the great delegations of the parliament through Africa  a couple of years later&mdash;well not so much a delegation but some of the reports of the delegation. By the time we got there, the post had been closed and all the furniture and everything had been flogged off to the Canadians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was a great tragedy that we did not have a post there, not least because the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity is a listening post. I have said this somewhat ad nauseam, but let me repeat it. Perhaps this will be the last time I use this argument. There was much hand wringing when we failed to gain a position on the UN Security Council. There were all sorts of looking at entrails and going to who voted how. This is a topic of particular interest to me because I will be looking at a few votes myself after sitting down and analysing them. But, nevertheless, there was much analysing of the votes cast&mdash;who voted for us and who did not vote for us in that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12179">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe we got a very good vote in Africa at all, not least because we have not had adequate representation in the posts in Africa. We do not have any representation in francophone Africa and we expect those people to turn up with the vote. Had we maintained a mission in Addis Ababa, it would have at least been a point of contact for many of those francophone countries. I think it would have been to Australia's benefit, but I am not quite sure if it would have changed the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the government response really just reinforces my view that the government does not take Africa terribly seriously. People think that I am just critical of the current government. I do not think that the previous government took it terribly seriously either. For one reason or other, we see our future very much in the Asian region. I agree with that. But what we always tend to do in Australia is to look for one area where we can have influence, or where we see our economic and political future and too often we pass by either our former friends&mdash;whether they be the European countries&mdash;or the potential for new areas where we can have an influence. Australia, of course, is not a super power. We are a small to middling power, but we can have influence in various regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In comparing Australia with Sweden, it always surprises me that Sweden, which has a smaller population than Australia, has much more influence in the international community than Australia has. People take the Swedish view quite seriously. That is for many reasons. But we are too closely aligned with the Americans. We are perceived as always going along with them, and we do not develop what we can in various parts of the world. So I think that the government has missed an opportunity to respond more positively. They have not actually disagreed with much, but they have not agreed with much either. They have agreed in part, or in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that our relations with Southern Africa are important. From the comments I have received from some of my friends on the African continent, the report that was brought down was a well received report. But as usual, as governments have done in the past, we will go along not working terribly hard to improve the relationship, not doing anything that may offend the relationship, very much taking it for granted. In the long term, I think Australia is the poorer for that, and in many respects, such as was shown in the vote for the Security Council of the UN, we will pay a price either diplomatically or, indeed, economically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are great economic possibilities in Africa. Some of the mining companies are there doing quite well. BHP is there working on the platinum mine&mdash;it will be one of the largest in the world. But because we fail to be adequately represented in so many parts of Africa, we have missed the boat in many respects in that area. I commend the report to the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. It is a pleasure to see you there. Let me say that I still worry about the functioning of this Main Committee, and I think today's debate illustrates that. There are about two men and a dog here, and none of the ministers, and none of the departmental officials. We have a series of reports dealing with what I regard as fairly significant public policy issues. While I enjoy the opportunity of being able to talk, which is often denied us in the other chamber, in the function of this committee when we have reports such as the ones we are dealing with today, it is a pity that we cannot make a more meaningful use of the relationship of parliament which is designed to provide ministers in government and members an ongoing contact. I worry that we get ourselves too much involved in the thought that just because we produce reports, they are actually going to have any consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12180">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I say to you now that you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, that when you were in your other role talking to the motion, many of your comments echoed my own concerns. It began, of course, with the observation that you made that the Sir Humphrey&hyphen;like response of the government to the recommendations of the committee rather suggested that they patted us on the head and said, `Yes. It is very good to consider those issues. We are glad to know that somebody is considering them. But the Treasurer has not given us the money for one reason or another, and we have not been able to proceed to adopt them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there is only one of these recommendations to which they have specifically said no, but instead of saying yes to the others they have added some sort of qualification to most. As one who is worried about where we go in our relationship with the African continent, I think it is important we are more than half-hearted by saying there are things we can do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one recommendation that the government has rejected is recommendation 18, that we participate in the Zimbabwe international trade fair this year and next year. I am not sure where we go with expos and international trade fairs but I must admit I have been involved with a few. We took some pretty brave decisions in the past to become involved in expos, and with some of them we wondered whether we were going to get a particular benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who visited the Brisbane Expo will know what an extraordinary event it was. In this instance, Zimbabwe is a country which is trying hard to establish its presence and its trade contacts. It seems to me that there are ways by which you can participate without its costing a fortune and yet it can bring reasonable benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having read the government's reasons, it seems to me that the `no' men of the government are saying, `I'm sorry, we haven't got the dough so let's forget it.' Instead of trying to find ways to do things, they are finding reasons why they cannot be done. Frankly, that is not good enough. The reason the government gives in its October response is a bit trite. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian business community values the participation of Austrade in trade displays in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what Austrade is for. Austrade has the capacity to muster a number of parties in order that they can collectively make a presentation. Further on the comment is made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is noted that the Zimbex Trade Fair in Harare is competing with the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair to become the premium trade display in Zimbabwe.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not mind which one we go to but I do think we have to be very precise in working with our business community in trying to promote who we are and where we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Keep in mind that the report to which this is a response, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Southern Africa</EMPHASIS>, is a report that is directed to a group of countries where there is the most significant growth in trade in the world. People say, `We have so much trade with South Africa because we have the same economies. Even though politics kept us apart, now that apartheid has ended we are able to trade more freely and liberally and therefore we are in a position to go ahead.' Frankly, there is a lot more to it than that. That is why this report tried to pick up what we see as both a political and a commercial attempt to improve our relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing the report I should again pay credit to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it was due to your initiative  that the report began under your chairmanship. As one who looked at Africa when the recommendation was made, I too shared some of the cynicism that comes from of the government's response. When you look at the nations of Africa, for years the Europeans dominated them. What happened in Africa was a classic illustration of the aftermath of European colonialism. The Europeans did not have the interests of those countries at heart 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12181"> but rather what could be done to advance the economic interests of the Europeans. It has taken considerable time for these African countries to get to the stage of being able to look more positively to the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were so many countries to look at that we cut it down to the SADC countries. By putting the SADC countries together we were able to focus on the fact that there is, if anything, a remarkable transformation occurring in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now proceeding towards an era when we have a better chance of seeing an advancement in those political qualities to which I referred a while ago&mdash;democratic institutions, the advance of human rights, the maintenance of the rule of law and a freedom of press. We also have a reasonable opportunity of advancing our political and economic interests together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another recommendation that I feel quite strongly about, and again I share the views of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), concerns our diplomatic representation in Africa. We really are not doing well enough. Kerry Sibraa, the former President of the Senate, is our present ambassador. For all that he comes from the other side of politics from me, I believe he has done an excellent job in representing us at seven posts. It is an extraordinary charge. He represents us to seven countries, all of which are different, most of which are underdeveloped, all of which have political institutions that are fairly fragile and really do need a bit of TLC. He has done a very good job. But having one person in one post&mdash;certainly with some professional assistance&mdash;means that we are not sufficiently addressing the problems of southern Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps that goes to the core of my concern about this response. I know that this report does not deal with the structure and management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but it seems to me that, if anything, the report reflects that the department does need to be concerned about itself. Perhaps we ought to have an inquiry into the department and see whether or not there are ways by which we could improve its management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regard Australia's foreign policy as a very important part of looking at the standards of living of Australians. Our foreign policy is not there to promote Australia in the direct sense&mdash;because our foreign relationships involve many other issues&mdash;it is there to protect our interests, to advance our interests and to advance our understanding. It is there to help other countries develop to the point where they are not likely to be a security threat, where their economic advancement enables them to be self-sufficient, where they are not going to be continually dependent on overseas aid and where they can make their own contribution towards the stability of the world system. Those are all very grandiose ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foreign office has progressively changed its priorities&mdash;we all accept our priority is for Asia&mdash;but, as it has done so, we have reduced significantly our presence in a number of regions of the world, and one of them is southern Africa. I am sorry that, in this response, while the government has given this agreement in principle, it all seems to be predicated on the fact that the money is not there. Therefore, it is not going to be possible to provide the financial resources needed to maintain the level of diplomatic and trade representation in southern Africa that I believe is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are ways by which you can get an extension of resources. The department at the moment is looking at one-person posts. I do not like that idea. I think it would be far better to provide at least two people to represent Australian interests&mdash;that is, two Australian-based staff in any post. Secondly, we can have a look at ways by which we can share overseas posts, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12182"> which I know we are now doing with Canada. I have seen the current post in Vietnam which seems to work quite well: there, the Canadians share our post; in other places, I gather we share the Canadian posts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not too sure whether that might be a way that we  can work in southern Africa. That does not mean that we subordinate our national interest to Canada or to any other country. But it does mean that, in the one facility, you can provide your own Australian national identity and you can promote your Australian views. I think that is fairly important because there are enormous economic opportunities in southern Africa, and we have very real political interests in southern Africa. I think that we need to have in mind that, just as we look today at the Pacific as the area of growth for all those economic tigers&mdash;albeit going through some economic difficulty&mdash;the growth in the Indian Ocean region offers the same potential for the future as I believe we have been able to gain from the Pacific over the past two decades. I am sorry that, in this response, the government has perhaps not seen those opportunities that are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In this response, while the government accepted a number of recommendations that we have made, they have said they are the subject of the Simons review. We have talked about the Simons review earlier in this chamber today. I hope that, having now pronounced where we are going on the Simons review, they will revisit the recommendations we have made and pick them up and provide the resources necessary. For example, recommendation No. 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AusAID, in conjunction with Southern African authorities, consider including provision of some legal education and training, and assistance to establish legal resource centres, as part of the official development assistance program.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To that the government said that they agreed with the recommendation in principle, subject to the government's consideration of the Simons review recommendations and funding availability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of that is to try and help those countries to govern themselves, to put in place better democratic institutions and, as I keep on saying, to promote the rule of law and to get over the problems which saw Australian soldiers serving in Somalia. While Somalia is out of the region, the point is that if you can promote these countries to look after themselves, you are going to avoid what, to my mind, is a regrettable alternative to establishing those principles by sending military force&mdash;even though in Somalia it was a United Nations peacekeeping force. Essentially, it is far better providing legal resources and aid to help these countries to help themselves than it is to have to send in the Australian Defence Force to do so as part of a peacekeeping mission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of these other recommendations. I have mentioned the extent to which I believe we need more diplomatic representation, I have mentioned the degree to which I think there are trade opportunities there that need to be promoted, and I do not think the government has accepted those to a sufficient degree. In all, the problem that I see in this response is that the priority given to southern Africa at this stage is really predicated more on a financial dictate than it is on a foreign policy priority. I think that is regrettable. I think we do have reason to try to find ways by which we can do a lot more than we are to promote our interests with these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other recommendation I want to refer to is recommendation No. 24. We recommended that we try to develop, with the South African and Zimbabwe governments, a memorandum of understanding on tourism cooperation. We developed the argument in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12183"> report; I will not go back to it now. We have been told that the government agrees to it, but it is not going to be pursued under current circumstances. I think that tourism cooperation is essential if we are going to take advantage of new tourist opportunities in the future. We are, each of us, at one end of the tourist track&mdash;southern Africa in the African sense, and Australia in the Pacific sense&mdash;and by cooperating in this way, we could advance our own trade and our tourism opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all, I found the government's response less than adequate. I am disappointed they have not taken more seriously the recommendations we made in our report on Australia's relations with southern Africa. And where they have responded, they have done so with qualifications. I hope they will revisit our recommendations because I believe they are in Australia's best long&hyphen;term interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on this report by the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, I would like to put on the record my appreciation and thanks to the now Minister for Transport and Regional Development&mdash;but formerly the chairman of our committee&mdash;the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and also, after the member for Lyne was promoted, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), for the very even&hyphen;handed manner in which they have chaired that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to recognise the very learned contribution made by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) to the committee's deliberations and to the compiling of this report. Over the last seven years that I have been in this place at a federal level, I have come to realise that what the member for Shortland does not know about transport in this country does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two areas in particular that I would like to comment on today before I finish by remarking on some of the issues also raised by the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) in his dissenting report. I notice that he is listed to speak after me here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Determining the Commonwealth's proper role in overseeing and funding the national road system was of course the primary goal of our committee. The message that came through in the majority of the submissions to the committee on this subject was, I believe, a resounding endorsement not only for the Commonwealth playing a role over and above providing road funding to the different levels of government but also that it should be active in pursuing that role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and again, the committee received submissions which made it clear to the majority of members that, as far as the future of the national road system is concerned, it is essential&mdash;essential, I stress&mdash;that the Commonwealth avoid simply giving money to the states and territories and relinquishing any managerial role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the contrary, it is necessary for the Commonwealth to involve itself wherever and whenever practical in the planning and the support of our national road system. As the report 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12184"> makes very clear, the Commonwealth is uniquely placed in Australia's federation to take a national approach to road projects. The roads of national importance in this country deserve to be considered as such at the level of government which concerns itself with all other issues of national significance. That, of course, is our Commonwealth. We cannot rely, and we have too many examples in the past of why we should not rely, simply on the states and territories to rise to the occasion and together maintain and coordinate the roads of national importance in this country. Nor do the states and territories want to assume that role from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the submissions that were put to the inquiry by the state and territory governments. The New South Wales government argued strongly that the Commonwealth should play a major part in implementing a national strategy for the road system. The Queensland government stated that the Commonwealth should set and monitor a number of national road priorities. The Northern Territory government argued that the Commonwealth brought a national perspective to roads and that the state and territory governments, from their positions, could not be expected to consider which roads were of national priority and which were not. The Western Australian government argued that a Commonwealth role in the national road system allowed national benefits to be maximised. The South Australian government stated that the Commonwealth, via its involvement in roads, was able to transcend state and sectional interests in order to achieve national objectives. Both the ACT and the Tasmanian governments argued that the Commonwealth had to continue articulating a national focus for the national highway system. It was only the Victorian government which questioned, in any depth, the role of the Commonwealth outside of providing funding for the national road system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With almost a complete majority of states and territories making their opinions clear on this matter, and with almost unanimous agreement of the members of the committee&mdash;and I am glad the member for Parramatta is here because he was the one who put in the dissenting report&mdash;I think this report has quite correctly found that the Commonwealth has a considerable role to play in a number of key areas. They are the strategic planning of roads, the setting of national road standards, project approval for roads of national importance and taking responsibility for the overall network of the national road system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a case to be made for a more precise delineation of responsibilities between the different levels of government where roads are concerned. There is a case for getting rid of the duplication and the overlapping of services that do occur between the different levels of government. However, delineation of responsibilities between the different levels does not, and should not, mean devolution of the Commonwealth's responsibilities either to the states and territories or to local government. This is a point I will return to in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of this report that I would like to comment on more closely relates to Commonwealth funding and, in particular, the issue of tied grants. I was glad to see the committee give its approval for tied Commonwealth grants to the states as the best and most effective way of providing a fair and coordinated national approach to funding our road system. I join the honourable member for Shortland in stating for the record that I too viewed with reluctance the abolition of tied grants by the former Labor government in 1991. I considered it a mistake at the time and, six years later, I still think it was a mistake. It is fairly obvious to most of us that it has been exactly that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12185">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the submission from the Victorian government was the only one out of all of those received from the states and territories which expressed dissatisfaction with the idea of tied grants. I think this mainly reflects the isolationist approach to government adopted by the Kennett administration, which considers any guidance coming from the Commonwealth as interference. Yet, as we have seen, without tied grants the Commonwealth&mdash;and, remember, this is at a time when the states and the territories are complaining about the lack of certainty they face with the current funding arrangements&mdash;finds itself burdened with uncertainty of its own. With untied grants the Commonwealth finds itself giving large chunks of money to state, territory and local governments, without complete confidence that the money is being used for the specific purpose of maintaining and building roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to untie all funding, the Commonwealth would need to be assured in some way that the money it was allocating to the states and the territories was being used for the express purpose for which it was intended. In its submission to the committee, the New South Wales government stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Commonwealth funding was to be untied, an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and the Territories would be essential to demonstrate what it is trying to achieve, with an agreed target nationally through strategic plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considerable debate would be required to work out equitable, acceptable criteria for allocating payments to the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Coming to such an arrangement would be fraught with difficulties. It would require a great deal of trust and goodwill on both sides. If we are being completely honest, that may be the most difficult thing of all. Ultimately, it does not match the benefits associated with a well articulated system of tied grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has also taken on board the criticism contained in a number of submissions regarding the level of uncertainty which currently exists for the states, the territories and local government in respect of the Commonwealth's funding arrangements. There was an undeniable concern among the submissions over the unpredictability of Commonwealth funding and the problems that such instability brings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I warmly support the committee's recommendations that the Commonwealth attach greater certainty to its funding of roads by implementing a guaranteed funding approach for a rolling three&hyphen;year period. It was not a surprise to any of us to see the Treasury mandarins cautioning us against recommending such a move and advising us that it would inhibit the Commonwealth's need for budgetary flexibility. While we took such advice on board, I was happy to see the argument for increased certainty and efficiency in road funding won the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to turn to the dissenting report of the member for Parramatta. In reading the member for Parramatta's report&mdash;and having listened with interest to his short speech in the House on the report in November&mdash;I believe his difficulty with the committee majority report seems to be one of ideology, of philosophy and of his understanding of what constitutes the proper relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. I fear, however, that the member for Parramatta has let ideology and philosophy blind him to the realities of what makes good sense for the road system in this country. I personally find it difficult to comprehend that the member for Parramatta could sit through all of those public hearings, read all of the submissions, which were handed into the committee, and yet come to the conclusion, as he did in the House the other day, that the Commonwealth has `no business in roads'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12186">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Parramatta wants to devolve the Commonwealth's powers back to the states, beginning with the national road system. Yet, apart from the submission from the Victorian government, that is the last thing on the minds of the other seven states and territories. As the committee was guided by these submissions, as much as anyone else, perhaps the member for Parramatta would do better to lobby the governments in those other states and territories to get them to change their minds. He would then have a better chance of convincing the committee of his argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the member for Parramatta likes to use a famous quote or two or three to illustrate his point. After reading his dissenting report, I had begun to think he had swallowed a book of familiar quotations before putting pen to paper. He was certainly still digesting them when he spoke on the report in the House. With this in mind, I am sure he would appreciate this bastardisation of a quote from Shakespeare: `There are more things in heaven and earth, member for Parramatta, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.' That includes, mundanely enough, the maintenance of planning of the national road system in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By all means let us clarify the role of the Commonwealth in funding, planning and maintaining roads in this country. But do not let us make the enormous error of getting rid of its guiding influence and the perspective it can offer outside of the simple allocation of funds. Let us not let ideology and philosophy blind us into going down that path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, along with my fellow members, I would like to again thank the chair of the committee and the member for Shortland for their work and to thank the standing committee staff for their ceaseless devotion to duty. I would like to put on record that the secretary was Meg Crooks, the inquiry officer was Geoff Johnston and the research officers were Jason Allford and Maria Grainger. The administrative officers, Annette Fischer, Natalie Milner and Lena Ridley, certainly did more than what was called for them to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is showing very clearly with some of the committees we seem to be sitting on now in the House is that when we amalgamate a number of portfolios into one committee, if we are going to carry that type of load, and we as members are expected to, well and good, but, more appropriately, we should be looking at a greater staffing level. I do not think in future we can expect staff, no matter how good they are&mdash;and the staff on this particular committee were second to none&mdash;to carry the loads that they had to over the recent reports that we have completed. Again, I commend them, and I also thank fellow members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly took evidence that was varied. We certainly took opinions on board that were varied. I believe this report in its totality is a very good report. It is a report that is worthy of an answer&mdash;a very quick answer&mdash;from the government. I commend the report to the House and I will be looking forward to the minister's reply, bearing in mind that for possibly 90 per cent of the evidence that we took and the submissions to this inquiry he was chairing the inquiry. It certainly will make some interesting reading when the government finally tables the response to this report in the House. I commend the report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the contribution of the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). She highlights the gravity with which one ought to approach the issue of a dissent, particularly as a government member of a committee with a government majority. The member for Prospect speaks as arguably one of the most experienced public figures in Australia, having served as mayor of her local community, as a member of the state parliament, as a minister of the Crown in the New South 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12187"> Wales government and now as a senior figure in the Labor opposition. So I take her views with considerable regard and respect. I nonetheless find myself in dissent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the member for Prospect is not alone but that, in fact, I am alone on this issue. Of the 14 members of the committee, 13 found themselves in clear agreement on the basic principles and findings of the report. I stand as something of a shag on a rock, a voice in the wilderness; nonetheless, I stand firmly in dissent on two key issues of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is the question, as the member for Prospect said, of what is the appropriate constitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. The second is the question of the role of private investment in the road network. They were the two principal issues on which I found myself in disagreement. Were one to accept that the status quo in terms of Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations is acceptable, then there is much in the report about which I could agree and with which I could concur. But starting as I do from that fundamental philosophical or, if you like, ideological point of difference, I find myself in dissent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address firstly that question of Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations and to turn later on to the question of private investment in the road network. My feelings and instincts on the subject come in part from my experience serving as a staffer to two ministers in the New South Wales government&mdash;one a minister for minerals and energy and the other a minister for roads and transport&mdash;in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Over that period, I formed a view about the role of the Commonwealth in what I regarded as more naturally or appropriately state government affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It did seem to me that the Commonwealth was remote from those who actually deliver services, remote from the coalface of service provision and decision making. It seemed to me that the Commonwealth frequently acted as a kind of constitutional bully, using its financial power and the lopsidedness of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relationship to force policy outcomes on the states which it seemed to me were well beyond the constitutional warrant of the Commonwealth. I refer back to what I see as the seminal point in this debate, and a key point in understanding public policy in this country, which actually relates to the Federal Aid Roads Act 1926.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I quote for the first time, in either this chamber or the other, James Scullin, the then leader of the ALP opposition in the government of Bruce. This is his response to the then transport minister's second reading speech on the introduction of the Federal Aid Roads Act. Scullin rose and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not the slightest objection to this Parliament making a grant or a gift to assist the State Governments in any direction it considers necessary; but there is a marked distinction between a gift to the States . . . from an overflowing Treasury, to assist them in developmental work, whether it be for road&hyphen;making or railway construction, and introducing a permanent and continuous policy over a period of ten years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable members can draw a distinction between the gift of a sum of money for constructing a few main roads&mdash;which is a state function&mdash;and introducing a policy under which new taxation is to be imposed in order to enter the field of road construction in state territories. We are exceeding our constitutional rights when we invade, in this way, territory under the control of state authorities, and that, in my judgment, is the fundamental objection to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My argument is that nothing fundamental has changed in those 71 years, that exactly the same arguments that were being had in the chamber on the day that the Federal Aid Roads Act was introduced are relevant today, and I will seek to substantiate that in my remarks in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12188"> a few moments. Before doing so, I quote another paragraph from Scullin's response to the Federal Aid Roads Act. This has got to do with the nature of federalism and the federal compact which governs the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. Scullin says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The supporters of the Government are continually chiding the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the Labor opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for being unificationists. It is true that we favour one sovereign government for Australia, but we are, at least, honest enough to say that, whilst we have a Federal system, it should be respected, and that we should not try to undermine it. It is the duty of the Government and those who stand for federation . . . not to undermine it, and those who believe in changing it in a constitutional way should also respect the union until they can openly bring about a unified system such as they believe in.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The practical consequence of this lopsided relationship, of the abuse of power by the Commonwealth, the breach of the spirit of the constitution, is that Australia now practises, in the words of Denis James from the Parliamentary Research Service, `the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance of any federation in the world.' I just want to repeat that: `Australia practises', in the words of Denis James, `the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance of any federation in the world.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my dissenting report, I cite the fact that, in 1996&hyphen;97, the Commonwealth raised $130.7 billion in revenue. On the other hand, Commonwealth outlays for its own purposes were only 58 per cent of total generated government outlays. As a result, in the same year the Commonwealth provided the states with grants amounting to $34.6 billion. Overall, in 1995&hyphen;96, Commonwealth assistance comprised 45.8 per cent of state and territory revenues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done is not only usurped more and more state functions, as Scullin so clearly elucidated, but also deprived the states of the capacity to raise their own revenues. We then get into this terrible situation where, every time you have a premiers conference or a council of Australian governments, you get this name calling and you get this refusal of anyone to accept responsibility. The buck stops nowhere because the states blame the Commonwealth for a lack of funds and the Commonwealth blames the states for failing to discharge their constitutional duties&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Aid Roads Act subsequently became the subject of curial consideration in the State of Victoria v. the Commonwealth 1926 roads case in which the High Court rejected Scullin's argument and upheld the act introduced by the government of Stanley Melbourne Bruce, and you saw this massive increase in the scope of Commonwealth power because of its capacity to manipulate section 96 grants to go into any area of state policy that any particular Commonwealth minister, on any whim of the day, decided he wanted to enter into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been very destructive for our relations. I believe we have to have one thing or the other. As Scullin says, if we want to have a unification, a unitary system of government where there is just the Commonwealth and local government, let us put it to the people and ask them. But let us not do it by stealth, because the abuses of public administration which flow from that stealth are many and varied.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12189">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn now to the issue of private investment in the road network. In particular, my dissent flows from a conclusion of the majority report which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BOOT schemes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">or build, own, operate, transfer schemes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are unlikely to be the best method of delivering Commonwealth road projects . . . The Committee also considers that BOOT schemes are unlikely to be the best method of delivering State/Territory and local road projects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That second recommendation from our committee deliberations is a breach of the basic convention that the Commonwealth does not venture into the field of state exclusive responsibility and lecture on or dictate to the states what is good for them. We restrict ourselves in our inquiries to recommendations over which the Commonwealth has direct responsibility, but in this instance we have decided to draw a very long bow, to enter&mdash;in an excessive way, in my view&mdash;into the field of the states and to start directing policy. Furthermore, in my opinion we have done it on the basis of evidence before the committee which was either incomplete or inaccurate.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CROSIO" NAMEID="7T4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K6">Mr ROSS CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right&mdash;and I have questioned it at various points through the hearings of the committee. The basic view of the committee was that there is not a real transfer of risk to the private sector. We are talking about these urban motorways or tollways. The view of the committee was that there was not a bona fide transfer of risk from the government to the private sector, that the private sector was deriving a benefit from these roads which was not matched by the commercial risk of delivering the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a view that I adhere to or uphold, and so I was at pains in the minority report to demonstrate the evolution of risk transfer over these projects, particularly in New South Wales, beginning with the Sydney Harbour Tunnel and moving through the M5 motorway, the M4 motorway, the M5 extension and, most recently, the M2 motorway. We have seen the evolution in sophistication of both government and the private sector in managing the risks associated with these major projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take, for example, the M2 motorway, which borders the northern boundary of my electorate, that motorway is giving back to 45,000 people every day 40 minutes of their time in going to and from the city&mdash;20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the evening for a toll of $2.50 each way. Effectively, that means 20,000 fathers who did not get to do so before the building of the motorway get to have breakfast with their kids before they leave home. In terms of productivity in the economy, this means that you have made a major contribution to the quality of life if you can give people an additional 40 minutes a day disposable time. I reckon you would have to go far and wide to point to any government policy which could match that in terms of the impact on the quality of life of a family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you saw there was a group of people gathered together around a $660 million project. You had the bankers providing debt, you had the equity providers investing, you had the insurers, you had the construction joint venturer and you had all of their lawyers gathered together around one table wrestling this beast to the ground. The critical thing about the bankability of one of these projects is that it is subject to market disciplines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, I worked for the New South Wales Minister for Minerals and Energy. In New South Wales, we created $10 billion worth of excess power generation capacity under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12190"> the former Electricity Commission because the decisions of that government agency were not subject to the test of whether the community actually needed the infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the M2 motorway the deal would not get done until those bankers are prepared to sign on the bottom line and say, `We believe that over 40 years we will get our money back.' That commercial interest serves a critical public policy interest, which is that we build only the infrastructure that the community actually needs. It helps to ensure that the investment of funds is not subject to political whims and political opportunism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the Commonwealth involvement in the national highway is that it has an intrinsic bias against urban roads. All of the studies before the committee showed that the critical need was for investment in urban arterial roads. The member for Prospect and I have both been strong advocates in respect of, for example, the need for the upgrade of the Cumberland Highway in western Sydney and likewise the need for the upgrade of the Sydney orbital route. Yet money is being spent&mdash;because of the political pressure, essentially&mdash;on a national highway system which is overwhelmingly a rural system, skewing resources away from the real need in urban areas into rural areas. That is because of the Commonwealth involvement in roads policy and roads funding. If we just got out of it and vacated it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the majority&mdash;as everyone else was apart from the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron)&mdash;I support the majority recommendations in the report of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform on its review of federal road funding. If time allows I will talk a little about some of those recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the spirited speech of the member for Parramatta, however, I would like to deal with the minority report and to put a counter view of the issues that he has raised. He argues that the Commonwealth should get out of direct funding for roads and hand the money over to the states for them to expend, firstly because of vertical fiscal imbalance and also because he thinks funds are being wasted on the national highway which would be better spent on urban roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term `vertical fiscal imbalance' means that the Commonwealth raises a lot more money than it spends for its own purposes&mdash;and the states correspondingly, through their revenue raising activities, raise a lot less money than they need for their own expenditures. The Commonwealth makes payments to the states to enable them to make up the deficiency, but this leads to a very substantial imbalance between revenues raised and expenditures by the states and the Commonwealth. This situation is called vertical fiscal imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever one thinks of that&mdash;and it seems to me that there are certainly strong arguments for some correction of it&mdash;it seems to me strange that the member for Parramatta, in his minority report, is arguing to make it worse. What he is arguing is that the Commonwealth should get out of direct road funding, making own expenditures on roads, and make more payments to the states. This would mean that the states would have more expenditures of their own, and even greater imbalance between the revenues they raise and their own expenditures. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12191"> The Commonwealth likewise would have an even greater imbalance between the revenues it raises and its own expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vertical fiscal imbalance would be made worse by the proposal of the member for Parramatta, who uses vertical fiscal imbalance as an argument that we should not be funding roads directly at the Commonwealth level. It is just a total non sequitur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, if the Commonwealth is to get out of direct road funding and hand the money to the states, why stop at roads? This is an argument to end Commonwealth funding for education, for health, for housing, for community services, for a whole host of expenditures that the Commonwealth is involved in, and an end, therefore, to a national approach to expenditures in all those areas. It means that we would not have a capacity for a national education system; we would not have standards being set for national health; and, likewise, we would not have a national road system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that we fund a national highway is that, if we left it to the states, we would probably have extremely inadequate links both between our capital cities and for the nation as a whole in terms of its national road system. That, it seems to me, would be a great deficiency in terms of our unity as a nation. It would reduce the economic efficiency of interstate transfers which take place through roads; and, of course, it is very important to us that those transfers are as efficient as possible. We would not have a highly efficient system to anything like the degree which we have at the present time, if we were to rely on the states to build it, because the concentration of the states would be more likely to be on areas which they saw as being to their own maximum advantage, without looking at the national overall benefit. I reject absolutely the view of the member for Parramatta in his approach, which is one of absolute states rights extremism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that funds are being wasted on the national highway and would be better spent on urban roads misses the point that we have in fact, in recent years, moved to have included in the national highway system the urban ring roads which link the national highway into and out of capital cities. This has already been funded in Melbourne with the western ring road; $600 million of federal government money has been put into the western ring road, thus linking the national highway and bringing about a tremendous economic boost to the western region of Melbourne as well as a greatly facilitated flow for interstate transport around the city of Melbourne&mdash;and for intrastate transport, for that matter, as well. Thus, we already have that example of a great urban benefit coming from federal government funding of the ring roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Road Traffic Authority says the number one road of importance in New South Wales is the similar ring road in Sydney, linking the national highway coming in at Liverpool and coming in at Hornsby. That orbital road, which the member for Parramatta referred to, is a most important road, and that will presumably be funded under the national highway program, following upon the completion of the western ring road; and the same thing can also be done to enhance the ring road system in Brisbane. Thus, we do have an added concentration of national highway programs on the urban road system in recent times, and I think the point being raised by the member for Parramatta is quite wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the minority report, of course, there is the important area regarding BOOT projects, which the member for Parramatta contends that the majority was wrong on, because it said that they were unlikely to be the best method of delivering roads at the Commonwealth, state or local government level in the future. And his report cites 10 criticisms, in the majority 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12192"> report, of BOOT schemes. The principal one of these is the inadequacy of the risk burden carried by the private sector operator, and the corresponding and inappropriate level of risk borne by the government&mdash;and, therefore, the taxpayer&mdash;for roads that they are supposed not to own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this matter, the minority report relies heavily on a response by the New South Wales Road Traffic Authority to very strong criticisms by the New South Wales Auditor&hyphen;General of the Sydney Harbour tunnel project and the Sydney M4 and M5 toll roads. The minority report accuses the majority report of ignoring the RTA response to the Auditor&hyphen;General, and proceeds to rely very heavily on the RTA response by quoting slabs of it in criticism of the Auditor&hyphen;General in his report. Indeed, the minority report reads very much like a whole lot of special pleading by the RTA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the minority report entirely ignores the Auditor&hyphen;General's rejection of the RTA response. The fact is, despite the RTA's strenuous objection, the Auditor&hyphen;General strongly maintained his original position. For example, in relation to the Sydney Harbour tunnel, the Auditor&hyphen;General commented on the RTA response to his report. I refer to the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Private participation in the provision of public infrastructure: the Roads and Traffic Authority</EMPHASIS> and the foreword to that by the Auditor&hyphen;General, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority asserts that only the Auditor&hyphen;General believes that the risks of ownership reside with the Authority . . . This statement ignores that its accounting adviser can also see reasons why it would be acceptable for the Authority to recognise its ownership of the Tunnel. It ignores Westpac's view that the Government and the Authority have the financial risks. It ignores that the Sydney Harbour Tunnel Company has no continuing benefit or risks from its legal ownership. And it ignores the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales' view that the Authority is the carrier of Tunnel risks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the Authority is the only entity that cannot or will not see that it is the risk taker.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the Auditor&hyphen;General's comment on the proposition by the RTA that it was not the risk taker in regard to that project. Also, he went on to say in relation to the RTA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, if I could be mildly critical of the authority, now up to its eighth legal action concerning the report, I could not agree that it cooperated with this audit. In fact, its approach could hardly have been more uncooperative. If the Roads and Traffic Authority has in the community a poor reputation for objectivity and responsiveness, its approach to this report reflects that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think there was much acceptance by the Auditor&hyphen;General of any of the RTA's comments. He regarded it as a pretty maverick outfit. Nor has there been a marked change in the Auditor&hyphen;General's approach in subsequent reports of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report endeavoured to argue that there had been an improvement in the allocation of risk in the later road projects. It quotes the New South Wales Auditor&hyphen;General on page 134 of the report as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report on the M2 motorway published at the beginning of 1995 noted the improvement (building on experience from previous schemes) in the balance of risks to be borne by the developer and the RTA, in particular, contractual arrangements . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then there is a break and it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements proposed for the contract for the Eastern Distributor continue the improvement in the balance of risks observed in the report on the M2.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, it is arguing that the Auditor&hyphen;General was saying there was this improvement. What it left out, however, was significant because what it left out were the comments by the Auditor&hyphen;General to this effect, and this was in the break in those quotes:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12193">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it also highlighted the uncertainty that remained over the underlying costs and benefits of such schemes for the state and for the transport network as a whole. While recognising some of the benefits from private sector financing and operation of some schemes in terms of efficiency, timing and risk sharing, it suggested that public ownership of such schemes might offer the potential for better management of traffic risk over the road network as a whole, more efficient pricing mechanisms and a more optimum public transport network.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This audit cannot definitively answer whether, from a financial viewpoint, private ownership of the M2 is the state's interest. It suggests that it need not be in the state's interest and it recommends that the government, with respect to future projects, carefully examine the relative economic benefits of private vs public ownership of urban tollways (and the effects of different revenue raising mechanisms).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All of that absolutely crucial reference to the fact that what he was really saying was that there was no evidence to show that private sector was better than public sector, and listing a stream of benefits for public sector over private sector was left out of that quote to try to suggest that the whole thing was moving in a way which was much more acceptable to the Auditor&hyphen;General. That is just a misquoting of what the Auditor&hyphen;General was on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, this misuse of quotes is also displayed in regard to the EPAC report on private infrastructure which is mentioned on page 139 of the minority report. In that respect, there is a reference to the EPAC report talking about BOOT&hyphen;type schemes and some advantages from those. What it leaves out are comments by the New South Wales Auditor&hyphen;General in his review of the eastern distributor road and this is not mentioned at all in the minority report. In respect of that EPAC task force, it concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the broad, BOOT&hyphen;type structures are likely to be least advantageous for urban roads. In reaching this conclusion, it considered that the incremental efficiencies from private ownership are likely to be smaller in roads than in other sectors and the private financing cost penalty more pronounced owing to greater network risk and higher transaction costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is quite clear that the reference to EPAC that is supportive for the minority report position is quite wrong. The EPAC position was quite against the use of BOOT&hyphen;type projects for urban roads. In regard to the eastern distributor, the Auditor&hyphen;General showed in the eastern distributor performance audit that he is still very unconvinced about private sector BOOT financing for urban roads, as that EPAC quote shows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to private financing, it may lead to a lower level of traffic than could be achieved with road tolling, if the providers had access to public borrowing. This was a view put in the Eastern Distributor report by the Auditor&hyphen;General. The overall benefits of the scheme are reduced because of less traffic using new roads than if they were directly provided by the government. This point was made by Professor Quiggin to the committee also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the Auditor&hyphen;General calls for a major examination in regard to financing urban motorways. On page 2 on the eastern distributor report, the Auditor&hyphen;General of New South Wales in mid&hyphen;1997 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence that urban toll roads are not as effective as other options is very strong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on with some other stuff that I do not have time to quote, talking about some advantages of government over private sector roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from all of that that the committee was on the right track in pursuing its approach to BOOT&hyphen;type schemes. It did not rule them out. It said that they should be looked at on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis and that there should be a clear benefit over costs associated with such projects before one pursued that kind of financing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the Auditor&hyphen;General keeps saying in New South Wales. That is what he keeps saying has not been happening. That is why he keeps saying that the New South Wales government approach to this has not been correct under either government, and that we need to be terribly careful about going down the path of BOOT&hyphen;type schemes unless we are absolutely sure of getting a good return on our money. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be associated with this discussion of a report. I am equally very pleased to be associated with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Planning not patching: an inquiry into Federal road funding</EMPHASIS> . It was an extensive inquiry, with 800 or more exhibits and submissions put to the committee, quite a number of public inquiries and a lot of research work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to record my appreciation of the professionalism, good conduct and good grace of the committee secretariat involved with the standing committee behind this report. I direct this especially to Meg Crooks, the committee secretary; Geoff Johnston, the inquiry officer; the research officers, Jason Allford and Maria Grainger; and the administrative officers, Annette Fischer, Natalie Milner and Lena Ridley. They managed to sort a way through the various bits and pieces of chaff which came before the committee and helped us to understand better some of the technical aspects we need to understand in the compilation of reports such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, let me say I think the best part about this report is that it reasserts the importance of the role of a federal government in the question of proper planning for road infrastructure in this country. Many times since coming to this place, I have said that ever since 1788 government has had an absolute role in ensuring that the proper infrastructure all citizens need is available. In a country where the population is sparse and the distances are great, it is a valid and legitimate role of government to provide infrastructure, so that citizens can go about their pleasure and their business, and good results are there for the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are obviously great defence implications in ensuring transport infrastructure, such as roads, are well thought out. The best part of this report is that it really does reassert the importance of the role of the federal government in ensuring national outcomes from road infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It points out clearly that states can become very inward looking and parochial. This is fair enough from a state's perspective. But we find mismatching of the quality of infrastructure on either side of state borders because a road in is not as important as a road out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) is sitting in the chamber here as one of the government whips. I know for certain that he is very frustrated in trying to convince the New South Wales state government Road Transport Authority to do the right thing as far as getting the national outcome that people in my electorate certainly want is concerned&mdash;that is, making sure that the Pacific Highway through his electorate is upgraded completely in keeping with this government's plans. It is frustrating to think that a state government may flick certain financial considerations away from achieving the good national outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly know that because my electorate is only about 100 kilometres away from the electorate of the honourable member for Richmond. In suburban Brisbane we look with a great deal of interest to the progress along the Pacific Highway as it traverses New South Wales. So Queenslanders have a great deal of concern if the New South Wales government is not doing the right thing as far as the Pacific Highway is concerned. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12195"> Nehl, as the Pacific Highway travels through your electorate, you will be keeping a close eye on the progress of the upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an aside, I think that one of the most interesting comments to come from New South Wales witnesses when they came to the hearing was a suggestion that perhaps all of Victoria's road funding allocation should be sent to New South Wales for a year so that they could finish off the Hume Highway. It would be the best thing for Victoria if the New South Wales government were able to complete the duplication of the Hume Highway. South of the Victorian border you have a magnificent road, but after crossing the Victorian&hyphen;New South Wales border, and in and around Canberra, Goulburn and Yass, the roads are not as good as they should and could be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here we have state authorities not looking at the national imperative from a New South Wales perspective. Perhaps it is a Sydney&hyphen;centric look, or, from a Victorian perspective, a Melbourne&hyphen;centric view. I know that in Queensland it is not quite the case because it is a very decentralised state by nature. What a lot of these different state road planning authorities are missing is the fact that there is a national interest in completing the Hume Highway in duplication, and in completing the Pacific Highway duplication between Sydney and Brisbane. Likewise, there is a national interest in continuing to upgrade the northern reaches of the Bruce Highway from Port Douglas and Cairns through to Mackay where much of that road leaves a lot to be desired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the federal government places national considerations in the execution of road construction in this country. It has never been a constitutional right of the federal government to control the construction of roads. It is something we inherited because, after all&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CAMERON" NAMEID="3K6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K6">Mr Ross Cameron</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We stole it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CK6">Mr HARDGRAVE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) said, we have more money generated from a taxation revenue point of view than we actually spend. The vertical fiscal imbalance gives us a great deal of control over the expenditure of moneys in a number of different areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) might suggest that we have stolen that right from the states but, in fact, it is quite right and quite proper, and in general conversation there is no argument about the importance of the federal government looking at things in a national perspective when it allocates funds to the various states. So this inherited role is endorsed by the majority report of the standing committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, I think&mdash;and I totally agree with the findings of the committee&mdash;to tie the grants for road purposes very specifically to the states because it was mentioned to us in a number of asides that some darned good swimming pools were built instead of roads. In other words, money went off into different areas but it ended up being used for other purposes. I do not believe this is in the national interest at all. Because of the importance of road infrastructure, it is vital that, if we are going to allocate funds for roads, roads are built&mdash;and not only that: that they are built with the proper consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important aspect of the report was contained in recommendations 13 and 21 which talk about national highway links and arterial roads. In the case of my electorate of Moreton, there certainly is some direct interest in that. I saw first&hyphen;hand, before becoming the member for Moreton, just how poor the planning of the previous Labor government in Queensland had been with regard to an urban national highway link in the form of Kessels Road.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12196">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kessels Road was a fairly quiet suburban road with a couple of lanes&mdash;a lane each way. But over the last 15 years it has slowly but surely developed into this national highway link. In fact, the previous Labor government made it part of the national highway system linking Ipswich Road, the Cunningham Highway, the New England Highway connection right through to the Bruce Highway via the Gateway arterial in my electorate. As a result we are now finding interstate transporters thundering down this road, creating a lot of undue hurt, confusion and, perhaps, health problems amongst constituents in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of this came about because it was a quick and convenient thing for the state government at the time in Queensland to do. The federal government kicked in the funds to make sure it was possible but, at the end of the day, the previous federal government did not take account of the parochial view of the state government of the day and threw the money at it without any connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are inviting the federal government of today to connect itself with the outcome, and not just simply make the money available without question but call to account the state governments for the conduct of the funds that are put forward. That is what tied funding is all about and I think, for so many reasons, good national outcomes will come as a result of the recommendations that have been put forward by this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, can I say that the minority report of the member for Parramatta perhaps was a few years ahead of its time. I am in a very generous mood because it is close to Christmas. But I suspect that one of the important recommendations within the inquiry is where we have said that the whole conduct of road funding, and the conduct of national outcomes, should be reviewed every five years to ensure we are getting the right results. Perhaps in five years time the member for Parramatta will make a submission that is something along the lines of his minority report. I applaud his determination to put his point of view, as he has done so well here today and as he has done in his minority report. I do not have to agree with all the tenets but I absolutely recommend the result of this long inquiry to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Corangamite)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available, I want to make a few remarks on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Planning not patching</EMPHASIS> . Firstly, could I commend the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform and its members and secretariat for a very carefully thought through report. Of all the parliamentary reports that I have been associated with in my time in the parliament, I think this one saw the participation of most members of the committee in the detail, in the final recommendations and in the script of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, it is a reference document for the views of people associated with roads and the views in relation to the very difficult problem of allocating resources&mdash;federal, state and local. Certainly, the committee took into account all those views around Australia and I think the final report is a monument to those submissions. The distillation of those views comes through in the report in trying to solve what is almost an impossible problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also put on the public record my thanks to the former chairman, now the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), for his contribution as chairman, for the way in which he conducted the inquiry and the fair manner in which he conducted all deliberations. I also thank the members of the opposition, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis)&mdash;both as federal Treasurer and as a member representing Victorian interests&mdash;and the deputy chairman, the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), for their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12197"> contributions and their long experience in this parliament and their long experience in the matter of road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broadly, the fundamental problem facing the funding of roads in Australia is that about $11 billion is collected and about $6 billion is spent on roads on an annual basis. So there is a legitimate argument by all Australians who drive vehicles that some of that money that has been collected for the purposes of road funding has not been allocated. Inevitably, there will never be enough money for road construction and maintenance. That will be an ongoing argument no matter who is in government; no matter whether they are state, federal or local governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, the argument about a national highway system, and the definition of the system, came to prominence in the debate in the committee. At a parochial level, and the member for Gellibrand would understand this, there is an argument that the Geelong to Melbourne road should be part of the national highway system in view of the fact it connects two such important cities. That argument, of course, continues in other parts of the Commonwealth. The definition of a national highway system is something that the committee looked at but had some difficulty in giving it a final recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the roads of national importance add another dimension to the possibility of the Commonwealth assisting with other secondary roads that do help in terms of commerce and manufacturing. I think it is clear that the state authorities are the instrumentalities that build, construct and maintain roads. There is always the difficulty of the funding, of the supervision between the Commonwealth and the state authorities, and certainly that came through in the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the committee has made a bold decision in saying that we do not agree with hypothecation. The figures show that in fact it is not being followed. We agreed that hypothecation was not a reality when one looks at the way in which funding is now allocated in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make mention of the bridges situation. An interesting aspect of our inquiry related to the allocation of funds needed for the construction of bridges between Victoria and New South Wales. It is something that I think governments have tended to overlook. Both state governments have passed the buck. The federal government has been reluctant to take up that fairly considerable amount of capital expenditure and it is something that I draw to the attention of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of private sector involvement, there has been an ongoing debate by those on both sides of the chamber. I have been convinced by the arguments that were put to the committee, although they might not accord with my normal instinct to support the private sector. But from the arguments that were put forward and the very lengthy discussions that took place, having regard to the build, own, operate and transfer type of road construction, there is some merit in the argument put forward in the report that motorists and the people who use these highways should pay for this construction through their taxes and charges in some form or other. Having regard to the toll system, the availability of capital and the element of risk involved in private construction, I think the analysis by the committee is a correct one. On balance, it is hard to develop a case for encouraging the private sector to build, own, operate and transfer some of these bigger operations; in the longer term, they are for the benefit of the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12198">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know my good friend the member for Parramatta does not agree with that. But having listened to the evidence, I understand that the private sector was able to mitigate the risk by having an extension of time, thus ensuring that they enjoyed the benefit of a genuine return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I refer to some of the country roads in parts of my electorate&mdash;and this also relates to roads in the electorates of other members in the chamber. In my electorate of Corangamite, which produces dairy and timber products, they cannot be compared with the western ring road, on any cost&hyphen;benefit analysis. In an intellectual and policy sense, it is very difficult to demonstrate that, but obviously in the longer run we must have soundly constructed roads to support our primary, rural and mining industries, which provide the export earnings of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the report to the parliament. I say again that I think it is a benchmark document which all state governments will read with considerable interest. Let them be assured that it is a document which represents the collective view of the parliament. It is the view of many experienced members of the parliament who have had a long association with road funding, and the dilemmas and problems associated with those allocations.</PARA>
