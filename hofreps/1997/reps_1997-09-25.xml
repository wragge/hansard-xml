<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is a recipe for uncertainty. It is, in its current form, a flawed piece of legislation headed straight for multiple visits to the High Court. The reason for this is, quite clearly, the fact that this piece of legislation has had to be negotiated through a backbench whose every public presentation of views makes evident its complete ignorance of the legal framework in which successful legislation has to be pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has surrendered certainty for pastoralists and the minerals and resources industry, and decent treatment of the property rights of indigenous Australians, for a bogus backbench unity&mdash;a unity based, as it is, on a fundamentally mistaken view of this parliament's legislative powers and an ignorance of the certainty to be found in the rule of law. This is the dominant fact of contemporary Australian politics on this issue, and it is no good for our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor shares the government's stated desire for greater certainty for all stakeholders, for greater workability of the Native Title Act 1993 and for the timely resolution of disputes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the act seeks to address. The amendment to the Native Title Act is a task and a responsibility that would have confronted the Labor Party had we remained in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mabo decision brought Australia into line as the last New World nation with a tradition of British common law to recognise the pre&hyphen;settlement laws of its indigenous people as giving rise to native title. Even without the hysteria and campaigns of misinformation that followed the decision, the government of the day would have been obliged to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a need for clarification of the implications for all levels of government and all holders of post&hyphen;settlement titles as well as for potential native title claimants. There were complex legal, social and economic issues to be worked through. There was the prospect at the time of a myriad of common law claims for native title from indigenous people to be conducted without a statutory framework and with a single piece of case law for guidance. The consequence was likely to be a lengthy period of complex, expensive legal action and a great deal of legal and economic uncertainty, just as surely as the process had the potential to be socially divisive both within indigenous communities and between indigenous communities and non-indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike most conservative political leaders across Australia, the Labor government accepted the concept of native title and set about devising a decent, workable, practical response. A key element of the response to Mabo was the Native Title Act 1993. The act was the product of extensive and inclusive negotiations with all stakeholders. The process was further enhanced by extensive research on comparable responses in Canada, New Zealand and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to that point of inclusive discussions with all stakeholders. Some folk like to portray the notion that an arrangement was set in place with one set of stakeholders only&mdash;the indigenous community&mdash;and an act emerged. If people recollect those times, as I do, there were in that community substantial concerns about the way in which the government was legislating, substantial concerns 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8460"> which produced some profound disagreements between the indigenous community and the government of the day. In the end, what was produced was an on&hyphen;balance result, not a result that went&mdash;as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to say in producing his pendulums on these matters&mdash;all one way. Interfering with that balanced result places any particular legislative activity at great constitutional risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act aimed to provide an expeditious, cost-effective and less legalistic alternative to resolving matters on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis in common law actions. It established the Native Title Tribunal and allowed for state governments to set up approved alternative processes. The clearest immediate outcome from the act was the validation of every previously issued title for every existing title holder. In particular, it validated potentially invalid past acts of governments, such as grants of interest in lands since the commencement of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim in a prevailing atmosphere of legal uncertainty was to achieve certainty, clarity and workability. The drafting and passage of the act was carried on in the face of a stubborn refusal on the part of the coalition parties to engage constructively in the process. Every word, every clause, was routinely opposed, irrespective of its merits or the interests that it sought to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes nonsense of the Prime Minister's rabid assertions that the flaws in the present act are the sole responsibility of the Labor government. Despite urgings by miners and pastoralists&mdash;and I well remember them at the time&mdash;the Liberal Party in opposition refused constructive participation in that debate. They let this parliament down and they let the country down, and many features in the act which are difficult to work at this stage can be directly sheeted home to that. We will not treat either the government or the country the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of conservative politicians simply rejected the concept of native title. They attacked both the concept and the High Court that had seen fit to recognise it. They typified the attitude that led the Hon. Justice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ronald Sackville to observe in more recent times:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attacks are made in some quarters on the High Court's decision in Wik that go beyond robust criticism of the court's reasoning process and conclusion and amount to attempts to undermine the authority of the court as an institution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government took the view that the only lasting certainty for all stakeholders was that which emerged from consensus. Any party aggrieved by the process or the outcome would challenge matters in the courts. In the case of indigenous people, their acceptance of legislated validation of titles was essential to the success of the bill. Their willingness to surrender or forgo any claims related to those titles that were validated was essential for the success of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal offsetting benefit for this wholesale validation of potentially invalid titles was the grant of a time limited right to negotiate in respect of grants of mining interests and compulsory acquisition for the benefit of others of land where native title may have survived. There is no veto in this. It is time limited and any outcome is capable of being overridden by a determination by a state or Commonwealth minister. Remember that. There is only one form of title in this country which has an unlimited veto. That happens to be Western Australian freehold title and agricultural lease title. They do, under those titles, have an absolute discretion to prevent other forms of economic activity taking place on that land. There are some features of it similar in the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, but there can also be ministerial intervention in relation to the national interest, so it is not unlimited veto. Only those forms of title in this country carry the right of veto in relation to other persons' economic rights in relation to the land that you owned or have access to by virtue of the title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous people with no hope of access to any benefits in surviving native title were given access to a land fund. A social justice package promised at the time was being negotiated when Labor lost office. Negotiations have not been continued by the incoming government, though those negotiations were one of the things which made the previous act 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8461"> safe. People need to bear that in mind: they are one of the compromises which produced the on balance outcome that the High Court accepted as rendering the act valid. The government's failure in this bill to understand these underpinnings is one of the flawed elements of their legislative approach which make it highly vulnerable to court challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initial resistance by some state governments was typified by the Western Australian government's resoundingly unsuccessful attempt to challenge the constitutionality of the act and institute a legislative regime substituting an inferior statutory title for native title. The Western Australian challenge was lost 7&hyphen;0 and the state legislation found to be invalid due to inconsistency with the Commonwealth act. But it is instructive to note this: the Western Australian government responded to its loss by instituting correct future act procedures as set out in the Native Title Act. Since that time, according to figures given in evidence before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on 23 September by the chief registrar of the Native Title Tribunal, Ms Patricia Lane, of notified intentions to carry out mining activities submitted under the expedited procedures, a peak figure of 97 per cent, settling down to 92 per cent, have gone forward without challenge from potential native title claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are approximately 17 native title related cases before the courts, at the conclusion of which many existing uncertainties will have been resolved. After pervading uncertainty with the new procedures, many problems have been ironed out. Confusion in the public mind as to the role of the Native Title Tribunal, sometimes fuelled by mischievous representation by vested interests, has led to criticism of the lack of determinations emerging from the tribunal. The tribunal, of course, is a mediating body with no powers of determination without the consent of all parties. If a state government or other party refuses to reach an agreement, the tribunal has no option but to pass the matter on to the Federal Court for determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An encouraging sign has been the emergence over time of regional agreements 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reached with the assistance of the tribunal and without recourse to the court. It should not be surprising that that is an attractive option. More than 70 per cent of all commercial disputes are resolved before reaching court. The motives are often very similar to experiences in the native title field: uncertainty of court outcomes, the high cost of litigation and commercially ruinous waste of time. Yandacoogina and the Murrin Murrin agreements, together with the Cape York heads of agreement, with all of their short&hyphen;term difficulties, are examples of a capacity to reach agreement faster than any conceivable court settlement of a common law claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the shortcomings of the existing act, let us take time to consider that point. The Wik case is a common law claim. It has been in the courts since June 1993. It is still there, with matters of substance related to it yet to be determined. That is four years down the track. Think of the 600 or so claims currently registered with the tribunal. The collapse, in the face of High Court challenge, of a badly amended act, an act bulldozed through the parliament by an unthinking government, would see all those cases, and more, clogging up our courts indefinitely. The pastoral industry might survive such a scenario but not the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you thought we had problems now, you have seen nothing compared with that worst case prospect. In fact, observers have already noted what could be a scare effect. In the face of possible adverse treatment through the prospective provisions of the government's bill, there is a worrying trend now reported in the number of cases that otherwise would have been prepared for processing through native title processes that have been diverted now down the common law route. We could already be previewing a coming nightmare for the minerals and resources industry in particular and Australian society in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the government's amendment bill. The opposition endorses the principle that the time is right for amendment. It was always accepted that, with relevant common law cases already in train and with an entirely new process to be put in place, the original act would in time need to be amended in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8462"> light of practical experience in the tribunal and the Federal Court and in recognition of new case law as it emerged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are still many problems to be addressed. Confusion over the meaning of the native title concept and the proper expectations that can flow from the Mabo and Wik decisions has not been the preserve of any one interest group. Unsustainable claims, multiple claims and overlapping claims, on the one hand, have been matched by a failure to negotiate in good faith, a failure to set up appropriate state tribunals and a failure to adequately resource the system on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The virtual gridlock inherent in the current situation in Kalgoorlie, with its maze of overlapping, conflicting and sometimes unsustainable claims impacting on mining, residential development and many aspects of daily life, is a dramatic example of the need for considered, sustainable change to the act in the interests of all parties. However, this government has particular difficulty in dealing with the problem. It is attempting to amend an act dealing with a concept it long refused to accept or recognise. In so doing, it is tampering with a piece of legislation that it failed to address with any intellectual rigour on its part when it came before the parliament in 1993. It failed to understand the breadth of its intent, the complexity of its processes and, importantly, the head of power under which it was enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the national interest that the act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians and of all stakeholders, be they miners, farmers or the Australian taxpayers. It is in the interests of all Australians that they not give in to the notion that co-existence is unworkable. We must accept that this nation is mature enough, compassionate enough and pragmatic enough for indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians to co&hyphen;exist, indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous cultures to co&hyphen;exist, and the rights and interests attached to them to co&hyphen;exist. We can work together for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must come to understand that native title rights are a reality and that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are here to stay. They have been recognised by the High Court as fundamental legal property rights and are entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. It is in the interests of all Australians that we achieve the maximum possible predictability and certainty in the operation of this act and in its practical operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government must come to understand that there is an overriding need to guarantee the constitutional validity of this legislation and that its validity could be critically threatened unless it operates for the net benefit of indigenous Australians. We take the Prime Minister back to his oft repeated promises when he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't wind back the Racial Discrimination Act . . . we don't attempt to reverse the Mabo decision . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Failure to act in a fashion that upholds the essence of the original act places at risk things that must be done now to ensure expeditious access for commercial interests vital to our national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor supports the government in seeking to deal with the registration and determination of claims and the resolving of competing interests in an expeditious and effective regime. These objectives may be advanced by the proper and appropriate adjustment of the registration test. Equally, as we have already observed, these objectives can be advanced by further encouragement and legislative support for the various forms of agreements set out in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, this bill is seriously deficient and it requires substantial amendment. Our areas of greatest concern include the fact that the validation provisions exceed anything necessary for addressing any real or perceived problems flowing from the Wik decision. The government's measures purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title through past grants of exclusive tenure involve massive overreach. The legislative provisions, including the schedule, do far more than confirm the current state of the common law as asserted by the government; they involve the extinguishment of surviving common law rights.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8463">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vital that pastoralists are permitted to fully enjoy all the entitlements they have been granted under their various tenures. Both the 1993 act and the Wik decision affirm that their rights extinguish native title to the extent of any inconsistency. We will support any amendments that give greater certainty and clarity to that reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the application of the tax act definition of primary production, in defining the activities pursuable without going through the right to negotiate, is simply unacceptably broad. It would allow activities never contemplated in the grant of a pastoral lease which by their very nature require exclusive possession and thereby extinguish native title to the extent of the new inconsistency. It would, furthermore, convert public assets such as timber to private assets to the detriment of a native title holder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of the primary industry definition to vacant Crown land adjacent to a pastoral lease allows the leaseholder, with the permission of the state, to carry on any so&hyphen;defined activity on that land without being drawn into a right&hyphen;to&hyphen;negotiate process, and that is a clear curtailment of the common law rights of the indigenous people. The test proposed to establish statutory rights is indefensibly restrictive. It requires contemporary, continued physical access. This denies a right of access to land previously exercised within the living memory of most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be stressed that each discriminatory measure in the bill raises the threat of a challenge to its constitutionality, with the consequence being uncertainty for all concerned. The right to negotiate was the critical item in confirming the constitutionality of the Native Title Act, yet this bill radically reduces its application. The degree of restrictive application amounts to a form of de facto extinguishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to registration and claims procedures have rendered the system more rigid and legalistic, and consequently more expensive. Placing powers in the hands of registrars that they have not been resourced to use and doing so in a rigid and inadequate time frame will most likely see their decisions challenged with consequent bottlenecks in the courts. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Provision for ministerial intervention before the determination stage will inhibit good faith negotiations and remove a key incentive for consent agreements outside the court process. Respondents will be motivated to lobby the minister rather than deal with claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to provide for the application of the rules of evidence and to downgrade regard for the cultural and customary concerns of indigenous applicants in the Federal Court is clearly discriminatory in that it impacts on no other  parties and is out of sympathy with the nature of native title as outlined in the Mabo decision. It completely ignores Justice Brennan's statement in Mabo No. 2 that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native title depends upon the traditional laws and customs of the group, and the nature and incidence of native title must be ascertained as a matter of fact by reference to those laws and customs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Any amendments that invite legal challenge must undermine certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill descends into absurdity when it seeks to introduce a sunset clause. This is a recipe for ambit claims and guarantees a return to expensive and complex common law claims after six years. This must surely be the case, unless the government presumes that this bill so effectively extinguishes native title that there will be little to go to court over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill must be made more practical. It must offer a genuinely attractive alternative to common law claims. It must address the legitimate needs of all stakeholders&mdash;no more, no less. Above all, it must be decent and it must retain the beneficial status of the original act, because if it does not do so it surely has to founder in the High Court. It must reaffirm the fact that the cultures of this nation can co&hyphen;exist, that we can all enjoy our rights to our mutual benefit in our own best interests and the best interests of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a bill in our own best interests and the best interests of the nation. This is the minimum achievable bill in a backbench deeply hostile to the concept of native title and deeply ignorant of the operation of the law of this nation in regard to it. It is a bill which reflects surrender by this government to that backbench pressure, and the product of surrender by this government to that pressure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8464"> is that it means it has no solution. There is no solution arising from this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will cooperate with this government to overcome the problems that it has with its backbench to produce a piece of workable legislation. On behalf of what we understand to be the needs of this nation for certainty and the desire of the people of this country to find themselves in a position where this situation is settled, we offer that cooperation to the government. We have considerable understanding about the operation of this act, but if that offer is spurned by the government then that poses a substantial problem for this country&mdash;either in the form of the legislation they get through or in the political consequences that flow from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has to move away from the political motivations essentially underpinning their approach. This is a serious matter which is capable of being dealt with seriously, which is capable of being concluded and which is capable of producing an expeditious and effective process to arrive at conclusions. But that very desirable objective is not contained in this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

They bring a white, suburban, middle class approach to something about which they know nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was nothing in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to identify where these amendments diminish in any way the native title rights of Aboriginal Australians as allocated to them by the High Court in the Mabo and Wik decisions&mdash;nothing whatsoever. Nevertheless, it did not take the Leader of the Opposition long to take some licence with the so-called common law. He told this House that any reduction in the right to negotiate was a diminution of the common law rights of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me challenge the next two legally trained speakers who are listed to represent the views of the opposition on this matter to show me one part of the Mabo or Wik decisions that granted Aboriginal people the right to negotiate&mdash;one part of those decisions. The right to negotiate, which is fundamental to the opposition of most people in Australia to the original Native Title Act, was an invention of the Keating government. It was introduced in that act; it was never a common law right; it could never be challenged under common law principles if this parliament chooses to change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope, while the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), was having a little chat, that he heard my challenge. I will repeat my challenge to you: can you point to one part of the Mabo or Wik decisions that granted common law rights to negotiate to Aboriginal people?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MELHAM" NAMEID="4T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr Melham</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Your leader linked the right to negotiate with common law rights, and he misled this parliament in so doing&mdash;and you know it. The issue of common law is where this matter rests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamentals of what the Mabo decision conferred on Aboriginal people are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The personal rights conferred by common law native title do not constitute an estate or interest in the land itself. They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown, such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, the fundamentals of that extract from the High Court decision on Mabo 1992 are the words `exclusive possession'. These amendments do not reduce in any way that granted right. These amendments are an attempt to give more certainty under the law and a better understanding under the law as to how that decision might operate administratively. It is of great interest to me how little time the Leader of the Opposition spent on the specifics of the legislation to sustain the arguments he put forward. The one he can give up on is that there is any common law 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8465"> right or any ability for common law challenge over aspects of the right to negotiate. That was not a right granted in common law by the High Court, and everybody knows it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments provide procedures whereby genuine Aboriginal claimants might pursue their rights and ensure that those landholders referred to in the courts whose title has extinguished native title have the right to occupy their land without intrusion and to understand their rights as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a very large country. It has a huge ethnic spread. Some of the most wealthy property owners in Australia today are people who came here as refugees after the Second World War, and they are as welcome to Australia as the first  settlers as far as I am concerned. Each and every one has operated and invested their money based on known property law. You cannot have a section of property law that is only to be determined in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition, during his speech, made a lot of remarks which I wrote down. Very early in his claim he talked about the original legislation and criticised the then opposition, the coalition, for its opposition to the legislation. It is a pity he did not go back to those Senate debates and read them word for word, because most of the issues that he would now concede need alteration, need amendment, were raised during those debates. The then opposition was accused at the time of filibustering, et cetera. But anybody who suggested that as an administrative tool the present Native Title Act is workable would be a fool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Native Title Act as `decent, workable legislation'. If it is decent, workable legislation why do we have massive multiple claims on a single piece of land, sometimes by up to 23 different Aboriginal groups&mdash;Aboriginals fighting with Aboriginals?  How workable is that? The solution is in these amendments, which propose that there can be one only claimant. That is, apparently, unreasonable. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned that the requirement for registration just happens to provide that one of that claimant group 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must demonstrate some traditional physical association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible in a court of law to determine somebody's `dreaming'&mdash;somebody living in Melbourne who suddenly goes before a court and who, as the original legislation prescribed, is not necessarily subject to  cross-examination. It is impossible for a determination of the court to be made concerning someone who has lived all their life in Melbourne and who says they have some form of association with a billabong in the Kimberleys of Western Australia. Clearly, there is a need and there should be a demonstration. It is a simple requirement and it should not be criticised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the original legislation was so good, why is it that Access Economics can tell us that its processes have delayed $11.6 billion worth of mining projects? Mines tend to be seen as the property of some very wealthy person when, in fact, they provide job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Australians. But it is worse than that. Over time most of these delays may have been overcome but, for instance, in the gold industry as a result of those delays many projects will now not proceed. They will not proceed because of the fall in the price of gold, but they could have been up and running and battling with the price of gold, giving jobs to people whom the opposition claims as its constituency. But it did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want evidence of how bad the act is we should look no further than ATSIC commissioner Robinson's reference to ambit claims and the remarks of one time Leader of the Opposition and ex-Governor-General, Mr Hayden, after his experience in attempting to mediate the Century dispute, where he made it absolutely clear that the previous government's legislation made it possible for people with absolutely no links with the land, no rights to native land title, to be involved in a process of delaying a $1 billion development project highly essential to the welfare and the jobs of many Australians and to the development of this country.     </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is how the present legislation works. It is the intention of the government to make simple amendments to ensure that those sorts 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8466"> of processes cannot continue. It is wrong to criticise that or to consider it a diminution of native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition talked about there being no veto in the present Native Title Act and that is correct. But the reality is that one of the greatest vetoes one can have&mdash;well understood by the trade union movement&mdash;is the right to negotiate if you never intend to say `yes'. Whatever the offer made on the other side, you can extend your demands. But when the legislation of the day is so deficient that you can achieve this right to negotiate, a right not granted in any of the High Court decisions, by the simple act of lodging a claim with a registrar whose powers to reject, as granted in the original Native Title Act, were knocked out by the High Court literally within months of their introduction because they were deficient&mdash;it gave powers to a tribunal that it was not entitled to have under the law&mdash;we find that we have thousands of claims totally unsubstantiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In public discussion I make the point that the right to negotiate as it has stood is best equated with a group of people attending an auction for numerous lots of residential property where the law provides that they must each negotiate with each other as to the type of house they build before they lodge a bid. You can imagine how stupid any politician who promoted such an arrangement would be perceived as being. Yet the current right to negotiate under the present Native Title Act is exactly that. The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that the opposition will go to the wall to protect this right to negotiate as it exists today. He went as far as to suggest that it was part of the common law right of Aboriginal people when it is not. It is a statutory right created in the original legislation which we intend to amend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition spent a lot of time suggesting that this `dreadful 10&hyphen;point plan'&mdash;which it is not&mdash;was devised by the backbench. It was devised by our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in negotiation with all the parties. I agree entirely with his view that it has swung the pendulum back to the middle ground. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Property rights are one of the most important things that anybody can have. The High Court in its reference to exclusive possession made it clear what sorts of titles it believed extinguished native title. But the previous government did not have the sense to try to put them into some form of list so that each and every one of them would not be disputed in the courts on whatever grounds you like. Please remember that there are disputes over freehold land. One was settled by the Labor government of New South Wales at Crescent Head&mdash;the very backyards of residential freehold property owners were at risk on some technicality which, fortunately for them, the government settled. If they had had to settle it themselves it would have been at 1.5 times the value they paid for the land in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the deficiencies of this act which we set out to rectify. What do the 10 points do? For a start they validate past acts that were enacted by the previous government up to a previous date. But they do not remove the native title rights to compensation of Australian Aboriginals even in that process. This government in both past and future acts has offered and will offer to assist the state governments by paying 75 per cent of that compensation to ensure that if and when that compensation is needed there are sufficient funds to pay the Aboriginal people. That is what we have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Resumption rights were included in the original Keating legislation. There were just no resources made available to fund it and we ended up with a silly situation all round. It is a fundamental principle of property ownership in Australia that the Crown can resume your rights whether they are freehold, leasehold or you name it. While there is an obligation on the Commonwealth to pay compensation, there is no statutory obligation on most states to pay compensation&mdash;but they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At every stage of our deliberations as a backbench committee we understood and endorsed the principle that, where over time there is a diminution of the native title rights of Aboriginal people, they will be treated on just terms. The purpose of excluding the right to negotiate over towns, cities and major 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8467"> public works is plainly obvious and right. Aboriginal people in this country are not excluded from driving on our freeways or attending our major public parks. Neither is any other ethnic race. It is public property and, of course, such public property should be enjoyed by all Australians in whatever way. That should obviously not be the subject of the control or the right to negotiate by a single ethnic group. So what is wrong with putting those sorts of things in?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition tells us that they will oppose the use of the tax act to describe the rights of pastoralists in terms of the words used by the High Court in this regard. That is not recognition of reality. The purpose and the business of pastoral activity as frequently described in those old leases is no longer sufficient for the residents of those leases to earn a living. They have to widen their activities. Furthermore, technology today has made it possible for them to enter into aspects of agriculture, as described under the tax act, that they would not have dreamed of in years gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, when the High Court makes a fairly general principle, is it wrong for the parliament of Australia to apply their knowledge of this industry to better describe what it is? There is nothing wrong with that and for the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that that definition was too broad is outrageous. I hope some of you are going to go out to those people battling on that land and tell them that you will not even stand behind them at that particular level of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the issues. There was so much in the Leader of the Opposition's speech which was both foolish and wrong that I have had little time to address all the issues in the 10-point plan. They are sensible moves. I repeat, in closing, they do not diminish in any way the native title rights of Aboriginal Australians as granted in the Mabo and Wik decisions. They are administrative arrangements for that purpose and, as such, they should be supported by this House. But you as an opposition have a choice: you can go to a referendum or a double dissolution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">About three weeks ago there was played out on television one of the ugliest little scenes it has been my misfortune, and that of many others, to witness for a long time in this country. It involved the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard) holding up to a national audience a map, 78 per cent of which was marked and coloured brown and was a map in respect of which, as the Prime Minister said, `the Aboriginal people . . . have the potential right of veto over the development of 78 per cent of the land mass of Australia. Now, that is a very simple message. I think the Australian people will understand that message.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a performance worthy of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) at his crudest; and how revealing it is of the government's attitude that the member for O'Connor should 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be the lead speaker for the government in this debate. What this House and what the Australian people need to understand about that little performance from the Prime Minister and about the Prime Minister's message is that it was wrong in fact and in law, as even the member for O'Connor acknowledged. It was malicious in its intent, it was alarmist in its effect and it was thoroughly immoral in its substance. The Prime Minister diminishes himself and this country every time he goes down this path. If he maintains this totally uncompromising and cynically opportunist attitude towards this legislation, then let me tell him and let me tell the coalition that they have a fight on their hands in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the Prime Minister does not in fact go down that path. I hope that we can have a serious and constructive debate in this parliament to get this legislation right. It is in the national interest, as we say in clause (2) of this amendment that I have just circulated, that the act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders&mdash;the farmers, the miners and the Australian taxpayers generally. It is, as we say in clause (3) of the amendment, both in the national interest and in the interests of indigenous Australians and farmers and miners that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the Native Title Act and its practical operation. It is in everyone's interest, as we say in clause (5) of this amendment, that the processes established by this legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims, and the reconciliation of competing interests, be as effective and expeditious as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, it has to be said, a lot of problems with this bill&mdash;a bill of nearly 300 pages, with its explanatory memorandum of nearly 400 pages, which is an unprecedented length for a piece of social policy legislation in this country. There are two underlying problems in particular which shriek out at one as we approach this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of those underlying problems really does go to the attitude of the government to the fundamental, central issue at stake 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8469"> here. The trouble is that the government still does not really see, nor does it want to acknowledge, that native title is a fundamental legal property right, acknowledged and upheld as such by the High Court and entitled to exactly the same respect and protection as the property rights of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. There is an attitude problem there. The government sees native title rights as an encumbrance, as an intrusion, as something that is indefensibly intrusive against the rights of other non-indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have to understand and respect the reality that the native title rights are full&hyphen;scale, identified, High Court upheld property rights. It is the responsibility of us, as legislators, to get right the balance between those property rights and claims of right and the legitimate property rights of other non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. That is a point that we make right at the outset in clause (1) of this amending motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second underlying problem that runs right through the construction of this amending bill is that, as my leader said just a few moments ago, it simply will not deliver the certainty and the predictability that it is in everybody's interest and in the national interest for this legislation to deliver. To the extent that this bill does not get right the balance of benefits to indigenous Australians and to the extent that, at the end of the day, it does not produce a situation where one can look at the outcome and say, `This is for the benefit of indigenous Australians,' then to that extent this bill is constitutionally suspect. It will be challenged and there is every probability that it will be struck down and, in the process, every last ounce of that certainty and predictability that everybody wants, including the miners and the farmers, is simply going to disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument is very straightforward. The constitutional foundations for this bill have to be either section 51(xxvi)&mdash;the race power in the constitution&mdash;or they have to be built indirectly on the external affairs power in section 51(xxix) by virtue of Australia's adherence to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the race power, it is very strongly arguable indeed&mdash;it is likely to be upheld quite soon in the High Court&mdash;that that race power can only be exercised for the benefit of indigenous people. If you are going to apply the external affairs power, support for justification for this legislation, it has to be applied in a way that does not discriminate against a racial group of Australians or, to the extent that it does discriminate in their favour, it is properly characterisable as a special measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no sign that the government, in the crafting of this amending legislation, even begins to understand and accept that fundamental basic legal reality. We are not talking about policy issues here; we are talking about simple, straightforward legal reality. If we do not get it right, if this bill does proceed with its `bucket loads of extinguishment'&mdash;as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) keeps on putting it&mdash;if it does proceed with the removal of the right to negotiate and if it does proceed with a whole set of procedural changes which work against the interests of indigenous people, the balance will tilt so comprehensively against the interests of indigenous people that this bill, and the act itself, simply will not survive constitutional scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pendulum that the Prime Minister likes to talk about is crashing against the non&hyphen;indigenous side of the clock case at the moment. Unless that pendulum comes back into the middle&mdash;in fact, unless it tilts at the end of the day very slightly at least towards the indigenous interests&mdash;this bill, this act, is going to be challengeable and we are going to be forced back to the endless complexity and expense of case by case common law litigation. I do hope that those people who are so stridently opposed to this or that aspect of claims being made about what is necessary for decency and justice in this final outcome at least focus their minds and concentrate on these legal realities. If you want certainty and predictability, you have to change the basic balance of this amending legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the underlying problems. What about the specific problems? There is a legion of them. There is no time to do more than very quickly sketch out the major ones. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8470"> second reading amendment before this chamber does that in a way which highlights some of the major issues we will be concerned with. At the outset, there is the problem of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the reach of the validation provisions beyond that which is necessary for the practical redress of post&hyphen;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wik</EMPHASIS>  problems . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are some problems that were created in the aftermath of the Wik legislation. We, on the opposition side, are fully prepared to cooperate in their redress, but there is some overreach involved here when one gets to the detail. Just to give one example, it appears that public works with quite a small impact on native title&mdash;for example, the construction of a set of electricity pylons going across a pastoral lease&mdash;will, nonetheless, have the result of achieving the permanent extinguishment over the whole area of the lease of any claim to native title that might exist. That is the kind of problem we have with the validation provisions. Secondly, as the motion says, there is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the manifestly unacceptable over&hyphen;reach of the provisions purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title where exclusive tenure has previously been involved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When this proposition appeared in the list of 10 points, it seemed, frankly, to be one of the more innocuous provisions. It seemed to be merely declaratory of what everyone acknowledges to be the legal reality&mdash;that where exclusive possession has been granted as a result of some legal conferral of interest in the past that means the end of native title, and if all you are doing in the legislation is confirming that legal reality nobody can seriously argue about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we have in this amending package before us is manifestly indefensible and unacceptable overreach. We have all sorts of things now being rubbed out as a consequence of the reach of this particular set of provisions and, in particular, schedule 4. Schedule 4 of the bill, which has only just been circulated, is a 40-page dog's breakfast in which page after page of statutory provisions&mdash;with no guidance as to the criteria which lie behind their identification&mdash;are set out. Each one of them will result, if a particular legal property interest is covered by them, in the absolute extinguishment of any claim 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to native title that might otherwise have continued to exist in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions as they stand at the moment result, among other things, in the absolute extinguishment of native title claims or rights over stock routes. They result in the impossibility of even now claiming native title over such areas as Yampi Sound in Western Australia, because at some stage in the past that has been the subject of a transfer of land from the state of Western Australia to the Commonwealth for defence purposes: there is a great tract of land there which is used about three weeks a year for defence exercises. But, by virtue of the way these provisions are constructed, there will be a draconian absolute extinguishment of native title claims. It goes too far. That is part of the imbalance. It is part of the bucket loads of extinguishment accomplished by this legislation, which is simply indefensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third problem with the legislation is the coexistence regime that is mapped so far as pastoralists and native title interest holders are concerned. Part 7(iii) of the amendment refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the unnecessarily broad application, in relation to coexistence on pastoral leases, of the statutory authorisation of non&hyphen;pastoral activities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us get it clear that it is perfectly reasonable so far as the opposition is concerned that the reasonable expectations of farmers be satisfied by this legislation. Farmers and pastoralists should be able to conduct on their pastoral leases the entire range of pastoral related activities that they have always been able to do, thought they could do and should be able to do without let or hindrance of any kind. That includes fencing and stock roads within the area of the lease. It can certainly include dams for the creation of some irrigation for pasture crops and so on. All of that is possible and it should be clarified. That is fine; there is no argument about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When, however, the pastoralist wants to engage in a different kind of upgraded agricultural activity which goes beyond that which has been traditionally permissible as part of a pastoral lease, then, we say, it is perfectly reasonable that the pastoralist be entitled to do so, provided it is done on a case 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8471"> by case basis in the way that it always has been done in the past, where you apply to the state or territory for a licence or permit to put in the intensive cotton crop or grape block or whatever it is and the state or territory makes the decision to allow you to do it on proper environmental or agricultural policy or land&hyphen;use planning grounds. You go ahead and do it and if the consequence of that is to suppress, for the duration of the exercise of that right, some inconsistent native title, so be it. We will accept that as part of the necessary balance that is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the way this legislation is crafted at the moment, it reaches way beyond that. At a stroke of the legislative pen, any form of non&hyphen;pastoral, agricultural or related use, including farm stays and so on for tourist purposes, is permitted and there is a chance of the balance here getting completely out of kilter. There is particularly a chance of a quite massive intrusion on otherwise legitimate native title claims if you contemplate the possible application of these provisions as they now stand&mdash;for example, to the Fitzroy River area of Western Australia, where a major dam and irrigation project on the scale of the Ord is in fact being contemplated. It is very easy to see how the applications of these provisions could wipe out, over a very large region of Australia, legitimate native title claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions about government services are, on their face, legitimate so far as they go, but they have an unnecessarily broad application. If there is an inconsistency with a grant of an interest to enable a public work or whatever to be carried out on part of the lease in question, then what happens is that, under the act as it is framed at the moment, there is permanent extinguishment over the whole of that area in question rather than just that part of it which is necessary to accomplish the legitimate public purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point (7)(v) of our draft says that there is an indefensibly limited test for allowing statutory access rights for people who have registered claimant status and who want to get access to land during the time&mdash;perhaps a quite extended period&mdash;that that claim is being formally determined. They can do it under this legislation only if they have maintained right up 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> until the end of last year some regular physical access to the land. But what about the position, just to take one example, of those people who were forced off pastoral leases in living memory as a result of the pastoral awards in the 1960s and have been in fact locked out? Should they be denied the statutory access right? We say not, and we say that this is the sort of issue on which the government should be prepared to make a ready compromise in the interests of basic decency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we get to point (7)(vi) and it really is quite central to this debate, that is, the dramatic limitation of the right to negotiate and, in particular, the effective elimination of that right in relation to mining on pastoral leases. Along with the provisions I have already mentioned, which amount to direct or potentially indirect de facto extinguishment, this is the stuff that really does significantly tilt the balance of this legislation against indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the right to negotiate, let me say that that may or not be a matter of common law entitlement. That is for the courts to determine. I do not make a judgment about that. What I do say is that there are two very obvious reasons for the legitimacy of that right to negotiate being retained in our legislative package and made available on a continuing basis to people in relation to pastoral leases just as much as on vacant crown land. The first is that it amounts to a legitimate form of economic empowerment of a group of Australians who have been spectacularly denied respect and a capacity to advance themselves economically through just about the whole 200&hyphen;plus years of Australian history. It is a legitimate redressing of a historical injustice and we ought to be prepared to contemplate it on that basis alone.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TUCKEY" NAMEID="SJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's silly.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reason we ought to be able to contemplate it, member for O'Connor, is a much more hard&hyphen;headed reason. That is, if you do not allow the retention of that right to negotiate, you tilt out of balance the whole shape and structure of this legislation and make it unequivocally legislation for non&hyphen;indigenous interests, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8472"> legislation which does not protect and respect and advance the interests of indigenous people. If you want certainty and if you want predictability, and if the other interests that have got genuine stakeholder concerns here&mdash;the miners and the farmers&mdash;want that predictability and certainty, they will go along with just that retention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other provisions which will also require attention. There is the unacceptable limitation on the right to negotiate, to the extent that it does continue to exist, involved in the provisions now for a very early power of ministerial intervention to act in the so&hyphen;called national interest to ensure that some particular economic project does in fact take off and is not inhibited by the operation of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were prepared to concede the legitimacy of such a ministerial intervention and override right back in the original legislation&mdash;Mabo 1993. It was properly balanced in that context. The balance is now out of kilter by virtue of the early stage at which that intervention is now possible, which will, we believe, make practically impossible for all practical purposes the legitimate exercise of what remains of the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is point (7)(viii):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the absurd and counterproductive sunset clause, which will simply ensure a proliferation of ambit claims under the Act, and the pursuit of future claims through expensive and complex common law processes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has not been able to apply a sunset clause so far as common law claims are concerned because to do so would raise immediately the prospect of constitutionally required compensation. It is proposing to do it simply for the statutory process. It is absurd and counterproductive to do so&mdash;and you know it&mdash;but it is an example of the pigheadedness of the government so far that we have not had a concession of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there are a number of provisions which go to the processes and procedures under the act which are proposed to be changed in ways again that are colourable in terms of their impact on the final assessment of the constitutionality of this legislation&mdash;talking about the inappropriately rigid and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legalistic constraints on registrars in the management of claims and the inappropriate introduction of formal rules of evidence, to the extent that they are now required to be applied, and the limitations, as a corollary to that, on the extent to which cultural and customary concerns can now be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not everything in this act is colourable in the same way as the sorts of provisions I have been identifying thus far. The stricter threshold test which is part of the proposed new regime is in everyone's interests, including that of indigenous Australians, to apply. We will need to have a closer look at the detail of the language in which that is couched, but the principle of having a stricter regime does make sense. It is something we would have done had we still been in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions facilitating a role for representative bodies makes sense. They can be a terribly important way of ensuring that claims are rationalised in the way they come forward and that there is a sensible negotiating/bargaining process. They are critical to the success in practice of this legislation. We are pleased to see that role recognised in the way the legislation has come forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are pleased to see that the legislation ensures that legal aid will be available for a whole variety of respondents; nobody could argue with that. We are especially pleased to see in the amending bill the provisions encouraging and assisting the entering into of agreements outside the formal framework of the act but able to be now recognised and enforced as a consequence of their recognition in the act. That is the best way to go in terms of reconciling these interests either on a site specific or on a regional basis. We have seen in Cape York, we have seen in Yandacoogina in Western Australia, we have seen in the Murrin Murrin agreement, we have seen in half a dozen others of recent times, that it is possible, even with the present shape of the legislation, to get decent, coherent discussion, agreement and outcomes that are in the interests of all the stakeholders and are in the national interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say just in conclusion that the opposition, as the leader said earlier on, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8473"> approaches this whole debate in a constructive and a conciliatory spirit. We acknowledge that the act that we passed in 1993 needed some remedial attention. We had no help at all in 1993. And I remember this better than anyone else in this country, because I was up there in that Senate chamber for days on end trying to get some rational input into the debate from the coalition side of politics which was spectacularly unforthcoming, and it is the case that a number of the problems in the current legislation are directly attributable to that pig-headed, dogged, dogmatic, bloody&hyphen;mindedness that we had from the coalition on that occasion. It is the case that the Wik decision does require some rethinking of some provisions of the legislation and to get a coexistence regime properly applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor Party and the opposition do want to protect and advance the interests of indigenous Australians&mdash;as we always have&mdash;for which we make no apology whatsoever. But we also want to recognise and protect and advance the legitimate interests of all those other Australians and Australian businesses who do have an interest in the outcome of this legislation. It is in the national interest that we get these balances right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will work in the opposition as hard as we possibly can, whatever the formidable character of the odds against us, in this chamber and in the Senate to get this legislation right. We simply ask that this government, and in particular its Prime Minister, approach this debate, this legislation, in the same spirit. If the Prime Minister wants to re-establish some credibility for his presently shabby and tattered leadership of this country, if he wants to re-establish some credibility by behaving not like a crude and ugly populist but something resembling a statesman, then he will have, Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you and I assure this House, the full support and the full cooperation of the opposition in doing so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess it is probably fair to say that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I am fairly disturbed about the debate about native title within the community. Throughout our lives there comes a time when the very essence of one's value system is tested and the strength of character to live by the truth is required&mdash;and, for me, this is the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before us is the Native Title Amendment Bill, which has been developed by the coalition I think in a caring and compassionate way and in a sense of doing what is right for all Australians and, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has just said, in the national interest. I support the bill because it addresses the issues which are contributing to I think the death by a thousand cuts attitude of the broader Australian community towards indigenous affairs. In my view, this bill is very, very important. It is probably the most important bill this House has addressed for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bill which will provide certainty to all stakeholders. It is a bill which will go a long way to solving the issue of the current confusion associated with land title management within Australia&mdash;and we must remember that this is a land title bill. The eyes of the nation are upon us, and it is vitally important that we provide justice to all stakeholders in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too long, there has been too much rhetoric and not enough action in relation to Aboriginal affairs. For too long, outcomes that the community wills us to deliver have not been achieved. For too long, we have not treated Aboriginal people with the respect they so richly deserve. For too long, their culture has been treated with disdain, their future has been disregarded and the need for them to be linked spiritually and culturally to their land has been misunderstood and ignored. For too long, there has been too much politics in Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party positions itself as the great advocate of indigenous rights when the facts belie this particular notion. In the last parliament the Labor Party stood, they said, for indigenous people. They said they were working for their wellbeing. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. They promised a social justice package associated with this bill which came out in 1993, yet they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8474"> failed and did not deliver. They took Aboriginal health away from the people who could best deliver it, the Aboriginal people. They created distrust and belittled Aboriginal people over the Hindmarsh Island affair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party failed to respond, let alone act, on two significant reports tabled in the last parliament: one called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equity and access</EMPHASIS>, which took them two years to respond to, and the other one called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice under scrutiny</EMPHASIS>, which just prior to the last election they took 12 months to respond to. They have also failed to respond to other reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party really has no credibility on Aboriginal issues other than giving a false hope to the Aboriginal people. The Labor Party promised land rights, yet did not deliver. The Labor Party promised and never delivered on many indigenous issues. The broader community must now wonder how the mess we now have was allowed to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, reconciliation has a long way to go, mainly because the Labor Party promised so much and delivered nothing. Labor allowed Aboriginal affairs to become politicised. Under Labor a wedge of distrust was driven between the black and white communities of our nation. Under Labor, the goodwill of the many has turned sour and, in my opinion, the relationships between black and white in our country are at their lowest since I can remember.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, bigotry and hatred towards our noble indigenous people have been allowed to prosper. There is no greater example of this than the election of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in a strong Labor seat based on anti-Aboriginal sentiment whipped up amongst traditional Labor voters who are conservative Australians, because the Labor Party politicised indigenous affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor inaction, infant mortality in the indigenous population tragically was allowed to be two to three times that of non-Aboriginal children. Under Labor, the life expectancy of Aboriginal males is 16 to 18 years less than non-Aboriginal males in Australia. It is not the Labor Party's fault, but it has been allowed to happen and continue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prevalence of diabetes is four times greater than that for non-Aboriginal Australians. Two out of five Aboriginal males can expect to live beyond their 65th birthday compared to three out of four non-Aboriginal Australians. Preventable diseases account for much of the Aboriginal health problems and Aboriginal premature death. These are just some of the sad, sorry stories. When one adds poor literacy standards, poor education, the unacceptably high incarceration rates, the unacceptably high unemployment rates and unacceptable housing and other services, one must ask the question: why is this happening in our country? Why is this allowed to happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder the indigenous leaders of our country are seeking some sort of economic independence. They have left themselves in the care of the many governments and administrations of over the last 200 years, and collectively we have let them down. Who can blame them for wanting their own economic independence when we cannot address the basic priority issues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have let them down to the extent where some in the community are now blaming them for the position they find themselves in. It is not the Aboriginal community's fault for poor health, poor education, incarceration, poor housing and dispossession. Collectively it is for every Australian to take responsibility to acknowledge past poor performance and to provide a future for Aboriginal people based upon respect, inclusiveness and bipartisan policy implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We owe it to past generations from both communities to right the wrongs and progress towards a future in which the indigenous peoples can rightly participate. But I am afraid we are a long way from achieving this grand plan. We chose a path some years ago, and it was a path of land management. In my view, it was the wrong path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our former Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, spoke with a forked tongue when he falsely promised a future which he could never deliver. Now we have a tense environment within the community of negotiation which will split the broader community if a little goodwill is not provided by all parties&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8475"> a split in the community which will not impact directly upon the broader community but may impact more greatly upon the indigenous community, and it probably is going to be worse than anything in the last 200 years. I ask why. In my view, it is because the Labor Party chose, and still chooses, to play politics with Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, when speaking on native title, I warned of a backlash. I warned that if a poorly constructed Native Title Act were enacted there would be a serious backlash towards our indigenous peoples. Who among us now would dispute that the mood in the community is finely balanced and slowly swinging against Aboriginal people? The question then is: why has this been allowed to happen? Why has community animosity been allowed to grow towards indigenous people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could point our fingers at the poor administration of the previous Labor government, which politicised Aboriginal affairs, and we may very well be correct in that assessment. We could point our fingers squarely at ATSIC and their failure to produce the key priority issues of indigenous people, and we may very well be correct. Yet, if one analyses the native title debate and cuts through the rhetoric, we come to some of the problems. We have two sides going in the opposite direction and pulling against each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How could so many good-thinking Australians get it wrong? I think the answer lies within the history of the original negotiations and the expectations which were given falsely to Aboriginal people. They were promised land rights and they got nothing. This is why we need to amend the original bill and provide certainty but, at the same time, recognise native title and how it can exist and coexist within Australian land management. Those who believe that native title is superior to Australian land law have not considered the issue in any great depth and have been caught up just in the emotion of politics rather than in seeking solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just four years ago, speaker after speaker in the then Labor government rose to support the native title legislation, extolling its virtues and how it will mean a new beginning for Abo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> riginal people. I doubt whether anyone believes that rhetoric now. The fact is that the native title legislation of 1993 is not working. I will quickly give you a couple of examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yakabindie is a nickel mining development in Western Australia. Last year it had four claims on it from four different Aboriginal groups. This year it has five claims. If Yakabindie's principals are able to negotiate with each of those five claims and strike an agreement, it will not be a problem. If they do it today, it will not be a problem; they will be able to proceed. Tomorrow another claim could be put on them, and the whole process would start again. This is uncertainty, and it is uncertain for Aboriginal people as much as it is for other mining developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example is Whim Creek, which is another nickel mine. They need to have gas running through to their project. It is 1&half; kilometres away. They want to run a pipe about an inch in diameter under dirt for 1&half; kilometres. They have asked for an appeasement some 20 metres wide for 1&half; kilometres. They advertised for the prescribed period. A week prior to the prescribed period finishing, they had a claim put on them from Aboriginal groups 250 kilometres away. The deal was this: pay us a million bucks and we will give you the right to go ahead to put a pipe&mdash;which passed all heritage laws&mdash;underground. There is uncertainty here, and it needs amending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Native Title Act provided no certainty and no rights for Aboriginal people in 1993. It would be easy for me to argue what was wrong with the 1993 act, but we should refer to who drafted it. The Attorney&hyphen;General at the time, Michael Lavarch, was drafting amendments prior to leaving the last parliament. He recently said that Labor may back the amendments before us. Surely this, by implication, means that we need amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for resources and energy, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), is in the chamber at the moment. What does he have to say? In a recent edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Gas Journal</EMPHASIS> he is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition will work in the national interest to seek an acceptable outcome to native title. Kim 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8476"> Beazley has made that clear both publicly and privately. Even prior to the Wik case, the act was not perfect and the procedures and processes need to be improved to make the act more workable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need a better, more workable process which will provide certainty and validity and which is fair to all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the words of the opposition leader group, which he is now a part of, we have an admission that the current act does not work, and we need certainty. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>  on 27 August said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Frankly I think it's in everybody's interest that the threshold test be tougher.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, he is suggesting, by implication, that it needs amendment. On page 328 of a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Victory</EMPHASIS> , the former Prime Minister is quoted on this subject. The passage reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To Court's surprise, Keating had confided that he believed he had received poor advice from his own people, that elements of the legislation were not working smoothly and that the act needed amendments to make it more workable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think we all agree with that. The passage went on to report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But he told Court it was too dangerous to reopen controversial areas such as pastoral leases and negotiation rights, because the legislation would then have to go back to the Senate where it risked further amendments from the Greens and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The architects of the Native Title Act 1993 have admitted it was flawed and required reform, particularly&mdash;by implication&mdash;the controversial pastoral leases aspect and the right to negotiate. So the party that promised everything to the Aboriginal peoples back in 1993 has said clearly, `The act is not working and needs reform.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With its reform, the coalition has tried to meet four major criteria which have not been recognised by those opposite. The first is to maintain respect for native title, the second is to reduce uncertainty, the third is to improve workability and the fourth is to find a balance among interested parties. Those have been our criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the government asking for these reforms. The list is long and includes farmers and miners. It also includes the former Prime Minister. It now includes the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). It also includes the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for resources and energy. The list also includes those dispossessed Aboriginal people who do not in fact benefit from the current act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the question then becomes: why is there conflict within our community? Why do we have full&hyphen;page advertisements saying, `Let's get it right.' For instance, Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 27 August that native title was more than any other title. In respect of being denied access to land, Mr Yu said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What that means is people can't fulfil those cultural imperatives, those cultural obligations to pass on the knowledge to our young children, to our kids, so that they are able to sustain that distinct and peculiar definition of native title which makes us distinct from the rest of the country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What I think Mr Yu is saying is, `Why can't indigenous people have access to traditional lands? Why can't Aboriginal people have access to land to fulfil their culture?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Yu is expressing exactly the same sentiments as the Australians listed in this advertisement here. The news is good, because this Native Title Amendment Bill allows this to happen. This bill allows statutory rights&mdash;which are greater than common law rights&mdash;to gain access to traditional lands for the fulfilment of their cultural imperatives and objectives. This right is within the legislation we have before us today. So the worries of Mr Yu and those Australians in this advertisement have been met on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what is the other issue? It has taken a long time to come out in this debate, but the other issue at the foundation of the opposition to this 10&hyphen;point plan is the right to negotiate. In my view, it is the money. The sticking point is the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do not want it to be the money. But, in January, Mr Noel Pearson, when responding to Paul Lyneham, who asked, `What do you want?' said, `Substantial justice.' What does that mean? Political cynicism says that `substantial justice' means `money.' In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 11 September with regard to Minister Herron, ATSIC spokesman Geoff Clark was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8477">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Herron made positive noises about his commitment to Aborigines but failed to acknowledge the link between land rights and economic independence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, that means money. The ATSIC chairman, Gatjil Djerrkura, was quoted in the same article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any reversal of native title rights won through legal processes will have a huge negative impact on indigenous economic development.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it may in fact be the money. Is it the money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How, from native title, will the peoples of Cullacubardee in my electorate gain economic independence? How will the peoples of Ninga Mire out at Kalgoorlie gain economic independence out of native title? How will the dispossessed peoples of Sydney and Melbourne gain economic independence from native title? The fact is that they will not. And, under the current arrangements, they cannot. Therefore, other than for local Aboriginal communities who are directly affected, economic independence will be provided to just a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a cruel hoax to suggest that all Aboriginal peoples of this land will gain economic independence on native title when they cannot&mdash;only a few can. Native title is not the panacea for land rights as indigenous leaders see it; native title is nothing more than land title management. The negotiation provisions have been improved, as suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the government is assuring just compensation if those rights are taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is much to do in Aboriginal affairs; there is much to recognise; and there is much to accept and acknowledge. We cannot falter in our desire to gain equity and particularly access for our indigenous peoples. The indigenous peoples are an important part of Australia's future, and the community should embrace their culture without fear and without suspicion. These emotional barriers are amongst us now within the broader community and our first steps towards reconciliation should be the goal of breaking down these barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides the first steps to bringing some balance back to the reconciliation debate. If we are truly keen to provide an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inclusive future to our indigenous people, then this bill provides the first step. If we truly want to provide certainty to land management in Australia, if we truly want to move forward, then this bill is the first step&mdash;the first step, not the end. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This current debate about native title will undoubtedly be seen in future years as another important and defining moment in our history and in the development of our national character. This parliament has a unique opportunity to restore some honour to this nation's reputation as an inclusive society and one where the rights and interests of all its citizens are given due weight and recognition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation, we should have pride in our diversity and acknowledge the central place that indigenous Australians have in the formation of our identity. As a nation, we have come late to the recognition that indigenous Australians have rights which predate the arrival of the British colonisers. It is only recently that we have afforded indigenous Australians any recognition of these rights within our statute law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, up until the High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2 in 1993, there were those who maintained their advocacy of the absurd and obnoxious notion of terra nullius. Following the Mabo decision, the Labor government, responding to the clamour of concern that resonated within some sections of the Australian community, sought to give legislative effect to the High Court's decision through the development and passage of the Native Title Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In passing this historic legislation, the government and the parliament did so in the face of concerted, noisy and sometimes mischievous opposition from vested interests, with the support of some state and territory governments. I well recall the bitter and nasty nature of this opposition, led by members of the then opposition who now hold high office in this government. But I also recall the leadership shown by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who, despite the difficulty in attracting the support of these vested interests and against the backdrop of the divisive 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8478"> rhetoric of others, had the dignity, wisdom, foresight and courage to persevere with the legislation and a package of other proposals designed to address the native title rights of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government's legislative response to Mabo included the creation of an indigenous land fund, the establishment of the Indigenous Land Corporation and a social justice package designed to address the fundamental elements of the social and economic disadvantage experienced by indigenous Australians. This outcome was always a compromise, the success of which rested on the preparedness of the government to sit down and negotiate with indigenous Australians over these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These negotiations required not only goodwill but also trust&mdash;trust in the fact that, once agreed to, the government and the parliament, representing the people of Australia, would be true to its word&mdash;but, from the minute this government came to power, it has walked away from that agreement that was given on behalf of the nation to indigenous Australians. Their success significantly also required sacrifice and agreement by the indigenous negotiators to compromise on key issues so that the demands and interests of non-indigenous Australians could be accommodated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was by no means a perfect exercise, and the outcome for indigenous Australians was, from their point of view, far from perfect. They were prepared to allow the validation of certain past acts which could otherwise have been declared as invalid because of the existence of native title. The agreement to the validation of these acts was arrived at on the basis that the total package being negotiated with the government and the parliament would be implemented, even though agreement to validate meant that native title associated with the acts validated would be extinguished. But it was by agreement. This was a big ask and an enormous sacrifice on behalf of indigenous Australians. I repeat: this was done by agreement and consent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The fact that indigenous Australians were prepared to contemplate this arrangement came as the result of their willingness to sit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the table with the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and accept the bona fides of the government to deliver on any agreement reached. They were party to and central players in a fair dinkum negotiation with the Prime Minister and the government of this country. The then government dealt with the representatives of the indigenous people of Australia with respect. They were closely involved in every stage of the process leading to the passage of the Native Title Act through this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a time of negotiation between equals, with full respect given to everybody involved. Of course, the then opposition were implacably and loudly opposed to the legislation and were moved to make the most derisive and condemnatory attacks upon it. It is they who are responsible, if there is unworkability in this package, for it being there because of their head in the sand attitude, their refusal to work with all the stakeholders in a positive way at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The core principles which underlie the Native Title Act 1993 were: ungrudging and unambiguous recognition and protection of native title; provision for clear and certain validation of past acts, including grants and laws, if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title; a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts affecting native title; and rigorous, specialised and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title and for negotiation and decisions on proposed grants over native title land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's current proposals change each and every one of these core principles to the detriment of indigenous people. However, I guess this should come as no surprise, given the attitude and opinions expressed by senior members of the coalition before, during and after the time the original legislation was debated. During the process leading to the development and introduction of this amending legislation, the government has treated the representatives of the indigenous people of this country with disdain. It refuses to listen to them. It takes no notice of their arguments for preservation of the package reflected in the act as it stands. It refuses to respect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8479"> indigenous people and their concerns. It has refused to negotiate with them. The legislation currently before the House reflects this disdain of indigenous people. It has a significant negative impact on the current rights enjoyed by indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House should be in no doubt about the position of the opposition in relation to these matters. It has already been enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) in the debate so far. The opposition will not walk away from the agreement reached between the previous parliament and indigenous Australians&mdash;an agreement which also respected the rights of pastoralists, miners and others with an interest in land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night I was fortunate enough, as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title, to witness a submission presentation by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. This presentation was made by the chairman of the commission, Mr Gatjil Djekurra, and his fellow commissioners, Mr Geoff Clarke, Mr Terry O'Shane and others. Their submission was noteworthy for the thought that went into it and the dignified manner in which the presentation was made. Their submission reflected their belief that the principles underlying the original legislation would be significantly watered down. In particular, Mr Djekurra highlighted key areas of the bill which are of major concern to indigenous people. Page 3 of the submission lists these areas as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The extensive extinguishment of native title contained in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The attack on the right to negotiate contained in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The problem of only those native title holders who currently have access being given interim statutory access rights under this Bill, and thus potentially denying this opportunity to a whole generation of Aboriginal people who were denied access in the past through no fault of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Serious doubts that exist over significant parts of these amendments in terms of conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act and their potential to be invalid on constitutional grounds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In their submission, the ATSIC representatives referred to the agreement reached with the government in 1993 over the right to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> negotiate. At page 8 of their submission, ATSIC indicates its opposition to changes which diminish the rights of native title holders because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">they are a breach of the agreement reached in 1993 between indigenous interests and the Government that provisions would be inserted in the Native Title Act which validated potentially invalid grants made after the Racial Discrimination Act came into force, providing they would also have a substantial Right to Negotiate;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Right to Negotiate is the only way that indigenous people can protect their communities from the negative impacts of development and help them benefit as well;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government has not made any case for proposing significant changes; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">native title holders will resort to litigation because the Native Title Act will not provide a fair means for protecting their interests, thus leading to more uncertainty for all parties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Any fair reading of the government's proposals shows that it involves, among other things, validation of titles well beyond any reasonable interpretation of the High Court's determination in Wik&mdash;manifestly unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable overreach of the provisions purporting to confirm extinguishment of native title. There are bucket loads of extinguishment involved in this legislation which comprise a substantial diminution of the rights of indigenous people to their land. There is an unfair, unreasonable and indefensibly limited test for allowing statutory access rights for registered claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC, in their submission to the parliamentary joint committee, presented a compelling case on this issue. On page 14, the physical access test to which this matter refers, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) . . . there is no way that such a test can operate in a way which does not discriminate unfairly against some native title holders; and,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the proposed suspension of all common law rights to an area, not just common law access rights, once even one claimant has qualified for the interim statutory rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many reasons why Aboriginal people have been dispersed from their traditional country. However this displacement is one of the greatest worries for native title holders, as it affects their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8480"> ability to care for, protect and maintain their important sites, and this in turn creates problems for social cohesion and stability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important consequences of the Wik decision for many native title holders was the promise of being able to exercise responsibility for their traditional country. Essential to this is the ability to access country for traditional purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To wait for determination of claims might be too long for many people, especially older people who feel this loss of country very keenly, and worry that they might die before these matters can be sorted out.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the heart of this bill is an inability, an unwillingness, by the government and some sections of the community to accept that the rights of native title holders can coexist with those of pastoralists and other non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. But, on the other hand, non&hyphen;indigenous Australians have consistently voiced their acceptance and support of the Wik principle of coexistence. As Mr Djerrkura eloquently put it last night in his opening statement to the joint committee&mdash;and I quote from page 3:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our basic approach to native title is one of co&hyphen;existence. The Wik case, in identifying the co&hyphen;existence of native title and other interests, has pointed the way forward for this nation, if we are mature enough to acknowledge it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Co&hyphen;existence means recognition, acceptance and partnership. It is on this basis that we can build a cohesive society which can face the future with optimism. There is no turning back to the days when the rights of indigenous people were suppressed, ignored or marginalised. With native title we have a great opportunity to build for the future. I would like to add a personal dimension here, because native title is not just an abstract legal notion. Native title is about our lives as Australia's indigenous people and the futures we face.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parents came to this country. This was the adopted country of my parents. I have respect for the indigenous inhabitants of this land. I have a sense of empathy with them when it comes to discrimination. The Racial Discrimination Act is a special act of this parliament to me because it is our bill of rights; it is what makes us all equal. This amendment bill shreds the Racial Discrimination Act. That is what it does as a later act of the federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worse still, this amendment bill is repugnant in parts; we in opposition agree with some of it. The parts that pare back the existing rights that indigenous Australians hold are based on a repugnant notion that the 1967 referendum, which was voted on by over 90 per cent of all Australians, was a referendum that purported in intent and purpose to give this parliament the power to legislate for the benefit and advancement of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government comes into this parliament and abuses the purpose and intent of that referendum by saying that the change to the constitution, as endorsed by over 90 per cent of Australians in 1967, can now be used to pare away not only the limited rights that the High Court has found that indigenous Australians enjoy as a result of the Mabo and Wik

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The history of relations between white settlement and the Aboriginal inhabitants from the time the clash began between a developing, civilised society with a coherent language&mdash;oral and written&mdash;and a primitive group of many tribes without a written language, basically nomadic hunter&hyphen;gatherers, can be characterised as one of patronisation primarily but also adjustment. The historian Barbara Tuchman summed it up when she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the beginning of recorded history, governments have pursued policies which are harmful to citizens whom they are supposed to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Honourable members who have bothered to listen to or read speeches I have given in this House will have appreciated that I am not a fan of more and more government&mdash;indeed, quite the opposite. I am a great believer in the rule of law and the evolution, not the revolution, of the common law. The common law can sometimes get it wrong. It can overcorrect, but, because of its innate ability to correct an overcorrection in an imperfect world, the common law has the advantage of centuries of human experience. It casts a look back, it considers, it observes and it works towards a consistent whole, but it should not overstep the mark. Quality judges, divorced from political rhetoric, do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, statute law is frequently inflexible, frozen in time for the time. In recent years a mountain of statute law has been passed. In the six years from 1990 to 1995, this parliament passed more pages of legislation than it did between Federation and 1974. I repeat this because it is very important: from 1990 to 1995, 29,230 pages of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation; from 1901 to 1974, 28,502 pages of legislation. This is a staggering statistic. Barbara Tuchman refers to this as a `march of folly'. Sir Harry Gibbs, the former Chief Justice of the High Court, said recently that the courts and the media have joined with governments in taking part in that march.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we are considering major amendments to what was a flawed act. At its core, when considering that it followed the two Mabo decisions of the High Court, it was the laudable but foolishly patronising notion that native title, whatever that means&mdash;and I recoil in horror at the prospect of the High Court, millions of dollars in legal fees later, telling us what it ultimately does mean&mdash;is somehow effecting or trying to effect a restitutio integrum: in other words, putting Aboriginals back in the same position they would have been in if European society and development had never appeared in this country with its standards of living, health and social welfare, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can appreciate, without going too far with this notion, how unrealistic, absurd and horribly patronising it is. It gets worse. Notwithstanding the clear assumption in the Native Title Act as originally drafted, especially in the recitals that pastoral leases extinguish native title, the High Court in the Wik decision decided that that was not the case, throwing a further 40 per cent of this land mass of Australia open to claim. The High Court was once considered a pre&hyphen;eminent court in the common law world under the auspices of Sir Owen Dixon, Chief Justice. But, unfortunately, it has crossed the line; it has simply gone too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Malcolm Fraser, a former Prime Minister, in an article in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> recounts a discussion with a distinguished English jurist who questioned in the early 1980s what had happened to the High Court. This jurist said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a pity about your High Court. We used to read its judgments. We all used to learn from them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is clear from the extraordinary rhetoric that has characterised some of the judgments in the Mabo case, especially that of Justices Deane and Gaudron, that the court has simply lost its way.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8482">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, under the rulings of the High Court, the Racial Discrimination Act, from being an act that basically hung around in the corner of your average law library, has assumed the status of holy writ, immune from tampering, unamendable and capable of being stretched to any corner of Australian life, taking on the esteem of the constitution itself. That was very clear from some of the remarks of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). The High Court in the Koowarta case upheld by a bare majority of four to three that the Racial Discrimination Act was a valid use of the external affairs power and thus a valid act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Harry Gibbs, a former Chief Justice, said that a bare majority of the High Court ignored the context provided by the constitution as a whole in construing the power to make laws with respect to external affairs. The High Court in Mabo No. 1 continued this particular march. In that particular case the question was whether it was discriminatory to abolish a form of property which could be held only by one race. Let us think of that notion. Was it discriminatory and in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act to abolish a law which discriminated in favour of one race of people? The High Court held four to three that it was. What a curious notion this is. Thus, a state law which purported to extinguish native title was inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mabo No. 2 overturned hundreds of years of settled law. Whereas the states ran the land title system, the Torrens title, which has been copied as a model all over the world, there is now a disturbing, convoluted and unsettled system of land tenure in this country. I regret to say that I do not think any government, no matter how well intentioned and motivated, can coherently wrestle with it. A brave attempt has been made by this legislation, but can years of expensive litigation generally funded out of taxpayers' money be ruled out? I am not sure that any legislation can exclude that prospect or that any legislation is capable of being accepted by the parliament as a whole in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So while I risk being labelled as one of those conservatives who would take us back 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the `advances', I ask again: we all want progress, but what is progress? Is it not getting into a position where you want to be? I do not want to witness the obscenity of 36 barristers appearing in the High Court for three days, as in the Wik decision&mdash;obscene because that indelible image of folly is contrasted with the image of the many Aboriginals for whom I have acted over the years, their lives wrecked by alcohol, by a culture of violence, by an isolation from the mainstream, cast adrift, lurching, getting nowhere where they want to be. It is this group, sadly, the great majority of Aboriginal Australians and to some extent Torres Strait Islanders, who are my constituency and who will not get anything from this amorphous monstrosity called native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is native title? Well-meaning Australians think it is like the title we have on the homes and land that we have purchased. Let me tell the people of Australia that it most certainly is not. I can mortgage my land and make it work for me, I can invest in business, I can use it to make myself prosperous, I can sell it and turn it into cash, I can buy a better piece of land. But if I am an Aboriginal and a native title holder I cannot do that. They cannot sell it. In any event, they cannot and do not, almost without exception, own it in their own name. It is communally held. They cannot mortgage it. Hence, they have little chance of improving on it or improving their own standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, I ask: of what value is it in advancing the health, welfare, living standards and employment opportunities of most Aboriginal people? Some might say: but what of the mineral royalties? Apart from the fact that I do not see people advancing individually&mdash;and recent history would seem to suggest this&mdash;from yet another handout, at best it can affect only a small number of people. You cannot forever say of a race of people that they are the most disadvantaged in Australia, for this forever condemns them to continued disadvantage and stigmatisation. This is where patronisation and paternalism are founded. It is a patently flawed and failed approach and it is time it was discarded in our dealings with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8483"> our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had much experience as a barrister&hyphen;at&hyphen;law appearing for Aboriginal people and I have seen that patronisation. It sickens me. Some years ago I appeared for a 16-year-old Aboriginal charged with murder. His name was Fred. He was almost a full-blood Aboriginal, a fine physical specimen if ever there were one, a keen intellect, lawyer/doctor material if I ever I saw such a person. He had enormous potential. Whilst he was on remand for a period of about nine months he was a model young individual in the Westbrook centre near Toowoomba. Reports came back to me directly that he was a leader of men, he was someone whom the other boys approached, he was someone whom the other boys looked up to. His mother, Mary, was also an extraordinary woman. He was an example to all of these boys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This incident arose from a street fight which originally arose from excessive use of alcohol. Many people were involved. The leading citizen of the town died in this street fight. It was never murder; it was manslaughter at most. But Fred had to cope on two fronts. In the court case, it was alleged that the person who threw that punch was the same person who scooped up the money that fell out of the deceased's pocket. It was a riot that night. Fred admitted to pushing in the direction of the upper chest of the deceased, but he did not admit to the fatal punch. He vehemently denied stealing the money. He identified the culprit who stole the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Aboriginals were apprehended that night. The watchhouse charge book identified each of those Aboriginals and each of them was searched for money. All of them, bar one, had small amounts of a few cents in their pocket. The one person who was identified by Fred had a lot of money in his pocket. When you think of the crown case you think: what has happened here? Fred was convicted by an all&hyphen;white jury of that offence and of the stealing. I have no doubt that it was a miscarriage of justice, a real one. I cannot stand injustice. Fred, as I said, was very much a tremendous specimen of his own race, yet a prisoner of it. A meddling, interfering uncle 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> told him repeatedly that Fred did not understand concepts&mdash;which he most certainly did&mdash;because he was Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This notion goes back again to patronisation. The uncle believed that because Europeans told him, and half-smart ones of his own race built on that concept of discrimination and race. So we are beset with this notion of patronisation. This, in effect, is a concept that we, I am sad to say, as European Australians, have foisted on Aboriginal people, just as with the word `reconciliation'. This is a word of European derivation, unknown in Aboriginal language. It is patronising in the extreme, though well meaning. It is muddle-headed and divisive and should be discarded, as it is used as a whipping post to foster division in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never seen more division in my life since this notion was foisted upon us. Likewise the use of divisive terms such as `indigenous' and `non-indigenous'. I pay tribute here to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A new deal</EMPHASIS>, where the committee eschewed the use of this divisive language. The problem with using that language was particularly acute when looking at Torres Strait Islanders. For example, what do you call a person of Japanese origin who has lived in the Torres Strait for over 100 years, as opposed to a Melanesian who has been there for fifty years? It can't be `indigenous' and `non-indigenous'. Again, the use of these terms is divisive, unnecessary and patronising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to mention a couple of things in relation to the opposition amendment. The opposition amendment speaks in 7(iv) of `extinguishment'. That is simply not true. Compensation will be paid. Similarly with validation. Compensation has been set at 75 per cent with a Commonwealth contribution. If the opposition can show anywhere in this legislation&mdash;and I challenge them to do so&mdash;where a native title right is established that compensation will not follow, then I would be very happy for them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise with this comment in 10(vii) about the rules of evidence. It is yet again patronisation, yet again wanting to say that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8484"> there is a race of people who cannot be subject to the same rules of evidence laws as the rest of Australia. It is Hindmarsh Island revisited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to honourable members the book by Michael Warby, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Past Wrongs, Future Rights</EMPHASIS>. I want to refer quickly to that book. In the summary it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have levels of life expectancy, health, income, educational attainment and employment which remain very significantly below mainstream Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The welfare approach to indigenous policy detracts from, or even frustrates, cultural adaptation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The only appropriate role for the concept of race in public policy is to bar racial discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to close with the final quote from this particular book:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The developing thread in public policy of building up an independent, privately owned asset base for indigenous Australians is far more potentially productive than the previous welfarist and anti&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">discrimination approaches. But only provided such an approach is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a basis for building up institutions, and assisting in the re&hyphen;construction of a vibrant civil society, genuinely inclusive of indigenous Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> fostering the cultural adaptation which must occur if indigenous Australians are to gain rightful benefits of participation in Australian and global society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cultural (including institutional) adaptations must come from within indigenous societies and communities if they are to succeed. Forced persistence with, for example, communal and inalienable title is not only not a basis for progress in improving conditions for indigenous Australians, it will actually retard progress. Native title, construed as communal, inalienable and generally partial title, is not a path forward.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree wholeheartedly with this. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That public policy should be based on the principle that race should not matter, except when in does, is a contradiction that cannot stand. It is too subtle a mix for the coarse operation of political processes; its intellectual incoherence not only ensures that it will not achieve its aims, but is a sign of deep lack of seriousness, of lack of genuine concern with consequences, with what actually occurs for real people with real lives to lead.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unfortunately, I do not have time to finish the whole quote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill goes some of the way to improving the present difficult situation. I do believe that the problem with this  great area is to get away from patronisation and paternalism and to generate within Aboriginal people that real sense of worth that will help them solve their own problems and have them advance within Australian society.</PARA>

The Vice&hyphen;Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, has completed his investigations and has provided me with the following information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8485">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ranks of individual Defence Force members are not compiled in any publication generally available to the public but they do appear from time to time in documentation printed by Defence and made available to the public, such as the Defence functional telephone directory, which members of the public can purchase. Legal advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department is that the matching of members' names and addresses as they appeared on the electoral roll with the member's rank and the disclosure of the information to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory was technically in breach of the Privacy Act. The Attorney&hyphen;General's Department added that the disclosure in this situation is of a relatively minor nature and unlikely to cause significant interference with the privacy of an individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that this was not a breach of the Defence Act as suggested by the shadow minister for defence. The issue in question is simply not covered by the Defence Act. Defence instructions are being amended to ensure that no breach of the Privacy Act occurs in future by this means. Members would realise that a military person's rank is hardly secret. Indeed, it is displayed with pride on the uniforms of everyone in the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the Privacy Act does not prevent the release of information on members' ranks for inclusion on honour rolls and the like where an ADF member may reasonably be expected to have known that information on his or her rank would be used in such a way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 September I told the House that I had been advised that there was no recollection or record of advice from Headquarters Northern Command given to the office of the leader of the Northern Territory opposition stating that rank information could not be made available. I also told the House on 3 September that I was not satisfied with the accuracy of this initial advice and that was what led me to ask Admiral Barrie to undertake this investigation. It now appears that such advice was indeed given to the office of the leader of the Northern Territory opposition by a newly appointed civilian staff member of Northern Command. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Admiral Barrie reports that this person did not know that the commander had available in his office a copy of a previously compiled list if it was requested by political parties. Despite extensive questioning the commander was not able to establish this fact until after the matter was raised in the House. Admiral Barrie's judgment is that this arose because of a lack of understanding rather than any deliberate attempt to mislead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already passed a copy of Admiral Barrie's report to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). Some of the material in the report is of a staff&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence nature and I would ask the honourable member to handle the material accordingly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record it should be recalled that, when this matter was first raised in this parliament, the question was put to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) and was shrugged off. The day after that, a similar question on this matter was put to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), representing the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, who clearly had no knowledge of the situation and was unable to provide any answer to assist the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having had the matter asked twice in that way I find it quite unacceptable that, when asking the Minister for Defence a question about this, which I did on 2 September, the minister's brief response brushed it aside, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite frankly, I think it is nothing less than a childish question.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, he repeated his conclusion that it was a childish question on another occasion. What we now know is that it was not a childish question; it was not an insignificant matter. It was a matter of some significance, which has now been acknowledged as a breach of the Privacy Act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8486">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carelessness with which the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, then the minister acting for the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and then subsequently the Minister for Defence dealt with the matter is of some concern. In fact, later that day, when the Minister for Defence gave a more detailed answer and provided documents from Brigadier Roberts and others, he repeated the comment, as I said today, `It is a childish question.' It is not a childish question; it is a significant issue, as the minister quickly learned the following day when he was in the House and commented that he was not satisfied with the original advice and had determined to ask Admiral Barrie to undertake a review, which is now before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information which I provided by way of statutory declaration, and the matters I sought to raise by way of question, have largely been confirmed as being factual and accurate. We now know that, in spite of what may have been in Chief Minister Stone's mind or Brigadier Roberts's mind, the material was not freely available to other candidates. Indeed, when the Labor Party in the Northern Territory and the leader of the Labor Party's office sought information about this, they were not only denied it initially but, after some checking by the person who they thought was the appropriate contact point within Defence, they were told that information of this sort is not made available and that they would not be getting it. We now know that is not the case and the frivolous way in which all ministers involved in this have dealt with the matter has been exposed. I would hope that future issues that the opposition raise in respect of defence personnel matters are treated with the seriousness with which I and other members of the opposition raise them.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8487"> which has been so ably moved by the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our main reason for opposing the separation of Medibank Private is that we believe that this is the first step in the ultimate privatisation of the fund. The government has quite generously provided the opposition some weeks ago with a briefing on this particular bill. During that briefing we sought to test the government's bona fides in its claims that the legislation which it was introducing would corporatise Medibank Private but that any government that wished to privatise Medibank Private would have to enact subsequent legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that briefing, I sought from the government an assurance that merchant banks and clever advisers could not come up with a scheme that would allow this government to perhaps sell off the revenue stream from the shares of a corporatised Medibank Private, even if the government retained the ownership of those shares. We have seen a number of corporate financial transactions where various financial instruments have allowed control of an entity to be transferred, even though the ownership of the shares may not be transferred. The government agreed to go back and have a look at this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure if that was the reason, or whether there were other reasons, that caused the government to suggest that it was intending to amend its proposed legislation to close off a loophole that might have allowed the effective privatisation of the fund without any new legislation. The reason I make this claim is that, in the Senate committee hearings on this bill, Senator Knowles told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is being delayed by one week in the House of Representatives to enable further consideration on tightening the provisions which would prevent any possible future privatisation of Medibank Private without necessary parliamentary approval.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As we understand it, the government is now not intending to make any such amendments. That makes us quite concerned that either this loophole still exists or the government has now received legal advice that it is impossible for anyone to privatise Medibank Private or to sell off the future revenue stream for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Medibank Private without further legislation having to pass the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government has received that legal advice, that is reassuring and fine, but we would like to see a copy of that legal advice. When this debate continues in the Senate, we will be seeking to ensure that that legal advice is provided. If the government does not have that legal advice, we remain very concerned that, having asked questions, further amendments were being considered, but they are not before the House today. We would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth) could respond to those particular issues at the end of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear what organisations are pushing for this particular measure to be before the House today. It is probably not the Liberal Party, it is probably not government backbenchers, it is probably not the members of Medibank Private and it is not the management of Medibank Private. The organisations which have been pushing for this legislation to be before the parliament today are the other private health funds. The other private health funds are the ones who have been demanding that Medibank Private be separated from the Health Insurance Commission. Let us look at what their agenda is all about. The Australian Health Insurance Association's submission to the government's Industry Commission inquiry into private health insurance said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has no more role in operating a private health insurance organisation than in running an airline.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Industry Commission report also indicated the views of National Mutual Health Insurance, which said that they `consider that Medibank Private should be de&hyphen;linked from Medicare and privatised'. The Industry Commission report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Unity considered that Medibank Private could first be corporatised and then ultimately privatised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is quite clear that two of the major health funds and the funds' major representative organisation, the Australian Health Insurance Association, have been arguing not just for the separation and corporatisation of Medibank Private, not just for it to be split 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8488"> from the Health Insurance Commission, but for its ultimate privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) we have the clear statement that this action has been taken because of the perception that Medibank Private has some competitive advantage over the private health funds. We are entitled to ask: who has that perception? Who are the people who have this perception, who have lobbied the government and twisted arms that has resulted in this legislation appearing before the House? It is certainly not the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts who, in 1992, found `no evidence that cross-subsidisation occurs between Medibank Private and Medicare'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that, despite extensive examinations by Treasury and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), it certainly was not their perception that there was some difficulty in the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private being co&hyphen;located. There was certainly no demand from those departments requiring the separation of these two organisations. The group that has this perception is the health funds, who are demanding not just the separation but, ultimately, the privatisation of Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister who claims that this perception needs to be addressed in this legislation is the same minister who has given the health funds $1.7 billion of taxpayers' funds&mdash;the biggest lemon in Australian health policy that we have seen since the Second World War. I am quite pleased that the second reading amendment of the member for Jagajaga highlights this very issue&mdash;the fact that we now have not only the AMA and the Industry Commission but even Jeff Kennett, the Liberal Premier of Victoria, describing that policy as simply money down the drain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that we have had the development only in the last few weeks of MBF and Medibank Private announcing another range of increases, I would like to spend a few minutes on this particular issue. Over the last year the government has had in place a policy that required the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> health minister to approve increases in health insurance premiums. We have had John Howard as Prime Minister approve an increase in MBF's premiums of 15 per cent in New South Wales, or five per cent if a fund member agrees to pay a new $50 a day bed tax for nights spent in private hospitals, subject to a limit on the number of nights each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has also approved MBF imposing a massive 25 per cent increase in Victoria, or a 15 per cent increase if those Victorian members agree to pay that $50 per night bed tax. We have the same Prime Minister also agreeing to Medibank Private, the very fund we are considering today, imposing an average 11.2 per cent increase in their premiums across the country, or an increase of 20 per cent in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have heard me on many occasions, Madam Deputy  Speaker, mention the point that every one of these increases further erodes the tax rebate which ordinary members were led to believe would provide them with a reduction in the costs of their private health insurance. We have not seen a reduction; we are actually seeing increases in the cost of private health insurance. We are certainly not seeing an increase in fund membership, which is what we were promised. About 1,000 people are still leaving private health insurance per day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why this latest round of increases which has been approved by the Prime Minister are so disturbing is the fact that the government has now accepted this new $50 a night bed tax for people who use private hospitals. The reason this is so disturbing is that the government said that this policy was about spending $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money to reduce the cost of private health insurance. That would, in theory, boost membership and take pressure off our public hospital system. That is what the $1.7 billion tax rebate was supposed to be all about&mdash;to reduce pressure on public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the Prime Minister and the health minister agreeing to MBF charging this new $50 a night bed tax for private fund members who use a private hospital, this will force more of MBF's members to be treated as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8489"> private patients in public hospitals. The reason why MBF has instituted the fee is that MBF pays a lower rebate for a private patient in a public hospital than it does for a private patient in a private hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">MBF is going to increase the pressure on public hospitals in complete opposition to the government's claimed intention of this policy, yet the government gives it a tick. The government gives a tick to the new $50 per night bed tax for MBF members in private hospitals. If you are an MBF member and you choose this option&mdash;there is almost a gun at your head: you will get a 15 per cent increase if you do not accept the new $50 per night bed tax or a five per cent increase if you do&mdash;you will be paying not only your Medicare levy, the cost of your health insurance premium and gaps but also a fourth cost: the new $50 per night bed tax, which this government is imposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we raise these issues and try to get the government to admit that its $1.7 billion rebate has been $11 billion, its response is that the Labor Party never blocked any health fund premium increases and that when Labor was in government people kept leaving private health insurance. The point I want to make is, yes, health fund premiums did increase when we were in government and, yes, the number of people in private health funds declined. But that is happening today&mdash;people are still leaving, and fund increases are still taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big difference is that the government has blown $1.7 billion and it has made no difference whatsoever. It has spent $1.7 billion on a failed tax rebate policy that could have been spent directly on patient care. It could have been spent directly on public hospitals to reduce waiting lists, to keep operating theatres open and to have put more throughput in our major public hospitals but, instead, the government has blown it on this tax rebate which is clearly not having any impact whatsoever. Jeff Kennett was right when he said it was money down the drain; we just cannot get the Minister for Health and Family Services to admit it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the crucial reasons why Medibank Private should remain in public hands is that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it provides some competition for the private health funds, for the other fund members. My evidence for that is the evidence that Russell Schneider, the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, gave to the Senate committee. He was asked by one of the senators whether Medibank Private offered lower premiums. Mr Schneider's response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think in some cases they have done that. There have probably been times when some products have actually been more expensive than most.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Schneider was asked again by a senator about whether or not Medibank Private was cheaper. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think it is possible to say that across the board, Senator. We would use the term undercut, but that might not be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If Mr Schneider and his colleagues use the term that Medibank Private undercuts the premiums of the other health funds, it sounds to me that Medibank Private is doing a good job for its members. It makes us question whether it would be in the interests of the fund members of Medibank Private if the fund was corporatised and privatised, as many people are arguing. That is the reason we believe that the government, through an ideological obsession with wanting to emasculate public enterprises, has set out on this course. We already have evidence of this with Australian Hearing Services, which is recognised as one of the great public enterprises in health services delivery in our country, and which the government is keen to corporatise and set up for further atrocities. Australian Hearing Services has been put through the ringer and the government now wants to do the same to Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty for the government is that it already has a track record in this area. We already have 44 Medicare offices which have been selected for closure. We can in some ways be grateful for that in that the government announced in its 1996 budget that 80 offices were going to close. The community campaign of protest against Medicare office closures, which has resulted in a reduced number of closures, from 80 offices to 44, is a welcome concession. But it is going to cause a great deal of inconvenience for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8490"> communities whose offices have been selected for closure by the government. My colleague the member for Jagajaga has particularly highlighted the consequences to her local constituents of the closure of the Medicare office in Heidelberg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of New South Wales, 17 of the 44 Medicare offices were singled out for closure. I know you will be shocked by this, Madam Deputy Speaker: by a strange coincidence, 13 of the 17 offices selected for closure just happened to be in Labor Party electorates. I am sure it is a complete coincidence; I am sure the minister has not tried to single out local Medicare offices of Labor Party members in my state for closure. If asked, the parliamentary secretary might say that a high proportion of Medicare offices have closed in government electorates in the state of South Australia&mdash;but that might have something to do with the electoral success of the governing parties in that state at the last federal election. The minister has a responsibility to explain what methodology he used to select 13 of the 17 Medicare offices for closure in New South Wales Labor electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituents are pleased that the Medicare office at The Entrance, at Erina, is currently not scheduled for closure. That is a tribute to the minister. He made the right decision in that case. It is also a tribute to the efforts of members of the Long Jetty Combined Pensioners Association, who for weeks had a petition outside the Medicare office at The Entrance where they collected thousands of signatures. I am sure that played a big role in the minister agreeing to keep that particular Medicare office open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty the government is going to have is that Medibank Private currently has 270 shopfronts because of the co&hyphen;location with Medicare offices. They are going to shrink from 270 shopfronts to only 70 shopfronts. So, if you are a Medibank Private member, it is going to be much harder for you to get the information you need. The government might claim that there will be some agency arrangements put in place, but we all know that, with the best will in the world, people who act as agents for Medibank 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Private will not have the detailed knowledge and thorough understanding which the excellent staff at the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private have built up over many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga explained a number of concerns the opposition has about the impact that the changes will have on the staff at the Health Insurance Commission. In particular, we think the tightening up on the limited staff mobility rights is quite unfair and sets a very dangerous precedent. We also will be seeking some assurance from the government about the right of staff to continue to be able to apply for Australian Public Service jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other difficulties the government will have is that, in some cases, the offices which are used jointly by Medicare and Medibank Private are leased by Medibank Private. So we will have the ridiculous situation of Medibank Private booting out Medicare, and then Medicare in those places needing to open new offices. Imagine what the cost of a fit out of those offices will be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It really amazes me and makes me wonder about the credibility not only of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) but of the Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8491"> Party. They get up here and talk about private health and bleat about the fact that the changes we are making will have some deleterious effect on private health. During their 13&hyphen;year reign, private health insurance membership fell from 64 per cent to 34 per cent. We must always remember that. I hope the public out there remembers that it was actually the opposition, when in government during those years, that set about destroying private health funds. Today they have the hypocrisy to come in here and bleat about this government's actions in ensuring that the rebuilding of private health in Australia takes place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell may not have been one of those responsible for starting that process of destruction. I do not think he was around during the time of the then minister, the former member for Oxley, Mr Bill Hayden. But I certainly am one who remembers the commencement of the destruction of private health in Australia by the then minister, Mr Hayden. I think he started that process in about 1972 to 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have listened to the member for Dobell talk about the recent increase in private health insurance. He criticised this government for its concern about the reserves of private health funds which need to be maintained to ensure the viability of people getting their returns&mdash;a requirement of the act. However, those opposite averaged the approval of a 12 per cent increase per year over those 13 years. It is very hypocritical for the member for Dobell to even have the hide to raise the point, let alone to try to put some criticism on this government for upholding the act and its requirements. We certainly do not like having to do that. It is not our desire to have increases in private health funds. But it is our desire to ensure that private health funds maintain their service to the community and that they give people in the community the opportunity to choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I will get back to addressing the purpose of the  Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill 1997  before us today. In my electorate of Griffith, we will see the closure of two Medicare offices. The member for Dobell thought he was a little hard done by, but two 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Medicare offices are to close in my electorate. There will be the opportunity for alternatives to be put in place&mdash;by the establishment of an agency or through technology, which I will address shortly&mdash;in order to overcome that problem. However, it would be totally irresponsible of the government to be operating facilities in the community which are not only not paying their way but not delivering the services because the service demand is not there for those offices to be commercially viable. I, for one, expect all government services and facilities, whatever they may be, to be commercially viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The closure of two Medicare offices in my electorate have great relevance to the Health Insurance Commission bill we are debating today. This bill, which provides for the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission, will have a subtle but important impact on the people of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that separation of our public health fund, Medibank Private, from the Medicare claim system will create a far more efficient and user&hyphen;friendly system for the people of my electorate. It is obvious that the health system is in crisis from the comments that I and others have made in this place. It is also obvious that it has been lurching from one disaster to another for more than a decade. It is also very obvious that little or no consideration was given by the previous government for long-term plans to arrest this decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will allow the health fund Medibank Private to be established as an independent statutory corporation. It will also enable the Health Insurance Commission to expand its operations in the area in which it excels&mdash;that is, the processing of claims. This bill makes only minor changes to our giant health machine but changes which will at least set a course for faster and more efficient servicing of health customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Commission, which currently runs Medicare and Medibank Private, is one of the most efficient and effective of all our statutory bodies. Established in 1973, the commission processes 200 million claims a year and does so with great efficiency. In fact, it is recognised as a world leader 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8492"> in its field. The commission wants to expand this facility and become a major national and international consulting organisation. By removing the health insurer Medibank Private from its structure, we are freeing the commission to focus on what it does best. Separating those health funds from the Health Insurance Commission also puts Medicare in a position to become more efficient and client friendly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's electronic technology makes it possible for service centres to be dotted throughout the community in the form of computerised units connected to a master centre. This is far more preferable than the existing system of one or two retail&hyphen;style outlets dotted around the suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many, the mastering of a video machine is the high point of their electronic programming skills&mdash;I add myself to that. The thought of handing your personal business over to a mindless machine is out of the question. But surfing up and down the global electronic highway is not just for boffins today nor the young, who have grown up with this technology and simply take it for granted. It is not just a major way of doing business in the future; it is a way of doing business today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The separation of Medibank Private from the health commission and Medicare will allow the modernisation of both organisations. The closure of 40 of the 700 Medicare offices throughout Australia is the beginning of major changes to our claims system. Currently, trials are under way for electronic processing of claims which will give clients greater access to funds than in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under consideration and study is the installation of electronic touch screen terminals in doctors' offices and medical centres. The technology is available for Medicare claims to be made by telephone now. It is also available for computer generated machines, the same as those currently in use to pay rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the mall in the CBD of my own city of Brisbane, machines like ATMs are in place. On a regular basis you see people standing at the machine punching their information onto the touch screen and paying their rates to the council. They are paying on a direct line basis and are not bothering to walk two blocks 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> around the corner to draw their money out of a bank and either pay it by hand or write a cheque. The public is already aware of these changes and is using them in other areas of their business with other levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Major changes to our lifestyle sometimes are unsettling. But major technological advances have been taking place throughout our lives often without us even noticing. I ask you to consider the modest fountain pen. Because it was easy to pull apart and figure out, its introduction did not cause any social trauma. But it had a major effect on the way we conducted our lives. It replaced the messy inkwell which had chained mankind to a desk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the ability to assess documents and transfer funds by sticking a plastic card in a machine is a fact of modern life. We now carry out our banking using machines on street corners. This is not only local banking but involves national and international transactions. That Medicare claims will be assessed this way is not an if but very simply a when.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The separation of Medibank Private from the health commission and from Medicare will also set up this organisation, as I said earlier, for modernisation. Medibank Private will continue as a health fund. The only difference is that it will become a Commonwealth entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the health fund industry is in crisis is an understatement, as I said earlier. There are 45 funds in Australia, and only two of these are not for profit. Medibank Private is one. Combined, the 45 funds last year lost $81 million. The largest, HBA, lost a whacking $10 million alone. It is an indictment on the opposition that, until Labor when in government dropped incentives to the health funds, the funds were running at a profit. To those on the opposition benches who are concerned that the separation of Medibank Private could mean the possibility of privatisation of the fund, I would suggest they get their priorities right for a change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our first and major concern is to stop the bleeding and revive Medibank Private. After 13 years of neglect, that is what has to be done with Medibank. As I said earlier, during 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8493"> its time in government the Labor Party encouraged the drop in the membership of health funds from 64 per cent of the community to 34 per cent. That Paul Keating proudly announced that neither he nor his family had private health insurance was a clear signal that the Labor Party had no intention of saving or supporting the private health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, Medibank Private&mdash;just like all the other funds&mdash;has suffered from membership loss. The message I give to the people of my electorate is that, once membership of any fund goes below 25 per cent, it is all over rover. This government is determined to establish a viable health care system, and this bill is just one of the many ways to do that and one of the many changes being introduced to turn the health insurance system around before it is too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medibank Private is a health fund and will continue to provide competition in the industry. Severing its links with Medicare and the Health Insurance Commission will not alter its competitive neutrality. This government has already shown it supports Medicare and Medibank Private. By taking them both into the 21st century and preparing them for the change to the electronic technology of the future, we are confirming that support. I support the changes in this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill is an important one for the Howard government. The separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission&mdash;the HIC&mdash;will bring about a dual benefit. The first is by way of continued modest reform in our public health system and the second results from the government's commitment to improving competitive neutrality through its micro&hyphen;economic policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to separate Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission has widespread support throughout the community&mdash;from independent analysts and, as I understand it, from within the rank and file of the HIC itself. The decision to corporatise is also consistent with the findings in the 1997 report of the Productivity Commission&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">which I will abbreviate to PC&mdash;into private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The PC found that the relationship between Medibank Private and the HIC presented problems, both in terms of competitive neutrality and in transparency and accountability in the management of the health fund. Several submissions to the Productivity Commission noted that Medibank Private was now operational in all Australian states and territories and had grown to become the largest private health insurer in Australia, with around 1.9 million members since its inception in 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other health insurance providers commented that seed money provided to Medibank Private during its establishment had allowed the health insurer to more aggressively compete for market share in an ever shrinking market. The Australian Health Insurance Association revealed that successive federal governments had failed to claim interest on funds advanced for the establishment costs which, in effect, provided Medibank Private with&mdash;according to the PC&mdash;`a commercial advantage unavailable to all organisations with which it was competing'. So much for the claim by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that there was no cross&hyphen;subsidisation and never had been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission report found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of a dominant government owned insurer . . . leads to specific questions about competitive neutrality . . . Medibank Private shares its shopfronts with Medicare&mdash;and appears to derive significant market advantages unavailable to other insurers, from their co&hyphen;location.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For this reason, the PC recommended that the government consider separating Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission. Importantly, the PC qualified its recommendation and proposed that the decision to separate the two should be reserved until the findings of a Treasury review into competitive neutrality were handed down. That review was scheduled to be presented to the government in March of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presumably the taskforce was in agreement with the PC on the fate of Medibank Private, because we are here today debating the very issue. I say `presumably' because we do not know what the Treasury taskforce recom 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8494"> mended to the executive. The taskforce did make a report available to cabinet, but its findings have not been made public. It is a curious thing that Treasury's findings have been closeted, given the coalition's undertaking to promote competitive neutrality at every opportunity. Perhaps someone from the government can shed some light on why the report has not been made public and, indeed, whether the Treasurer (Mr Costello) intends to release it at all. If he does not, then the House deserves an explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As recently as 2 December of this year, the Treasurer reaffirmed the government's commitment to competitive neutrality as part of its overall policy to boost economic growth. In response to my question without notice about salary packaging in the Western Australian public sector, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where things can be done by the private sector, we encourage it to be done, for (the sake of) competitive neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The issue of competitive neutrality was addressed by Medibank Private in its own submission to the Productivity Commission. It was suggested that Medibank Private already operates on a competitively neutral basis with its competitors, but the submission also observed that minimal change would be necessary for it to meet every one of the competitive neutrality principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medibank Private purports to already essentially conform to the competitive neutrality guidelines, but at the same time it is inferred that health funds are not competing on equal terms under the current arrangements, and that this commonality could be achieved with a minimum of change. You cannot have it both ways; either competitive neutrality is present or it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the evidence in the case of Medibank Private suggests that there is a strong case for its separation from the HIC in the interests of competitive neutrality. The issue is not whether Medibank Private has benefited, either directly or indirectly, from its shared accommodation with the HIC but whether it has benefited at all. The Commonwealth's competitive neutrality policy statement suggests that no business activity `should enjoy net competitive advantages over their private 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sector competitors simply by virtue of public sector ownership.' That is premised on the notion that distortions in the allocation of resources can occur when governments use their legislative edge to their own advantage over private sector competitors. Efficiency and competitiveness in those cases are, of course, the big losers, particularly if market based mechanisms are not adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that Medibank Private recorded an operating loss of $33.7 million for the year 1995-96 after posting an operating surplus of $22.4 million the previous year merely reinforces what I have been saying. Medibank Private should be answerable to its fund members for its poor performances, rather than being cushioned by taxpayers' money from the outcomes of questionable market decisions. It is a luxury not afforded to any other rival health insurance provider and it should not be extended to Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few Australians appreciate the true cost of health care services, and most are keen to limit their contribution to the system wherever that is possible. The continued drop in private health insurance illustrates that very point. It is hard to imagine many taxpayers being impressed with the notion that their taxes are being used, at least in part, to buffer losses incurred by Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now generally agreed that our health insurance system is in dire straits, and our health care system generally is under great pressure. All the more reason for the government to divest itself of business enterprises that, in the first instance, have a distortional effect on the competitive process and, second, drain limited funds that could be better utilised elsewhere in the delivery of basic health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent study of health care policy in advanced democracies by Mr David Wilsford at the Institute for American Universities found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demand for high&hyphen;volume health care services of greater and greater sophistication is practically infinite. This demand confronts increasingly severe resource constraints as health care expenditures consume an even larger share of national income, rising in real terms faster than economic growth. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8495">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bottom line is that government resources are finite and our health care system is facing severe cost problems. Federal spending in Australian health care has increased by more than 20 per cent over the past five years in an attempt to keep pace with the ever increasing demands for `free' universal health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said during the debate on the  Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 that the government needed to take a holistic approach to reforming our health care system. Tackling the supply side of the problem without also focusing on demand will not see the reduction in the share of gross domestic product needed to pay for health care. Hence my earlier remark that the reforms contained in this bill should be championed only in so far as they are one part of a wider change in policy direction. The competitive neutrality statement sets out all those government business activities which should comply with the designated requirements. The Health Insurance Commission and its subsidiaries are included on that list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation strategy in the 1996 statement specified that a review of borrowing costs, ownership and operations of the HIC was to be conducted under the coalition government. The government should be given credit for following through with that commitment. Importantly, the strategy states that government businesses `can achieve success as a result of their own merits and intrinsic strengths, but not as a consequence of unfair advantages flowing from government ownership.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, Medibank Private has enjoyed considerable benefits from its co&hyphen;location with Medicare. The existence of a captive tenant arrangement and a captive client throughput were just two examples illustrated by the Australian Health Insurance Association in its submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill  suggests that the separation of Medibank Private from the HIC will not have any significant impact on Commonwealth revenue, but the budget papers outline the government's intention to spend more than $4 million over the next three years in its cam 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> paign to inform Australians about the implications of separation, as well as encouraging greater participation in private health insurance. While in the scheme of things $4 million does not seem to be much of a sum, in this time of thrift in government any expenditure on health care must bring about an improvement to the system, and it should be have been mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date all indicators suggest that the measures in this bill will correct other anomalies. Information provided to the Senate inquiry by the AHIA shows that Medibank Private has benefited from its relationship with the HIC by way of the cost sharing of audit fees, salaries, property, and plant and equipment. Again, that gives the lie to the assertion of the honourable member for Dobell that there is no subsidisation involved. According to the AHIA's figures, the HIC absorbed the cost of $13 million in salaries that should have been paid by Medibank Private in the 1994&hyphen;95 year alone. It is totally improper that Australian taxpayers should be subsidising Medibank Private salary costs via the Health Insurance Commission. The government is correct in making sure that this practice ceases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is likely that these amendments will have an impact on staffing levels at Medibank Private. The government has conceded, for example, that there will have to be changes in the corporate services department, because the HIC is currently served by this section. However, this bill is unlikely to bring about the wave of redundancies that the Community and Public Sector Union, the CPSU, would have us believe it will. The CPSU's submission to the Senate inquiry stated that the separation of Medibank Private from the HIC will reduce employment security for staff at both organisations. It argues that the separation will leave the two stand&hyphen;alone organisations more prone to external threats, and that together they:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . offer a more diversified range of operations and therefore opportunities to survive, if one of its component parts is threatened or attacked.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is an argument that shows a total lack of regard for the importance of promoting fair 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8496"> competition in the Australian health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some analysts have argued that the government has not gone far enough in its decision to corporatise Medibank Private and separate it from the Health Insurance Commission. They believe that it should, instead, have been sold off. However, the government never committed itself to that option. In his second reading speech the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) stated that the second part of this bill concerns itself with increasing the functions of the Health Insurance Commission. However, a closer inspection of the amendments shows that there will be no change to either the HIC's Medicare functions or its service delivery capacities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting the change to the HIC's spare capacity functions that will be brought about by this bill. Comparisons of the procedures and systems used to process medical transactions put the Health Insurance Commission ahead of comparable instrumentalities in all other OECD nations. The HIC currently processes individual transactions at a cost of $1.25 each, and this bill will provide for the possibility that the HIC sell its expertise to anyone interested in purchasing it. According to the minister's office, countries including Turkey and Indonesia have already expressed an interest in buying information like this. In terms of cementing our place as a provider of information technology to offshore markets, this measure could prove to be a good one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 8AA of the bill will also see changes to the HIC's additional functions. The explanatory memorandum sets out three categories of additional functions that will be affected, including those conferred under the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. Also, certain functions conferred by written determination of the minister and functions conferred by regulation will alter. The proposals will provide the HIC with the statutory authority to liaise with state health departments in the pursuit of administrative best practice. This is a positive amendment and one worthy of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final change to the Health Insurance Commission's functions relates to those things that are deemed to be `incidental or conducive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the performance' of the functions mentioned. While information on the specifics of this amendment is a little sketchy, I understand that it will provide for senior HIC staff to have access to credit facilities, including Cabcharge. It is difficult to comment on this provision, given the lack of detail, but I would like an assurance from the government that there are adequate checks and balances in the bill to ensure that these privileges cannot be abused sometime in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures contained in this legislation have not been watered down by the government. They are no less ambitious at their adoption than they were at conception. The coalition is right to adopt measures that rein in the spiralling costs in our health care system. However, cost cutting and patchwork measures will never compare with real reform. A Canadian researcher recently posed a question to the Canadian government. He asked, `Is this the future of health care: a string of unnecessary disasters before real reform?' The similarities between the Canadian and Australian health care systems suggest to me that this government should ask itself the same question.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With almost everything this government brings forward, one has to look for the hidden agenda. When we hear about protecting the most vulnerable, we look and see the changes to social security. When we hear about protecting the aged and getting more funding into aged residential services, we look to a budget cut of half a billion dollars. Every time the government says one thing, it is invariably doing something quite different. This is particularly pertinent in Medibank because in Medibank we have a replay, if you like, from more than 20 years ago when a previous Liberal Prime Minister promised the people before an election that Medibank would be maintained. Medibank, members will recall, was in fact a full medical and health insurance system instituted by a previous Labor government in the early 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Medibank that was to be maintained is what we are talking about today. This is the kind of symbolic Medibank from the 1970s, the one of which Malcolm Fraser said, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8497"> `Medibank will be maintained,' and what was maintained was the name&mdash;Medibank&mdash;as a private health fund; not as a total medical and hospital insurance system for all Australians but as an organisation called Medibank Private, which was another health fund but owned by the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a great deal of symbolism here today because we are seeing the next Liberal government, within their first year and a half, into Medibank again&mdash;22 years on, they are back at it again. Guess who is the Prime Minister? The person who was the Treasurer through the decimation of the original Medibank. The one who was in control of the finances of the Treasury and who probably led the charge in the then cabinet is now Prime Minister of the country and his government is back at Medibank yet again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last vestige of one of the world's best designed systems for health care, the original Medibank, is now being turned over yet again and, of course, we are being told that it is not to privatise it but simply to make it more rational or whatever. I find this very peculiar. One looks for the logic as to why it is so critical to do this and why it has to be corporatised and formed into a company but there really is no compelling argument at all unless there is a hidden agenda. The agenda is not very hidden. It is pretty open; it is pretty transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing will be replicated in the next few months&mdash;or for however long these people are in power&mdash;in Medicare itself so it is really quite fascinating to watch, if you like, a revisiting of the seventies on Medibank and a replay for Medicare. So, on one hand, the old original Medibank in name only and what is left of it&mdash;its vestiges&mdash;is now being finally dispatched effectively out of government control. There is no question that is what that is about. This is about eventually selling off the name Medibank. At least Malcolm Fraser kept the name and at least he kept it within public ownership. This lot are really preparing the way to even sell the name off as well. Not satisfied with destroying Medibank in the seventies, they are intent on actually getting rid of the name and public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ownership as well&mdash;and this is simply the first step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as this is happening, we are seeing complaints. We are all getting them&mdash;there is not a member in the House who would not have been approached in recent times by constituents concerned about bulk&hyphen;billing and about how Medicare is operating. It is all very well for government members to pontificate about what wonderful reforms they are making. The word `reform' means to make better. Change is not reform. Most of the changes that we are seeing are not reforms at all; they are regressive changes&mdash;they are going backwards&mdash;and those members know it because their constituents are telling them. The more they stand up in here and pretend that black is white and that white is black and that these are reforms and that these are progressive and improvements, the more their own constituencies will reject them and disown them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent weeks, a torrent of people has been coming forward on a range of issues and not least amongst them is Medicare itself. So we are seeing the vestiges of Medibank from the Whitlam government being prepared for final dispatch. They are finally getting rid of it all together, because remember: when this government came to power, it did not promise to keep Medibank&mdash;only Medicare. So the Fraser promise of `keeping' Medibank has been completed. This new Liberal government can now finish off what the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the then Prime Minister started back in the mid&hyphen;seventies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who thinks that this is not about privatisation of Medibank is simply kidding themselves. Anybody who thinks it is not also linked to a broader agenda about the role and nature of public enterprise in Australia is also kidding themselves. Some would have watched yesterday the formation of the so&hyphen;called Centrelink. We are watching the corporatisation of the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would not be a person in Australia who has not had an argument at some point in time with an Australian bureaucrat, myself included, but there are very few systems in the world that have been so durable and so effective in providing continuity of profes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8498"> sional advice and service to government, the parliament and the community. The concept of a professional bureaucrat has been a fundamental principle of Australian government and in fact Westminster government for a very long time. We are seeing the decimation of that concept and the institutions themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy of all this is that these institutions are more important than governments&mdash;not the bureaucrats themselves and not the jobs they do, but the institutions&mdash;because they have had the continuity, the consistency and the detachment to provide professional advice to governments of all political persuasions over very long periods of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The HIC and Medibank Private have effectively been an instrument or an arm of government. How strongly that is applied can be argued and can be varied. But, if you are going to decimate Medicare, first you have got to get rid of Medibank because that would otherwise be inconsistent. The thousand or so people who currently work for Medibank Private are public servants&mdash;they are employed by the government of Australia in one form or another. The government can say, `That will be fine&mdash;we will protect them; they can transfer forwards and backwards,' and we all know that will not be the case. They know it and we know it. The community might not understand that very well yet but it will come to understand it because that will certainly be the case as it has been with other organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transfer of so many of our public servants into corporate bodies such as the single service agencies&mdash;where it is management by a board and there is no accountability to the parliament&mdash;are very important changes that the public really should understand. This government is actually creating a public service that does not answer to the public via the parliament but answers to a minister via a board. One would expect, given the events of recent days, that all those board members would have already signed their resignation letters in advance before they would be appointed. In other words, what we are getting is government by ministers without accountability to the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this week we are seeing a minister justifying, on behalf of the government, people signing in advance a letter to resign indicates the particular board is not autonomous or sovereign in any form, so the idea that somehow they are creating a system that is objective and at arms&hyphen;length from government is in fact utter nonsense. It is a fraud on all of us because those board members have all signed the same letter, I guarantee, that the members of the CASA board have been asked to sign in recent days and one would assume that they have all signed. In other words, they have signed their own resignations in advance. If the minister does not like you, then you will resign as required and as requested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments seem quite innocuous. They seem pretty harmless; they are simply corporatising an existing public body which will stay in public ownership. In theory, legislation is required to do anything other than that. Firstly, why bother doing it if it is so innocuous? Why waste the parliament's time? The cost involved in this process will be quite significant. If it is so innocuous, why bother? What is the major benefit? Any benefits that will be obtained by this could be obtained without doing this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the staff involved warrant this government's confidence and support. People are employed to do a job. They act professionally and they carry out their work in good conscience. They deserve a bit better than what they are getting from this government. In the last 18 months virtually every public servant has been stigmatised as being untrustworthy, unreliable or tainted in some form. Let me tell you that they are leaving in droves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a call in my office this morning from a staff member working in one of the departments in Newcastle who is leaving in absolute despair. This morning she telephoned to say goodbye, to thank me for working with her over the years and to tell me that she could not take any more. They were her comments: she could not take any more. This woman has been a  tremendously good employee and has acted extremely professionally. We have argued with her often, but a very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8499"> professional public servant who has done a great job is leaving right now because she cannot take any more. That is a tragic indictment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am finding in all the departments is that all the corporate knowledge is going. All the experience and expertise is disappearing. What is happening out there in those departments is an absolute tragedy. I am also finding that mistakes are coming through. I know of a case where a man who became unemployed was told by social security that he was entitled to $8.54 a fortnight, and he had no income. We checked with the department and got them to go back and check through their records because it did not make any sense to us. There was a mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot blame the person who made the mistake because the fact is that they are all overloaded. They are administering rules that no-one understands. The guidelines are contradictory and are being worked out as they go along. They are understaffed and a lot of their most experienced people have gone. The people who are suffering are the people in the community who require services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medicare and Medibank are no different. We are going to see an exodus of staff as and when they can leave. Rather than be shunted, shifted and pushed around the way people are being, those who can leave will go when they can at their choosing rather than become victims. Some of those will be the very best people they have. They will get out when they choose. The services that will be offered will be scaled back. The complication between Medicare and Medibank will be exacerbated as the culture and the nature change. Guess who will suffer? The person who fronts up to make a claim or to pay a bill will find that people do not understand, or there is a mistake, or it is not what they thought it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While all this is happening, the real issue of health funding is being ignored. All this is basically a smokescreen. There is a hidden agenda, and the real issue of health insurance is being ignored. Some of us remember very well how in the last parliament the then health minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), tried desperately hard to get some bipartisan support for the concept of full 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> insurance, where the health funds and the hospitals would work together to give people 100 per cent coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of us recall how that legislation was passed with violent opposition from the then opposition. We are watching now in some bemusement as the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) tries ferociously to get that same system in place. Everything that we tried to negotiate in the previous parliament in terms of a better outcome for both the health funds and their members is now being revisited by a minister who comes from a party whose hands are not clean on this matter. Their violent opposition to it in the previous parliament sabotaged and virtually destroyed the potential for the whole system. Now he is blaming someone else. Now he is blaming the doctors or somebody else because they will not cooperate. The people who are not cooperating are the people that the current government encouraged and incited not to cooperate in the last parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the start, with this government you watch what they say and then look for the hidden agenda or the inverse. If they are talking about improving Medibank, watch out. If they are talking about improving service delivery, watch out. If they are talking about improving efficiency, watch out. What we are finding is that virtually all of those things are not reforms, they are regressions. We are now getting a worse service in almost every area. For all the lauding of their changes and their savings, we know who is paying. We know who is suffering. We know who is not benefiting, and that is the general public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of my constituents have suffered in one form or another, particularly in recent weeks. The changes that came in last Saturday are horrendous. The changes to nursing homes are absolutely mind&hyphen;boggling. People who are managing nursing homes are now required to give 28 days notice of fee changes. The new fees come in next week, and their residents do not know how much they are required to pay because the government has not yet told them. The departments have not yet told them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister comes and asks us for our support for amendments to this legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8500"> on the grounds that it is going to iron out some competitive advantages and disadvantages and create a more transparent system, a more arms-length system, we start asking: what is the government really trying to do; what is really going on here? The reasons become fairly clear. Firstly, it is finally going to get rid of Medibank altogether&mdash;the final guillotine, the final chop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us think back to the conservatives' view of Medibank when it was originally introduced and remember the anger and the hatred they had for it. Fraser said, `We will keep it,' and he kept the name. Well, we are finally going to get rid of the name. Twenty&hyphen;two years later they are finally going to get rid of the whole lot. Medibank will not be owned by the Australian public. It will become somebody else's. That really has great symbolism for people. I think the government is much more symbolic than actual in its approach. The reality tests that the government is having at the moment in a lot of these areas may make some government members wake up, because I have no doubt their offices are being besieged by their constituents, like mine is, with these matters. That is their hidden agenda on privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second agenda is the staffing. The aim is to get rid of as many public servants as possible in whatever form is possible and at whatever expense is required. Let me tell you: the payouts for some of our long-serving public servants have been enormous and have been quite wasteful. People did not want to leave, but the offers were too good to refuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will find similar things occurring as this legislation works its way through. When people are moved into the new system but then want to move elsewhere, they will be forced to be compensated in some form. Those who cannot&mdash;those who have less service&mdash;will be pushed around. Those with bargaining power will bargain; those who cannot bargain will have to cop it. We are talking about getting rid of another thousand. We will then see the Prime Minister up saying, `Another 1,000 public servants gone; isn't that terrific? It is another burden off the taxpayers.' What a load of rubbish! It is not a burden off the taxpayers; it is simply shift 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing another burden onto the taxpayers in another form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the blatant dishonesty of so much of the last 18 months comes together in what appear to be very obvious and very innocuous amendments. But, in a way, they symbolise so much of this government: the appearance defies the reality; the objectives are never clear; the outcomes invariably disadvantage normal people in the community; and, on top of all that, they then start boasting and bragging about what a wonderful thing they are doing on behalf of all of us. Some of us have been watching this for long enough to understand that it is not as simple as that. It is not done with mirrors or glib words. Eventually, governments have to perform and they are judged on their performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you: out there the community are now judging the government, and they are not judging the government's performance kindly. Government members know that because the panic in recent weeks since the parliament resumed back in August is now becoming pretty transparent. Until the government backbenchers start to stand up and be counted and demand activity of their ministers&mdash;as they did this week of the minister for aged services&mdash;we will see more legislation like this; we will see more of these deceptions and deceits that are being practised. These amendments are unnecessary, disruptive and destructive. They should be opposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think I have heard the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) already answer questions on this but, as the member for Dobell has asked about it, I will tell him again. The first criterion is that there be minimal disruption to the public. Therefore, a branch will be within 12 kilometres of

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will get to that in a moment. The second is the ability to redeploy staff and the third is the volume of face-to-face claims. That is all about whether there is a high volume of bulk-billing in a particular area. That is probably the greatest single contributing factor to the offices that are being closed. One is actually being closed in my own electorate, which members opposite might be interested to know, and I am certainly a member of the government. But I recognise that area as an area where there is a very high volume of bulk-billing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth criterion is the leasing arrangements; that is, the ability to terminate a lease, assignment or sublease. No branches are closing as a direct result of the separation of the HIC from Medibank Private. The good news for rural areas is that, within two months, we will have an extra 100 claiming facilities for rural Australians. This is another example of this government's commitment to rural Australia and, certainly, a great win for the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The question of the selling of Medibank Private has also been raised by opposition speakers. The government does not intend to sell Medibank Private. The member for Dobell asked for details on this matter; I can give him some details. The National Health Act 1953 has had a possible hole in it, which would allow the government to sell its interests in the fund while retaining Medibank Private as a hollow shell. This provision has been there for years, through Labor and Liberal governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A question from the member for Dobell to officers of the Health Insurance Commission and an adviser to the minister on 27 August raised the possibility of the income stream of Medibank Private being sold. After checking with the Health Insurance Commission, the minister subsequently was informed that the National Health Act 1953 allows for a fund to be merged with another authorised fund and makes no comment on the ability of a related transfer of compensation. It seems, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from legal advice, that it is possible to merge a fund with another and for the owner of that fund to pay for that merger. There is nothing new about this. That provision has been there for years. The government has decided that, because it has been there for such a long time, it is not necessary to make any change now. I repeat that the government has said that Medibank Private is not for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have been astounded that the opposition would come in here and talk about our privatisation record and what we might be going to do about this, because before the election we said we would not sell Medibank Private. We will stick to our word. Labor's record on privatisation is really quite different: they said that they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank and they did; they said they would not sell Qantas and they did. In contrast, this government went to the election saying that we would sell one-third of Telstra, and we have done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The opposition has also raised questions about this legislation risking higher premiums. Premiums will not increase as a result of this separation. There will be no cost impact at the macro level. Premiums did increase as a result of Labor's mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new CEO and board devoted to Medibank Private, for example, will obviously have cost implications. However, this will be managed within the total management expense budget. Net management expenses represent less than five per cent of the fund's total expenditure. Priorities will be assessed and costs will be examined by a board whose sole purpose is to run Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor spent years saying that Medibank Private does not enjoy a cost advantage, so I am now surprised to hear them say that costs will increase. The opposition really cannot have it both ways: they were either right then or they are right now. I do share with the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) a dislike of hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has raised the question of job security. The member for Jagajaga wants us to protect the job security of those in the Health Insurance Commission. We will do that by the very mechanism that the member for Jagajaga de 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8502"> plores&mdash;and that is compulsory staff transfers. Without this measure, the terms and conditions of staff cannot be protected. It provides visible certainty to staff regarding their terms and conditions of employment, including their mobility rights. The Health Insurance Commission has put administrative mechanisms in place to ensure that staff are consulted and that their preferences are taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On the question of additional costs to taxpayers, which once again the member for Jagajaga raised, she deplores the additional cost to taxpayers, including massive upheavals and replication of computer and information systems. Using technology is an ongoing process, requiring constant update and adaptation. Electronic claiming, for example, now accounts for over a quarter of the Health Insurance Commission's Medicare business. While the member for Jagajaga may wish to use pen and paper and queue with customers, the HIC is moving ahead into a more sophisticated method of service and delivery. Information systems will, as I mentioned earlier, include the 100 additional pharmacy claiming facilities in rural Australia as well as electronic and telephone claiming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The opposition has spent considerable time in this debate criticising the government about how it has managed its support for the private health industry. It is absolute hypocrisy for Labor to criticise this government on private health insurance policies and issues, given its record. Let me remind those present what the previous Labor government has done and why we have had such a mess which we are now dealing with: the previous Labor government abolished the federal contribution to the reinsurance scheme; the previous government cut the Medicare rebate for in-patient services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent; and the previous government abolished the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. These decisions alone led to a 40 per cent increase in private health premiums in just two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The old arguments have been trotted out about Medicare being under threat. It is not. But we know that a strong public sector needs a strong private sector, so the government is committed to that. I emphasise again that a lot of damage needs to be undone. The previous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor government either ignored or did not understand the significance of the private health sector. However, I know that at least one Labor health minister understood the problems and actually had the honesty to refer to them. I quote Graham Richardson when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor health ministers are not allowed to believe that the decline in private health insurance is anything other than a vote of confidence in medicare . . . they are also not allowed to believe that the public hospital system will ever find itself unable to cope with the influx of formerly insured citizens, which will one day create one hell of a problem.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government is now having to deal with that one hell of a problem, caused by Labor's refusal to deal with&mdash;or perhaps their woeful ignorance of&mdash;the relationship between the private and public sectors. When Labor came to power in 1984, over three in five Australians had private health cover. When Labor left office, it was barely one in three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are still dealing with that one hell of a problem that Graham Richardson identified; that is, less people are in private health insurance which has resulted in longer waiting lists in public hospitals. Labor ignored this problem and remained unresponsive to the desire of Australians to have a choice in their health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have inherited a Medicare system in trouble, jeopardised by the rising costs and the weakening of the private sector, which saw over one-quarter of Australians drop their private health cover during Labor's administration. But we are trying to fix it. We have been successful in containing the costs of Medicare while maintaining the bulk-billing rates. Medicare, after growing out of control under Labor, is slowing to a sustainable rate of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are trying to fix this mess left to us in the private sector through a number of means, notably the private health insurance incentives. Despite criticisms from the opposition, I am pleased to say that we are actually giving $450 to families to assist them with their private health insurance and $250 to pensioner couples. Yet the opposition would have us not provide that assistance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8503">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Premiums have gone up. They have gone up a lot more than we would have liked. The funds are still trying to cope with the legacies of Labor's attitude that private health insurance was unimportant. It is no wonder that so many young people now do not have private health insurance. There was a culture which was rampant particularly under the last government when the former Prime Minister and the then minister for health, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), were very publicly saying that you just did not need it because you could rely on Medicare. Of course, we know that the Medicare levy only brings in between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion a year, and Commonwealth expenditure is, of course, closer to $20 billion. So the problems we are having now have been a direct result of former government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer quickly to another couple of matters. This government supports competitive neutrality and is committed to that. Many in the private health insurance industry believe Medibank Private has an unfair advantage by virtue of its association with Medicare. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) covered this subject particularly well. While not supporting this view, the government sees value in removing any perception of unfair advantage. The administration arrangements between the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private are sound.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has claimed that there are winners and losers and that this bill will only produce losers. That is certainly not so. Staff of the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private will be the winners, with a tightly focused board of directors and a general manager devoting full attention to each. Staff will be part of a vibrant, focused organisation, whichever way they choose to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of Medibank Private will be winners. Those members will be part of a fund eager for new opportunities, employing new technology and a more flexible option of enhanced services. Members of other funds will also be winners because Medibank Private will continue to push and develop new service opportunities which will drive industry forward. I think that is a very important point. Of course, funds are now operating in an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment of support from the government which, as I have been at pains to point out to you, is very different from the contribution under the previous administration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As originally introduced, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) BIll had three major elements: clarification of advance pension payments, extinguishment of Commonwealth liability for the medical consequences of future smoking, and changes to repatriation benefits and clarification of defence declarations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government yesterday foreshadowed 28 pages of amendments regarding treatment benefits, fringe benefits and carers payments. Whilst many amendments arise from earlier bills, they come at the death knell a full three months after the bill's introduction, and this is obviously an unsatisfactory practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition endorses the change in regard to advance payments. It stems from the 1995 legislation that allows pensioners on modest means to have advance payments for the purposes of repairs to the home, equipment or travel. The measure is now liberalised to allow disability pensioners and war widows also to have access to these advance payments which must be repaid over a period of six months, the maximum payment being $500 or 13 times the person's fortnightly rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in regard to smoking, we support the change whereby, from 31 December this year, the future taking up of smoking or an increase in smoking will not be compensable for injuries, diseases and deaths where the only cause stems from the use of tobacco products. This comes in the context of wider 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8505"> knowledge of the dangers of smoking and the fact that the defence department has been smoke free since 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not be opposing these aspects because they are purely prospective in nature and do not reduce or eliminate a veteran's existing entitlement. Under the changes, the department will continue to provide automatic treatment benefits for veterans with cancer, as well as for PTSD and TB. It also appears unlikely that the changes will impact on disability pension claims in the immediate future. No savings have been included in the current forward estimates and ex&hyphen;service organisations have not criticised their introduction. Obviously, the actual implementation of the measures needs to be closely monitored lest it later produce any unanticipated adverse effects on veterans' entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major element of the bill deals with what has become known as overseas service anomalies. On behalf of the opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the Government for its confused, secretive and inconsistent handling of repatriation benefits and awards for overseas service;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> believes the Government should extend qualifying service status to personnel at RAAF Ubon Thailand from June 1965 to August 1968 and to RAN ships that served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan emergency; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recommends that the Government should restore entitlements to Vietnam naval logistical support personnel for the journey to and from Australia and Vietnam".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wish to consider, firstly, the nature of the government's review of overseas service anomalies. The coalition's 1996 platform promised to review all overseas service anomalies in respect of both military medals and access to repatriation benefits. It set up a joint Department of Veterans' Affairs and Department of Defence review and announced the resulting repatriation changes in the 1997 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disturbing to note that the review lacked any community representatives or public consultation. Its report has not been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> released to the public and its reasoning and the evidence that it relied upon have not been revealed. I wrote to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) on 26 June 1997 seeking a copy of the report. Three months later she has not even had the courtesy to reply to my request. This is sadly typical of her idiosyncratic approach to the portfolio and conventional government practice. She alone in the government has refused to allow the opposition an overall departmental briefing. All this is in stark contrast to the former Labor government's Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards&mdash;CIDDRA&mdash;which comprised community members with service experience, which consulted with ex&hyphen;service organisations and whose full report was published and publicly distributed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Neither the opposition nor the ex&hyphen;service community can be expected to simply accept blanket assurances that the review properly considered all identified anomalies and reached reasonable conclusions in this context. This is particularly the case, given Minister Bishop's bungling over double medalling, the First Lord of the Admiralty letters and the failure to gazette medal changes over many months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We naturally welcome the fact that the bill extends operational service benefits to many veterans. These benefits consist of disability pension entitlements and medical treatment for any disease or injury resulting from that overseas service, and access to defence service home loans for 11 groups. The groups include: the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan; the RAN personnel I speak of; RAAF personnel at Ubon and other ADF personnel in north&hyphen;east Thailand; service in the demilitarised zone of Korea; and various United Nations missions such as in Lebanon, Korea and the India&hyphen;Pakistan border.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides that disability pensions can be backdated to 13 May 1997 if the individual veteran applied by the middle of last month. Otherwise, an application can only be backdated three months. It is very much in the interests of the veterans concerned to make application even while the necessary legislation is still making its way through 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8506"> parliament. I would urge the government to better publicise the importance of early applications, given the government's studied indifference to the impact of its tardy actions in finalising this legislation. As I said, it was first introduced three months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Service pension rights are extended also to 80 embassy guards and RAAF evacuation personnel who remained in Vietnam after the withdrawal of ground forces and up until the end of the war, that is, between early January 1973 and the end of April 1975. The opposition is pleased to support this measure. Obviously, those involved would have incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy&mdash;the basic qualification for qualifying service in regard to service pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also clarifies the nexus between defence declarations and repatriation benefits eligibility through new classifications of warlike service and non&hyphen;warlike service. These will equate with the repatriation concepts of qualifying and operational service. When it becomes law, the Minister for Defence will be empowered to declare particular overseas service as being warlike or non&hyphen;warlike without the need for further amendments of the act to give servicemen rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is relevant to note that the ADF's current conditions of service manual <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indman</EMPHASIS> defines warlike operations as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those military activities where the application of force is authorised to pursue military objectives and there is an expectation of casualties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Non&hyphen;warlike operations are defined as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those military activities . . . where there is a risk associated with the assigned task <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">and where the application is limited to self&hyphen;defence.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These definitions strengthen the opposition's argument that the situation of RAAF personnel at Ubon and Royal Australian Navy FESR service were warlike in nature, as the personnel involved were not restricted to acting in self&hyphen;defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition endorses these changes and notes that the Defence classifications concerned were introduced under Labor. The recent experience of drawn out debates years later about the precise nature of veterans' overseas service, with semantic changes having potentially serious implications for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> individuals with dimmed memories many years later and increased problems of substantiation, and with the passage of the necessary legislation often subject to numerous potential delays, is obviously not an ideal situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that ADF personnel serving overseas are entitled to be clearly and speedily told what classification their service comes under and what their entitlements will be. We would insist that any changes in the operational environment be followed by appropriate changes in the classification of service. The government should also be able to legislate to extend coverage to other overseas service anomalies that might arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also introduces the phrase `assigned for service' as an alternative to the longstanding expression `allotted for service'. No definition is given for `assigned for service' and the change in terminology is not mentioned in the explanatory memorandum. Whilst there may be some unstated explanation for the change, there must be grave suspicions that it has been employed to soften the reality that, as recently as February this year, coalition ministers were asserting that the Royal Australian Navy Far East Strategic Reserve ships, which the bill now declares were assigned for service, were never allotted. As far as can be ascertained, the expressions have an identical meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's review severely downgraded veterans who served at Ubon, Thailand, during the Vietnam War and in RAN ships attached to the FESR during the Malayan Emergency. I would first like to canvass some of the issues and difficulties involved in making judgments about qualifying service or warlike service for service pension purposes. This pension was introduced for the likely adverse effects on veterans of theatre of war service. The most frequently cited instances are premature ageing and reduction of earning capacity. Both are encapsulated in the concept of the `burnt out digger'. Broadly speaking, access to service pension is usually restricted to persons who have rendered service against the enemy during a period of hostilities and have incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy, whereas disability pension is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8507"> available to a broader group that have experienced hazardous or peacekeeping service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accepted interpretation of the term `incurred danger' was made by the Full Bench of the Federal Court in the Thompson case in 1988. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The words `incurred danger' provide an objective, not a subjective test. A serviceman incurs danger when he encounters danger, is in danger or is endangered. He incurs danger from hostile forces when he is at risk or in peril of harm from hostile forces.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are two particular difficulties in objectively determining the degree of danger encountered in post&hyphen;World War II conflicts. Almost all such service has been in circumstances other than a declared war fought on traditional lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many of the situations covered by this bill our participation was contentious and in several cases owed more to the request of third parties&mdash;chiefly the United States&mdash;than to a formal invitation from the country concerned and, particularly during the Vietnam era, the true nature and military objective of our participation was not always truthfully conveyed to the Australian people. Conflict was more likely to involve sporadic, hit&hyphen;and&hyphen;run tactics and acts of sabotage involving small numbers of highly mobile opponents rather than traditional battles, and the identification of categories such as civilians, combatants and allied and hostile forces was often tenuous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern involves the relative difficulty of assessing the degree of danger facing naval personnel and air crew in circumstances that did not involve high technology battles along Battle of Britain or Battle of the Coral Sea lines. There is no foolproof formula that can be used to assess such different warlike or hazardous circumstances. There can only be reasoned judgment based on the available evidence. We are not convinced that the coalition government has done this in the two cases we cite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government argues that RAAF personnel were at Ubon, Thailand, from 1962 until 1968 pursuant to Australia's South East Asia Treaty Organisation treaty obligations and that their role was merely to guard Thai airspace. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The government insists that their activities were entirely separate from Australia's Vietnam involvement. Even in February, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a RAAF contingent based at Ubon in Thailand situated on the borders of Laos and Cambodia between 1962 and 1968.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were there pursuant to our arrangements and our obligations under SEATO and it was separate from our involvement with the Vietnam war.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was on 13 February this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RAAF personnel were despatched to Ubon in May 1962 as Australia's first bilateral military engagement in the region with the United States. There is no doubt that we were actually invited there by the United States for broader strategic reasons related to the situation in Indochina. The official Thai invitation was a diplomatic pretence along identical lines to our subsequent entry into the Vietnam War two months later. As far as the Americans were concerned, Ubon's strategic location was the central issue&mdash;it being only 50 kilometres from the Laos border, 80 kilometres from Cambodia, close to the Mekong River and 200 kilometres from the Ho Chi Minh trail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until 1965, Ubon personnel were basically engaged in a schedule of routine training. Whilst they had permission to use force in self&hyphen;defence and in the air defence of Thailand, they were not required to do so. During this period their rules of engagement stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That no aircraft will be directed to investigate any identified contacts unless specifically requested by the Royal Thai government and, secondly, that no aircraft will attack unless fired upon.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We accept that service at Ubon during this early period was not qualifying service. We emphatically reject, however, the argument that the above rules of engagement, quoted by Minister Bishop in February, were those that applied to the Royal Australian Air Force's final three years there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following apparent Chinese air assistance to North Vietnam, the United States decided in 1965 to escalate operations at Ubon. A fully integrated Royal Thai Air Force and United States Air Force Air Defence System 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8508"> was established under effective US control. Under this system, RAAF personnel No. 79 Squadron came under the effective control of the US 2nd Air Division Task Operations centre. From 25 June 1965, the Alert Status of that squadron was altered to place two aircraft at `alert 5 status' seven days a week with aircraft to be armed with 30&hyphen;millimetre cannon and Sidewinder air&hyphen;to&hyphen;air missiles.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An aircraft commits a hostile act when it conducts unauthorised aerial reconnaissance or combat tactics within the national boundary of Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Certainly, RAAF personnel at Ubon were to be employed only within Thailand's boundaries. However, in all other respects, from June 1965, their rules of engagement authorised them to take action to destroy enemy aircraft engaged in broadly defined hostile acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their effective role was to be responsible for the air defence of Ubon, which the US used as the Thai base for their massive, 24 hours a day Operation Rolling Thunder bombing campaign against North Vietnam and Laos. The RAAF role included patrolling Thai territory regarding border helicopter activity and ground arm caches. From late 1966, RAAF Airfield Defence Guards were also involved in providing physical base security due to local insurgent activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Published Australian and unpublished US records regarding Ubon have been consulted. We have also been provided with statutory declarations by RAAF officers who served 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there. From this material, extensive reported enemy activity directed at Ubon which entailed danger to Australian personnel included many instances. For example: a guerilla attack on the US radar unit in May 1965; a Thai helicopter being shot down in May 1967; a USAF C130 was hit by ground fire during its approach to land in 1968; combat experienced US air crew reported 12 separate cases of muzzle flashes; an enemy MiG 21 was identified and chased by two RAAF Sabres&mdash;et cetera, ad nauseam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 3 January 1968, Pilot Officer L. J. McGrath was killed near Ubon. According to the then RAAF Officer Commanding at Ubon, `The cause of the crash was not established although insurgent action cannot be discounted.' We hold specific references from official sources on these incidents. Based on this material, and in the absence of any credible coalition material against the claims by the servicemen, we have come to accept that RAAF personnel at Ubon were de facto participants in the Vietnam War from June 1965 until withdrawal in August 1968.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst they were ordered to stay in Thai airspace and did not directly participate in the United States bombing raids into Laos and North Vietnam, the rules of engagement they operated under from June 1965 were warlike in nature and they were not restricted to acting in self&hyphen;defence. They faced a degree of danger from hostile forces; chiefly infiltrators from nearby Laos. Ubon RAAF personnel performed much the same role as RAAF personnel did in Vietnam itself. In neither case were there direct enemy attacks on allied air bases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Archival material indicates that Australian authorities considered granting them repatriation benefits on a number of occasions. This culminated in the June 1967 suggestion that Ubon should be subject to special legislation. This did not occur before the RAAF's withdrawal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second anomaly that our amendment addresses concerns naval personnel who served in Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan emergency. This is a longstanding grievance that has dragged on for the best part of 40 years. It reflects no credit on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8509"> successive governments. There have been three traditional arguments used to justify their exclusion from repatriation benefits&mdash;namely, that the RAN personnel were allegedly never `allotted to duty', they were `not subject to military law' and they did not incur additional `operational risk'. Whilst I will touch on each of these arguments, I would observe that, with the budget announcement granting them access to disability pension, the coalition has implicitly abandoned the arguments regarding `allotted for duty' and `not subject to military law'. However, it appears to be still maintaining the argument that they did not incur sufficient additional operational risk to justify the service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears clear to us that the Royal Australian Navy ships concerned were originally allotted for duty in 1955. According to a letter to Treasury from the Secretary of the Navy on 11 November 1955:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The date on which RAN Ships were allotted for duty as the RAN component of the Strategic Reserve was 1 July 1955.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Similarly, on 4 August 1955, the Minister for Navy and Army stated in a minute to Prime Minister Menzies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Naval Board recommends also the RAN personnel be granted the benefit of cover under the Repatriation Act and be eligible for whatever taxation concessions and other general benefits, not associated with living costs, as are granted to the Army and the RAAF personnel.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This request was never granted. However, Army and RAAF personnel who saw service during the Malayan Emergency qualified for a campaign medal, the Returned from Active Service Badge, and were eligible for full repatriation benefits, including the service pension and War Service Home Loans. They also received generous allowances and income tax concessions denied to the RAN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest budget decision acknowledges that these personnel were on operational service. In doing so, the government must also acknowledge that they were `allotted for duty', even though senior coalition figures, such as Senator Newman, were denying this as recently as February. To soften its change of position, the government actually uses the phrase, `assigned for duty' in the bill, but the two phrases have identical meanings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second traditional argument in support of denying repatriation benefits to these people was that the RAN personnel were not `under military law'. However, section 5 of the Defence Act reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act shall apply, subject to the provisions of the Naval Defence Act 1910&hyphen;1949 and the Air Force Act 1923&hyphen;1950 to, and in relation to, all the Naval, Military and Air Forces of the Commonwealth and to all members thereof whether appointed enlisted or deemed to be enlisted under this Act or under any other Act.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That being the case, I would ask which part of the act removes the naval force from being subject to section 4? Senator Newman claimed on 14 May that the RAN forces were subject to the Naval Discipline Act and not to military law. The evidence that she presented was a letter from the chairman of the Repatriation Commission to the secretary of the Prime Minister's department in response to a request dated 20 March 1953 to define properly the description of Australian operations in Malaysia. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The secretary, Attorney&hyphen;General's department has brought his description into conformity with the proclamation made under Section 4 of the Defence Act, declaring Australian Military Forces in Malaya to be on active Service. This declaration, which relates only to Army Forces, was made primarily for the purpose of the application of certain provisions of military law to Army personnel serving in Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If these provisions only related to the Army personnel in Malaya, this does not explain how the RAAF forces in Malaya qualified for recognition. Both Army and RAAF personnel who served during the Malayan emergency received the GSM clasp Malaya and repatriation coverage. The opposition does not consider that the veterans concerned should be denied benefits due to semantic wording problems and highly dubious arguments about the applicability of military law. In support of this, I note that the Veterans' Entitlements Act does not include a definition of, or impose requirements regarding, military law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third and only remaining argument is that the navy personnel who served with the strategic reserve are not considered by the coalition to have been subject to sufficient `additional operational risk' to justify the grant of the service pension. Senator New 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8510"> man, for example, stated in the Senate on 5 February:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Service by RAN personnel in Navy ships attached to the FESR was specifically excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits, on the basis that the enemy did not have the capability to threaten naval vessels, while it did have an offensive capability against forces ashore.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This echoes a statement by Dr Donald Cameron, then coalition federal Minister for Health, who said as far back as 1956:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are not regarded as being subjected to additional operational risks. They are subjected to the risks of service for which they engage, and therefore their conditions are in accordance with the terms of enlistment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The accepted basis for qualifying service for the service pension is that the person rendered service against the enemy during a period of hostilities and that the person incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy. The concepts of danger and operational risk are not defined in the act but, as previously mentioned, were defined by the full bench of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v. Thompson in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty with regard to the Malayan emergency and other guerilla conflicts is that the enemy was more often than not concealed and was, to a degree, unidentifiable. In such a context, danger to ADF personnel often stemmed from civilians, including children. Government apologists have also argued that, because the enemy in this conflict had no substantial naval capacity and did not possess surface to sea missiles, there was no perceived additional threat. However, archival evidence suggests that the naval personnel actually engaged in warlike operations and experienced a degree of danger from hostile forces of the enemy. They were not restricted to acting in self&hyphen;defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operations that these RAN personnel assumed in Malaya were clearly beyond peacetime demands. The primary role, as laid down in the general directive, was to secure and to defend the sea lanes and coastline of Malaya. The secondary role was to participate in operations against communist forces. Actual operations included escorting land troops through the harbour, which was allegedly mined; enforcing a blockade of enemy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> positions; preventing infiltration by the enemy; bombardment of communist positions; general supportive functions for other Australian and Commonwealth personnel; and protection of merchant shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the enemy did not have its own navy or possess surface to sea missiles, it is equally true that they lacked an air force or surface to air missiles. This was not seen as a reason to deny qualifying service benefits to other services, which qualified after only 24 hours service in an operational area. The additional operational risk faced by the RAN personnel is obvious and should be recognised. This very week, the coalition member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) told the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The navy's contribution to the achievements of the reserve is highly regarded in the annals of history. They were an effective blockade and a powerful deterrent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is strange that their highly regarded contribution is not seen by the coalition to warrant the appropriate recognition of access to the service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original decision to exclude the RAN personnel from repatriation benefits in 1956 was essentially based on economic considerations. Every excuse in the book cannot change this. The unexpected expense of the Malayan emergency caused a shortage of funds, and the purpose of excluding RAN personnel was simply to save money. In a secret letter from the Prime Minister's department to the Deputy High Commissioner of the United Kingdom on 25 November 1955, the government stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian offer . . . of 2nd September represented a large increase in the financial commitments which Australia envisaged when the formation of the Strategic Reserve was originally considered . . . this commitment will be further substantially increased at a time when Australia is facing balance of payments difficulties and has had to increase restrictions on imports . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The RAN played a vital supportive role in the emergency, under a very present potential enemy threat. Of the four conflicts involving ADF personnel during the 1950s and 1960s, navy personnel who served during the Malayan emergency are the only ones to be denied equity, comparative treatment and recognition through full veterans' entitlements. The reason 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8511"> is not because of allotment, operational risk or military law. The rationale is economic and political. The opposition's amendment seeks to remedy this injustice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with considerable interest to the speech of the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). I believe that he has made some very good points. No doubt the points he made were made on advice from various ex&hyphen;service personnel and ex&hyphen;service organisations. I am sure that when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) responds in due course he will quite correctly deal in detail with a number of the matters that the member for Reid raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think, however, that it is slightly disingenuous of the member to move an amendment which states, in part, that the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">condemns the Government for its confused, secretive and inconsistent handling of repatriation benefits and awards for overseas service . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the contrary, and as the member for Reid's speech clearly indicates, these are complex matters&mdash;matters which are not resolved easily. That was the case with the previous government, which certainly had some excellent ministers for veterans' affairs. I pay credit to them. Ben Humphreys and Con Sciacca, who were the ministers in our first two terms in the parliament, were excellent ministers. I do not think it is entirely fair&mdash;not that this place is about fairness&mdash;to move an amendment which condemns the government for things that are just not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present minister's handling of these matters has not been confused, secretive or inconsistent. The government has taken many steps to honour its pre&hyphen;election commitments on veterans' benefits. Since the election this government has clearly demonstrated that it has a very strong commitment to veterans' affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the minister makes the point very strongly in his second reading speech 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we, on this side of the House&mdash;indeed, in this parliament&mdash;understand that, by virtue of Anzac Day and other commemorations, we need to pay our greatest respects as a nation to those who gave their lives in the service of this country and to be concerned that those who served and survived have their interests safeguarded. This is particularly true of older veterans whose needs, by virtue of their ageing, are tending to increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election, the government promised a review of repatriation entitlements. We, in opposition, had been critical to some extent of some of the decisions taken by the former government, as they are now being critical of us. That demonstrated not only the complexity of these issues but also the fact that in making decisions you have to keep in mind the basic element of fairness and make sure that there is a reasonable differentiation in service which entitled service personnel to particular benefits if they were placed at a level of risk. Those who had served at the highest level of service, if you like, obviously had a full entitlement to a wide range of benefits. Those who had served in a lesser sense nevertheless had to have that level of service and that degree of risk recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will always be degrees of debate about where those lines should be drawn. I believe that this government, since it came to office, has demonstrated very clearly its total integrity in the handling of veterans' matters, and we will continue to do so. I know that there is a good degree of bipartisanship in this parliament on the issue of veterans' affairs, as there should be. We should not allow our veterans to be used as political footballs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will never be able to keep everybody happy. As the member for Reid said, in a sense there are financial restrictions and ramifications. There are obviously budgetary constraints in every portfolio. The government came into office faced with a huge economic problem and has had to go about solving that problem in the interests of all Australians. But I believe our commitment to veterans is not a matter that can be questioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On election to government, we implemented our promise to review repatriation entitlements. After the election, the Department of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8512"> Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence jointly conducted a study entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of service entitlement anomalies</EMPHASIS>, which was submitted to cabinet. The legislation which we are dealing with today deals with some of the recommendations that were made in that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the report is actually entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of service entitlement anomalies</EMPHASIS>, because that is where there are these grey areas. Indeed, in his amendment, the member for Reid addresses some of those areas of service which have been difficult, based on the fairness test to determine whether in fact they represented the level of service that was required for recognition. The member's amendment deals with a couple of particular matters. There are other matters which are contentious, but it deals specifically with the RAAF at Ubon in Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech, the member for Reid made a very good case for why consideration should be given to that particular matter. However, at the moment the government's position has been that qualifying service entitlements should not be extended to personnel who served there. That is not necessarily the end of the matter and, as I said, the member for Reid made a useful contribution and, indeed, gave a rationale for why perhaps further consideration should be given to that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that the member for Reid raises in his amendment deals with the Far East Strategic Reserve. At the moment, the government's position on that is that RAN personnel did not incur danger from the enemy as a result of that particular service. But, having said that, that matter is still under active consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that the member for Reid has raised in his amendment deals with a recommendation that the government should restore entitlements to Vietnam naval logistics support personnel for the journey to and from Australia and Vietnam. I am sure the minister, when he responds, will be able to confirm the situation, but let me foreshadow his response by saying that my understanding is that the government is already moving to restore that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so&hyphen;called port to port coverage for Vietnam naval logistics support personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that the member for Reid in his speech gave the government the credit which it deserves, but let us be under no misapprehension that the amendments that are included in this legislation are comprehensive and of substantial benefit to a very large number of veterans. In fact, as a result of this particular legislation, 10,500 veterans, at a cost of $19.4 million over four years, will become eligible for compensation for injuries or diseases resulting from their service in the Australian Defence Force.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. In the near future the government will be releasing a draft request for tender document for the first cluster of government agencies' information technology outsourcing. As part of the tender process, the government will require vendors to propose and to commit contractually to industry development initiatives. We will be using our purchasing power and the size of our business to support the growth and development of the Australian technology and telecommunications industries, to promote the international competitiveness of those industries and to create growth, employment and development in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's IT and T industries are vital to the economic development of this country because of their growth potential and their potential to contribute to the competitiveness of businesses in all other areas of the economy. At present the Australian IT and T industries are focused on a domestic market that is small in global terms. There is a need to build on the inherent strengths of the Australian industry. Those strengths include a number of innovative local firms, particularly small and medium enterprises, and also a considerable skills base in the software area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wishes to develop this local industry to ensure that it is successful regionally and in global markets. The aggregation of the Commonwealth agencies' IT and T requirements into clusters will deliver a series of large long&hyphen;term contracts to the private sector. The Commonwealth will require from successful tenderers a series of commitments that are commercially sensible and sustainable and that contribute to the growth and the globalisation of the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8515"> IT and T industries. Tenders will not be accepted from multinational companies alone. Multinationals will be required to partnership with Australian small and medium enterprises, Australian small and medium IT companies. The partnerships will be required to show what other Australian and international business will be conducted by those partnerships, and the tenderers must also show what Australian products and services will be used in the delivery of the contract and what jobs will be created, particularly in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, we want jobs, particularly in regional Australia, and we want exports. We are getting the government out of non&hyphen;core business and we are building the industry. We will be seeking from tenderers what commitments they will make to industry development and what sanctions they will propose if they fail to honour those commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to outsource its information technology requirements and our commitment to using the size of the business to promote industry development presents a considerable opportunity for the Australian IT and T industry.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. There is no doubt that schools and parents want to help their young people get jobs. For a year now I have been suggesting that schools should extend their role to become job placement agencies for their school leavers to help them get employment. Today I am delighted to announce that, under the government's jobs pathway program, 73 schools have successfully tendered to provide employment placement and support for their school leavers both as individual brokers and as members of consortia. The schools, of course, receive extra money to do this job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first tender round last year members may remember that only two schools tendered successfully. Those schools had over 100 per cent success rates and I am pleased to say both of those schools have successfully tendered again. They have been joined by 71 other schools in this important development. In addition, 50 other agencies have successfully tendered to provide services to school leavers. In all, this program will assist over 10,000 school leavers to get jobs in the coming year and encourage another 10,000 students to remain on at school and build up their skills. Over 1,100 schools, almost half of the high schools in Australia, will be able to participate. The revolution in schooling in Australia is now under way and there is no turning back. In fact, I believe Australian schools are school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one disappointing feature of this tender round. Of the 73 schools that successfully tendered, only one was in New South Wales. The reason why there was only one school that successfully tendered as a broker in New South Wales is that the New 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8516"> South Wales Carr Labor government banned its schools from tendering. The Carr government told New South Wales school principals that they must not tender for a Commonwealth program designed to get school leavers jobs. Schools in every other state and territory were permitted by their governments to tender.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Carr government capitulated to the unions in that state on the issue of employment of school leavers, just as it has on literacy, just as it has on school reporting and just as it has on school reform generally. I believe that government will be condemned by every parent in New South Wales for its arrogant disregard of the interests of school leavers in that state. Their behaviour is disgraceful. I would say that the Carr government, with this sort of decision, is not fit for public office. It is playing politics with the lives of young people in New South Wales and parents will make their views known about this government at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to say whether he will raise this matter with the Carr government, whether he will stand up for the rights of young people in New South Wales to get assistance to get employment when they leave school or whether, as on literacy, he will sit back and do nothing, offer no leadership and confirm, once again, that the Labor Party has no commitment to getting jobs for young Australians.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The government has moved to restore a proper balance between the family and skilled streams of the immigration program. Could the minister inform the House what is being done to ensure Australia gains the maximum benefit from the skilled categories?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8516" SPEAKER="Ruddock, Philip, MP" NAMEID="0J4" ELECTORATE="Berowra" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Immigration and Multicultural Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Of course, the skilled category was one that had been marginalised under the former government. When we came to office I think less than 30 per cent of available places were in the skilled program. We have been moving to address that very considerable problem that we inherited. It was a result of, I think, deliberate policy that we saw a very significant increase in the number of people who were applying for skilled migration to Australia, and an unwillingness to process them expeditiously and appropriately. We saw the maintenance of low pass marks for those who were applying in the late 1990s. Low pass marks were maintained over most of that period and, of course, with a low level of skill people were able to enter Australia but they were not necessarily able to contribute significantly to the growth of our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw a situation as well where the former government set up a priority occupation list which was designed, I think, to ensure that those people who were coming were more likely to have skills that were going to be beneficial to Australia. But in their latter years no particular occupations were nominated for that priority occupation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8517"> list. We have been actively addressing this question. We have increased emphasis on English language ability in the points testing arrangements. That is important because research has shown that English language skills are one of the most important factors in obtaining employment in Australia. In other words, if people come without English language skills they are more likely to be unemployed after arrival than able to find employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will shortly be finalising an external reference group that will be assisting my department in relation to a review of the points test system. What we know of the points test system is that it is not sufficiently well targeted to ensure that people who do enter Australia with recognised skills&mdash;with English language competency&mdash;at an appropriately young age are necessarily going to be able to obtain employment when they arrive. We have situations, which are well known around Sydney, where very highly qualified people are often forced to drive taxis because the skills that they have are not in occupations where they can be readily used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we do want to see the points test more carefully targeted. We do want to see that those people who will come to Australia and who will not be eligible to obtain social security benefits are not misled into believing that if they are able to access Australia through a points system that is drawn in general terms and not able to get benefits they have been let down in some way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this review we are looking to see whether there are other steps that should be taken to more carefully target skills to produce the national benefit. This will supplement the other initiatives that I have already announced and dealt with: the review of the employer nomination scheme, which has made it more responsive to the need of Australian employers, the skill matching scheme for employers in regional areas to assist them in filling vacancies that cannot be filled locally and, of course, the active promotion, which we are involved in, of the regional sponsored migration scheme so that employers outside major capitals can get the skills that they need to keep their businesses running. A skills 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> program which is carefully targeted benefits Australia greatly. We are about ensuring that the program that we are managing delivers those results for Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I am pleased to inform the member for Hinkler that medication reviews will now be available to at risk veterans in his own electorate. The first pharmacist accredited to provide this service in Australia is, in fact, in Bundaberg in the federal electorate of Hinkler. She was signed up only yesterday. I am sure that when the member goes back to his electorate he is going to be making sure that there is a little bit of publicity about the fact that a pharmacist in his electorate in his own home town is the first accredited in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Veterans identified by their local doctors as being at risk of medication misadventure can be referred to this pharmacist for a compre

The review identifies existing and potential problems with the veteran's medication and provides, importantly, ongoing monitoring of the veteran's use of medication. The aim of the program is to ensure that veterans receive the best results they can from the medication that they use. With the administrative arrangements for the program now in place with the department, the department has invited accredited pharmacists to sign a deed of agreement and, in so doing, make the service available to at risk veterans throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from the trial that was conducted last year that this program can produce outstanding results. In one example, a veteran involved in the trial had his required number of medications reduced from 19 to 14. In his case they were identified as duplication of medication, confusion over some of the medication that he was prescribed to take and others counterbalancing some of the drugs that had been prescribed. This is just one program that identifies how this government is encouraging an expanded relationship between the Department of Veterans' Affairs, doctors, pharmacists and other health care providers in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge all members of this House to encourage pharmacists in their own electorates to participate in this program because I think we all agree that this nation owes a great deal to our veteran community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the points the honourable member raises, first of all, the reports, which have been drawn to my attention, which were run on the ABC this morning are in fact misleading. It is true that the Royal Australian Air Force has been ferrying much needed supplies to affected areas of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, but I emphasise that these are areas very much in need&mdash;not because the Ok Tedi mine just happens to be in the Western Province. This Australian cooperation, let me add, was requested by Papua New Guinea's Minister for Provincial and Local Government Affairs. So to say or suggest that the Australian government is somehow focusing on the area around the Ok Tedi mine because of some sinister relationship between the Australian government and the Ok Tedi mine is, frankly, completely misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also not true that the Royal Australian Air Force is only bringing supplies to the township of Tabubil where the Ok Tedi mine is located. Today, the RAAF will deliver essential medical supplies, food and fuel to Kiunga, a township some distance from Ok Tedi&mdash;I understand about 100 kilometres away&mdash;in Western Province. Essential supplies will be delivered to enable schools and aid posts to remain open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's High Commissioner to Port Moresby will today visit the drought affected areas on this RAAF flight. In addition, an officer of Emergency Management Australia is now in Port Moresby to assist the national disaster emergency service with coordination and development of action plans. It is essential that our aid help, not hinder, Papua New Guinea's capacity to cope now and in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the second point the honourable member raises about the private sector 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8520"> giving assistance, I am aware that a number of companies, including BHP, have taken action to provide logistical support.

<ANSWER PAGE="8520" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Workplace Relations and Small Business" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I did not write that&mdash;I certainly did not write that last bit&mdash;but what an excellent question it was. What an excellent point the member makes. I do a lot of breakfasts, lunches and dinners with people in the small business community and they talk to me about interest rates. When you look at interest rates today, you will see that they are as low as they were when man walked on the moon. What a tremendous turnaround we have seen with better economic management under this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only five or six years ago that the small business community in Australia had interest rates of 22 per cent, 23 per cent and 24 per cent. It is no wonder so many small businesses even today are doing it tough as a result of the legacy of the Labor government. Small business should never forget that it was the previous Labor government that introduced taxes, red tape, the burdens and the unfair dismissal laws which have been such a major problem to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the member for his excellent question. He is right: the ABS put out some figures today. Whilst some small businesses are doing it tough, it is also important to say to small business that there are a few bright signs on the horizon, that there are a few positives out there. I am a great believer in saying that a bit of confidence is very good for encouraging confidence generally in the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day we saw in the Westpac&hyphen;Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment that confidence was up 4.2 per cent in September, which is good news for small business because consumers are feeling better. We also have had this survey on expectations, and it is quite important because if you look at the ABS you see it says that this means that the results can be used indicatively in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8521"> terms of expected future levels of economic activity and for providing early signals about turning points in the economy. So it does give you a bit of a feeling for where the economy is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very useful signs in this figure. For example, if you look at trading performance and the medium-term expectations of sales, you see a figure of 4.4 per cent for profits for small business, which is up. You will see the figure of 22.9 per cent, which is a very encouraging figure&mdash;a real push&hyphen;along on the profits side. If you look at profits again, you see that it is described somewhere in the document as a fairly significant increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This survey is based on 3,000 representative Australian businesses. It tells you that there is a growing confidence within the small business community. That is good for everybody. It is certainly good for small business and it is certainly good for job prospects in the future.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought the terms of reference were adequate and that, if the Auditor-General thinks that in some way the terms of reference are constraining his investigation, he will ask me to expand them. I am not going to initiate at this stage an expansion. The whole process that we have embarked upon has an unprecedented transparency compared with the sorts of processes that you lot adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is that, if the Auditor-General, in whom I would hope members on both sides of the House have great confidence, believes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the terms of reference in some way constrain a proper investigation of the matter, I have little doubt that he, like other interlocutors appointed by governments of all persuasions at a state and federal level over the years, will come back and ask for an expansion of those terms of reference. That is the answer to the first part of the Leader of the Opposition's question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the Leader of the Opposition's question, when he alleged&mdash;I must do him justice&mdash;that expenses in one year were higher than in another, reminds me of a piece of information that came to my attention this morning. That piece of information says that in the financial year 1996-97&mdash;my government's first full year in office&mdash;the total expenditure on travel related expenses for ministers and parliamentary secretaries was $812,829 less than the Keating Labor government's expenditure in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say that it gets a little better. This is all meant to be about a prudent use of the taxpayer's money. This is all meant to be about whether you have overspent the dollars of the Australian taxpayer. That is what this is all meant to represent. I suppose that is hardly surprising, given the attitude to travel allowances adopted by the man whose name was left behind on the last Labor government in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say that the comparison that I have just mentioned to the House represents a saving of 14 per cent in relation to the travel related expenses for ministers and parliamentary secretaries, and I have also been informed that the travel bill for the Keating government's last eight months in office was even higher than my government's first full financial year. In eight months they spent $100,000 more than in my government's first full financial year on travel related expenses for ministers and parliamentary secretaries. To use the old expression, they not only have the largest snouts but built the trough.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Is the member for Burke cruelly misleading cane growers when he says maintenance of the tariff will be of benefit to them?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say at the outset that, if there is one thing to be said about the member for Page, it is that he understands the sugar industry a great deal better than the shadow minister for primary industries. Somebody said, `That's not hard.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Page is absolutely right. The customs duty on imports of sugar last year was about 700 bucks. That is how much came in. Almost nothing; it was almost negligible. A little over $700 is all it was. Almost no sugar came in last year. And he is absolutely right. The retention of the tariff would not yield returns to Australian producers because the price is established by the Queensland Sugar Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke, who in this instance can be described only as a cheapjack opportunist, really needs to be confronted with a very simple reality, and that is that no&hyphen;one in this place and no&hyphen;one outside believes anything other than, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in its editorial pointed out, had the Labor Party retained government, they would have abolished the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reality. It is as simple as that. Why? Because they set up the competition policy&mdash;which they said was going to be the great saviour of Australian jobs and of rural and regional Australia&mdash;under which the review was conducted and under which this recommendation was made. So they are a bunch of total and absolute hypocrites on this issue, as well as being people who do not understand the sugar industry. They miss out on both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite simple. They have walked away from virtually everything they said they believed in in government, and now they have walked away from competition policy as well. They have walked away from that mainstay of their commitment to economic reform in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are the people who are securing the future for rural Australia. It is this side of the House that is securing the future for sugar farmers and for the rest of the nation's farmers. It is we who tackle this nation's major problems in terms of interest rates and an overvalued dollar. ABARE's research shows that that is delivering far more tangible benefits for the sugar industry than anything that you delivered or might deliver. You take them back the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And it is not only that; it is packages like the AAA package which the Prime Minister and I recently launched. That has been universally recognised in rural Australia as being focused, well targeted and the best thought&hyphen;out policy approach for rural Australia for decades. It is we who are providing such important programs as a communications upgrade approach for rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point that I cannot help making&mdash;it is a vitally important one&mdash;is that the sugar industry is an export industry, and it is this side that is tackling waterfront reform. You are the people who are identifying with those who want to block it. You want to look after the privileged few at the expense of Australia's exporters, including our sugar exporters and the jobs that depend on them. The best my opposite number can come up with: he was out on my local radio station the other day giving his imprimatur to a report from somewhere the other day that says that what farmers ought to do is diversify into&mdash;wait for this&mdash;insect breeding to cash in on growing demand for bush tucker!</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first matter of public importance this House has dealt with on defence since 1988. Nearly a decade has gone without the requirement of the House to consider a matter of this sort. The reason it is before the parliament today after a decade is that the morale within the services has reached a stage where it threatens capability. It has reached that low stage not just because of the incompetence of the last month but because over a period of some 18 months we have seen a series of slipshod decision making by the ministers responsible without any plan and without any guide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a process of slipshod decision making that has also seen some 7,000 or 8,000 military jobs tagged to go, with another 5,000 to 6,000 civilian jobs identified to go&mdash;all of this being done without any concept of Australia's defence needs. If you were to be serious in any endeavour as Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), or for that matter in any serious endeavour of any kind, you would set about establishing a few goals, what you are about; and, having clearly identified those and having made sure everyone understood them, you might then go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8525"> about establishing a plan of action and involve people in that. Then you would set about making a few decisions to implement the plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But here we have a minister and a government that have actually reversed that process. For 18 months there has been a series of decisions, starting with the abolition of the ready reserve, the establishment of the defence efficiency review, the defence review program and the carving up of thousands of jobs out of the Defence Force. All of that has been done as a string of uncoordinated, unconnected decisions. Having done a whole host of those, this government sat down and said, `We had better have a plan.' So they cobbled a few of those together to make them into a plan, and some time later this year they are going to give us the goals. Some time later this year the minister is actually going to tell the people of Australia what his and this government's strategic analysis of Australia's needs is. The thing that should have been done first has been put on the tail end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone in the defence forces, and I might say a heck of a lot of people in the region who take some interest in Australian defence matters, have observed this malaise, and the people in the defence forces are bearing the brunt of it. They are the ones who are actually walking out the door. And it is not just the thousands of people who are having their heads lopped off; there are good career service officers, men and women, who are leaving early because they are disgusted with the way in which this government has operated its defence policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the events of the last month. If time permits, I will go back to the longer litany of the errors that have occurred prior to that. Over the course of the last month, what we have seen is a sad and regrettable lack of leadership which has turned what was a terrible tragedy into farce. I think that was probably best encapsulated by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this Monday with a front page headline which says `Army in Turmoil over Black Hawk Inquiry'. That is not a happy headline and it is not a happy story for the Australian Defence Force. The fact that it makes the banner front page headline of the national 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> capital paper is some indication of the depth of feeling not just of people in the community broadly but of people in the defence community as well. That headline is simply the latest in a string of catastrophes that this minister and this government have been a party to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We go back to earlier this month when the Black Hawk tragedy became news again in rather sad circumstances. We had the disclosure in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 5 September with the headline `Black Hawk Tragedy: Army was Warned'. It is worth recounting what that article drew to the attention of the public. It said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proficiency in operational tasking has suffered, in particular formation flying, airborne operations and support to special forces operations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of life is this: when issues like that arise ordinary people say, `Hold on, isn't there a conflict of interest here?'

If the minister cannot see that he has a role in that or that there is a built&hyphen;up problem in the defence forces, where everyone in the defence forces had their morale stripped from them in the course of the last couple of months, thankfully someone in the defence forces did. His failure to act was not replicated by the Defence Headquarters. The Chief of the Defence Force actually set up an inquiry to look into the way in which that original board of inquiry was conducted. That is not going back and looking over all the evidence necessarily or getting any witnesses. They should not do any of that. But it was to re&hyphen;establish some confidence in the process, some integrity in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did none of it. He sat on his hands and the Chief of the Defence Force had to act, and we see the references to that in the media. All this, I must say, has been done by press release. There has been no statement to the parliament; there has been no accountability to the parliament. This has all been by press release from Defence Headquarters, from the Chief of the Defence Force, not from the minister, who should have responsibility for it. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper carried an article at that time saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A federal judge has been appointed to investigate the conduct of an army board of inquiry into the Black Hawk collision amid allegations of a conflict of interest and controversy over charges against three officers for their part in the tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  got it dead right. And it was as much that concern over conflict of interest as anything else that led to the need for the issues to be cleaned up, for integrity to be restored and for confidence to be restored. The Chief of the Defence Force acted to do it; the minister didn't. The minister should have. The sad part about it is that I think the Chief of the Defence Force got it wrong technically. </PARA>

A press release from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence News</EMPHASIS> that simply says: `Defence Chief announces Black Hawk Change'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You use your 15 minutes to read it out. The simple fact is that the Chief of the Defence Force had to act to clean up a problem that he should never have been placed in a position of dealing with and the reason, of course, why Justice Rowlands was not able to serve is no reflection on Justice Rowlands as a person. It is a conflict between the role of a serving judge and the requirements of the executive government. There are a number of rulings about that matter that call into question his capacity to undertake the inquiry that he was asked to do by the Chief of the Defence Force while he was a serving justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of this, the minister has gone missing in action. He should have been front and centre doing these things. The minister's response throughout this has been to say that I and the opposition have been mischief&hyphen;making and that really his hands are tied. His authority for that is an Australian Government Solicitor advice of 1 September 1997 dealing with the question of Black Hawk discipline. That very advice, which the minister relies on, also points out that he does have the authority to deal precisely with the questions that I am now raising&mdash;the questions of the manner in which the inquiry is conducted. That advice says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is appropriate for the minister to satisfy himself that the required procedures under the Defence Force Discipline Act are being properly followed . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it would not be appropriate for him to influence the outcome on a particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What I am now saying very clearly to the minister is that you have a responsibility, and it is set out there in your own legal advice, to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8527"> satisfy yourself that the required procedures are being followed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Chief of the Defence Force understood that matter had been brought into question and he took a decision that it needed to be acted upon. You should have done that, and you did not, and your failure has contributed to the slide in confidence that exists within the Defence Force at the moment. The other thing I will just comment on in passing is that the Defence Force Disciplinary Act, which this whole legal advice is all about, is not actually the act that the board of inquiry was established under anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The head of power for the board of inquiry is not the Defence Force Disciplinary Act at all, so you can throw that away&mdash;forget it. The head of power for the board of inquiry is the Defence Act, and the minister has an absolute responsibility to do a couple of things. He has an absolute responsibility to make sure the act sets out precisely what the government of the day and the people expect of its Defence Force&mdash;No. 1, first and foremost&mdash;and secondly, having assured himself of that, he has got an obligation to make certain that it is properly followed and implemented. He has done neither.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of life is that over the course of the last year the minister has had warning of these problems&mdash;this is not something that just lobbed three or four weeks ago with that first article I mentioned. The minister would be well aware of recent precedents last year involving defence disciplinary action in the United Kingdom and in Canada where disciplinary acts under the military legislation have been overturned. In the case of a UK sergeant, the European Court on Human Rights overturned disciplinary action and called into question the entire basis upon which the UK military disciplinary procedures operated. That is known by people here. I am sure he has received advice about it. The alarm bells should have rung&mdash;`Hello, here's the wake&hyphen;up call. There's a problem. We'd better actually have a look at our own procedures because there are some parallels between our legislation and our procedures in Defence and what the UK people do.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But so far, nothing. So far we leave the Chief of the Defence Force to dangle out there and we leave the ordinary troops to bear the brunt of the pain of reform while they feel themselves not only leaderless but also increasingly betrayed. That is a terrible position for them to be in and, make no mistake, that is precisely the feeling they have. Anyone who wants to debate that should spend a day roaming around talking to people on base. Don't talk, listen. If you do that, you might in fact get a few shocks about the attitude that those people have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other warning signal that this government got but it seemed to sleep through was the report tabled last year by the Defence Judge Advocate General, who just happened to be last year the same Justice Rowlands I referred to a moment ago. In his annual report last year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the ADF is to continue for good reason to conduct its own legal proceedings in serious cases, it appears to me that the case for professional military judges with appropriate independence from command is unanswerable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the warning last year and we seem not to have taken any notice of it. This government and this minister, having got that advice in the annual report from the Judge Advocate ignores it, goes ahead and falls into the very problem the Judge Advocate says you have got to look out for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time this problem was cleaned up, and if the minister is not willing or able to act on it, the parliament will have to. What we will be doing as an opposition is pursuing the opportunity for a parliamentary committee review of the existing defence legislation and the procedures concerning internal inquiries and disciplinary action. There needs to be a full and open account of what is transpiring that does not just focus&mdash;in fact, hopefully, does not focus at all&mdash;on the events of the last few weeks but looks at the events of the last year, including what has happened overseas. When the minister gets up and says that he cannot do these things, here is a question he might like to answer: Minister, if it is not possible for you to act in relation to the Black Hawk board of inquiry, why have you acted in relation to a RAAF board of inquiry where, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8528"> as advised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> only a few days ago:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the only public contribution that anybody has noticed in the last 18 months or so from the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) is his recent and constant undermining of senior army officers and the military processes that they have been going through, and it is mostly in regard to the extremely tragic Black Hawk case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that it is a rather disgusting way of putting politics before propriety. I have told the shadow minister previously that he got it wrong when he constantly advocated publicly a course of events which would interfere with the legal or military legal processes. It is possible that the shadow minister now understands that the first fortnight of his publicly interfering with those processes were wrong, because I noticed that of recent times he has pulled out of it. I am so disappointed in this matter because I was told by the previous Minister for Defence that the shadow minister would be somebody that the nation could trust. When it came to this very important and tragic matter of Black Hawk, I might have to tell him that he was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister commented that we did not have a plan. Let us talk for a minute or two about the plan that the Labor Party must have had when they were in office. They had six previous years of defence budgets coming down from 2.7 per cent of GDP to 1.8 per cent, which is the lowest since 1938.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to quarantine the defence budget for the first three years of government. In the previous five or six years, 16,000 to 20,000 people lost their jobs. You had a separation rate which averaged somewhere in the nature of 10 to 12 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found when we came to office that the machine guns did not work and that the Navy had a whole lot of hulls but was not fitted with the gear to look after itself. We found that the Army had almost finished a report into itself which contains just about the most scathing self&hyphen;criticism that I have ever read by any institution anywhere&mdash;commercial or government or defence. You are saying that we should have had a plan. Where was your plan for the Army? We put a plan together, we did a review in the last couple of years, we then put the plan together and called it Army into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we looked at the defence efficiency review, the shadow minister's plan also showed up a billion dollars worth of waste, duplication or simple lack of efficiency. One billion out of 10. Not a bad effort after 13 years of running the place! A minute ago I mentioned the navy policy of building ships fitted `for but not with'. I think your defence policy was `for but not with'. You had a defence shell with no technical ability to produce a decent Defence Force. I might add that that scathing self&hyphen;criticism which the Army called `Army 21'&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8529">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the real issue that the shadow minister has raised, and that is morale. How can you possibly expect a Defence Force to have super&hyphen;duper morale in 1997 with a litany of failures like those behind it? That is, budgets coming down, people leaving, an Army with the greatest self&hyphen;criticism imaginable. We have had to try to pick that up. What do we do with it? We make sure that we have an Army into the 21st century plan. And you know, because you have been around those areas, that if you talk to those task force members today they are extremely enthusiastic. They are getting some gear they were not getting before, and they know there is more coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also building the reserve situation, something which you did not do. If there was one failure that tops the lot, worse than ships fitted for but not with, worse than the fact that the machinery did not work, it is your lack of interest and performance in regard to the reservists in the last 13 years. I had some reservists in yesterday, and they will tell you that at the present time they do not believe they will be anything but a drag upon the regular Army. That does not apply across the board, but it applies enough for us to have to put a major financial effort in to get the reserves up to speed. I think that will be the most difficult. It will be more difficult than spending the money on acquisitions or on platforms and so forth. The most difficult thing will be to change the attitude not only to reservists but by reservists, by their employers and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the major point of this MPI. The shadow minister has raised the matter of the Black Hawk inquiry. I will come to his own efforts in this regard in a minute, but he raised, in particular, that magnificent newspaper the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> and that irregularly accurate correspondent who works for them. I took the trouble, as I have done all the way through the Black Hawk matter, to get the best legal advice I could as to the proper process. I have made sure that when other people were getting legal advice that I had it checked. That is the reason why&mdash;and you did not read this out because you did not consider

I put no store by anything that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> has written on this matter of recent times. Until such times as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> makes its mind up that it is going to report things accurately and in a balanced way, I will be paying no attention to it.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is very important. You should take notice of this:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that he was biased and that the recommendations by the Board for disciplinary action were coloured by that bias.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not think that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  article raises any implications adverse to the present disciplinary action.

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a fact you know. It continued:</PARA>

What you were saying back then was that charges against three junior officers could be counterproductive&mdash;that is what you said. I hope that you now know that advocating any course in regard to those things is quite wrong. `They should put a halt to this process,' you said, `an article reports that shadow minister Arch Bevis has repeated his call for the dropping of the charges.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot make&mdash;and you know I am at a disadvantage in this matter&mdash;any comment and I will not make any comment about any of those matters. What I am saying to you is that, on any number of occasions, we go to the Attorney-General or the Australian Government Solicitor and we get the advice and we act on it, just as I advised General Baker to act on that advice only several days ago&mdash;and we will continue to act on that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that you go along to the Australian Government Solicitor, get some advice and act on it because, if you did, then you would not be making the mistakes that you have been making out there in the last few weeks. I have to say to you, and I repeat what I said before, that the only actions of the shadow minister that anybody has seen in public over the last 18 months or so have been an undermining set of actions which are quite without precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, after advice from me at this box several weeks ago, also went out there and said that I should give under the table in some covert

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put in place these processes after copious amounts of advice to the senior military officers, and they have acted entirely properly and with my support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow minister outlined, it is a rare event in this House to have a matter of public importance raised on defence matters, the last being in 1988. Members on both sides of the House understand the seriousness and importance of defence matters. They understand that decisions made by the present government, like decisions made by the former government, are left to be implemented. Defence is an important area with long lead times, where one must reach out for bipartisanship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MPI talks of the `desperately low morale in the Australian Defence Force caused by the failure of the Minister for Defence to provide leadership'. We have heard the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) answer the accusation. He does not deny that there is low morale; that is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up for debate. Low morale is not being debated or defended by the government. What the government is saying is: `Yes, we do have low morale, but even though we have been in government for 18 months it is all your fault'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pick up on a few of the things that the Minister for Defence has said and raise a couple of my own points. He says that in our acquisition policy we were creating `defence hulls'. Let me remind the minister that we had a very active defence industry policy approach which saw in 13 years the level of Australian industry capability, of Australian industry input into defence acquisitions, which usually ran under us at about $2 billion plus per annum, go from 30 per cent to 70 per cent. This meant jobs for Australians but also in-house Australian industry capability. That is very important and needs to be nurtured and fostered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, we are now returning to an age&hyphen;old approach by defence under this minister, and particularly under his junior minister, that the world is a supermarket, overseas and off the shelf and that is how we should buy. Indeed, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), in outlining her approach to defence industry, said: `You can count on my personal support.' That is terrific&mdash;a real commitment from the minister. But the rub was: what did that personal support for Australian industry mean? `I will help in any way I can with letters of support, telephone calls, visits, or whatever is required'. This is the coalition's defence industry policy. This is the policy that is desired to overcome what the minister has called the `defence hulls'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will need a defence capability into the future. We need to maintain it. We need to nurture it. That is now slipping under the new government. I hope it will not be to our cost. I hope that when we need to make that telephone call we will be able to get the equipment in the way that the government envisages. I do not believe we will if we are involved in any serious conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to return to the issue of restructuring the Army. I have to confess that in the previous government I was very excited about Army 21, a plan initiated by the former 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8532"> Minister for Defence Robert Ray. It looked fundamentally at what was going to be the role of the Army in defending Australia, how we needed to restructure the Army, and what sort of capability we needed to restructure it. The Minister for Defence says: `Oh, yes. We picked this up. We have a new plan now, restructuring the Army&mdash;"Army into the 21st century". We have done it all.' What have they done? They have decided to trial over two years some concepts&mdash;a commitment to trialling. I have never been more surprised. I said to the minister: `I would love to know, for my own understanding, what army came up with Army 21 and what is the difference in the plans being trialled by the minister.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a matter of just restructuring the Army or changing some of the equipment, of reshaping some of the units, or positioning them differently. We have a problem, which the minister obliquely alluded to, in wanting to change Army conditions. What is the approach of the new coalition defence team? Again, what does the junior minister do? There is a very decent report&mdash;and I am not saying you would want to implement everything in it, but it certainly highlights the way to go&mdash;that was, again, prepared under the previous government: the Glenn review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How have the government implemented the Glenn review? No departmental or uniformed officer is now allowed to refer to the Glenn review. This is how we implement change&mdash;we just pretend it does not exist. But there are very real issues that need to be faced up to and very real changes that need to be made in the defence forces. We need to have mobility between full-time employment, part-time employment, and allowing people to opt out. We need much greater flexibility if we are to be capable of attracting the people we need to attract to the defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention the ready reserve. It is true that the coalition in opposition were opposed to the ready reserve. I do not necessarily criticise them for that, but I want to point out what the ready reserve was doing. It was introducing, as Army knew only too well, a calibre and quality of recruit that they had not experienced in other ranks before. The greatest advocates of the ready reserve 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scheme were the Army&mdash;for that very good reason. Why would they want that calibre of recruit? Warfare is no longer about grunting, although you do need a highly capable infantry, and I mean no disrespect to them. What I am alluding to is that technology is moving on and we need serving officers in other ranks capable of operating and being competent in the use of that equipment. Indeed, we pride ourselves in Australia that we can operate equipment far more capably, probably, than any other army in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To do that goes to the quality of recruits. They have abolished the ready reserve scheme, as predictably they would, but there is a vacuum. Where are the university type people that the ready reserve was encouraging into the Army&mdash;either into the ready reserve or the full&hyphen;time Army, into other ranks or at the officer level? Where are you getting those people now? The short answer is that you are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to say something about ADFA&mdash;a personal thing of mine. ADFA is the most expensive university in Australia, absorbing 50 per cent of the officer training budget. I say to the minister, as I have said before: I thought the committee report was a decent one, although it was rubbished, again, by the junior minister. We need to look at a scholarship scheme that allows people to do their university training at other universities, mix with their peers and, after completion, embark on a military career&mdash;either at officer level or other ranks, full time or part time. But that was completely rejected by the government, and I regret that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time remaining I wanted to make this point: there is a lot of change going on&mdash;and we do not object to change&mdash;but, as the shadow minister has said before, if you are going to implement change, at least do it in a structured and ordered way. Have your strategic review so you understand what you are confronting. Have your force structure review so you have the forces deployed and structured in a way to meet that threat. And by all means go through your defence efficiency review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only result that is going to come out of an MPI on defence is a demonstration of the lack of understanding that the Labor Party has of the modern ADF in this country. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) does the ADF a great disservice today. Labor continues irresponsibly to talk down the morale of the ADF. I find that a great shame because I come from a city that has Australia's largest ADF infrastructure. I know the men and women in the ADF in my area are proud to be in the ADF, they are proud and keen to serve. They do good work for this nation and yet they have politicians talking down their morale. I find that absolutely disgusting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, I do not think that the shadow minister understands the role of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan). Soldiers in the ADF do not care about political issues. They care about the minister providing strategic level leadership. They want to get on with the fighting and the inevitable administration that occurs in the ADF. They want the minister to secure strategic level policy and secure the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister that we have today leading the defence forces of this country will likely be remembered as a minister who has done all of those things that the ADF expects. You see, this minister has delivered the DER, the plan to restructure the army, and an extra $125 million to the sharp end where it is really needed. On top of all that, he has delivered what the ADF have been looking for for so many years&mdash;no further cuts in funding. I believe that the members of the ADF will see 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the hypocrisy that occurs from the Labor Party in this matter today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I said to you that I represent the largest ADF base in Australia. The shadow minister said that we should get out and talk to the troops on the ground. Every week I talk to the troops on the ground. I talk to all ranks in the ADF. I ask them what their concerns are. I do not see any problems with morale in my area. Instead, I see a fighting force that knows that it has an important job to do and a job that it is keen to get on with. I see troops who have a strong commitment to our nation, and that does not come from a lack of morale. I see soldiers being continually asked for more, and I see them delivering it. You do not get a situation of being able to deliver more and more if the morale of the forces is low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The soldiers in Townsville do not give two hoots about what appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. They are not interested in the politics of this issue. They are interested in getting on and doing the job of looking after our nation, and they do that very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year we have had two exercises out of the RDF in Townsville&mdash;Exercise Tandem Thrust, based in Rockhampton, and Exercise Tasman Eagle. Both of those exercises were carried out with our allies. Both of them had a superb result. Our allies looked at the ADF in Australia and said, `It is a fine organisation.' You do not get a fine organisation, a well&hyphen;oiled machine or a keen machine if there is lack of morale. It gives the lie to this MPI today.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to go to 5 Aviation. I go to 5 Aviation all the time. Let me tell you what they tell me. The unit is getting on with the task of providing the 3rd Brigade with support. They are not interested in the politics of the board of inquiry. They are not interested in the political shenanigans of the Labor Party. They are not interested in you trying to drive down the morale artificially. They are interested in getting on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might note, if you look at the performance of their exercise Swift Eagle last year, which was after the accident, they took out 17 Black Hawks. After only having had three flying under Labor they took out 17 into the field. I think that indicates a pretty strong performance from the officers and men of the 5 Aviation Regiment. I can categorically tell this parliament this afternoon that there are no morale problems in that particular regiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RDF, which is the 3rd Brigade, is an organisation in Townsville which has a tremendous focus. Because they have that focus we have seen that group deployed to areas like Somalia and Rwanda. Recently a small component of the RAAF went to Cambodia. They have a purpose. The morale is not poor. They are doing the job. Look at the wonderful success we had out of the operation in the Southern Ocean, for example. That is not part of the RDF but it is part of the ADF.

Just in my own patch I have the former member for Herbert, a member of the Australian Labor Party, jumping up and down in the Townsville media saying, `Well, guys, the 11th Brigade is going to go; 3rd Brigade is going to get scaled down.' Fear, scare&mdash;driving it down. And what happened? It did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister recognised, in the planning, what should occur in northern Australia and that was put in place. Labor continues to push the fear and uncertainty buttons of the ADF. I do not know to what end because, at the end of the day, it is the Labor Party that suffers with credibility among our soldiers&mdash;among the men and women of the finest fighting force that we have had for some time. I do believe that the leadership from the minister, Mr McLachlan, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) in ensuring that the funding was provided for the ADF at a time of very tight financial budgeting processes is indicative of the leadership that is shown on this side of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has secured the future of the ADF. He has secured the future well into the next century. Certainly he will be known in the ADF, and is known now, as the first minister to secure a sound budget base for the ADF. I am hopeful, without pre&hyphen;empting it, that in future years we can increase the expenditure in the ADF as a percentage of GDP.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Since its creation under the NRTC Act 1991 the National Road Transport Commission has been the means of carrying forward a major program of reforms in road transport. The commission reports to the Australian Transport Council, recommending policies and legislation for reforming road transport and producing a uniform, consistent regulatory environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Road transport affects every part of Australian life. Inefficient road transport that is more costly than it needs to be affects everyone; improvements in efficiency and safety benefit every Australian. This government from the outset has reiterated its commitment to road transport reform. When in opposition we gave bipartisan support to the road transport reform process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having different regulations, different inspection requirements and different permit criteria from one jurisdiction to another is frustrating, time consuming and costly. Fragmented regulations in states and territories impede the competitiveness of industry and restrict the effective integration of the Australian transport market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has committed itself wholeheartedly to bringing the regulatory and operating environment for road transport up to date:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Since the NRTC was created in 1991 heavy vehicle charges have been reformed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act has been passed to provide the basis for new, nationally uniform road rules.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regime for the transport by road of dangerous goods.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Driving hours for long distance coaches and for trucks have reached an advanced stage of development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although a great deal has been accomplished, much remains to be done. Such matters as driving hours and speed management have consumed vastly more time and involved a great deal more consultation than could have been envisaged at the outset. Pilot projects on alternative compliance for the management of vehicle maintenance, mass limits and fatigue management have proved to be more complex than was thought necessary when these projects were commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform process must continue. The tasks that have commenced need to be brought to completion. More progress has been made in reforming road transport legislation and in achieving uniformity and consistency of approach in the last six years than had been made in the previous half century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accordance with the NRTC Act 1991, the government set up a review last year of the functions and achievements of the commission. That review found that the commission should continue through an amendment to its enabling legislation but that several improvements needed to be made to improve its functioning and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February the Ministerial Council on Road Transport accepted the main features of the review report and gave in-principle approval to proceed. Since that time, Commonwealth, state and territory officials have been working to translate those principles into amendments to the NRTC Act and heavy and light vehicles agreements. Accordingly, this bill will extend the NRTC Act by one year to enable the commission to continue in operation. The bill also provides for commissioners to be reappointed, if necessary, in the interim period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is an interim measure. It is intended to allow the reform process to continue while the legislation is finalised to place road transport reform on a more solid foundation to deliver the returns to the industry for the benefit of all Australians. In this bill no

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to give effect to the government's commitment to cap aircraft movements at Kingsford Smith Airport, KSA, at 80 movements per hour through the implementation of a slot system. This commitment was first made in our election policy statement on aviation in the 1996 election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I am pleased to be introducing the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill, which represents a legislated cap on aircraft movements. Its introduction follows 18 months of effort necessary to ensure a cooperative scheme is ready to be formally implemented following the passage of this legislation. The timing for formally legislating a maximum aircraft movement cap at KSA is right, as the number of movements at KSA in the peak morning hours is rapidly approaching the 80 movement limit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the earlier private member's bill of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), we have been concerned when we legislated to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put the cap in place to also deliver an effective tool to administer it. We have achieved this with the development of a slot allocation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slots system which has been developed, in cooperation with industry, will ensure that we have a workable and effective means for administering the cap. The slots system will not only manage the cap in a non&hyphen;discriminatory way but help alleviate delays through congestion at KSA. This will be beneficial for all users of the airport&mdash;the airlines, the airport owner and, most importantly, the travelling public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By limiting the number of scheduled movements in any five&hyphen;minute period, the slots system will force the airlines to move away from their practice of cluster scheduling, where a group of flights, potentially well beyond the airport's capacity, are scheduled with the same arrival or departure time. The bill requires movements to be spread more evenly across the hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also incorporated a compliance regime into the slot system which, in tandem with the spreading of scheduling as cluster scheduling is dismantled, will also promote reduced delays at the airport. Under the compliance system airlines will be liable to fines and other penalties for poor on&hyphen;time performance. This is a crucial element of the slots system which will provide airlines with an additional incentive to perform on&hyphen;time. Because off&hyphen;slot movements may involve fines unless an acceptable reason exists, the system will also bring transparency and accountability to a process of explaining why delays occur into and out of KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We intend to trial the off&hyphen;slot provisions of the proposed slot management regime for six months. This will enable the scheme to bed down and for industry to adjust to the new arrangements before fines are imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objective we have met in developing the slots system is to guarantee residents of regional New South Wales continued access to KSA. The system we are establishing will safeguard the current levels of access that regional New South Wales has to KSA, reflecting the Commonwealth government's commitment to country residents. This will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8537"> achieved by setting aside dedicated regional slots based on existing service levels, which cannot be sold or swapped to interstate or international services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with a deregulated aviation industry, the slots system also provides for any potential new entrants to have equal access with their established competitors to slots at Australia's primary domestic airport. This is the most progressive level of access for new entrants at any slot-constrained airport in the world. And it is possible to do this principally because we are putting this cap in place now, before the limit is reached in any hour. However, should the bill be delayed, allocation under the present ad hoc, first come, first served process will continue. On current trends, the 80 cap will soon be exceeded if not clearly established through this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are convinced that the introduction of a slots system will effectively administer the cap and will overall help reduce congestion and delays at Sydney airport. This will have a flow&hyphen;on beneficial effect as so much domestic aviation traffic is affected by good performance at KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the main provisions of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Maximum aircraft movement limit</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 2 of the bill establishes a cap of 80 movements per hour at KSA, and requires Airservices Australia to monitor compliance with the cap. Airservices Australia is also required to report any breaches of the cap. These reports will be tabled in both Houses of parliament. In allocating slots, hourly movements are to be measured every 15 minutes. As I noted earlier, this will assist in alleviating the practice of cluster scheduling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under clauses 7 and 8 it will be possible to lower the maximum number of hourly movements at KSA after consultation with interested parties. However, any change to the cap must be made in the form of a disallowable instrument which must go before the parliament for the full disallowance period before it would come into effect. The capacity to lower the maximum number of hourly move 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments is essentially a reserve provision. The cap of 80 remains our policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Penalties for unauthorised aircraft movements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 3 of the bill establishes a system of penalties for unauthorised aircraft movements. This will protect the integrity of the cap and establish clear guides for all users of KSA as to the range of sanctions which may be levied if an infringement occurs. Unauthorised movements will be subject to penalties in the form of an infringement notice or civil prosecution. A range of civil penalties have been specified in relation to breaches of the slot allocation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most serious of these breaches relates to no&hyphen;slot movements, where an aircraft lands or takes off without having permission to do so. This is a fundamental breach of the slot system which jeopardises the cap and disrupts other airports users who have applied for a slot. A no&hyphen;slot movement will be punishable by a maximum penalty of $220,000 per infringement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum penalty for an off&hyphen;slot movement is $110,000 for a corporation, or $22,000 for an individual. It is proposed that the Compliance Scheme will provide initially for relatively small fines, but persistent offenders will find an exponential increase in the level of fines for the second and third offences&mdash;up to the maximum. It is worth noting that fines are not triggered unless a flight is more than 15 minutes late, and off&hyphen;slot movements which are outside the control of the airline will not count.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Emergency and state aircraft will be exempt from this part of the bill. In addition, the slot manager may grant, within approved guidelines, a dispensation to certain aircraft. The guidelines will be a disallowable instrument as part of the slot management scheme and will therefore be subject to further scrutiny by this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Revenue received from penalties is to be used by industry to offset the costs of administering the slot management scheme. This signifies that the government is not aiming at raising revenue under the scheme. Rather, we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8538"> are serious about improving poor performance and delays.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The slot management scheme</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 4 of the bill establishes the broad slot allocation framework. It does not contain the fine detail covering the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operation of the slots system. An outline of the detail of the scheme to be authorised under the bill is contained in the regulatory impact statement. A detailed draft scheme will be the subject of further development by an appointed slot manager. The scheme will be a disallowable instrument when finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 46 of the bill provides a ministerial discretion to vary, suspend or cancel slots. This will be important for short&hyphen;term adjustments to the slots system to meet the operational requirements of special events, such as the 2000 Olympics. Any directions under this clause will be required to be tabled in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The compliance scheme</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 5 of the bill establishes the broad compliance framework. It provides for a compliance committee to develop and oversight enforcement provisions in relation to the slot allocation system at KSA. The compliance scheme will be a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The slot manager</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 6 of the bill establishes that a slot manager, which will be a separate company, will be appointed to put forward a slot management scheme and future amendments, and administer slots at KSA. It is envisaged that the company appointed will be one formed by Sydney airport and Australian airlines or operators using the airport.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The compliance committee</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 7 of the bill provides for the appointment of a compliance committee for KSA, with responsibility for developing, administering and amending the compliance scheme. The minister will appoint the committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Miscellaneous</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 8 of the bill allows the making of regulations necessary to address the issue of slot management at KSA. The bill allows approval of amendments to the slot management scheme and the compliance scheme to be delegated to the Secretary of the Depart 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of Transport and Regional Development, or to any person holding or performing the duties of a senior executive service office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is a strong and reliable framework against which Sydney airport and the airlines using it will have the opportunity to build a mature, cooperative arrangement for better on&hyphen;time performance and effective planning, up to the cap of 80 movements an hour. The full details of the scheme and amendments to it will be tabled in parliament as a disallowable instrument. A great deal of work has already gone into developing the slot management scheme, and it will be available for tabling later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no excuse for further delay. The necessary advance work is now complete; and the 80 cap must be set in concrete now, before it is exceeded by growth in the morning peak hour. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those members who took part in the debate in the Main Committee on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. But, in doing so, I say that it is disappointing that the opposition is attempting to hold up its passage. The bill seeks only to correct anomalies in the Northern Territory land rights act which allow certain land claims to remain technically on foot when, in practice, they should not. This has the potential to unnecessarily restrict economic development in the Northern Territory, which would disadvantage all territorians, including those from Aboriginal communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the anomalies, relating to stock route claims, is actually a Labor mistake. Labor proclaimed an amendment in 1990 which was intended to prevent stock route claims. This amendment proved technically deficient, and this is one of the things we are now trying to fix.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is acting in good faith in doing this. It will be insisting that the Northern Territory government keep to its side of the bargain and improve aspects of its Pastoral Land Act before this amendment comes into force. So there is no argument for delaying passage of the bill here. It is true that the Northern Territory amendment bill lapsed at the recent election. However, the government expects the Northern Territory government to reintroduce its Pastoral Land Bill during the new assembly's first sittings. This is likely to be in November this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor further argues that this bill should wait until completion of the land rights review. Such a delay is not warranted, as the government has repeatedly made clear that amendments seek only to fix minor technical anomalies in the act. They are not relevant to any of the important policy issues that will no doubt be examined by the review and therefore need not await the outcome of that review. The sunset clause was introduced by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8540"> Labor in 1987 and the government has no intention of removing it. This is implicit in the terms of reference for the review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before question time I was dealing with the amendment that has been moved by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) and indicating that I thought it was slightly disingenuous of him to be condemning the government for its handling of veterans' affairs. I was making the point that, on the contrary, I believe that since this government came into office it has delivered on its commitment to veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is at the table this afternoon. The member for Reid did actually make a number of points during his contribution that I conceded were points worthy of consideration and I am sure that the minister will deal in detail with those comments at the time he sums up this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election the coalition promised to review repatriation entitlements and we have done that. This legislation reflects a number of amendments that are consequential upon that particular review. In fact, the amendments in this bill in relation to operational qualifying areas of service arise from the report that was commissioned by the government. That report was undertaken jointly by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised that member for Reid was not prepared to concede that there is no doubt that this particular legislation has within it considerable benefits for a wide range of veterans. I want to quickly reiterate what those are.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="8T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr Laurie Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear you say that, but if you said it, you said it. The fact is that another 10,500 veterans will become eligible for compensation for injuries or diseases resulting from their overseas service 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8542"> in the Australian Defence Force. That will represent an additional cost of almost $20 million to the government. The measures in this bill will take effect from 13 May 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also six new areas which this bill adds to the list of overseas deployment regarded as operational service. Once again, this will be of benefit and interest to a large number of veterans. There is the BCOF, or the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces, in Japan for a certain period of time; Singapore during the Malayan Emergency; the Far East Strategic Reserve the navy for certain dates; the DMZ, as it is called, the demilitarised zone, in Korea from 19 April 1956 and onwards; HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vampire</EMPHASIS> or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quickmatch</EMPHASIS>, which saw service in Vietnam for a certain period of time; and north&hyphen;east Thailand, including Ubon, for a period of time. This partly addresses the member for Reid's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes a number of amendments aimed at giving some groups access to the service pension. It does this by including a number of peacekeeping forces on the list for qualifying service. I will not go through that list because of the shortness of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the bill changes the way in which operational qualifying service will be determined in the future. At the moment operational service for the purpose of veterans' entitlements is whatever is listed in the act. In future operational service will be that list, plus any service defined as warlike or non&hyphen;warlike, and qualifying service will include warlike service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation that we are dealing with today not only honours the government's commitments to veterans, but it delivers on our pre&hyphen;election promises and also in no uncertain terms is of substantial benefit to a wide range of veterans. There are a number of other important elements within the legislation. One is the extension of eligibility to certain other people of advance payment of pensions, and that is a positive benefit for many veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a brief remark about the changes which the bill proposes to the treatment of tobacco related illnesses. There are two items in this bill which seek to make it clear 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the commission will not accept tobacco related death or injury as war caused if the serviceman or servicewoman began to smoke or use tobacco products after 31 December 1997 or increased the amount of cigarettes or tobacco products used after 31 December 1997. The opposition spokesman accepted that, of course, and I do not think there would be any debate about that particular change because it is absolutely justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dangers of smoking are now well known, and that was not the case back in World War II and at other times since then. In fact, many World War II veterans, including my own father, actually took up smoking during the war, were unable to stop smoking after the war and have subsequently succumbed to a number of different sorts of cancers which were caused by smoking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But these days we are much more enlightened, and therefore this particular change is not about saving money, although in an indirect sense it may well do that, but is about recognising that everybody in our community, including members of the ADF, are informed about the dangers of smoking. I would like to observe in this context that the tobacco companies still refuse to accept the situation as it is. They accept in some obscure way a statistical association between people who smoke and cancer, but they do not actually accept that it causes cancer. They maintain their position to this day, to this hour, that causation has not been proved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, of course, they continue to market products to children, yet also deny that they do it. I think the Tobacco Institute said recently that advertising is not what makes people take up smoking. I am not sure why the companies are spending so much money on advertising if that is the case. I have no respect at all for the way the tobacco industry goes about marketing its products to children. There is no doubt in most thinking people's minds about the causal link between smoking and many illnesses, including many forms of cancer, and that is why this particular provision in this legislation is broadly accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other matters I want to touch upon briefly. The legislation provides 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8543"> for the transfer of carer service pensions and carer income support supplement recipients to the Department of Social Security. I need to make it very clear to people that veterans are very jealous and very concerned about the maintenance of their department and the department's administration of their affairs. The minister understands that and I know the government understands it, and I want to underline the fact that there is no intention to deviate from that position. I do not think, and I do not think anybody in this place thinks, that that is going to be the case forever, and maybe in 20 or 30 years time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are in fact some very positive benefits in that particular change because there are only a very small number of DVA pensioners who are affected and the great bulk of carers, the 24,500 who exist, are paid through the Department of Social Security. I want to assure veterans that this is not in any way the thin edge of some wedge to disband or remove the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Those sorts of rumours float around from time to time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, as the minister says, this government has absolutely no intention of going down that track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that has been floating around is the criticism of the proposed merits tribunal. I have had letters from some of my RSL clubs about that. I have got one here from the Currumbin&hyphen;Palm Beach RSL sub&hyphen;branch. I understand that there was originally a bit of misinformation floating around about the government's intentions, and particularly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the effect it might have on veterans' capacity to prosecute their cases before the tribunal. I think those concerns have now been allayed, and the amalgamation of the AAT, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Veterans' Review Board and so on into a single tribunal will have substantial benefits for everybody involved. I think that has been put to rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of other matters I wanted to touch on, but let me quickly go to the last. I know this is also good news for this government, and I applaud the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) of the new Australian active service medal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In talking about the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R278">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997</XREF> , I might start off almost where the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) finished, and that is on the question of the tribunal and the department's future. Despite what has been said in recent times, many of us are in fact very concerned about this new super&hyphen;tribunal. As someone who has dealt with the various tribunals over time and has very much appreciated the level of expertise within those tribunals, and the level of sensitivity which they have displayed over the years, I am actually quite nervous about the government's proposals. I think the possible savings that may be involved may lead to a system where the individual gets lost in a tribunal which will not be sufficiently expert, if you like, and sufficiently sensitive to deal with all of the matters that come before it. Until we see its final shape and how it is going to be formed and so on, one has to keep some reservations, but I personally have some very strong reservations about what has been announced to date. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8544">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think the veteran community of Australia are equally concerned. They have not yet made a judgment about it but there is a genuine concern. In effect, the logic is that appeals are the most complex of matters and, if you can handle appeals in one tribunal, why do you need a separate department? It is not the thin edge of the wedge in one sense, but in another sense it is a logical conclusion to say that, if you can handle the most complex things in one organisation, why can't you handle the simple things in a single organisation? So, if you can merge the SSAT&mdash;the Social Security Appeals Tribunal&mdash;and the Veterans Review Tribunal, it does beg the question: why have separate departments? I think there is a very real apprehension about that part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part is whether or not the level of expertise and sensitivity that we have grown to appreciate and respect in the separate tribunals will carry through to a new tribunal. In the case of staff members, many will be different. The personnel will change to a large degree&mdash;no doubt the tribunal members will change and the staffing as well. Of course, the government will say they will not, but we all know that they will because these things always happen that way. So I suspect that the culture, if you like, that exists will be lost, and I am genuinely concerned about the implications of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for McPherson also spoke about departmental professionalism and so on. I think another cause for concern actually came up in the minister's speech on this matter, in which he referred to outsourcing. He expressed with some pride that this was the first Commonwealth Public Service to outsource its computer infrastructure. I am not sure if he realises that is not something to be proud of. As someone with a computer background, I have a genuine concern that what is happening with the government will lead to a very serious problem in the years ahead in terms of privacy and ownership of intellectual property. The software and data that are being outsourced are, in fact, the personal records of people who are pretty special. Those systems have been developed at taxpayers' expense over a lot of years and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be transferred to a private supplier who will operate that software.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the years ahead modifications will, no doubt, be required. The system will need to be adapted and changed with changes in legislation. There is a real concern that the changes will belong to the provider and not to the government. So if one wanted to change the supplier of that outsourced infrastructure in five years&mdash;for example, at the end of a contract or for some other reason&mdash;the supplier, or provider, would keep the changes and would give back the original software.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things are complex and I am not satisfied, and I am sure many in the community are not satisfied, that what is happening is something to be boasting about. It has been put forward as a cost saving measure but, certainly in terms of intellectual property, it opens up an area of genuine concern and, even more importantly, our capacity to protect the data and the privacy of that information becomes very vulnerable, particularly when the government has a view that the private sector should not have privacy legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that the government's proposal for its outsourcing does require the provider to observe Commonwealth standards on privacy so I am not making that broad statement in that context, but I am questioning the government's capacity to monitor and control the privacy provisions with an outsourcing provider. To do that properly will cost almost as much as running it&mdash;you almost have to have somebody in there auditing all the time to make sure that the system is not being tapped into and that it is not being misused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw cases in New South Wales recently where both Commonwealth and state information on social security and motor traders was being misused in a corrupt fashion and it took ages to come out, and that was in departments with very strong privacy protection. One wonders how much security that information will have with an outsourced supplier. So, as a minister I would not be so boastful. I think it was not his idea&mdash;it was forced on the department by Finance and Treasury as a budget measure. It is not in the interests of veterans and, in the long term, the current 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8545"> government may well rue the day that it took such a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments in general will be supported by those on this side. The shadow minister has spoken on a number of matters, particularly regarding Ubon and the Far East Strategic Reserve, where there are problems. Let us make no mistake about this&mdash;over the years since the thirties the definitions of theatres of war, what constituted danger and who should be recognised have been a matter of perpetual debate and argument. Take the case of Darwin: there were people there in the army during a particular period when it was recognised as a theatre of war. Others sent there as part of the civilian defence corps&mdash;they were not volunteers&mdash;helped to build structures. They helped to build the buildings for the soldiers who were there. Those people were not treated as soldiers and they were not entitled to the same benefits as the people they worked next to. Those kinds of issues have always been a problem and always will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Ubon has got a second problem&mdash;it was part of a dirty war. It was part of our not wanting to recognise and accept that we were involved in wars that were not legal. There is no doubt that the air force personnel in Thailand during that period were part of the Vietnam army, air force and navy with the Americans and ourselves. There is no doubt that they were part of that, but we do not want to admit it out loud because it brings Thailand into, if you like, a situation that was not officially accepted. So for years the department and the military have tended to want to put screens around Ubon. That has been a grave injustice to the people who were involved. It is a similar case with the Far East Strategic Reserve, the Malayan incident and so on. We have been involved in things as a country perhaps for good motives but, whatever the motives may have been, the outcome has been that we have been involved in issues that we have not admitted to openly. Clearly, there were naval ships involved, but those who served on them are not recognised, and discrepancies still exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments go a long way towards recognising the service of a lot of people who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were not recognised previously and who made contributions under Australian flags. We are pleased about that, but this is not the end of the story. This will go on for years to come, just as this is one more step taken as we mature as a country and as we recognise increasingly our responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another group of people who have equally missed out in this legislation. I refer to the entertainers who went into Vietnam. There were two kinds of entertainers. There were those who were engaged by the Australian Army or the Australian defence forces and were sent in strictly for the Australian troops. There were others who were originally engaged by the Americans and were sent in as part of the American entertainment corps or group but who were then contracted across to entertain Australian troops&mdash;not mixed groups but Australian troops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They came in and entertained Australian troops as Australian entertainers. They were never recognised. The department know that they were there and they know they contracted them, but because they were not employed by the Australian defence forces directly they cannot be recognised. These are the invisible people. We know they were there. They entertained our troops, in some cases for very long periods, and they did it very well. They were known to be Australians and they were known to be there. But, when it comes to their recognition, up goes to the screen and they say, `Because we did not engage them, they do not exist.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One young woman who was entertaining Australian troops at the time is Lyn Lawson, who is now a nurse and a councillor. She is a tremendous worker for the Vietnam veterans' cause in Newcastle. She does an enormous amount of voluntary work and provides an enormous amount of support. She and her husband, Gerald, have done a great job. Lyn is quite accepting of the situation, but the Vietnam veterans are not. They think she has been dudded very badly, because they know how much she did and how much she does now. She puts herself forward as a Vietnam veteran who is part of that group, but the fact that she cannot be officially 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8546"> recognised for that service is a travesty and is quite unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that the government look very closely at the pettifogging, nitpicking terminology we tend to use. These traditions go back perhaps before 1066&mdash;who knows?&mdash;when the military decided what level gets what medal at what stage for how many days. We had the silly situation about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and others where the air force had one day in Vietnam and received a medal but the navy required 30 days. I find it very difficult at times to understand and interpret their judgments. Hence, many of us have campaigned over the years to re&hyphen;think and re&hyphen;visit those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the entertainers is one that needs revisiting. On behalf of Lyn Lawson and those like her, those young Australian men and women who were engaged originally by the Americans, who entertained our troops in battle situations, who were as significant as the ones who were engaged by the Australian Army and defence forces, should be recognised for their presence&mdash;for at least being there. I think that is what my Vietnam veterans are saying to me. Lyn herself is certainly not making any approaches in that sense, but the local Vietnam veterans have given her a medal of their own. They struck their own medal for her because the government would not do so. I think that in itself is an indication of the depth of their concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation progresses these issues one more step. There are still more steps to go. I think the Far East Strategic Reserve and the question about Ubon will come forward again. There may be other areas that we still do not know about. Year by year more little pockets of activity that were surreptitious, that were not visible to all of us, come forward. I would think that on both sides of the parliament there is recognition that we need to understand and appreciate that the separation of people from people who have faced similar experiences should diminish and the equality of treatment should be extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a wide&hyphen;ranging debate in parts with the minister's comments about outsourcing and the previous member's comments about a number of other issues. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Therefore, I want to make the House aware that this weekend the underdogs are a great chance; Manly are beatable. I think the whole of Newcastle will be looking forward to the Knights putting up a tremendous performance. They are a team of veterans in the sense of their skills and professionalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst many of them are quite young and a great number are home grown, they have done our region proud. I am sure on Sunday afternoon that they will prove that Manly are not invincible. Watch the underdogs. The Hunter are often the underdogs in this country, as I think on Sunday we are again. Manly should not be too confident about their chances of success. Madam Deputy Speaker, I appreciate that opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is most appropriate that at this particular time, when the highly successful `Their service, our heritage' initiative is beginning to demonstrate its effectiveness by making Australians, and in particular our young Australians, more aware of the huge contributions our ageing service personnel have made in Australia, that the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R278">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill</XREF>  should be introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only too often do we perceive that the Anzac spirit and our Australian veterans belong to an era past, leaving only an aura of gratefulness, pride and memories of old soldiers and battles. The reality is that our current veterans in some cases include soldiers who are still young with young families and are still serving our great nation in many parts of this troubled world&mdash;be it Somalia, Cambodia or, even closer to home, Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should always bear in mind that we, as Australians&mdash;and I mean all Australians&mdash;have a responsibility to honour the commitment that our service personnel make time and time again in the tradition of our forebears. As true ambassadors for all that is good, honest and true, our service personnel never shirk their responsibility and, like the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8547"> Anzacs of old, demonstrate that the spirit of mateship and of being true blue is far from dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, known as the AATTV or The Team, which produced some four VC winners and numerous other bravery awards, celebrated their 35th reunion. A message arrived from the Commandant of the US Marine Corps, General C. C. Krulak, who wrote in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on the occasion of the 1997 AATTV 35th birthday, and on behalf of the Marines in posts and stations around the world, it is with great pleasure that I extend my greetings and warmest best wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Vietnam war, AATTV worked alongside our Marine units. Working as advisers, AATTV was an invaluable asset to the many successful missions. The indomitable spirit and raw courage of the AATTV will forever remain a significant part of the history of the Vietnam war and remains the standard by which US marines measure the mettle of a warrior.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Although that war has now been over for some 25 years, the memories, the pain, the pride and the ghosts of this conflict are still very much part of our current community. Sometimes we forget this. As the National President of AATTV, Brigadier Garth Hughes, said recently in a response to an address by the South Australian Governor:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when we came back from Korea and Malaya, we were largely ignored, but we accepted this with a soldier's stoicism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After all, what was it Kipling said?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Oh, its Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy go away, but it is "thank you Mr Atkins", when the bands begin to play'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and while we were ignored, at least nobody spat on us when we came home from Korea. There is not much point in reiterating what happened during and after Vietnam. We all know about that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the war has been over for more than 25 years. I think it is time to let the dead rest in peace, and for the rest of us to get on with business of living out what's left of our lives in whatever happiness we can find.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Personally, I do not think that I can accept that gracious epitaph. We can, should and must do more as politicians and legislators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every year, as I stand and watch the Anzac Day parade, I see a sea of new young faces 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wearing service medals and awards proudly earned on peacekeeping missions that they display and share with veterans three times their age. Even in this Parliament House there is ample evidence of a younger generation of veterans who served their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, next time you walk through the entrance to the House of Representatives or pass a security station, allow your eyes to wander to the left side of the jackets. You will notice that quite a few of our parliamentary staff are wearing Korean, Malaya and Vietnam medals and awards. For example, there is: Des Campbell, ex&hyphen;training team Vietnam, who served in Malaya and Papua New Guinea and who is up in the gallery at the moment; Bruce Glossop, engineer, who served in Malaya and Vietnam; Garry Cosgrove, engineer, Vietnam; `Buff' Phillips, air force, Vietnam; Lindsay Kidd, navy, Vietnam; Klause Wendt, RAAF, Vietnam; Tony Forbes, infantry, Vietnam; Frank Armour, navy, Vietnam; and even Lynne in our parliamentary post office is the daughter of Neville Dodds, ex&hyphen;training team, Vietnam. Peter Hulsing, who works as my chief of staff, is ex&hyphen;training team Vietnam and has also served in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it would be remiss of me not to mention our own Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, the Hon. Tim Fischer, and my colleague and friend John Bradford, the member for McPherson, who also saw overseas duty in Vietnam. We should never lose sight of our responsibility towards this serving community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our legislation, therefore, must keep pace with the ever&hyphen;changing conditions and needs of this very important legacy of our nationhood. This bill goes a long way towards addressing this issue. It delivers the outcome of an election policy undertaking to review perceived anomalies in the eligibility for veterans' entitlements for overseas deployments since World War II. It nominates areas of operation not included previously, where the level of risk existed above that of normal peacetime conditions. It includes Far East Strategic Reserve naval service in Malaya between July 1955 and May 1963.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8548">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It adopts the defence classification of warlike and non-warlike service which provides a consistent closer link between the eligibility for benefits and the nature of services rendered. The existing legislation dealing with the operational service has been rewritten and restructured to improve readability. By presenting new operational service provisions within the revised setting, the government is continuing its commitment to simplify the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It also provides access to an annual lump sum advance on pensions and excludes liability for the effects of tobacco usage started or increased after 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In my electorate of Paterson, I meet with many ex-service personnel&mdash;like Peter Lord of the Maitland RSL who, with his team, works tirelessly raising funds to have a World War II memorial erected. Then there is Bill Gardner and Graham Chandler of the Vietnam Veterans Association, who are constantly striving to have the Department of Veterans' Affairs recognise the many problems these much maligned warriors experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Les Dwyer, President of the Naval Association of Newcastle and President of the Newcastle and Districts Council of RSL Sub&hyphen;branches, and former Chief Petty Officer John King, Pensions Officer of the Naval Association of Newcastle and the Nelson Bay sub&hyphen;branch, are tireless fighters for their groups to have their World War II and post&hyphen;World War II efforts recognised. And not forgetting Bill Paterson of the Gona Memorial Association, who recently visited Papua New Guinea to commemorate their fallen mates with the unveiling of a special memorial they have built. We must also pay homage to the work of Ron Anelzack, President of Karuah RSL sub&hyphen;branch, and his efforts to build a new memorial at Karuah.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would like to advise this House that I have a special affinity for the Harbourside Haven Aged Care facility located at Port Stephens, which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) during a recent visit described as a model by which others could be measured. On 9 October, the Harbourside Haven Aged Care facility will open a $3 million recreation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> centre for the aged veterans who live on site at the new complex at Fingal Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opening will be performed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott. This occasion will also mark the first visit of the minister to my electorate. During the visit to Paterson, Bruce Scott will be taking the time to visit the Newcastle Vietnam Veterans' Association and will present cheques to the Karuah and Maitland RSL sub-branches as part of the Their Service&mdash;Our Heritage initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one common goal of all these organisations and associations is to look after their mates who are in need. The least we as politicians can do is to assist them to the full, and the most appropriate way to do this is to regularly update and improve the legislation which deals with the conditions affecting our affected veterans. I know that the inclusion of nine areas of service which extend eligibility for disability pensions and treatment for injuries or diseases incurred whilst serving there will be applauded by the many ex-service men and women who to date have not received this recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, this bill will give those veterans who are income support recipients the ability to claim an annual advance on pensions. Disability pensioners, war widows and war widower pensioners will welcome the access to a lump sum advance on their pension and simplification of the calculation of the amount of this advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important part of this bill deals with the Commonwealth's liability for the effect of tobacco use. The dangers associated with the use of tobacco products have been well known for some time, and there is wide community awareness of these dangers. There are prominent health warnings on tobacco products and smoking is forbidden in Commonwealth buildings and many public places. Current service personnel in the Defence Force are discouraged from smoking and encouraged to maintain healthy lifestyles. The Commonwealth should therefore not continue to accept liability for conditions caused through an individual's lifestyle choice. This bill amends the Commonwealth's liability for deaths, diseases and injuries 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8549"> among veterans and members of the Defence Force caused by the use of tobacco products where that use commenced or increased after 31 December 1997. There is no doubt that this measure will also be applauded by the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth should provide clear warnings and guidelines which are in the best interests of the individual. Too often it is found that wisdom comes easy in hindsight. Not only should compensation be entertained when legislation does not allow for certain incidents but education and clear measures designed to protect each serving individual should be enacted as well. I again reflect on Brigadier Hughes's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of us brought home our own private ghosts from that war. Personally I don't think they were much different to ghosts from any other war. When one considers the conditions under which soldiers fought during the first world war, then the Vietnam War was a walk in the park. What makes the ghosts from Vietnam appear worse to us is the treatment meted out to returning servicemen by the media, the politicians, the bureaucracy and worst of all, by the public. We were made to feel guilty for serving our country! Those who served during WW1 and WW2 were treated as heroes and cloaked in an aura. If they drank too much they were forgiven because, after all, "they'd been through the war". If they couldn't hold down a job everyone understood because: "weren't they just out of the army?" I know! I was one of their greatest admirers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We should learn from our mistakes and never again allow a negative attitude to reflect on those who served and still serve. Instead, we have the solemn responsibility to ensure that, for those we send out in our name to uphold peace and the great Australian tradition of looking out for our mates, our legislation recognises and protects their interests on their return to our shores. For instance, the recent announcement by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, recognised the fact that the additional issue of the Australian Service Medal to Australian servicemen who received imperial awards made all the difference in feeling accepted by Australian authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the minister's recent visit to my electorate of Paterson, I have received numerous letters of congratulations on her solid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support for this initiative. Surely that is a strong indication that our role as legislators is appreciated but, even more importantly, constantly monitored. In addition, it is important to recognise the other people who serve, like the women's auxiliaries of the RSL, and the tremendous work which is undertaken by Legacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House at the moment, although small in measure, marks another important milestone in the history of our veterans' affairs. Although we have a lot further to go on our veterans' affairs legislation amendments, I wholeheartedly support the current bill and commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). I do so because, as he indicated, the process which has brought this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R278">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill</XREF>  to the House really is confused and secretive and it has produced inconsistent handling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition had an election commitment to review the anomalies that exist in relation to veterans' entitlements. In our view they clearly have not been successful enough in removing those anomalies. We welcome the extension of recognition for operational service to a number of areas including the Far East Strategic Reserve and to Ubon. We also acknowledge the extension of service pension entitlements to some categories, primarily the United Nations peacekeeping categories and importantly to embassy guards and evacuation personnel who remained in Vietnam after January 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view the extensions, as welcome as they are, simply do not remove all the anomalies. It seems to us that there are three substantial anomalies remaining. There is the naval component of the Far East Strategic Reserve and their eligibility for service pensions, there are RAAF personnel who served at Ubon and there are naval logistic support personnel from the Vietnam conflict who we believe are being significantly disadvantaged in this process of tidying up anomalies. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8550">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the coalition advances three arguments against the extension of recognition to the RAN personnel in Malaya. They talk about there being no process of allotment of personnel, they talk about there being no operational risk and they talk about the fact that they were not subject to military law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to allotment, the archival evidence clearly contradicts that. There is correspondence to the Defence treasury from the secretary of the navy dated 11 November 1955 in which it is made quite clear that RAN ships were allotted for duty as the RAN component of the strategic reserve. That allotment occurred from 1 July 1955. In terms of the question of military law&mdash;without bogging the House down in legalistic mumbo jumbo&mdash;there seems to be some sort of argument that naval personnel were not covered by military law and rather were covered by naval regulation. Clearly, that is a lot of nonsense. If army personnel are the only ones covered by military law for the purpose of these matters, one can ask how it is that RAAF personnel have been included. So we think that anomaly remains and does not stand particularly close scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that it is the area of operational duty, though, that is the most misunderstood in this respect. I did, several weeks ago in the context of an adjournment debate, read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the operational experience of a former RAN gentleman who had been to see me and had given me a documentary account of the circumstances surrounding the death of Able Seaman Spooner in that period. I have a number of other documents from personnel that I would like to deal with in this debate that I think indicate that these people were experiencing warlike conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, one has to, by way of preamble, say that clearly all these conflicts post Second World War did not have the sorts of characteristics of, say, the Battle of Britain in terms of being a clearly delineated conflict for the purposes of air force personnel. They did not have the characteristics of the Battle of the Coral Sea for RAN personnel. The conflicts in which Australia has been involved in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period since the Second World War have primarily been conflicts which have had characteristics of low level intensity. They have been conflicts with circumstances where perhaps the involvement has not been part of a declared war. There have been circumstances where there has been some contentiousness about Australia's involvement. There have been circumstances where the military conflict involved sporadic hit&hyphen;and&hyphen;run tactics by an enemy, and tactics and acts of sabotage, and limited traditional battles. There were circumstances where the identification of categories such as civilians, combatants, and allied and hostile forces was not always clear cut. It seems that, in those circumstances, some generosity of spirit and some more genuine attempt than what has been apparent by the government to clear up anomalies really ought to be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I would like to recount tales of some circumstances that RAN personnel found themselves in in Malaya to illustrate the sorts of situations that they faced. I have a letter from Keith Davidson, who was in the gunnery division as a quarters armourer. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 26th July 1957 I was serving onboard the destroyer HMAS ANZAC which was attached to the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On that day the ANZAC carried out bombardment, assisted by Army spotter aircraft, of communist terrorist/bandit positions in the Malayan state of Johore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My action station was in "B" gun&hyphen;bay which is a compartment on the deck directly below "B" gun turret. My duties were to oversee the non gunnery branch sailors such as cooks, stores staff etc whose action station duties were to manhandle ammunition onto the hydraulic gun loading hoists as directed. ANZAC's main armament 4.5 inch gun ammunition comprises of two sections the shell and the charger which are united just prior to entry into the gun breach for firing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the bombardment an emergency situation occurred whereby I was instructed, via the "B" gun turret loud speaker system, that `There is a brick and charger dropped into the expended charger compartment, get them out quick.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "brick" is a reference to the 4.5 inch shell, the charger is the brass cylinder containing the cordite which is the propellant, and the expended charger compartment is located in the centre of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8551"> gun bay one deck below gun turret and is where the hot expended charges drop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What had occurred was a hydraulic failure. When the gun barrels were in an elevated position the hydraulic operated `rammer' did not return to the loading position which resulted in the live shell and the full cordite charger dropping down the channel and ending up amongst the hot expended chargers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon opening the access door to the expended charger compartment I saw the shell lying amongst the hot canisters with its nose cone broken. I also saw the cordite charger with its aluminium cover displaced and sticks of cordite melting amongst the hot expended charges. Being mindful of the consequences and with fear my immediate action was to physically remove the cordite charger and its content before flash point occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the above situation, the close proximity of explosives was an extremely dangerous situation which could have resulted in serious damage to the ship by fire and/or explosion and had that occurred it would have most certainly caused serious injury or death, most probably to myself and to the other members of "B" gun bay and the "B" gun turret crew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gunnery operations off the Malayan coast were always in the high risk category when conducting bombardments due to the oppressive heat which resulted in serious malfunction of the gunnery hydraulic systems. The malfunctions usually occurred towards the completion of a bombardment after continuous running of machinery.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an illustration of the real&hyphen;life situations in which our RAN personnel served. To suggest that that is not a warlike situation or a situation exposing them to considerable danger is clearly nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a statement from Joseph Charlton of Devon Hills in Tasmania. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While serving in HMAS Quickmatch during the Malayan Emergency 1955&hyphen;57, sailing in Malayan coastal waters we were either at action stations or at action cruising watches. With the closeness of the shore line we were always in danger of being `picked off' by heavy machine guns which had the capability of both accuracy and range to reach vessels sailing in the coastal shipping lanes.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When our ship was in dockyard at HMS Terror, Singapore, we would have sentries posted on the focsle and quarter deck armed with sub-machine guns. Once every hour we would send the clearance diver over the side to inspect the ship's hull above and below the water line for attached mines. I remember having to get the electrical party to have the flood lights rigged to expose the ship's side. Underwater lights were rigged to assist the diver and also to assist the sentries in seeing under water 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for enemy swimmers. Our passive sonar sets were switched on to listen for enemy approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When billeted in HMS Terror, we had to take part in duties pertaining to the safety of personnel sleeping and working. Part of these duties were guarding the peripheral fences of the establishment against terrorist infiltration. Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers had automatics. Ratings usually carried 303 rifles with one of these carrying a sub-machine gun. When we went ashore from Port Sweatman or Port Dickson, we always went as an armed party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we were allotted to this operational zone, the ship's company was always aware of the dangers from enemy attacks in these waters or on shore.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The list of documentation goes on. I do not intend to read them all on this occasion because I think I have amply illustrated the point. To suggest that these were not real warlike conditions is wrong. That these people are being denied service recognition for that purpose continues, despite the government's efforts in this regard, to be a very serious anomaly indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the position of the Vietnam naval logistics support personnel. On 9 April, the head of the department's Compensation and Support Division issued an instruction headed `Extent of operational service with deemed allotment'. The import was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for deemed allotment cases, the extent of operational service is confined to the day or days when they were in the operational area, and does not extend to the journey from and to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Army personnel have traditionally had the journey to and from Australia counted as part of the period of operational service. The position regarding those who ferried troops and supplies to Vietnam has been contested over the years, with the department favouring a restrictive interpretation. On 22 September 1993, the Federal Court, in the Hawkins case, found against the commission and held that HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>  was allotted for service from its last port of call in Australia to its first port of call in Australia on return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consecutive Labor Ministers for Veterans' Affairs provided written confirmation that the government would honour Hawkins. On 16 November 1993, in response to a question on notice, Senator Faulkner replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Operational service for those members of the Australian Defence Force logistic and support units 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8552"> . . . will now be determined on the same basis as all other members who were allotted for duty in an operational area. This means that journeys from Australia to and from the operational area will be covered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A subsequent Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Sciacca, substantially confirmed that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition argues that the 1995 amendments overturned Hawkins and provided the legal basis for its departmental instruction. The tortuous basis for this appears to be the claim that the 1995 reordering of the act means that the reasoning used in the Hawkins judgment can now apply only to units that were actually allotted as opposed to those that were deemed to have been allotted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's position is dubious on two fronts. Firstly, the relevant amendments were passed as far back as late 1995, yet the departmental instruction that supposedly stems from it was not issued until 9 April this year. I know of no other case where a government has waited over 18 months to draw the Public Service's attention to legislative changes that were allegedly specifically designed to overcome what was considered to be an unfavourable court decision. Secondly, there is no reference in the debates on the 1995 legislation to either the Hawkins judgment or to the position of Vietnam naval logistic support personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech, Mr Sciacca described the relevant amendments in the following terms: simplification of the bill; preservation of the original intention and concepts relating to the requirement of danger from hostile enemy forces; the operational area; allotment; and the specific rights of members of units allotted to Korea but who served only in Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the instructions were criticised by ex-service organisations, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) issued a media release in July this year headed, `No naval veteran to lose any current benefits'. This claimed that no-one `who has current entitlements to pensions, medical treatment or allowances . . . will lose any of those benefits'. He said `The Government has made no changes to the rules'. He also observed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that `no ship transporting Australian forces to Vietnam was ever attacked by an enemy'&mdash;a pointer to his guilt in this travesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister must either accept full responsibility for the change and the consequent reduction in veterans' entitlements or assume control of his department and direct that the instruction be withdrawn. He cannot seriously expect the ex-service community to believe that Labor is responsible for government decisions made in April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In support of the opposition's position on this matter, I refer to a departmental minute dated 28 July 1997. It stated that the 9 April 1997 instruction will apply `to all matters where deemed allotment is the issue'. It said that `it will not matter that in the past a different meaning has been given to the legislation than was intended, no matter that a previous claim had a different period applying'. Clearly, departmental practice changed as from April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that the government should act to restore the entitlements of the naval logistical support personnel to ensure that the journey between Australia and Vietnam is counted as operational service. There are probably a number of ways to do that, most obviously by having the Minister for Defence retrospectively allot the ships concerned. Whatever the government decides to do, it cannot deny responsibility for this situation. It cannot deny that it is assaulting veterans' rights and trying to cover up its own complicity in this or its own responsibility by attacking the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area which is subject to amendment from the opposition relates to the circumstances of RAAF personnel in Ubon, Thailand, in the period after the commencement of the Vietnam conflict. To deny that in a real practical sense these people were not involved in the substance of the Vietnam conflict is simply to talk nonsense. To deny that these people were not subject to direct warlike threat is also nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just give a brief catalogue of experiences. There was a guerilla attack on the US radar unit in May 1965. Aircraft were fired on from the ground while approaching the airfield. A Thai helicopter was shot down in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8553"> May 1967. A United States Air Force C130 was hit by ground fire during its approach to land in 1968. Combat experienced US air crew reported 12 separate cases of muzzle flashes or tracers directed at their aircraft from September 1966 to March 1968. An enemy MiG 21 identified and chased by two RAAF Sabres from Ubon was shot down by a missile from a US Air Force Phantom in January 1967. An unmarked C123 was identified on 1 December 1965. The list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To suggest, as the government does, that these RAAF personnel were not experiencing warlike conditions is simply a nonsense. The government ought to honour its election commitment to tidy up the anomalies once and for all and ensure that justice is done to our veteran community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three specific amendments to this legislation are, firstly, to extend the eligibility of certain benefits to armed forces personnel who served in some overseas deployments, and these benefits will include defence service home loans; secondly, to allow all disability pensioners and their war widows or widowers the possibility of an advance of a lump sum payment of up to $500; and, thirdly, to limit Commonwealth liability for injury and death to service personnel due solely to tobacco use commencing or occurring after 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first part of this amendment is particularly important. As background comment, I should point out that currently there are two categories of pensions and benefits: operation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> al service and qualifying service. Operational service refers to service overseas in a clearly defined area during a war or similar operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Just before question time this afternoon, the former Minister for Administrative Services, Mr David Jull, handed me a signed statement by Mr John Sutherland, his senior adviser, which contained suggestions that some material relating to the matters which led to the resignation of the former minister and the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development had been conveyed to two members of my staff in May of this year. Those two staff members were Mr Grahame Morris and Ms Fiona McKenna. I am this afternoon sending the document to the Auditor-General, and it follows from what I said in the House at question time that it is open to the Auditor-General to interview any member of my staff regarding what is contained in the document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I again affirm to the House and categorically assert without qualification that I personally knew nothing of these matters until the past few days. I can also inform the House that the staff members in question have affirmed to me that they had no discussions with me about these matters in May or, indeed, until the past few days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also inform the House that the provisional advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), which I obtained this afternoon, is that it would not be appropriate, on grounds of possible prejudice, for the statement signed by Mr Sutherland to be tabled at this time. I should also say to the House, given the statements I made yesterday, that, in the lead&hyphen;up to the resignations of the two ministers, I had a number of discussions with both the former Minister for Administrative Services and Mr Sutherland, and at no stage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8554"> during those discussions was any suggestion made by either of them that any member of my staff had been given prior knowledge of these matters or had been involved in prior discussions. The relevance of that is that the context of some of those discussions involve inquiries from me of the former minister as to why information had not been conveyed to me about these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I felt it necessary, having got the document and having discussed the matter with my two staff members and, in the interests of fairness, given them an opportunity to comment, that the House should be informed. I do not wish to canvass the various recollections because I think that does also go to the possible questions of prejudice. But I wanted the House to be aware of that material. I repeat: it will be sent to the Auditor-General, and at all stages I am utterly and completely committed to an open inquiry.</PARA></SPEECH>

He has made an extraordinary statement at the end of a week that has seen two more ministerial scalps.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take advantage of this adjournment debate to speak briefly about my local football team, the Gold Coast Chargers. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This team has come from relative obscurity to considerable notoriety during the last season, and we on the Gold Coast are very proud of its achievements. Its coach, Phil Economidis, was named coach of the year, which was a great tribute not only to him but also to the team. Mr Economidis came to the Gold Coast also from relative obscurity to achieve prominence. He has done that in the Gold Coast community and has had remarkable success with the Chargers rugby league team.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 12 months there has been considerable disarray in the rugby league community at large. There has been disruption caused to the game by the separation into the two competitions. No matter whose side you take in the debate, the result has been disappointing for the sport. I think it has led in part to the disappointing attendances that have occurred at many of the games throughout the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gold Coast Chargers deserve to continue in the competition in their own right. Members may or may not be aware of the proposal to amalgamate the Gold Coast Chargers with the South Queensland Crushers. We do not necessarily object to that amalgamation if it is in the best interests of the ARL competition. But what the Premier of Queensland, certainly the Gold Coast City Council and I are expecting is that the team will continue to be known as the Gold Coast Chargers and that it will continue to play regularly at the Carrara stadium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, the Gold Coast based team has had a chequered history. It has had a number of owners, a number of names, a number of home grounds and a number of fairly dismal performances in the competition. All of that has now changed. The Gold Coast community has demonstrated over the last season that it has the capacity to deliver very large crowds to our home games at Carrara, which incidentally is where I happen to live. In fact, I can walk to the game. But I must say that that is not the reason I am necessarily concerned about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Gold Coast has demonstrated that it has the capacity to support a team in the ARL competition. We have done that with some very substantial interest in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8555"> home games. We have also demonstrated it with some substantial interest in our away from home games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make clear my very strong support for the moves by the Gold Coast City Council, by our mayor Gary Baildon and by a number of councillors&mdash;in particular Dawn Crichlow, who has put an enormous effort into ensuring that we have a team that not only is an ongoing Gold Coast team that we can call our own but also continues to be based at Carrara.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the arrangement that the Gold Coast City Council entered into with the ARL was one that in effect guaranteed that the team would continue to play at that stadium until the end of the 1998 season. The Gold Coast City Council has spent a very large amount of money on upgrading the facility. The stadium at Carrara is now one of the best rugby league facilities in the competition. I indicate my support to the Gold Coast City Council, and I want to indicate to the ARL in no uncertain terms&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time, I was asked several questions by the member for Hotham relating to forward dates and overnight claims. I will take you through those dates sequentially. The first one was 15 March 1996. I was scheduled to attend the state National Party election campaign launch 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in Shepparton in company with three state parliamentary colleagues. At the last moment, I cancelled and remained working in my Melbourne ministerial office until late. The claim for Melbourne this night is correct. However, the charter flight went ahead nonetheless.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three state parliamentary colleagues. It was wrongly submitted for payment by me. It was submitted several weeks later, on 6 May, with another account and was a genuine oversight on my part. Naturally, I did not receive the money and will accept the responsibility of arranging repayment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to 15 July 1996. The claim for Canberra is incorrect. My records show that I was at my home at Nambrok; therefore it is a wrong payment of $145. On 16 July 1996, I did indeed charter to Canberra this day from West Sale. The claim from Melbourne is incorrect as my records show that I was in Canberra. There was a wrong payment of $275. Consequently, there is a $420 overpayment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claim for Melbourne on 5 August 1996 is correct. A hire car collected me at 8 a.m. from my home at Nambrok to drive me to the Latrobe Valley aerodrome and again collected me at 12.30 p.m. to travel to Melbourne for a business dinner. After voluntarily repaying $9,000 of taxpayers' funds, I now find that I will give another $1,462, being the charter of $1,042 and $420 travelling allowance. You can be sure I will be recouping the $1,000 from the passengers on the charter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon in this House we have witnessed the most incredible end to an incredible week which has bathed this government in absolute shame and the nation in disarray. There has been a series of revelations that no&hyphen;one on either side of this House could possibly have believed could have been the case had we not been here and heard them for ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very sequence of events, starting with the revelations on Channel 9 about the cover&hyphen;up of more than $8,700 in false, fraudulent claims by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)&mdash;which were hidden away by the former Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) in his administration&mdash;leads to the knowledge we have now that this could never have been made public to the people of Australia were it not for the fact that it was leaked and the subject of that broadcast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the questioning that has occurred since that fateful evening, and we have seen revelation after revelation. The press today were carrying the story about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his actions in stepping in so speedily and swiftly&mdash;his outstanding demonstration, many people said today, of leadership. And ringing in their ears were his words, spoken here in this parliament only yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also inform the House that I was not informed of these matters when the adjustments were made in May of this year. Given the circumstances, that also was an oversight which should not have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was ringing in everyone's ears. People have a right to be able to believe a Prime Minister, briefed since last Saturday&mdash;when he returned from the South Pacific Forum&mdash;in respect of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to say later in question time, in answer to another question from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I might also, in the interests of full disclosure, make it plain that I knew nothing, as I said in my

<PARA STYLE="Para">These are the words of a Prime Minister, and the people of Australia have a right to be able to believe their Prime Minister. And yet this afternoon, at the eleventh hour, when there is no time left for the debate, and the parliament has resumed, we have this dog's act by the Prime Minister, who comes into this chamber and reveals the memorandum, saying that the knowledge has been in his office, amongst his best friends, his two closest confidants, for a matter of months.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make it absolutely clear. This cover&hyphen;up, this conspiracy to keep the truth from the people of Australia, did not stop with the former minister for transport or with the administration of the former Minister for Administrative Services; it went right to the very top, to the pinnacle. And there is only one way, in the national interest, that this matter can be resolved properly&mdash;that is, not with an Auditor&hyphen;General's report but with a full and open judicial inquiry, armed with the full powers of a royal commission, able to take evidence on oath and to compel witnesses to give evidence.

I am glad he said that, because it was the Labor Party that was the cause of the problem, it was the Labor Party as they went after a Labor rat that gave these issues public prominence, yet it was this coalition government that knew what needed to be done, did the right thing and has put in place a set of standards and a set of processes which should have been put in years and years ago but was not as you protected your mates.

And what has caused this death rattle? We have the Travelgate affair engulfing the Howard government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a circumstance admitted by the Prime Minister today at 5.25 p.m., five minutes before closure at the end of a sitting week. This is the new openness of government by John Howard, sneaking into the House hoping to get his statement on the record whilst the debate concludes. This is the person who, from his own lips today, admitted before question time that he was aware that Grahame Morris had this information back in May. Why didn't he fess up in question time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has he waited until the end of the night to slink in here and scurry out? Where is he in this building at the moment? If he is watching, I challenge him to come back into this place and make a full explanation as to why, if he knew before question time, he did not fess up. The reason he will not fess up is he hopes the problem goes away. Have you ever known this Prime Minister to delve? This is a Prime Minister who, so long as he is told, `It is all under control, we have fixed the problem,' doesn't even ask the question. But here he is today standing by his Minister McGauran, who, within two hours of repeating his statement that nothing had been done wrong, nothing had been claimed wrongly, is in here admitting to four false claims. And why four false claims? Because we put all four to him. There are more to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say to you that the Prime Minister's code of conduct is in tatters. It is only applied when we enforce it. It is only applied when he gets caught out. The circumstances are these: even if the argument is that he knew on Sunday&mdash;and he has admitted that about John Sharp&mdash;why didn't he come into the House on Monday or seek the answers on Monday of John Sharp that he was forced to accept on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8559"> Wednesday?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill is entitled the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R272">Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> and it provides for amendments to four acts administered by the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. They are uncontroversial amendments. Very briefly, there is an amendment to the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 to allow for simultaneous entry into force of a treaty establishing an international organisation and the regulations related to that organisation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, there is an amendment to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 to provide diplomatic privileges and immunities to inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and foreign country inspectors carrying out challenge inspections for such weapons in Australia&mdash;and I think that you would all agree, that is an unlikely event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there is an amendment to the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to give effect to Australia's obligations under the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation Treaty and those under our safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency and other bilateral safeguard agreements with various countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly and finally, there is the amendment to the Passports Act 1938 to add the concept of `recklessness' as a mental element in the event of making a full statement in passport applications, or in support of an application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to debate the majority of the instruments covered by these amendments, but I do think that it would be remiss of me not to pass some comment on some of the issues raised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in his second reading speech when he introduced the bill on 25 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that speech, he made much of the Howard government's professed commitment to the international campaign to ban landmines. I do not think any of us has any doubt about the absolute abhorrence felt by the Australian public in response to the horrific toll inflicted on innocent civilians&mdash;on men, women and children&mdash;right throughout the world as a result of landmines. Those dreadful devices, originally designed for use against enemy troops, are now increasingly used&mdash;intentionally or otherwise&mdash;against civilians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, landmines have increasingly been used for random and large&hyphen;scale mining of agricultural land, and that has been done with terrible results. The vast majority of landmines laid throughout the world have no use&hyphen;by date. They sit and wait for years until they are painstakingly cleared or, as is more often the case, they are accidentally detonated. These awful weapons kill or maim some 30,000 people each year, the overwhelming majority being civilian casualties. Many of them, of course, are children.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8562">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I remind the chamber that the former foreign affairs minister, Gareth Evans, stated in February last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Labour, Australia is committed to, and will work towards, a total ban on the manufacture, stockpiling, use and transfer of antipersonnel landmines&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our support for such a ban was clearly expressed internationally at the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference in Vienna in September 1995. We agreed in the interim, pending the achievement of a total prohibition, not to produce antipersonnel landmines or to transfer landmines to any other country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 15 April last year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) reaffirmed, on behalf of the present government, Australia's commitment to work for the objective of a global ban. The funding for mine clearance activities announced in recent months by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is a very welcome contribution towards that goal. Having said that, I should point out that other elements of the government's strategy have at best been a public relations exercise and, as such, do not advance honest dealing with a problem of massive and tragic proportions. Indeed, on occasions they are more likely to trivialise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 15 April 1996 the government introduced what was described as a unilateral suspension on the operational use of antipersonnel landmines by the Australian Defence Force. It was an announcement made with much fanfare and we were told that it was breaking new ground. On analysis, I think that is patently untrue. It is untrue because the announcement carried a crucial qualification&mdash;the suspension is reviewable. I will quote what the announcement said about the circumstances for its review:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of substantial deterioration in our strategic circumstances in which Australia's security is under threat and the denial of an APL capability to the ADF would result in additional Australian casualties and damage to vital infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the government's ban on the operational use of landmines will continue, but only until such time as their use becomes operationally necessary. I think this is really high farce. It would be worthy of a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister </EMPHASIS> script if it was not such a deadly serious issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one will not argue that, while other countries continue to use landmines, the ADF must be trained to handle them. But the retention of the existing stockpile against the contingency of future operational use is a very different matter. The public demolition of the current stockpile, with the exception of minimum stocks required for ADF training purposes, should be carried out in the presence of the international media&mdash;and we have so proposed. It would be a tremendous boost to the Australian campaign for a global ban, a campaign which has gathered, and continues to gather, international support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal have already taken this step. But, far from Australia proceeding along these lines, we find ourselves as one of only five countries&mdash;along with Ecuador, Japan, Poland and Spain&mdash;who have supported the recent, ultimately unsuccessful, US efforts to undermine the recent signing of the Oslo treaty. All this bears out a pretty sad and generally inadequate effort by the present government to move along with the rest of the world in proceedings towards the elimination of the scourge of landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I wish to cover today was also mentioned by the foreign minister in his second reading speech. It is the government's claim to credentials in the area of nuclear disarmament. I note one assertion in particular, where Minister Downer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also promoted the report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8563">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I presented the report personally to the UN General Assembly in New York last September and also to the Conference on Disarmament this year. I have urged its careful consideration by all governments.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were to be facetious, this could be described as a typically forceful display by our foreign minister, Mr Downer. It is worth recalling what the foreign minister said, as opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, when the Canberra Commission was first established. On that occasion, he described it as a stunt and said that it would only be good for a newspaper headline. Of course, the published report of the commission silenced him on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reflecting its board membership, the commission produced a document which combines vision and realism, making an eloquent case for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, as well as outlining a credible series of practical steps towards that goal. The report's logic is really iron clad. It shows that nuclear weapons have long been unusable, even in the case of attack by conventional forces or of hypothetical attack by chemical or biological weapons. The report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, the only apparent military utility that remains for nuclear weapons is in deterring their use by others. The utility implies the continued existence of nuclear weapons. That would disappear completely if nuclear weapons were eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Some of the pragmatic initial steps towards the goal proposed by the commission included the taking of nuclear forces off alert, the removal of warheads from delivery vehicles, the ending of deployment of non&hyphen;strategic nuclear weapons, and the initiating of negotiations to reduce further United States and Russian nuclear arsenals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any right&hyphen;thinking person would see a role for the foreign minister to do more than simply distribute a few copies of this report in the course of his overseas travels. We did, at the time, advocate that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should attend the United Nations to give his prime ministerial imprimatur to the report and its promotion by Australia. It is time that Minister Downer overcame what I think is a touch of intellectual jealousy over the commission and put in place some genuine strategies for global diplomacy to advance the disarmament cause. The minister must remember that Australia's success in disarmament has really been achieved off the back of Labor's diplomatic activism. He could well do to apply himself to chalking up some successes of his own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the facts that I have recounted to the chamber today are merely a further confirmation of an irresistible drift in foreign policy under this government. After 18 months, it is something of a catalogue of woes. To recall in chronological order some of the `highlights' of that policy, I commence with the cancellation of the DIFF scheme barely 100 days into the government's term of office and the enormous damage that did to our regional relationships. That, of course, was followed by the Prime Minister's first visit to Indonesia, with the repetition 16 times on three occasions there that Australia was not part of Asia. That was less a matter of curiosity or discord but more a matter of simply giving offence. It was on that trip that Australia was also described as not being a bridge to Asia, which added to the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the occasion of the Prime Minister leaving Japan early to attend the Liberal Party gathering in Brisbane, where he made his comments on the new climate of free speech in Australia. That, in turn, was followed by the government's speculation about uranium sales to Taiwan. And then there was a good deal of undisciplined comment by the Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8564"> Defence about China's regional security intentions&mdash;comments not helped by the foreign minister, who was in Beijing at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shortly thereafter, the overclaiming of a reinvigorated defence relationship with the United States damaged our relations with China, as I notice Des Ball himself has had occasion to remark upon recently. That was followed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) throwing his hat into the ring by publicising the contents of a private and confidential discussion with the most important economic figure in the United States&mdash;Federal Reserve Chairman Dr Alan Greenspan&mdash;which in turn sent world bond markets into a spin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was followed by the retraction of the invitation issued by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) for Yasser Arafat to visit Australia, with all the angst that caused to the Arab nations, and, of course, the most recent effort, the leaking of the Australian&hyphen;eyes&hyphen;only document which contained such condescending and offensive comments about South Pacific leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only in recent weeks, our isolation on the question of greenhouse gas emission in terms of the world attitude and the fact that we have left ourselves with no fall&hyphen;back position or active diplomacy to put our case internationally should be of concern to everyone. Underpinning a lot of this foreign policy drift has been the serious damage wrought to our regional image by the PM's refusal to confront Pauline Hanson's bigotry and intolerance, and his refusal to apologise to the stolen children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, what we have witnessed these last 18 months is a collapse of ambition in Australia's foreign policy. That collapse was made very clear in the content of the recent white paper on foreign and trade policy. That paper is a security blanket for a government without any real foreign policy ideals and ambitions beyond what Australia is not, and what our foreign policy will not do. It is a C-grade foreign minister's receipt for diplomatic recidivism. The only passion evident is the bureaucratic one for ticking boxes and it fails all the substantive tests. It really represents the withering of an agenda for social change in terms of education, immigration and multiculturalism to a narrow mantra of trading opportunities divorced from their political and social underpinning. It collapses a proactive regional and multilateral agenda to the raw mechanics of bilateral negotiations, divorced from any concept of a community of states in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific among which Australia must find its future. It replaces an unambiguous assertion of Australia's destiny in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific with the timid and narrow complaint that Australia's `core values' need not be surrendered in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The liberal references throughout the white paper to the `national interest' and its implications to `realism' represent a harking back to a 1950s doctrine of international relations and a definitive shutting of the door against any foreign policy which aims at a societal dimension to engagement with the region. With these comments on the white paper, I conclude my remarks this morning.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his second reading speech, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) made reference to a number of areas of considerable interest to me. I intend to touch on several of those areas in my speech in respect of this omnibus bill, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R272">Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . In particular, the minister referred to Lucas Heights and the fact that it would be subject to increased international inspection. Recently, the treaties committee visited Lucas Heights and I was privileged to inspect the facility there. We went into the area where the reactor was. It is a very old reactor, of course, and that is why the government has recently announced a replacement research 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8565"> reactor, that facility being a $286 million facility which will replace the existing ANSTO ageing HIFAR reactor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very useful for me to see that facility and to realise the considerable benefit that facility provides to Australia. It was something I was unaware of. In fact, I had some scepticism about the siting of a nuclear reactor in an area adjacent to a large capital city. I was reminded by the director there, and others, that there is a considerable buffer zone around that reactor of something like 1.6 kilometres and I was reminded of the siting of some nuclear reactors of much greater size. For instance, at the Boston Hospital a large nuclear reactor is sitting right in the middle of the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reactor, as well as the Lucas Heights reactor, is used considerably in nuclear medicine. That can provide considerable advantages that are continuing to be provided for the benefit and health of Australian people generally, and also in enhancing our status as producing experts in the field who can advise other countries engaging in a nuclear program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not a great supporter of nuclear fission as an energy source, but I understand that various countries have to use this form of energy. I would rather have no nuclear energy, of course&mdash;I think most people would&mdash;but we are in a society where we accept that we do have this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits that can be derived from it must not be overlooked. In that respect, I am pleased to hear the announcement of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) about the replacement reactor which will be commissioned in 2005. It will create 800 new jobs during the building phase and, ultimately, the new reactor will be a much safer and more efficient facility in its use and operation. The actual ANSTO reactor contains about seven kilograms of nuclear fuel, as opposed to a typical power reactor which contains about 150 tonnes&mdash;not kilograms&mdash;of nuclear fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">HIFAR is one of 274 research reactors operating around the world and there has been no evidence whatsoever of any adverse impact on the community. There are 180 nuclear medicine centres in Australia performing more than 430,000 diagnostic treatments and tests annually. Almost 80 per cent of these are reactor based and over 50 per cent of the total procedures are for life threatening reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ANSTO is Australia's only producer of radioisotopes, which are used in the detection and treatment of numerous illnesses and medical conditions, including cancer, thyroid and heart disease. Simply put, lives would be lost without a reliable source of radioisotopes. It has to be borne in mind that the half&hyphen;life of some of these isotopes is such that you could not have these materials imported because you would have to have a large quantity of the material to get it in time to the source where it is needed. Even to send this material from Sydney to Perth means you have to send a much greater quantity because of the half&hyphen;life of the material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, while not having turned into an avid nuclear fan overnight, I must admit that the inspection that I, along with other members of the Joint Treaties Committee, had of the facility was a particularly useful one overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the notion of disarmament generally, and the efforts by the government in that regard, I do at the outset commend the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, when in opposition, for his statement that followed the announcement that the French were going to test nuclear weapons in the South Pacific at Mururoa. That was during 1995. In my own electorate of Dickson, I organised a petition which was signed by several thousand people and I delivered it personally to the French embassy in Canberra.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8566">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present foreign minister, then in opposition, took a very innovative and courageous stance against the French testing. Ultimately the former minister for foreign affairs, who took a not so distinguished stand, given the comment that he made in Tokyo, was brought round to the reality that this arrogant behaviour by the French was outrageous. Now, ultimately the French testing ceased. I hope that is for forever, although one can never be sure with the French behaviour in this respect. Certainly, it is something for which I do commend the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of landmines, personnel mines, was touched upon by the shadow minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton). Australia was one of the first countries to support a ban on landmines and is a world leader in de&hyphen;mining.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting&mdash;in fact, startling&mdash;to reflect on the incredible preponderance of landmines in the world. There are 110 million active mines scattered in over 70 countries. There are just as many waiting to swell their numbers, in stockpiles all over the world. The most severely affected countries are Afghanistan, with 10 million mines; Angola, with 15 million; Bosnia&hyphen;Herzegovina, with six million; Cambodia, with 10 million; Croatia, with six million; Eritrea, with one million; Iraq&hyphen;Kurdistan, with 10 million; Mozambique, with three million; Somalia, with one million; Sudan, with one million; and Vietnam, with 3.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one landmine for every 16 children in the world, one for every 48 inhabitants of the planet. It is estimated that 800 people are killed by landmines every month and another 1,200 are maimed, totalling about 2,000 victims a month. One person is either maimed or killed by a mine every 20 minutes. Most are civilians and most are killed or injured after hostilities have ended. Nearly one-third of mine victims have at least one limb amputated. In the last 16 years, the International Committee for the Red Cross has manufactured over 100,000 prostheses for over 80,000 amputees in 45 projects in 22 countries. In 1995 alone, 11,262 artificial limbs were manufactured in Red Cross workshops. In January 1997, the Red Cross was running 19 prosthetic&hyphen;orthotic projects in eight countries, all infested to varying degrees with landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Antipersonnel mines are priced at $US3 to $US30. The cost of neutralising landmines ranges from $300 to $1,000 per mine. Removing the world's 110 million active mines would cost $US33 billion. Experts think that under current conditions it would take more than 1,100 years to clear the entire world of landmines. It is something to bear in mind that in Libya, in northern Africa, there are parts that are still desert&mdash;deserted and non&hyphen;arable&mdash;50 years after the end of the war because they are full of landmines. That shows you the extent of the problem. We talk about pollution and we talk about other things but this problem is a major one. It is a massive one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lethal nature of mines varies. In Bosnia, for example, each blast kills an average of 0.54 people&mdash;I hate to say it that way&mdash;and injures 1.4, while in Mozambique 1.45 are killed and 1.27 injured. It is estimated that up to 50 per cent of mine victims die within minutes of the blast and therefore approximately one person dies in the field for every one who makes it to hospital. Also, 28.5 per cent of mine victims lose one or both legs. Of these, 16&half; per cent have a single below the knee amputation, nine per cent have a single above the knee amputation and 2.9 per cent lose both legs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large number of victims are alone and in isolated places when they are injured, and obviously delays cause exacerbation of already horrendous injuries. Landmines, of themselves, are generally laid in rural areas, far from urban centres and easy means of transport. A large 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8567"> number of victims&mdash;peasant farmers, shepherds, nomads, children collecting wood&mdash;are alone and isolated when they are injured. Some lie with shattered limbs for hours waiting for help, and many die before help arrives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ambulance services are rare and medical evacuation by helicopter is non&hyphen;existent. During what is generally an arduous trek to hospital by what means are available&mdash;camel back, bumpy ride in a truck&mdash;death through haemorrhage, gangrene infection and tetanus, in what are largely non&hyphen;immunised populations, all too often occurs&mdash;let alone all of the psychological trauma involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Landmine infestation increases the likelihood of waterborne diseases, when access to safe drinking water is cut off; of malnutrition, when mines block access to arable land; and of infectious diseases, because vaccination teams avoid heavily mined areas and because the scarcity of resources and equipment to test blood supplies in mine infested countries means they are not always free from infectious agents, so the increased frequency of blood transfusions favours the spread of various diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For amputees&mdash;and this is another terrible statistic&mdash;the cost of artificial limbs is prohibitive. The Red Cross estimates that a child's artificial limb should be replaced every six months and an adult's once every three to five years. A child injured at the age of 10, with a life expectancy of another 40 to 50 years, will need 25 appliances during his or her lifetime. Since prostheses cost $US125 each, this amounts to a total of $US3,125. In most countries where the per capita income is between $US10 and $US15 per month, crutches are all amputees can afford&mdash;if that, sometimes: just a bit of a stick that is made up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Libya, according to a United Nations study, 20 per cent of the total arable land is unusable because of the World War II infestation of mines. A UNHCR study in 1992 found that the majority of Afghan refugees still living in Pakistan mentioned the presence of landmines as their main reason for not returning home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those statistics are really quite frightening. The quantity involved and the cost of removing them really makes us all think and makes us aware of the imperative for all of us as parliamentarians to communicate this message to the people of Australia. When we do hear many people complaining about the cost of foreign aid and other things, we ought to tell them of these sorts of statistics and how, in many respects, we do have a duty to try and rid the world of these horrendous things. That also means, in my view, removing them from the calendar of weaponry that should be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a recommendation in the fifth report of the joint standing committee on this particular area. Since 1941, Australia has made a contribution of $24.5 million to these de&hyphen;mining activities. In the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 15 October 1996, Mr Downer referred to a $12 million, three&hyphen;year de&hyphen;mining program for Laos and Cambodia and a further three&hyphen;year $4 million program for Cambodia and Mozambique for 1996&hyphen;97. This would make Australia one of the major donors to the UN sponsored de&hyphen;mining and ordnance clearing efforts in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is trying to play its part with respect to the clearance and also in taking initiatives to try to rid this world of these terrible weapons and expose some of the countries who are involved in their manufacture and the enormous conflicts of interests involved&mdash;for example, manufacturing them and then manufacturing devices for clearance. It is quite horrendous what is going on in terms of conflict of interest. The countries concerned really have a lot to answer for, and they are generally the ones who have not been involved in the Ottawa conference 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8568"> process. Ultimately, if Ottawa is not going to succeed in effecting a total worldwide ban, then the auspices of the UN must be brought into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, I urge some consideration in relation to these particular matters. I commend the joint committee's report, and its recommendations to eliminate the use of these weapons and also the stockpile, to the House. I think the committee has taken the initiative there. The honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith made some criticism of the minister but it is to be remembered that the approach of the former minister in relation to this area has been somewhat ambivalent. In a speech to the Evatt Foundation on 7 February 1996 the former minister for foreign affairs said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . however much we wish to see an immediate end to the international scourge of landmines . . . an immediate ban is not achievable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our judgement is nonetheless that . . . an incremental approach is the one most likely to be successful.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith said, quite honestly, that until recently many governments had dragged the chain on the landmine issue. This is certainly a criticism levelled at the former Labor government. With regard to Labor's approach in opposition, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It quickly become apparent to me that the landmine issue was something Labor, in government, could have handled much better.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One must acknowledge that we came to this position late. We did so slowly and many would say, grudgingly, more often than not, arguing why things could not be done.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He finished with the quite candid remark that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must accept my share of collective responsibility for an approach in which we lost sight of the most important dimension of foreign policy, the human dimension.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I urge members to consider these matters in the context of the overall remarks by the minister in his second reading speech and I support the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the most significant features of the  <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R272">Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill</XREF>  relate to Australia's obligations arising out of global efforts with respect to weapons of mass destruction, steps towards control of and, ultimately elimination of, such weapons. The bill specifically deals with the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act and the associated international agreements relating to those particular weapons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does come to this position globally with a very impressive track record. As the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) said, the former government in particular can take very great pride in the leadership role Australia played in a range of areas, particularly the nuclear area. Certainly the role Australia played to achieve progress on the comprehensive test ban treaty, which is an absolutely fundamental step towards a nuclear safer world and, ultimately, hopefully, a nuclear&hyphen;free world, hardly needs stressing. The treaty bans tests, which is an important step in creating pressure for a downward spiral in competition in nuclear matters and, equally importantly, it acts as an inhibitor to the development of new generation nuclear weapons. It has been most pleasing in the last week to see that President Clinton has now taken legislation to the United States Senate with respect to the United States position on that particular treaty. Its profile in international circles was achieved through Australia's efforts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8569">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reference has been made to the Canberra Commission on nuclear weapons. The words of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, remain very much the case. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless we take action now, the nuclear competition that characterised most of the second half of this century will very likely return&mdash;and probably in a much more unstable and multipolar form. The world must extricate itself from the circular argument that we need nuclear weapons because we have nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, the main recommendations of the commission were taking nuclear weapons off alert, removal of warheads from delivery vehicles, ending deployment of non&hyphen;strategic nuclear weapons, ending nuclear testing, initiating negotiations to further reduce US and Russian nuclear arsenals, agreements amongst the nuclear weapons states of reciprocal no-first-use undertakings, and a non&hyphen;use undertaking by them in relation to the non&hyphen;nuclear weapons states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, Australia has an important record in terms of senior personnel. The appointment of Richard Butler as chair of the United Nations Special Commission with responsibilities in Iraq is a reflection of Australia's importance in this area, and Dr Gee's appointment as deputy director of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is another important and noteworthy appointment which reflects credit on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also ought to refer to the efforts of the former foreign minister, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), in testing matters in the International Court of Justice with respect to the legality of the use of nuclear weapons. Once again, that was a key opinion forming and policy forming initiative taken by the former government which, to its credit, the current government continues to provide some support for, but in my submission is not sufficiently energetic in its pursuit of. There will be a couple of matters in that respect that I want to talk about later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What really is required now is for Australia to be taking some fresh initiatives, building on the credibility it has internationally in this area and its position as a well placed middle ranking power. Certainly, it is critical for encouragement from all countries, but particularly from countries like Australia, to be present to encourage the United States and Russia to really get on with the START III process, the strategic arms reduction treaty process. There continue to be difficulties in the Russian Duma, the Russian parliament, with respect to completion of the START II process completely. We ought to be playing an active role in encouraging both nuclear superpowers to get on with the task and not dilly dally in pursuing the agenda further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further effort is required in terms of attempting to achieve a ban on the production of fissile material, plutonium and highly enriched uranium. A recent edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</EMPHASIS>, the May/June 1997 edition, outlines the size of the problem the world has with fissile material. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nuclear club has produced some 200 metric tons of weapon plutonium. An equal amount of reactor-grade plutonium reprocessed by Britain, France and Japan is all piled up with no place to go. It will not be used in breeder reactors until the second half of next century&mdash;if then. Meanwhile, over the next decade, reprocessing will add another 160 metric tons to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither Americans nor Russians know exactly how much highly enriched uranium they have. They only know that they have a lot. The authors' estimate of 1,400 metric tons of "excess" highly enriched uranium includes neither the uranium in current arsenals nor an amount estimated to supply the world's nuclear submarines for the next 50 years. If blended down and used as reactor fuel, excess weapon uranium alone could supply the world's reactors with fuel for more than eight years. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8570">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The world does have an immensely serious problem in terms of the ongoing production of fissile material and the ongoing stockpiling of it. The experience in recent years with both Iraq and notably North Korea in terms of the production of fissile material shows the immense threat to global stability that is caused by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, there are complex and difficult issues because of the competing interests between nuclear states, threshold states, and non&hyphen;nuclear states having different circumstances and different strategic requirements. It is going to be an extraordinarily difficult process to achieve a treaty which moves to ban the production, and I would suggest also, take active steps to reduce stockpiles of fissile material. That is no reason why it should not be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arms Control Today</EMPHASIS> magazine in October 1995 by Fetter and von Hippel the following was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A global, verified ban on the production of fissile materials for nuclear explosives is therefore an essential part of any comprehensive nuclear disarmament and non&hyphen;proliferation regime. A cutoff would limit the size of potential nuclear arsenals. It would make reductions irreversible if fissile material were transferred from dismantled weapons and other unsafeguarded stocks to non&hyphen;weapons use or disposal under international safeguards. Also, a cutoff would strengthen the non&hyphen;proliferation regime by opening nuclear facilities in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">all</EMPHASIS>  the states to international inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that there is an extremely positive role for Australia to play now, following on from the lead role we played in the comprehensive test ban treaty process, to be working actively and aggressively in the diplomatic field to achieve a situation where there are serious efforts to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agenda has been around for a little while. In September 1993 the United States moved to a position where it ceased being an opponent to a fissile cut&hyphen;off. Also in 1993, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution without opposition calling for talks on a `non&hyphen;discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is now four years ago, and I suggest that there need to be fresh efforts in that respect. Australia is certainly well placed to provide a lead in that. In fact, the article I was quoting from by Fetter and von Hippel in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arms Control Today</EMPHASIS> magazine makes it very clear that it is essentially a task for non&hyphen;nuclear weapons states to provide the lead on this, given the vested interests that clearly exist amongst the states that possess nuclear weapons or are on the threshold of obtaining them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before us also deals with the chemical weapons convention. The chemical weapons convention bans the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, and it establishes a verification regime with respect to those weapons. We wholeheartedly endorse that process, but I take the opportunity in this context of suggesting where fresh new effort ought to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the government's attention to the biological and toxin weapons convention, which was established in the early 1970s and for which there is no verification regime. The importance of taking new initiatives in respect of biological weapons and generating a verification regime for them despite the difficulties, some of which I will refer to, has recently been demonstrated by the experience of the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq. Despite the fact that Baghdad was a 1972 signatory to the biological weapons convention, it had produced and converted to weapons large quantities of biological warfare agents. In addition, Iraq had deployed aerial bombs and Scud missile warheads filled with biological 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8571"> agents to four locations prior to the Gulf War and had pre&hyphen;delegated authority to launch these weapons if Iraq had been attacked with nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally frightening is the potential for non&hyphen;state criminal or terrorist use of biological weapons. In Japan the Aum Shinrikyo sect, which launched the attacks on the Tokyo subway in March 1995, used the nerve gas sarin, but it had initially been working on biological weapons. According to some analysts, it appears that biological agents were the group's preferred weapons of choice&mdash;and the source for that observation is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arms Control Today</EMPHASIS> magazine of January/February 1997 by Graham Pearson&mdash;so we are dealing with a real world situation where either at state level or non&hyphen;state level there is a capacity to use biological weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world is a different place from the one that existed in the early seventies when the convention was negotiated. At that stage, according to the literature, there was a perceived lack of military utility in the utilisation of biological weapons, and there was a view in the context of the discussion about verification that in the Cold War context any verification would be unacceptable to most states because of the intrusive nature of what would be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, though, there have been a range of scientific developments which have, according to the literature, increased the utility of biological weapons through, for example, genetic engineering techniques. We have had the end of the Cold War and an acceptance in other arms control processes of greater levels of intrusive verification. There is no reason that that process cannot also be negotiated with respect to biological weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been an increase in the number of countries which apparently have been developing biological agents&mdash;in the literature, about a dozen. In the literature, they are described as `the poor man's atomic bomb'. They are very much a last resort for nations that do not have the capacity to readily develop more sophisticated weapons, but in terms of weapons of mass destruction, nonetheless, these are pretty scary and horrific agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Biological weapons do not require costly infrastructure. Unlike chemical or nuclear weapons, there is no distinctive precursor material or types of equipment required specifically for weapons production. The sort of equipment that is used to produce biological weapons has almost in all circumstances legitimate commercial use and is widely available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, despite the difficulties I have described in achieving a verification regime, we need to be taking initiatives. Australia is extraordinarily well placed to take initiatives to beef up significantly the biological weapons convention and to introduce a verification aspect to it. There have been difficulties in the past, I understand, with the United States's position on this, where the US has been concerned that intrusive inspection with respect to biological weapons could produce industrial espionage problems in their pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. There are real difficulties in finding the smoking gun, as it were, with biological weapons because of the comparative ease of dismantling production. Nonetheless, despite this, these are not sufficient reasons for not taking swift and meaningful steps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In literature that I have looked at&mdash;once again, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arms Control Today</EMPHASIS>, April 1995&mdash;there is an article by Tucker entitled, `Strengthening the biological weapons convention'. It makes a number of suggestions about off&hyphen;site and on&hyphen;site inspection techniques which ought to be negotiated into the international convention in respect of those weapons. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Possible off&hyphen;site measures include: surveillance of scientific publications, data declarations, notification of activities, remote sensing, and environmental sampling and analysis. On&hyphen;site measures include: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8572"> scientific exchanges, visual inspections, interviews, identification of relevant equipment, sampling and analysis and continuous monitoring with cameras or other sensors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Backing that up there has to be a serious regime of penalties for non&hyphen;compliance and some sort of international secretariat to enable the verification regime to have real meaning. There has to be a willingness in the international community to draw adverse inferences, and very strong adverse inferences, from excessive secrecy in countries with respect of biological weapons, or suspected biological weapons activities. Certainly, misrepresentation during on&hyphen;site inspections ought to draw very severe adverse inferences based on experience with other verification techniques in arms control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of the amazing advances in biological science, there are also required a capacity and a willingness to continually update the terminology of the convention. In the early 1970s, when the convention was established, molecular biology, genetic engineering, genome studies, and so on, were quite different and significantly less advanced in both a general sense and a military application sense than is the case presently. So, in the light of scientific advance, there needs to be a willingness to continually update the international and the diplomatic communities' understanding of these issues and a willingness to take steps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in the Pearson article that I have referred to, a very relevant point is made in the conclusion where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather, measures already internationally accepted in other arms control regimes need to be tailored and integrated into a verification regime for the BWC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the biological weapons convention&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The developments since the third review conference make it clear that the strengthening of the BWC is an urgent task, and as President Clinton said in September 1996, "We should aim to complete this task by 1998." The time for action is now.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, the time for action is now. I would certainly be urging the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and his colleagues to build on the very substantial credentials that Australia has internationally in arms control&mdash;the credentials and reputation that the government has inherited&mdash;to pursue actively a fissile material ban and steps in relation to biological weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the brief time I have left I will touch on two other things. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) referred to landmines. I think all of us in this parliament concur on the importance of continuing efforts. I notice the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) sitting opposite. This time last year he and I were in Peshawar, in Pakistan, and were briefed on the involvement of Australians in relation to the decommissioning of landmines. It is vital for all sides of the House to continue actively to make it known to the government that Australia's efforts in that respect ought to be pursued most aggressively and actively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also deals with some consular matters and the foreign minister referred to consular matters. I will briefly refer to the need for Australia to consider significantly upgrading its consular activities in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Croatia and Bosnia, both of which have sizeable communities resident in this country. It is a significant disadvantage to those communities in Australia that there is no representation in Zagreb. Vienna, I am sure, is a much more pleasant place for Australian diplomats and consular officials to live, in some respects, but the cutting edge, and the interests of Australians from those former republics, would be significantly enhanced by the government paying attention to beefing up its consular services in those regions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R272">Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  this morning. Before I get to the substance of my remarks I would like to pick up on a couple of points made by the previous speaker, the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would certainly agree that there is, to a large degree, a bipartisan view on many of the issues that are covered by this bill. Australia does have a good reputation and this government has been pleased to continue a number of the initiatives that were put in place by the previous government. That has particularly been the case with the CTBT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also agree with many of the comments by the member for Maribyrnong concerning biological weapons. In a previous life, when I served in the military for some two dozen years, those sorts of issues were things that I became very well aware of, with almost a coalface working&hyphen;level approach, and I very much agree with many of the comments he made. He also made some valid points about genetic engineering. In a previous parliament one of the committees undertook a formal study on genetic manipulation, genetic engineering. It seems to me that that is a field which is moving so rapidly, and on an ongoing basis, that it is very much an area that we need to look at on a regular updating basis. It is perhaps time we did some more work in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Maribyrnong also referred to a trip that he and I made last year to Pakistan, where we were briefed in Peshawar on the subject of landmines. I will return to that subject later in my remarks, but I acknowledge that he and I were there. I can also inform the honourable gentleman that, even more recently, Madam Deputy Speaker Sullivan and I were briefed on the subject of landmines in Laos, where we were part of a delegation. Only two weeks ago, we and other members of the delegation were having a very comprehensive briefing and demonstration. I can inform the House that Madam Deputy Speaker very spectacularly pressed the button that caused a detonation as part of the demonstration. It was very carefully arranged that hers was the biggest bang of the entire demonstration!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I am being flippant, the point that I want to make in alluding to this is that there is no question that Australians overseas are playing a very prominent role in the area of de&hyphen;mining. We have obviously very considerable skills. Particularly in Asia and South&hyphen;East Asia, huge areas are affected by landmines. It was interesting that not only do we have Australians&mdash;both military and civil personnel in their own right&mdash;in various parts of the South&hyphen;East Asian area but also that, in an American team in Laos, one of the first people we met was a military fellow who was in fact an Australian, on secondment to the US military forces, who had been posted back to Laos as part of the military de&hyphen;mining team. Even the Americans could not do without the Australian expertise, a fact which we were obviously very pleased to see. I think there is a general acknowledgment overseas that we do very well in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 deals with a number of things. It is an omnibus bill which amends four acts administered generally by the portfolio: the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act; the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act; the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act; and the Passports Act 1938. The bill addresses a diverse range of issues, mainly of a technical nature, including meeting formal legal obligations in respect of international organisations, strengthening international nuclear safeguards standards, and false passport applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the bulk of the amendments included in this omnibus bill relate to the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act. These amendments update an act that is nearly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8574"> 35 years old and they are necessary to keep pace with the increasing number and diversity of international organisations now being established&mdash;organisations which Australia obviously becomes involved with as the world shrinks its boundaries and we become more and more involved in the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, a group of amendments deals with disarmament issues re chemical weapons. The chemical weapons bill amends an oversight in the drafting of the original chemical weapons act. It is highly unlikely, of course, that an inspection team will ever come to Australia to investigate another country's allegation that Australia was in breach of the convention. Nevertheless, should this occur, representatives of the country making such an allegation will now be extended standard diplomatic privileges and immunities, along with other members of the inspection team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, one of the major amendments of the bill is in respect of nuclear safeguards. This will implement the recently negotiated International Atomic Energy Agency Protocol to strengthen safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the amendments to the Passports Act, which is an act from 1938, tighten up the provisions relating to the offence of making false statements in relation to passport applications. It adds the concept of `recklessness' as a mental element in the offence of making a false statement on a passport application or in support of an application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the whole group of legislation amendments are all about recognising that Australia must, on an ongoing basis, be vigilant in updating its legislation and the actions that it takes in terms of the international community. Increasingly, of course, national borders shrink, and communications and travel mean that we live in an international, global world. We cannot any longer put up barriers at the borders of our country and lock everybody else out&mdash;although there are some amongst our number who might wish to do that. The reality of life is that we cannot do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is part of making sure that Australia maintains its responsibilities; that it is part of the international community; and that we look after not only our wellbeing as part of that international community but also our wealth and the importance of jobs. Our international reputation, of course, relies on a number of areas covered by this bill. Our influence is very considerable. As you and I both know from our recent travels and other travels that we have undertaken, Madam Deputy Speaker, our reputation is high in the international community in a number of the areas covered by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker and I were in Peshawar last year looking at landmines. He and I were also in the capitals of India and Pakistan last year where we were talking to those governments on matters such as the CTBT. We did not get agreement but, nevertheless, it was an issue that had to be pursued. This government and members of this parliament quite appropriately have a need and a responsibility on an ongoing basis to make sure that Australia holds its head high. We need a good international standing and reputation and we need to continue to go abroad to push the particular views necessary to maintain international peace and to improve the quality of life not only for us but also for people in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always seemed anomalous to me that, in places such as India and Pakistan which have huge poverty problems, so much of their budget is spent on nuclear weapons and arms in one form or another. Australia needs to make sure that it is a good citizen so it can go overseas and continue to argue the case, on an ongoing basis, to get some of those countries to change their priorities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8575">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of landmines is a very important one. As I mentioned earlier, when we were in Laos two weeks ago we had a briefing on de&hyphen;mining demonstrations and were given a map that showed the number of sites in Laos. It is not a big country; it has a population about the size of Victoria's. Hundreds and thousands of tonnes of mines were dropped on Laos in recent times. The reality is that they were often dropped on commercial centres and key targets such as airfields or runways. Since the war, people have been blown up when they have gathered for activities or when they have tried to get the country going again&mdash;for instance, when they have cleared a site to start a new business, such as farming or industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We visited an aid bridge that Australia was funding at one of the rivers in Laos. We spoke to the John Holland team who were building the bridge. The reality was that the first thing they had to do was to put considerable effort into making sure that the area was cleared of mines. It is a major issue and one which we need to pursue, and which this government is pursuing&mdash;as did the previous government&mdash;with considerable vigour and making more and more funding available to help our friends and neighbours in South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting that in Laos we were given a wooden replica of a little fragmentation mine about the size of a cricket ball. I meant to bring it with me this morning, even though we are not supposed to produce things in this chamber. During the war in Vietnam and Laos these mines were dropped by bombs, and each bomb had about 600 of these little containers inside. It would open up and scatter these things all over the place. They do terrible damage to the population; they are indiscriminate as to whom they hurt and attack and, of course, they are all over the countryside. So when the farmers go out in their villages and are planting their rice paddies, or whatever, they do not know when they will step on one. The result of the landmines is terrible damage to many of the population, and it will continue for many years to come. If children find one of the unexploded little devices they might think it is just a ball and they might pick it up and throw it to one another. I might throw it to the honourable member  opposite from Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) in all good innocence and fun&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subject of landmines is a very important one. By pursuing the sorts of measures covered by this bill&mdash;the chemical and nuclear safeguards&mdash;and the further biological and landmine issues raised by the previous speaker, we can demonstrate to the world that we, as a country, are good corporate and international citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can particularly do that in the Asian part of the world, which is so important to this country's future. This country's future undoubtedly is going to be very strongly linked with the Asian region. It is important from a trade point of view. The reality of life is that we run a huge trade imbalance with Europe; we run a huge trade imbalance with the United States. We are actually running a large trade surplus with Asia, and Asia is the growing part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the sorts of products, commodities and services that are so much in demand in those areas. Therefore, it does help our reputation very considerably when we want to get into trade. If we do not have that trade and do not export our products or services, then we lose jobs. That is detrimental to the Australian community. It is very important that, as part of our overall strategy as a country and as a government, we pursue the areas that are mentioned in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8576"> the amendment bill because it has those broader ramifications. Our reputation is, therefore, important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good example of an allied matter that is relevant to our good reputation and that will have good flow&hyphen;on effects in terms of the tangible issues of trade was the recent bail&hyphen;out of the Thai baht. Thailand got itself into financial trouble and we arranged a currency swap, which does not cost Australia any money and which is guaranteed to come back at a certain time at a certain rate. It is under the management of the IMF, so we are not actually losing any money at all. It is not money that we would be spending on anything else, but it provides confidence to Thailand. It was interesting that, when we undertook that act, the foreign secretary of the Philippines, who was here at the time, said that it was the single most confidence building act that Australia has committed in the last 10 years in terms of our reputation with Asia. We were part of the team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, when you and I were in Thailand only last week on a delegation, we had a meeting with the deputy foreign minister of Thailand as well as with many other officials. Their attitude was quite simple: that Australia had demonstrated that a friend in need is a friend indeed, and we had done the right thing to support Thailand. Although there are those in our community who will say we should have spent the money on somebody else, it was not a question of spending money, it was not a question of lending money. It was a currency exchange. It has cost this country nothing at all other than gaining us a lot of goodwill and we have a guaranteed safeguard in terms of getting it back. There is no cost associated with it, but there is tremendous goodwill associated with it, and our reputation throughout Asia has grown tremendously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With you, Madam Deputy Speaker, on that same delegation I attended the ASEAN interparliamentary organisation in Indonesia a couple of weeks before we were in Thailand. We met all of the ASEAN countries while we were there and a similar attitude was espoused by all of them that quite clearly Australia was seen to be focusing on Asia. It was seen to be a good neighbour; it was seen to be a good friend; it was doing all the right things in terms of nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, landmines and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seen as a country to be very clearly making our contribution. We make that contribution in the international community in these intangible areas, although it is very tangible when you are out there de&hyphen;mining and saving lives. We make that contribution and, of course, it stands us in very good stead when we then want to trade and to sell our services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that we have here some legislation which is practical and necessary and an ongoing part of the updating of our mechanisms for dealing with the international community, which is an important part of the broad canvas of government activity. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said in his second reading speech that this bill, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R272">Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , makes a number of unrelated amendments to four acts administered by either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). To all intents and purposes, it is an innocuous piece of proposed legislation&mdash;five out of the six major amendments relate to Australia's obligations under international treaties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These include the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and their Destruction; the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources; the Commission for the Conservation of Southern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8577"> Bluefin Tuna; the Treaty on the Non&hyphen;Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and the protocol additional to the agreement between Australia and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the application of safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the Non&hyphen;Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this parliament is to enact legislation giving effect to Australia's obligations under international treaties, it is important that members of the parliament have a full and real role in examining those obligations before they become binding on Australia. This is a concern I have raised on previous occasions, and I will dwell on it to some extent today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, in opposition, had much to say about the way in which the former Labor governments entered into and ratified international treaties, before tabling them in the parliament as a fait accompli. The treaty making process followed by the previous government was seriously deficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following its election, the present government, to its credit, acted quickly to try to remedy some of those deficiencies. Just two months after the election, the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in the House announcing reforms to the treaty making process. Unfortunately, very few members were afforded the opportunity to debate that statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four principal reforms were announced. The first was that, after signing a treaty on behalf of Australia, the government will prepare a so&hyphen;called national interest analysis, which will note the reasons why Australia should become a party to the treaty. Where relevant, that will include a discussion of the foreseeable economic, environmental, social and cultural effects of the treaty; the obligations imposed by the treaty; its direct financial costs to Australia; how the treaty will be implemented domestically; what consultation has occurred in relation to the treaty; and whether the treaty provides for withdrawal or denunciation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said, in his statement of May last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultation will be the key word, and the government will not act to ratify a treaty unless it is able to assure itself that the treaty action proposed is supported by national interest considerations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If successful, this approach would allow selected members of the community to consider the terms of treaties which Australia had already signed, in order to recommend reservations or amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, the government undertook to table each treaty in parliament after it has been signed, but at least 15 sitting days before the government takes action, which would bind Australia under international law to the terms of the treaty. The national interest analysis will be tabled with the treaty to which it relates. To be successful this must allow sufficient time for members to debate the terms of the treaty and the national interest analysis, and allow us to raise any issues of concern with our constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third reform proposed by the government was the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee on treaties, to consider tabled treaties and the national interest analysis. In practice it has not been open to members of parliament to debate the reports of that committee, and that is a matter I regret. You would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, that those reports are tabled during private members business time. There is a selective list and some mystery as to how one gets onto it, but it seems to me that members of the committee are given the privilege of debating their own report but no&hyphen;one else in the parliament is. I think that could be improved. The honourable Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) said, at the time of the announcement:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8578">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee process will provide an opportunity for greater Parliamentary and community involvement in the treaty process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final main reform was the proposal by the government to support the creation of a treaties council as an adjunct to the Council of Australian Governments, COAG. The government stated that the Treaties Council will have an advisory function in the context of Commonwealth&hyphen;state consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs also said in a statement at the time of the announcement of the reforms that it is particularly important that the fundamental rights of people to scrutinise the way international law is made be upheld. Nearly 18 months have passed since that announcement. Now is probably a good time to assess the success or otherwise of the government's reforms to the treaty making process. Before I do so, I note that under the constitution the signing of a treaty is an exclusive function of the executive branch of government. Signature amounts to a commitment by the signing country that it supports the principles of the treaty and will refrain from any action which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty. Depending on the terms of the treaty, signature alone will not bind a country under international law to implement the treaty. In such a case, the further step of ratification is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of a multilateral treaty, a country may be permitted to make a reservation when it ratifies a treaty stating that the country does not commit itself to comply with a particular provision or provisions. Reservations are permitted so that the fact that a country disagrees with one or two clauses in an important treaty will not prevent it from signing and ratifying the treaty. A country is not permitted under international law to make a reservation which is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are therefore two opportunities for the community and the parliament to take part in the treaty making process. The first is by undertaking thorough consultation across the country with interested parties during the period of negotiation of the treaty and prior to the government's signing the concluded treaty. The second is by encouraging debate and consideration of the actual terms of the concluded treaty, after signature but prior to ratification. While the latter would not prevent Australia's entry into a treaty, it would allow the community and the parliament to call on the government to lodge reservations before binding Australia under international law to implement the treaty. The issue of lodging reservations is not a theoretical one but, from experience, it is of real concern to many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more undemocratic actions of the previous Labor government took place in connection with Australia's entry into the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. There was great concern in Australia about the potential effect of the convention on family life in this country. There was particular concern, evidenced by the great many petitions lodged in the parliament, about the convention's potential to undermine parental rights and responsibilities, particularly in relation to education, religion, association with others and privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The articles of the convention relevant to these issues contained no express recognition of the primary rights and responsibilities of parents but appeared to give absolute rights to the child. Consequently, the former member for Kooyong, the honourable Andrew Peacock, placed a motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> of this House calling for the government of the day to undertake 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8579"> that, in the event that Australia ratified the convention, reservations would be lodged to safeguard the inalienable rights of parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then Labor government, in what I describe as an outrageous contempt for the democratic process, denied the parliament the opportunity to even debate the motion. On 17 December 1990, while the motion was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> but before it had been debated, the then government ratified the convention for Australia with no reservations. The action of the then government ensured that there was no discussion of the convention in this House prior to its ratification. It was presented as a fait accompli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the present government seems unlikely to have any part in the sort of undemocratic practice represented by this, the last 18 months have shown that there is substantial room for improvement in the procedure introduced last May to reform the treaty making process. First, the treaty making process must not be allowed to disenfranchise Australians. Second, we must ensure that our international trade agreements reflect the full and best interests of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to a serious inadequacy in the consultation process that was brought to my attention earlier this year. On 15 May, I debated the second reading of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997. That bill formalised Australia's undertakings made in a double tax arrangement with Vietnam as far back as 1992. The agreement was examined by the parliamentary treaties committee earlier this year, pursuant to the government's procedure, as it is now laid down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Chartered Accountants made a submission to the treaties committee that was critical of the agreement. The ICA was concerned that the agreement had limited application to Australian exports. The ICA went on to state its belief that industry had not been adequately consulted in the formulation of the double tax agreement. That same body said in its submission that, with such proposed arrangements, the Australian Taxation Office should seek early and extensive deliberations with all relevant professional parties. The ICA said that organisations with expertise in the field of international tax law should be consulted once the initial round of diplomatic negotiation has been conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I drew attention to that during the second reading debate on the bill, and I have referred to and sought the government's response to the ICA's recommendation. I went on to note the criticism by the treaties committee itself of the lack of consultation in the formulation of the double tax agreement. According to the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the consultation between the Australian Taxation Office and professional accounting bodies, and the quality of the national interest analysis, was `less than satisfactory.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his reply, at the conclusion of the second reading debate, the honourable Minister for Veteran's Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will be positively looking at improving consultation as part of the treaty process. The government will be responding also to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I look forward to the government taking some early steps to improve the consultation procedures in the treaty making process. The lesson of the Vietnam double tax agreement is that there is scope for improving consultation, before the government signs an international treaty or agreement. This is arguably the most simple method of increasing the scrutiny of treaties prior to execution.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8580">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a variation of a British procedure, Australia might require treaties to be tabled prior to signature, with provision for disapproval by parliament within a set period of time. I understand that the parliament would not have the power constitutionally to prevent the executive from carrying out its treaty negotiation or treaty making role, and that is acknowledged. Only if the text, and not the object or purpose of a treaty, were specifically objected to might parliamentary approval be withheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of that sort of approach are several. If the government gets approval prior to negotiating and concluding a treaty, then Australia will be able to move quickly to ratify and implement the treaty. Contentious provisions can be identified early and, if necessary, have reservations placed on them. This proposed procedure would provide an opportunity to obtain greater input from the public and interested groups, which may lead to greater community support when the treaty is later translated into domestic legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This suggested procedure does not come without its drawbacks. Since Australia could not obtain parliamentary approval of the text of a treaty until the final stage, Australia's effectiveness during negotiations might be weakened. This is a significant disadvantage, of course, in the case of multilateral agreements but it is less so with bilateral agreements. In my view, it is worth taking the time now to examine this proposal and related matters in order to find some balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the concerns expressed by the present government to respond to the demand by Australians for more say in the treaty making process. The government should ensure not only that Australians take part in the process but that consultation is appropriate, extensive and thorough. Without this Australia cannot take full advantage of all the opportunities to form links overseas, including those that will benefit local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that when the government assesses the progress of its reform to the treaty making process it takes my comments into account in the constructive way in which they are intended, and gives consideration to the points I have tried to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already noted, constitutional power to enter into treaties for Australia rests with the government and cannot be assumed by the parliament. Many Australians are confident that the present government will not use this power to enact laws properly within the domain of the states and territories, nor ratify a treaty in deliberate disregard of widespread community concern about it. I await the early fulfilment by the government of the undertaking made to me in the chamber in May of this year on its behalf by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this omnibus bill, the Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, I am going to deal with each of the amendments as there is no overall theme which governs the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first amendment is the amendment to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. The background to that act is that Australia signed the chemical weapons convention on 13 January 1993, ratified it in May 1994 and subsequently passed the act. In the original drafting of the act there was no provision made for observers from a challenge country to be granted diplomatic immunity and privileges when they were visiting a country. The amendment is to govern a situation where a challenge country may determine that a country is producing more than threshold amounts of certain chemicals and may request access to visit the facilities which are producing those chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be extremely unlikely that Australia would ever be challenged under the chemical weapons convention. It would be extremely unlikely that there would be an inspection team 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8581"> that would come to Australia to investigate a breach of the chemical weapons convention. Nevertheless, this amendment will extend the privileges and immunities to the observers from the challenging country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main part of the bill amends the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963. It deals with an act that is 34 years old and there are a number of amendments made. The amendments to that act will tighten the definition of an international organisation for the purpose of defining privileges and immunities. Generally, the privileges and immunities will extend to representatives of an international organisation who are involved in their official capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will also allow for representatives of international organisations to be subject to ordinary Australian law&mdash;criminal and civil law, property law&mdash;and to be able to own property and so on. That means Australia will only be granting the privileges and immunities which are required by international law. The amendment is necessary to keep pace with the increasing number of international organisations. It also allows for things like sales tax exemptions for international organisations which are headquartered in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another amendment allows the regulations regarding the international organisations to come into force when the actual treaty comes into force. It was necessary to amend the Acts Interpretation Act to deal with an anomaly there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment also gives effect to certain obligations. It will extend privileges and immunities to international law tribunals. As I have said before, it will provide sales tax exemptions for international organisations that are headquartered in Australia. At present there are only two, the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in Hobart and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in Canberra. As a South Australian, I wonder why they did not headquarter that in Port Lincoln.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sales tax exemptions will have a negligible financial impact. The one&hyphen;off direct cost to revenue is likely to be about $5,000 to $10,000, and there will also be a net annual cost of $2,000 to $5,000. That will be more than outweighed by the revenue that would be gained from Australians gaining employment at the international organisations and the international organisations buying our goods and services. Again, the impact from any international organisation which does establish their headquarters in Australia in the future will be positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I might just say something on Australia's role in international disarmament. It is worth noting that Australia has been a leading player in international disarmament in relation to weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons and also antipersonnel landmines. Last year the government was successful in concluding the comprehensive test ban treaty&mdash;in salvaging that treaty&mdash;and in September last year having it voted for overwhelmingly at the United Nations General Assembly. It is also worth noting the appointment of the Australians Dr John Gee, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Richard Butler, a former diplomat, to head up international bodies on disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of antipersonnel landmines Australia has contributed to the campaign to end the use of landmines in warfare. In April 1996 Australia indicated it would support the global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of these weapons. It is worth noting that Australia does not manufacture landmines, and it does not export landmines. We still do have an existing stock of landmines, which are used for training and research. As many members would know, the Australian Defence Force has a number of units with expertise in the clearing of landmines, and that was especially visible in our peacekeeping operations in Cambodia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8582">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding weapons of mass proliferation, in September 1996 the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty was endorsed at the UN General Assembly, and the Canberra Commission, which was initiated by the previous Prime Minister, delivered its recommendations to the current government. Those recommendations, especially relating to the transparency of nuclear weapons and to delivery systems, have been sent to every government, and the Australian government has recommended that they consider those recommendations. It appears that they have had some effect, in that they were picked up by presidents Clinton and Yeltsin at the third START meeting in Helsinki this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dealing with the amendment to the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act, Australia signed the nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation treaty in 1970. It was actually signed by the Gorton government. The act in 1987 gave effect to Australia's obligations under the non&hyphen;proliferation treaty and gave effect to Australia's obligations under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It also dealt with things like setting up the ASO&mdash;the Australian Safeguards Office&mdash;and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, though, the lesson of the Gulf War has been that Iraq was able to have clandestine nuclear weapons which had not been detected by the International Atomic Energy Agency. One of the problems was that the declarations were not made when uranium and nuclear material for energy purposes was transferred to contribute to nuclear devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IAEA has improved the safeguards and introduced a new protocol which is going to come into effect in Australia early next year. The practical effect of this will be that Lucas Heights is likely to be subject to increased international inspections. The uranium mines in Australia, and possibly Maralinga as well, are likely to be subject at least to declarations and perhaps international inspections. The Australian Safeguards Office has reported that the uranium mines and Lucas Heights have no objection to this international scrutiny and the stricter regime that will follow it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last amendment is an amendment to the Passports Act to expand the area dealing with the making of false statements in relation to passport applications. It adds the concept of recklessness in terms of people making false statements. As I said before, this omnibus bill is mainly a technical bill dealing with amending certain pieces of legislation. It really just tidies up some areas that were overlooked in the previous acts. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

This bill, as has been pointed out by other speakers, is an omnibus bill and it seeks to amend a number of acts of this parliament, namely the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, the International Organizations (Privilege and Immunities) Act 1963, the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act of 1987 and the Passports Act 1938. Two acts are also affected by government amendments. One is the Consular Fees Act 1955 and, again, the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), his Parliamentary Secretary (Mr Andrew Thomson) and, indeed, the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer), on the white paper on foreign and trade policy which was released only a short time ago. This paper has been treated with adulation widely in the community. It is the first time that any government has brought down a paper on Australian trade and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8583"> foreign policy. I believe that in the past trade and foreign policy has been treated in an ad hoc way, rather than in the focused way as outlined by the white paper delivered by the minister. It is important to note that the government will act in the national interest, be pragmatic and hard&hyphen;headed, aiming of course, to improve the security of jobs and the standard of living of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has pointed out that it recognises that Australia has global interests which require an active foreign and trade policy of broad scope, and that within this framework Asia and the Pacific will be our highest priority, although not, of course, our only priority. The document is a declaration of commitment to the region. Most importantly, the document indicates that the government, in its administration of this area, will place great importance on further developing bilateral arrangements as a means of advancing our interests, not as an alternative to multilateral arrangements but as the basic building block of our foreign and trade policy strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the government, the parliamentary secretary, and indeed both ministers, ought to be congratulated on that particular document which I believe will be a blueprint for foreign policy matters in this country for many years to come&mdash;regardless of what party happens to be in office. I am confident, however, that the coalition will remain in office for many years. The way in which this white paper has been broadly accepted&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am smiling in the sense that I looked at your face and you seem to have an unrealistic expectation of getting elected next time. Obviously the Labor Party will not be elected. The point I am making is that the white paper on foreign and trade policy is a document which is not designed to be a partisan document. It is a document which is a blueprint for the future. I believe that great credit should be extended to those in the government responsible for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, however, the bill currently before the chamber is an omnibus bill which seeks to make changes to a number of bills. It is really quite interesting to see that in Australia these days we seem to be changing legislation often through omnibus bills rather than through individual amendment bills with respect to separate pieces of legislation. I suppose that in a sense, legislatively speaking, this is quite an efficient means of dealing with this matter and I am certainly not about to criticise that this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major amendments will extend to observers the same standard diplomatic privileges and immunities provided to inspectors carrying out challenge inspections under the chemical weapons convention; will allow regulations relating to an international organisation to come into force at the same time as the treaty establishing the organisation comes into force for Australia; will tighten the eligibility criteria for international organisations and people connected with those organisations to which Australia accords privileges and immunities; will enable specific privileges and immunities to be extended to international tribunals in accordance with Australia's treaty obligations; will implement the provisions of a protocol between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Australia to provide for expanded declarations of nuclear items and access to additional locations where nuclear material is customarily used; and will add the concept of recklessness in the offence of making a false statement in a passport application or in support of an application.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8584">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think these particular matters included in the omnibus bill currently before the chamber should be considered to be non&hyphen;contentious. I believe that they are very positive changes and changes which will achieve strong support throughout the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note briefly that the proposed alteration to the Consular Fees Act 1955 will expand the categories of persons who can be authorised to authenticate documents and charge the prescribed fees to include locally engaged staff overseas. The amendment is expected to result in improved and more flexible delivery of consular functions overseas, which should reduce the cost to the government providing those services. It is also consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report in June 1997 on consular services, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping Australians abroad: a review of the Australian government's consular services</EMPHASIS>. The amendment to the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act is of a technical nature only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out in his second reading speech that Australia was going to have increased training for consuls and honorary consuls. I suppose that gives me a brief opportunity to say how impressed I am with many of our representatives abroad. I believe that Australia needs to have as much representation abroad as we can&mdash;within the need, of course, to be financially responsible&mdash;and I am very pleased that the Department of Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade is moving in the direction of co&hyphen;location with Canada of embassies and high commissions, so that in places where we are not able to have a stand&hyphen;alone mission, or where Canada feels that that is not possible, we are able to co&hyphen;locate missions with Canada. We are two middle&hyphen;sized countries and our interests, generally speaking, do not clash. I think it is infinitely preferable for us to have co&hyphen;located missions rather than no missions at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent visits abroad I have noticed that, with many of the new countries attaining independence, Australia has not been able to have resident diplomatic representation in their capitals. I believe that the cooperative arrangement that the department is endeavouring to pursue with Canada will be one means of bringing about cost&hyphen;effective resident representation for Australia in many of those countries. When we do have that kind of resident representation in countries, we are very well&hyphen;positioned to take advantage of trade opportunities. I want to commend the ministers and the parliamentary secretary for initiating this move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an alternative available, of course&mdash;and I think we are also following it to an extent&mdash;and that is having mini&hyphen;embassies. Instead of having missions which have to have 20, 30 or 40 people on staff, we can have very small missions. With all the modern facilities and the communications capacity around these days, it is possible to have a small mission with an ambassador and maybe one or two staff, and when it is necessary to obtain advice from Canberra, it is only a computer, a fax or a phone call away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a very strong advocate of resident representation of Australia in as many countries as possible. I think the department's co&hyphen;location with Canada idea is great and the mini&hyphen;embassy arrangement, maybe on the Slovenian model in Canberra, is desirable. But if it is not possible to have paid staff in the various capitals, then the proposal to have honorary consuls is a very good idea because it is important to provide the best possible services to Australia abroad. It is also important to realise that having local resident representation in countries and their capitals will put us in a very good position when we come to export goods to those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in his second reading speech also outlined the wonderful record of the government in encouraging Australia to become, and remain, a very good international citizen. The minister pointed out, when referring to the chemical weapons and nuclear safeguards acts, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8585"> that it is highly unlikely that an inspection team will ever have to come to Australia to investigate another country's allegation that Australia was in breach of the convention but that, should this occur, representatives of the country making such an allegation would be extended the standard diplomatic privileges and immunities, along with other members of the inspection team. And that obviously is very positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also pointed out that we have a well&hyphen;deserved reputation as a leading player in arms control. I must say that our predecessors also were very interested in this matter, and it is significant that arms control has been a bipartisan issue. But the new government, the new ministers and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs have obviously brought these matters into focus, and Australia is now widely recognised as having taken the lead internationally concerning arms control. Everyone would know that the efforts of this government in the international fora helped to bring to a conclusion the comprehensive test ban treaty. The international community has endeavoured over 20 years to achieve this, but Australia managed to do a tremendous lot to bring this to reality. In addition, over the past year, as the minister points out in his second reading speech, Australia has been one of the leaders internationally in gathering an adequate number of signatures to bring the chemical weapons convention into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing I will mention very briefly is the very strong position taken by the government in relation to landmines. Landmines are completely uncivilised, and this government and the minister, through international fora, have taken a very strong stand. I am very pleased with the results that the advocacy by this government have produced internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also briefly mention the Passports Act. It is very important to recognise that the issuing of passports is a vital role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and it is necessary that this facility be made available to Australian citizens. Of course, a passport is evidence of who a person is and it is evidence of citizenship, and it is therefore vital that Australian passports are only given to those people who are entitled to them. The bill tightens the provision in relation to the offence of making false statements concerning passport applications. As I have said previously, it adds the concept of recklessness as a mental element in the offence of making a false statement on a passport application or in support of such an application. I commend that element in particular to the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very sensible omnibus bill. It changes a number of existing acts. The bill is largely of a technical nature, and I believe it will be supported in the Australian community. The sentiments which have brought about the framing of this bill are very positive, and the changes are necessary. I urge the Committee to support wholeheartedly the bill introduced to the parliament by the government. I thank the Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I have quite got Churchill's frame, but I am working my way towards it! At the appropriate time, I will move two further amendments to the bill. To summarise, it is plainly an omnibus bill that amends four different acts: the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act, the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act and the Passports Act. As the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) pointed out, it deals with a spectrum of issues such as false 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8586"> passport applications, where it introduces the concept of recklessness into the offence of making a false declaration in applying for a passport and it strengthens the international nuclear safeguards standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note there was some debate among members on issues of the environment that merge with issues of nuclear safeguards in this respect. This gives me the opportunity to put on record a defence of the newly appointed Ambassador for the Environment, Ms Meg McDonald. Her appointment was announced earlier this week. I thought it was rather churlishly criticised by representatives of those two very peculiar fringe&hyphen;dwelling parties, the Democrats and the Greens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always amused me that people can be elected to parliament representing the Democrats on the basis that doubt is a legitimate philosophical posture. They think they are in the middle but, of course, as we all know&mdash;those of us in the mainstream&mdash;they are not in the middle; they are nowhere. As for Senator Bob Brown and the Greens&mdash;who would better be named, I think, the anti&hyphen;private enterprise party&mdash;using the cloak of environmental concern for what is basically a Marxist agenda, for him to say&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do, as my colleague points out. But that said, for Senator Bob Brown to criticise the Ambassador for the Environment and say that she was more interested in economic issues than environmental ones is quite ridiculous. We all know that the environmental problems that we suffer on this planet will be solved, as they have been solved in the past, not with political rhetoric or an excess of international fora, but with technology, and technology is a product of nothing more than private enterprise. If he would come out of the closet and declare himself as nothing more than an opponent of private enterprise, it would serve this nation much better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I thank all those who participated in the debate. It is nice to see, from time to time, some bipartisan or even non&hyphen;partisan sentiments being addressed. Occasionally, of course, it makes you nervous when you see the other side of the chamber agreeing with you. It reminds me of the old statement from Chairman Mao `When the fox seems friendly put another lock on the chicken coop.' In this case, I think we can celebrate some bipartisanship that has been displayed in the debate on this bill.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Terms of reference have been released on a review that is proposed of the Aboriginal land rights act. It is worthwhile reading onto the record the terms of that review which are as follows. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 commenced operation on 26 January 1977. The last general review was in 1983 and some important changes have been made to its provision since then. The review will examine and report on the operation of the act and suggest any areas for possible change, including recommending amendments where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the review will consider: firstly, the effectiveness of the legislation achieving its purpose; secondly, the impact of the legislation in terms of its social, cultural and economic costs and benefits; thirdly, the operation of the exploration and mining provisions; fourthly, the operation of the Aboriginal benefits trust account, including the distribution of payments 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8588"> out of the trust account; fifthly, the operation of royalty associations, including their reporting requirements; sixthly, the question of the need for compulsory acquisition powers over Aboriginal land; seventhly, the application of Northern Territory laws to Aboriginal land; eighthly, the role, structure and resource needs of the land councils following the coming into effect of a sunset clause relating to land claims and, ninthly, any other matters relevant to the operation of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review will be required to report six months after it commences. It is not going to be a long review. That of itself worries me. I hope that it is not one of those reviews where the fix is already on, given the performance of this government in indigenous affairs since it came into office just over 18 months ago and the amendments that we now see to the Native Title Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear, and my reservations are, that the fix is on to basically strip the land rights act in the Northern Territory of any of the powers that it gives indigenous people there.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on the opposition side will certainly be having a very close watching brief on that. Any amendments should be aimed at improving outcomes in the Northern Territory. They should not be aimed as a front to strip away indigenous rights. The act is working well. You have established land councils in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an honour and a privilege to have my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) here today. He actually introduced that 1986 bill when he was the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It is a landmark piece of legislation. I anticipate that my colleague will give some instances where all the Northern Territory government has done is just try to attack clauses in that bill and usurp the law of the land. It just loses time after time and has wasted millions of dollars in legal challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of my amendment is aimed at ensuring that the negotiations that have been undertaken between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory in relation to the  Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1997 which is now before the parliament are honoured by the Northern Territory government. There is a history that is laid out in the second reading speech about these particular problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an excellent digest from the Parliamentary Library, prepared by Jennifer Norberry and dated 3 September 1997, which again contains a long history in relation to this. I take this opportunity to commend Jennifer Norberry and members of the Parliamentary Library. They provide excellent research services for us as a parliament but they are not acknowledged, in my opinion, as much as they should be. Jennifer Norberry in particular is a very professional officer in the Parliamentary Library, and in all my dealings with her I regard her as a thoroughly professional and decent person supporting us as parliamentarians. It again shows that we do have in the Public Service dedicated professionals committed to the public service. Too often we hear from this government that you have got to outsource and go out to private enterprise to get the best. I think the Parliamentary Library has the best, and Jennifer Norberry is amongst the best. I commend her again for this digest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we say is that there should be deferral of this bill because the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was recently prorogued for territory elections and it is expected that the amendments to the Pastoral Land Act 1992, in the form of a new bill, will be introduced into the new assembly. We say that there are two reasons for the deferral of this: we want to see the Northern Territory assembly enact its legislation before we on this side approve this legislation, and also we think that there is a broader concern here anyway.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8589">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the use of putting this amendment through if there is going to be a swag of other amendments to the land rights act coming as a result of the review? Let us do them in a package. It is not as if this problem is an urgent one. It is, in terms of its impact on indigenous people in the Northern Territory, but I would not be relying on the Northern Territory government acting in the interests of indigenous people in view of the hysteria that the current Chief Minister goes on with in relation to the Native Title Act when he has an act that is much stronger and there is development occurring in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not a lot I want to say. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will follow me. But basically it is worth quoting from what he said at the time of the introduction of the 1986 bill. I think it is better for me to quote him than for my colleague to be seen as issuing self&hyphen;serving statements. He had this to say, as is shown at page 3 of the digest:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present Act it is possible for Aboriginals to claim title to stock routes and reserves, and a number of the claims that have yet to be heard and reported on by Aboriginal land commissioners are in respect of such stock routes and reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some practical problems have emerged. On the other hand, a claim to such lands may offer, to some Aboriginal groups living in the pastoral areas of the Northern Territory, the best or in some cases the only prospect of obtaining title to some of their traditional lands. On the other hand, to proceed to grant title to some of these areas&mdash;assuming that a land commissioner had so recommended&mdash;would result in the splitting of existing pastoral leases into two or more segments, with consequent disruption and costs for the pastoralist concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, it has been the Government's position that it would be preferable, as a general rule, that claims to stock routes and reserves not proceed and that a program be developed, with the co&hyphen;operation of the Northern Territory Government and pastoralists, whereby excisions from pastoral leases to provide living areas for Aboriginal groups would be negotiated. Useful progress has been made in these negotiations. These negotiations are now well advanced in 40 cases, and actual title has been granted in 13 cases. There are some 61 applications at varying stages in the pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, however, some Aboriginal groups living in pastoral areas for whom the excisions program offers limited prospects and who may therefore, in view of the land councils, be seriously disadvantaged if they were forced to forgo the prospect of obtaining living areas on stock reserves. We have also been discussing these special cases with the Northern Territory Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have now informed the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the land councils and the Cattlemen's Association that the Commonwealth will proceed, in this Bill, with an amendment which will prevent a land commissioner from hearing claims to stock routes and reserves, unless a hearing has already commenced or unless the stock route or reserve is wholly encompassed in the overall area of land under claim. This is a significant concession.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In general, the provisions of the 1987 act commenced on royal assent. However, two of the sections it inserted into the principal act, subsections 52(d) and 52(e), were to come into operation on a date fixed by proclamation. These two subsections related to claims over stock routes and stock reserves. The proclamation was not made until February 1990, and it set a commencement date of 1 March 1990. There is some further explanation of that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> . There is one other part that I do want to quote. On page 4 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for a statutory regime in the Northern Territory relating to Aboriginal community living areas on pastoral land was referred to in Minister Holding's speech above. It had been raised at least as early as the 1970s, and was addressed by Justice John Toohey in his 1983 report on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Justice Toohey remarked in that report:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the amount of land available for claim under the [Principal] Act is substantial, there are many Aboriginals to whom the benefits of the legislation are not available because their traditional country is on alienated land (mainly pastoral leases) which cannot be claimed. . .  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8590">  </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of these communities have no security of title to the land on which they live and many are anxious for that security. Without it they do not qualify for some forms of government assistance and so are unable to improve their material conditions significantly. Understandably, governments are reluctant to spend substantial sums on improvements to land in which Aboriginals have no legal interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1989, an agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, so this has a bit of a history. It appears to us on this side that we really should be deferring this. Let the Northern Territory government come up and enact the legislation, and in conjunction with the review we can look at this in a wholesale way. I think it is absurd continually to have these amendments. There is no urgency for these particular amendments to be processed at this point of time, especially when we hope a review is going to report within six months of the person being appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do reiterate what I started with. I have major concerns about the goodwill and good faith of this government when it comes to indigenous Australians. I do not say that in relation to a number of members on the other side of the House. I believe that there are number of members on the other side of the House who have an empathy and an understanding of indigenous people, who actually have lived with them on the ground, who understand that there has been coexistence, and who respect traditional customs and law of indigenous Australia. My criticisms are not aimed at individual members on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have been shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs for 18 months, and I believe that there is now a body of factual material in the public domain that shows that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has no empathy or understanding when it comes to dealing with indigenous Australians. He is in a time warp, and has a one&hyphen;dimensional, white, Anglo&hyphen;Saxon, Protestant view of the world. His definition of `for all of us' is obvious from the way he has practised it in the last 18 months, and from the legislation that he has sponsored into the parliament purporting to be amendments to the Native Title Act 1993. It is not legislation that a Prime Minister of this country should be sponsoring if he is genuinely acting on his election commitment to represent all of us. It is obvious that his definition of `all of us' is `some of us', and it does not include indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of growing in the office, we have seen him diminish in the office. I would not mind if it was just him diminishing in the office, but he is diminishing all of us. He is diminishing the nation. He is on the path of turning this country into a pariah in terms of the international community because of the way the government has changed direction in dealing with indigenous people. These are points I make against the Prime Minister of this country, because I think he has been a disappointment in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying it is easy. There is prejudice and there is fear out there. That is why I have the respect that I do for the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. As a matter of record, it is well&hyphen;known that I did not support him in either of the leadership challenges against Bob Hawke but, in my opinion, he grew in stature in the office of Prime Minister. He showed leadership and took on the forces of prejudice in this country in his enactment and his sponsoring of the passage of the Native Title Act 1993, without the cooperation of the then opposition. The tragedy for this nation is that indigenous Australians have been used as political footballs by this government since this government lost that 1993 election&mdash;the election that it should never have lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cross&hyphen;party support in indigenous affairs and in immigration went out the window because the then opposition was desperate. They saw power within their reach in 1993 and it eluded them. That is why we had this response by the now Prime Minister, when he was a mere 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8591"> member of his caucus, that forced the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson, and the then opposition parties, not to engage the government in debate and not to engage in a constructive all party response to the High Court's decision on Mabo. That is all right for opposition but it is not all right for government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not all right for the Prime Minister of this nation to set up indigenous people, and that is what has happened from the first announcement of this cabinet that it had appointed a special auditor into ATSIC, which was subsequently held to be illegal three to nil by the Federal Court&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the basis of my broad ranging remarks are that I have moved a second reading amendment that basically says that we want deferral of these amendments until the review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. My suspicion, in terms of how this government will handle the land rights legislation, is directly as a result of observing this Prime Minister in action&mdash;firstly as Leader of the Opposition and now as Prime Minister. In my view that is where I am trying to link them together because there is no need for this. I do not trust the Northern Territory government to enact anything that is beneficial to indigenous Australians, and that is why in my amendment I say that this parliament should&mdash;because we have a special responsibility under the 1967 referendum to legislate for the benefit of indigenous Australians&mdash;let the Northern Territory government enact its part of the bargain first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at this review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. If it is to be an honest, open and transparent review, and the fix is not on, then we on this side of the House would be quite happy to support these agreements. Agreements are about both sides delivering. I understand that there is some cynicism about that but the great tragedy is that trust has gone out the window. Trust has gone out the window because indigenous Australians see themselves under attack. We are all under attack. We are all diminished and it is unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish by saying that there is no urgency on this bill. With the way this government has the Senate program at the moment, that is not a high priority matter. I would urge the relevant minister to accept the second reading amendment. With the other amendments in the last session of the parliament to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act we engaged in a very cooperative approach. That legislation had been waiting for some time to be dealt with by this parliament. I approached the minister's office, we had a number of hand&hyphen;backs, and it went through in the same week. That is the way we should be dealing with indigenous affairs in this parliament because these issues are above partisan politics. These issues are not helped when we start to divide our community, and feed into the prejudices of our community, by holding indigenous people up as a political tool and a political football. I commend the amendment to the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise not to support the amendment proposed by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R243">Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . Before he leaves the chamber let me say that there was a memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory dated 7 September 1989 where it was agreed that certain land would be scheduled as Aboriginal land, that the territory would pass legislation allowing for pastoral lease excisions for community living areas, and that the Commonwealth would pass amendments to ensure the remaining stock route claims would lapse. The legislative action, which was introduced by the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), did not achieve that aim when he introduced the legislation, and I can quote him on that a bit later on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to support the government's legislation, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1997, which provides for the disposal of certain Aboriginal land claims over stock routes and stock reserves, and the removal of technicalities associated with section 67A of the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 2 of the bill is the commencement provision which provides that the amendments contained in the bill commence on proclamation. However, if no proclamation has been made within 12 months from when this legislation receives royal assent, then the schedule commences the day after the end of that 12-month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Items 1 and 2 of schedule 1 amend section 67A of the principal act. This is the most important amendment as it is this section which provides that where the land is subject to a land claim under the act no other interest connected with the land may be considered. It is this section that has caused concern in the territory regarding future land use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 67A(5) of the act sets out conditions where a land claim will be regarded as being disposed of. Currently, a land claim is disposed of if the claim is withdrawn, granted, or if a decision is made to reject the claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 2 of schedule 1 inserts a new subsection 67A(6). This subsection increases the circumstances in which a land claim will be taken to have been disposed of. This will occur where the claim has involved a stock route or stock reserve or where the Aboriginal land commissioner had not begun an inquiry into a land claim by 1 March 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other amendments to the act which territorians will welcome. These will ensure that if the Aboriginal Land Commission is unable to make a ruling regarding traditional owners, or if the claim was lodged after the sunset clause, then the claim can finally be disposed of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this Commonwealth act came into operation over the Northern Territory in 1977, a total of 60 separate parcels of land have been scheduled. This act has provided a mechanism for over half the territory to be granted or be under claim by Aboriginal territorians. The title to this land is generally held by an Aboriginal land trust in fee simple, which makes it the most complete and secure form of title to land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around 700,000 square kilometres of territory is currently held by Aboriginal interests. When enacted in 1977, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provided for the immediate transfer of 258,000 square kilometres of land for Aboriginal people. The act also provides the mechanism for the grant of traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory to land trusts that hold title for traditional Aboriginal owners.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8593">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Land claims are heard before an Aboriginal land commissioner who, after examination of the claimant case, makes a recommendation to the Commonwealth minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs who then has the discretion to accept or reject the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as specifying what land is potentially available for claim, the land rights act also excludes certain land from claim; for example, roads are excluded. Following the enactment of the land rights act in 1997, a number of land claims were lodged over areas of land which included stock routes. Stock routes were not specifically excluded from a land claim in the act. A group of cases in the 1980s established that land claims could indeed be made over stock routes and stock reserves under the provisions of the act. This is not what the legislative draftsmen of the Northern Territory government had intended, and difficulties have since arisen over the status of claim on stock routes and reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1986 the federal Labor government introduced amendments to the act in an attempt to clarify the position regarding stock routes. These amendments, subsequently passed by the parliament, provided that with some exemptions the Aboriginal Land Commissioner should be unable to hear a land claim over a stock route or stock reserve, but did not allow for the claim to be disposed of. That has subsequently caused all the uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1986 the then Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who is present with us today, when discussing the amendment in this place noted that the act presented some technical problems in dealing with claims over stock routes. He said that claims over stock routes would, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . result in the splitting of existing pastoral leases into two or more segments, with consequent disruption and costs for the pastoralists concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, it has been the Government's position that it would be preferable, as a general rule, that claims to stock routes and reserves not proceed and that a program be developed, with the co&hyphen;operation of the Northern Territory Government and pastoralists, whereby excisions from pastoral leases to provide living areas for Aboriginal groups would be negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of 22 October 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1987 and 1989, the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments negotiated a statutory framework for the granting of Aboriginal community living areas on pastoral land. In 1989 a memorandum of understanding which had three parts was signed by the parties. I think this may even have been signed with Mr Tuxworth at Yulara when the member for Melbourne Ports was the minister. There is nothing on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which would tell us that, but from memory I think it was he who negotiated with the former Northern Territory Chief Minister Ian Tuxworth at Yulara. He may correct me if I am wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It allowed for certain land to be scheduled as Aboriginal land. The Northern Territory government was to legislate for the establishment of community living areas on pastoral leases, and the Commonwealth would pass amendments that would ensure that all remaining stock route claims would lapse. That was seven years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As agreed, the Northern Territory enacted legislation establishing Aboriginal community living areas on pastoral land. This legislation enabled certain Aboriginal people to apply for community living areas on pastoral properties, and a successful application resulted in a grant of freehold title to the Aboriginal group. However, the Commonwealth's amendments to the land rights act were ineffective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8594">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the act meant that while on the whole the Aboriginal Land Commissioner could not hear particular land claims involving stock routes and stock reserves, the legislation did not dispose of these claims. As a result of section 67A of the act, land under claim cannot be dealt with by the Northern Territory government. In other words, while the Northern Territory government has fulfilled its part of the 1989 agreement, the Commonwealth has not delivered on what it had agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just now the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) was saying how concerned he was about the interests and the actions of the Northern Territory government, and saying that he did not trust this Commonwealth government in dealing with these questions. Yet this has been on the record here since 1989 and it is still outstanding. Now the opposition has asked to defer it until such time as the inquiry takes six months to evaluate the Northern Territory land rights act. The review announcement has been made, but no chairman has been appointed as yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Justice Toohey reviewed it in 1983, it took the Labor government four years to get the amendments into legislation, and then they were false: they did not work. The Labor Party is now asking for further delays to resolving the section about stock routes, when it agreed seven years ago that it should happen. That is what I would like to say to the honourable member for Banks. It was an arrangement made for living areas, and Aboriginal communities got the living areas, but we still have not got the stock route section resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because it goes into a trust, the land council refused to withdraw the stock route claims. As a result there is still a level of uncertainty over the status of the land under claims seven years later. There are Aboriginal communities out there that want to do something. They want to try and get a bit of economic development, but there are still problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory government has been trying to get the Commonwealth to honour its side of the agreement since 1990. In 1995, after further negotiations between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory government, agreement was reached that the Labor government would amend the land rights act again to ensure that the stock route and stock reserve claims would be disposed of. Notwithstanding the fact that the territory had already fulfilled its side of the 1989 agreement, it was resolved that the territory would amend its community living areas legislation. The NT Pastoral Land Act 1992 would be amended to expedite the granting of living areas to Aboriginal people by the tribunal. However, the Commonwealth conceded that the territory would do this only once the Commonwealth stock routes amendments we are debating today were passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was prorogued on 12 August in 1997 for the territory elections last month. The amendments to the NT Pastoral Land Act 1992 subsequently lapsed and will be introduced in the form of a new bill in the next parliamentary session. A review of the Aboriginal land rights act is imminent and I welcome the government's decision to investigate the relevance of the act 20 years after its introduction. I am particularly pleased to note that the terms of reference include a look at the role and structure of Aboriginal land councils, particularly in light of the sunset clause that came into effect this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came as no surprise to Territorians that on the very day the sunset clause came into effect, the Northern and Central land councils slapped claims on virtually all remaining land in the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am for Aboriginal self&hyphen;determination, but I am yet to be convinced that the mere act of granting land will improve the living standards of Aboriginal Territorians. At the risk of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8595"> sounding cynical, I fail to see how claims over areas like national parks, Alice to Darwin railway reserves, future roadhouse sites, land set aside for police purposes and racecourses, plus a litany of rivers, roads, stock routes and parts of the seabed are aimed at improving the lives of Aboriginal people. For many Territorians it simply looks like a last&hyphen;minute land grab.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wait with interest and some trepidation to see how these claims are settled. I am also interested in the outcomes of claims made under the Native Title Act that exist over Darwin, Alice Springs, assorted pastoral properties and parts of the Arafura Sea to the north. The people in the territory are hopeful that there will be bipartisan support for the amendments to the Native Title Act in order to restore certainty to tenure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As already stated, I am in favour of self&hyphen;determination for Aboriginal territorians but the amount of land held as freehold by Aboriginal Territorians raises serious questions about future land use and management. There are concerns about the ability for the territory government to manage its land. I know the territory government is concerned about the lack of ability to acquire interests in land, short of freehold, for essential public purposes. There is also a degree of uncertainty regarding the application of territory laws on Aboriginal land and the ability to claim public facilities. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties of administrating this Aboriginal land rights act are brought home by the current case before the Federal Court in which the Northern Land Council is challenging the application of territory laws on Aboriginal land. The Northern Land Council claims that by virtue of the land granted under the land rights act they are now entitled to stop people entering, or fishing in, the waters off the top end of the Territory. This application is in several parts and it is important that members understand the dire consequences for the territory if this action is successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, the application is asking for the court to validate the claim that the Northern Land Council has the right to exclude people from entering or fishing in the intertidal zone off Aboriginal land. It goes on to argue that since the NLC did not give its consent, the Northern Territory government has no power to issue licenses under the Fisheries Act in respect of these waters. On this basis, all previously issued licences are invalid and therefore entry into these waters is considered an actionable trespass on Aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the claim seeks to restrain the Northern Territory government from issuing further licences in respect of these waters. There are also claims for damages, costs and other relief that the court thinks fit. This action, if successful, will call into question the ability of the Northern Territory government to govern for Territorians. The Northern Territory government already has concerns about its ability to acquire land for public works for future generations and this court action only substantiates these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The land councils enjoy exclusive freehold on land granted to them under the Commonwealth act. As more and more land is granted to land councils, the Northern Territory government loses its ability to plan for schools and hospitals for future population growth. Naturally, I am alarmed by the prospect that territory laws could be ruled invalid over Aboriginal land. I do not think for a moment the NLC has taken this step in an attempt to protect fish stocks or the marine habitat. There is no mention in the claim of any environmental concerns or sacred sites in the area. This is a blatantly hostile action by the NLC and an action designed to test the limits of the courts and the goodwill of territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recreational fishermen already pay for a permit to enter Aboriginal land to access fishing grounds. This is on top of the money they pay the Northern Territory government for a fishing licence. Now the NLC wants to prohibit the territory government from levying a licence fee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8596"> and have its own collection regime. In my opinion, this revenue would be better spent by the Territory government on fisheries management for the whole territory, rather than ending up in the pockets of a few Aboriginal activists. The Amateur Fishing Association of the Northern Territory has worked tirelessly with the government to implement some of the best fisheries management strategies in the world. I share their outrage at this action by the Northern Land Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginals need to be able to develop land in order to improve their standard of living, something which is simply not happening. It is unclear as to whether this is due to the difficulties of dealing with land councils or the uncertainty of laws governing the land. The issue of development is one that we need to address urgently. All the Aboriginal territorians I have met want economic development for their people, something they have not achieved by the mere fact that they have secured the land. The actions of the land councils are hindering Aboriginal economic development and territorians are becoming frustrated and impatient with the state of Aboriginal affairs and land tenure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claim by the Northern Land Council to invalidate territory laws over Aboriginal land is a serious abuse of their charter. Another disturbing aspect of this action is that the NLC does not have support for it from all Aboriginal communities in the Top End. Some Aboriginals I have met blame the political agenda of the land councils for the level of ill&hyphen;feeling some territorians have towards normal hard&hyphen;working Aboriginals. There is a misconception among residents of southern states that the objectives of Aboriginal Australians and the Aboriginal land councils are the same. Well, let me tell you they are not. The land councils are not acting in the best interests of Aboriginal territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very noticeable lack of support from some quarters has called into question the very nature of Aboriginal representation in the territory. Every time I go bush I hear stories of neglect and contempt by the land councils and by some ATSIC representatives for the local communities. The only answer is decentralisation of land councils. There are countless examples of Aboriginal communities refusing to deal with the land councils and, indeed, some are trying to form breakaway land councils of their own. I would be happy to take the honourable member for Banks to those communities any time he likes. I would be happy to arrange the trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern and Central land councils willingly accept&mdash;in fact, demand&mdash;millions and millions of taxpayers' money every year to fund their activities, money they should spend on education, health&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed. If you listened closely not merely to what he was saying in his speech but also to the very terminology that he used, you will see why my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has suggested that what is needed is a thoroughgoing review of all of this. I would say this to the honourable member for the Northern Territory. Throughout his speech there were two significant things that come automatically to many members of the coalition in the Northern Territory: that is, he continually referred to territorians `and' Aboriginals. I would hope that, by now, whatever view you took in terms of the state, a significant percentage of Australians who are of Aboriginal origin have lived in the Northern Territory, and their families have lived there, for far longer than the more recent settlers have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter almost of psychology that the member for the Northern Territory instinctively falls into a use of language whereby he talks about Territorians as if they are a different group of people and excludes, and has another characterisation for, the indigenous people of the Northern Territory, who would have far greater claim to be called Territorians&mdash;because they and their families were there long before many of the people who are now there ever thought of settling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not resile from my comments in the speech I made in respect of pastoral properties. What I said then was accurate. It was accurate then and it is accurate now. I am concerned, when I look at the kind of legislation that has been introduced into the parliament as a dimension of the argument which now goes on across Australia about the future of pastoral leases and the rights of our indigenous people, that there is a major debate about to be adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say this: as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs between March 1983 and 1987, I spent a great deal of time in the Northern Territory, and I do not think there was any significant political leader or any significant Aboriginal group that I did not sit down and talk to. I am bound to say that, in terms of the Northern Territory government's involvement in the practice of this legislation, I welcomed that. Legislation followed the Woodward 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8598"> commission, which was picked up and responded to by the Whitlam government, but the actual legislation was put through by a then coalition government led by Malcolm Fraser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude that Malcolm Fraser took and now takes in respect of the rights of indigenous people is to his everlasting credit. His views on the racist attitude of the then government of South Africa on apartheid were fairly exceptional at the time he was Prime Minister, having regard to the coalition. He was a great credit to a party that now seems to have shifted its focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was not a single land grant that I made as minister&mdash;and I was bound as a matter of courtesy to notify the Northern Territory government of the day&mdash;which was not the subject of immediate legal challenge, which inevitably finished in them losing. The costs to the citizens of the Northern Territory, and I include the Aboriginal people, were enormous. The course of confrontation that took place on so many issues still is built into the psychology of many of the people in the Northern Territory. It is exemplified when the member for the Northern Territory gets up in this House and, without even thinking about it, uses the terminology `Territorians' which means `us' and `Aboriginals' which means `them'. There comes a time in the history of this nation when that terminology has to cease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These expressions and the kinds of approaches that are now being taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) are going to recreate problems which I thought many of us had solved&mdash;for instance, the legislation on the upgrading of pastoral leases that is contemplated around Australia. I do not want to go into details. I simply want to make this point. While I was a minister and land grants were taking place, there was continual misrepresentation by members of what is now the coalition, about the purpose of that. There was substantial legal challenge which was, by its nature, intended to divide the dominant white community from the indigenous people in terms of political and social structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It even got to the stage where a formal Liberal member of this parliament, who had mining interests on an area of land in the Northern Territory that could not possibly be developed&mdash;but it did have ore underneath it&mdash;left mining machinery on the land of a traditional owner. This caused that man great illness. It was the only occasion on which I granted a title to land without informing the Northern Territory government. I did that on the basis of legal advice because, once the land was vested, it was beyond challenge. I had to deliver the title in the Darwin hospital. There was a sense of outrage because they had not been notified. It was the only way we could get the machinery off the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had hope for this parliament and, more importantly, for this nation. Like all members, I go to the citizenship ceremonies and, on many occasions, I am accompanied by members of the Liberal coalition, mainly state members. There is one thing we agree about: this is a multicultural nation. We all make speeches saying, `Welcome to the family.' This legislation is now before parliament&mdash;and the second reading was taken up today by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and other speakers from the opposition. We are a multicultural nation and, if this legislation and this government's attitude continues, we will be a multicultural nation in name only. You are only a truly multicultural nation when you include the indigenous people of Australia within the fabric of our culture, which builds on their traditions and relationships with the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude of the Northern Territory government has basically been schizophrenic. I used to get off aeroplanes to be greeted by people holding up placards saying, `Rights for whites.' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8599"> When you asked them how long they had been in the Northern Territory, they would say five years, three years, six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There comes a time in this nation where we have to come together as a people. I must say I find it fascinating, when there are people with the attitude that there are Territorians and Aboriginals, that when in my state you see the advertisement saying, `Come to the Northern Territory,' what you see is photographs of land which is Aboriginal land and where titles have passed. You see Aboriginal drawings and Aboriginal paintings. When I go there, as I have been recently to visit Aboriginal relatives, what do I find? I find tourism booming. I find lines of people from all over the world waiting to look at rock art sites, which are whole galleries going back 20,000, 30,000 and&mdash;in some cases&mdash;60,000 years. They are part of the heritage of all Australians: they are part of my heritage; Mr Deputy Speaker, they are part of your heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that staggers me is that there are these problems, but you can only solve them if you start on the basis of treating Aboriginal people as equals. They can only be solved if we are able to intellectually and mentally cut across some of our own traditions. They have survived and the conditions under which they live in many of the southern states are much worse than the situation prevailing in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you stop and think about it, there is a perception and a relationship and a spiritual belief related to what they see as their country. I know young Aboriginal men of great skills who, if you were to meet them today, are very much Australians. But they go back to go through ceremonies which are buried in the mists of time in order to take their role as leaders of their own community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say on the basis of much experience that, despite all of the things that have occurred to them, there is still a generosity of spirit amongst Aboriginal people which will enable us&mdash;we only have to reach out&mdash;to share their perception of our land and their land, which is the land of all of us. We only have to look. It is only in the course of the last 10 years that the real history of Aboriginal people has been written.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They fought for their land, as they were entitled to.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were massacred in many places, and we cannot undo history. That is our history and we have to face up to it. But we have to face up to it by recognising the indigenous culture and the rights of indigenous people. Land councils have made mistakes; they will have to make a lot more mistakes in order to catch up with the mistakes that have been made by successive governments in Australia, both federal and state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time now to pause. We have now got different approaches. The suggestion made by my colleague the member for Banks and shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs has much merit. I think we are going to be engaged, unfortunately, in a debate following the Wik legislation, which is by its very nature divisive and which will not enlarge the reputation of Australia in the eyes of the world. I am bound to say this. I had two farmers come to see me as part of a delegation from the National Farmers Federation. They were thoroughly decent, honest Australians who had a real affection and concern for their land. What surprised me and what angered me was that they had been lied to by their own leaders. Their land was not under threat or anything like it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can land be under threat, when the actual passages of the High Court judgment say that native title means no more than the right in some cases to go onto pastoral leases for the purposes of forage or for the purposes of visiting sacred sites for spiritual reasons? Nobody 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8600"> told them that. They sat there&mdash;as I say, decent, honest, hardworking Australians who had been lied to by their leaders, by the whipping up of the view that the Wik decision threatened the rights of pastoralists around Australia. That is nonsense. There is no way, in my view, that on an intelligent appraisal of the implications of the Wik judgment and the Mabo judgment, with less talk about adventurous courts, as a parliament we cannot work our way through this in a way which heals this nation and which does not divide it. I do not believe in legislation which deprives one group of a title which the High Court of Australia has recognised, which extinguishes their potential to make claims, in order to strengthen, at the cost of the taxpayers of Australia, the rights of some people holding pastoral leases, many of whom do not even live in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the role of the government&mdash;any government, irrespective of its basic political attitude&mdash;where there are divisions in this nation to heal them, not to exacerbate them. There will always be conflicting interests in our own community between some manufacturers and government policy, between some groups of workers and their employers. There is no future in using the legislative power of the Commonwealth to extinguish the rights of one group of people in order to strengthen and give additional rights to people who have only got, for example, pastoral leases. There is a very real difference in freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some talk about claims that, in the eyes of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, are unworthy claims. On the basis of fairly lengthy experience as a minister for Aboriginal affairs, I think there is one thing that you can always work on: if you keep any group of people outside the framework of your concepts of inclusiveness, and they are then given a right to claim, they will often make what can be talked about in legal terms as try&hyphen;ons. The way that is prevented is by discussion across the table by ministers, who have got to say, as I had to say on many occasions, `It is not on.' In any group of people who have gone through the deprivation that our indigenous people have gone through, when they create structures, there will be try&hyphen;ons. There will be try&hyphen;ons with the minister. Make no mistake about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I believe the time will come when Australia will be judged in the eyes of the world about the way we handle these problems. The question of apartheid in South Africa was not just an issue for the South African government. There are people in Asia who do not think very highly of Australia and say so. Do we think that some of those leaders are not going to use an attitude that has, I think, been mistakenly taken in terms of the way in which we treat the claims of our indigenous people? I think it is time for everybody to take three deep breaths and to not go down a track which will exacerbate the problems that already exist in this area. I am happy to finish on the note that I support the amendments moved by the honourable member for Banks. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence for about 60 seconds to hopefully conclude the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R243">Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  in this chamber. I briefly mention that, as a seconder of the amendment, I think the amendment makes sense. What we are talking about here is a need to defer consideration of the amendments to this legislation while the review of the principal act occurs. Wide ranging debate on the whole issue of indigenous affairs in this country in the current circumstances we face has occurred through this bill and through other bills before the parliament. I think, in those circumstances, six months will not be a problem. While those issues are under consideration matters such as this can wait.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Yes. It has proven difficult for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to determine appropriate criteria for what constitutes a serious deficiency in terms of providing meaningful advice to consumers. However, I expect CASA will soon be in a position to provide a report covering several months of this year. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Yes. The Codeshare Disclosure: Industry Code of Conduct was signed by myself, Qantas, Ansett and the Australian Federation of Travel Agents on 5 December 1996. This agreement provides for passengers to be informed when they are purchasing tickets on Code Shared services through a printed sticker on tickets issued by AFTA travel agents, printed information on tickets issued direct by Qantas and Ansett, and through Code Share flights being identified on timetables. We have received positive feedback from the airlines about the successful implementation of the Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) I have announced a new classification of operations that will direct CASA's regulatory effort to all passenger carrying operations and require charter operators to upgrade to the higher standards required of airlines. This will remove the distinction between the regulatory standards of Regular Public Transport and Charter operations, which was one of the major concerns of the Plane Safe report. We are in the process of developing a safety pamphlet which will provide consumers with some meaningful, easily understandable safety information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Yes. The current review program, which is examining the role of the safety regulator and Australia's aviation safety regulatory framework is addressing this concept. I expect to see this shift in onus in the outcomes of the review process and in regulatory actions taken by CASA in response to its industry surveillance activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. Defence acknowledges the need for protection and conservation of culturally significant sites and supports the provision of access onto or through Defence property for the purpose of assessing, maintaining or visiting such sites. Other forms of access such as permanent or long term occupation of camps or out&hyphen;stations, and hunting or fishing activities are not generally compatible with Defence management of the training areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of activity undertaken by Defence on training areas, and the requirement to exercise duty of care, dictates the necessity for controlled access. Determination of a right to access is assessed against possible conflict with Defence use of the property and is guided by safety considerations. Access to a site for cultural, educational or ceremonial purposes will generally be granted provided no military activity is impeded. If there is an obvious hazard in accessing a particular site, for example, as a result of the possible presence of unexploded ordnance, escorted access will be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where range management plans are being prepared or revised for specific training areas, it is common practice to include a cultural heritage assessment and to seek input through consultation with representatives of interested groups. In such cases, Defence representation is normally provided by local Defence staff. Where more substantial access is being sought, representatives of Defence Estate Organisation and other government agencies are usually involved in negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Formal access arrangements are in place covering Shoalwater Bay Training Area and RAAF Base Scherger in Queensland; Yampi Training Area in West Australia; Beecroft Weapons Range in New South Wales and Larrakeyah Barracks and Kangaroo Flats Training Area in the Northern Territory. Where military training activity does not preclude 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the granting of access, that access is granted following notification to the local Base Commander or Range Control organisation. The terms and conditions of these arrangements essentially form the basis for other arrangements under negotiation and for periodic grants of access to other Defence properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other access arrangements are currently being negotiated over the Delamere Range Facility in the Northern Territory, following an Aboriginal Land Claim over that area, and the Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, Queensland, in relation to proposed environmental and archaeological studies, and Point Wilson in Victoria.</PARA>
