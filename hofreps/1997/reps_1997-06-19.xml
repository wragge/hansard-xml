<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sad part in relation to the House of Representatives debating the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill is that this government in its incompetence does not know how to set down a legislative program. The House of Representatives is now going to debate the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee is due to report on the bill next week to the Senate. So we in the House of Representatives have to debate this bill before we see the recommendations of the Senate committee, before we see how the Senate committee is going to respond to submissions by not only the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission but also a number of other organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has now been in office for some 15 to 16 months. One would have thought that they could have got their act together. So the opposition are left with a situation where our final position on the bill
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has not yet been determined because we want to have a look at what the Senate committee report will recommend. In our period in office, we managed to coordinate legislation. If there were Senate inquiries, we managed to delay legislation. In the last parliament there were amendments to the procedures of this chamber whereby committees of this House were given power to inquire into legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last parliament, I was the Chairman of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. We had arrangements with the other house whereby we did not duplicate inquiries. The Senate committee did certain inquiries and the House of Representatives committee did certain inquiries. So I am a little bit disappointed in the way that this government has introduced this legislation for debate now before we on this side have had an opportunity to see what the Senate committee report does reveal. I would ask the government that, in future, they pay courtesy to members of this House in allowing them to get together all the information and all the reports. Normally I am not a great advocate for the Senate or the Senate committees, but I do acknowledge that their reports in the past have proved valuable. What I do urge is that it is about time this government got some of the House of Representatives committees to do inquiries into this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought we set a good precedent in the last parliament when the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquired into the child sex tourism bill and the war crimes bill. As chair of that committee I made sure that those committees did not take a partisan view. If anything, I found myself in conflict with the executive of the day. I remember that at the end of the first day's hearing into the child sex tourism bill, our committee copped a press release signed by three ministers of the Crown attacking the committee, thinking that the committee was going to derail the legislation. But, in the end, the government picked up 35&half; of the 38 recommendations that the House of Representatives committee made, and we had an improved bill. We had a bill that was picked up by other countries. So that shows that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5792"> House of Representatives committees can work. I was hoping that that precedent would be picked up by this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This House of Representatives might have a situation where the government has an overwhelming majority, but there are members of parliament on both sides of the House that do have an interest in these affairs, and this House should be given the courtesy of being able to look at these matters. I noticed in the debate yesterday, for instance, that on an item to do with telephone intercepts we did not even have a government speaker. The government was bringing forward into this place legislation that was going to impact. It was going to allow non&hyphen;judicial officers to issue warrants for telephone intercepts. Yet there was no government speaker other than the Attorney-General (Mr Williams).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have some wide reaching proposals that are suggested to the human rights legislation. This is what the Disability Discrimination Law Advocacy Service, which is a specialist community legal centre funded by the federal government, had to say in its submission to the Senate committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We provide legal advice and assistance to people wanting to lodge a complaint under the Disability Discrimination Act and community education to people affected by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the short notice in which to write a submission and our desire to consult with the disability community the Disability Discrimination Law Advocacy Service is only able, at this time, to make a few points and will lodge a much fuller submission as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of our concerns include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Court fees</EMPHASIS> &mdash;The fees are prohibitive to the majority of people with disabilities who are in receipt of government benefits or who have high living costs because of their disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application of filing and hearing fees in the proposed human rights jurisdiction will create an uneven playing field, with respondents making the most of the opportunity provided to allow a matter to continue to hearing, knowing that complainants will not be able to afford to go to hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A blanket exemption for people on a pension or benefit will not be adequate to ensure that people with disabilities can access the Federal Court. There are many people with disabilities who earn an income, but who because of their disability, are required to spend that income on adjustments. Filing and hearing fees will significantly disadvantage this group.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Costs Orders</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another disincentive for people to pursue their rights is the possibility of costs being awarded against them. We would urge that costs orders are not awarded in discrimination cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rules of Evidence</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applying rules of evidence is a major change from the practice of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. If the new human rights jurisdiction were to enforce the rules of evidence, then the resulting technical legal arguments would preclude self advocacy by respondents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Formality</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would like the Committee to take into consideration the informality that is strived for in Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission hearings compared to the formality that may be imposed at the Federal Court. This, if not changed, will be a further disincentive for many people with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our experience, complainants in discrimination cases are already disadvantaged. Given the unlikelihood of obtaining legal aid for civil cases, it seems likely that any extra formality and cost associated with fighting discrimination will add a significant burden on the complainant which in many cases will make access to justice unlikely or impossible to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Representative Proceedings</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Much of the discrimination suffered by people with a disability is of a systemic nature, affecting large numbers of people. Often it will be necessary and in the public interest to address systemic discrimination in a public hearing. Under the bill, a person who is not affected, but makes a complaint on behalf of others is only able to seek conciliation. This change disadvantages many people with a disability who may be best represented by an organisation. (For instance, people reliant on services provided by the alleged discriminator, fearful of retaliation, people who do not want their disability disclosed because of the stigma attached to it, people with little or no means of communication.)</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We cannot keep using this House as a rubber stamp. I know that there are newer members on the other side of the House. I have an enormous respect for this House. When I was chair of the committee in the last parliament I believed an important role of committees was to consult with the community, to bring in professionals. I am getting sick and tired of this House being taken for granted by the executive government and the arrogance of  this government when it campaigned on raising the standards of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now in a position as an opposition where we will not be moving substantive
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5793"> amendments in the House of Representatives; we will be waiting until the matter comes to the Senate so that we can see what the government's response is going to be to the Senate committee report. The repository of all wisdom does not lie in the Senate; it does not just lie in the executive government. There are members of this House that bring with them experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that at times it is pretty hard to turn the executive around because it is the prisoner of the bureaucracy, but I raise this as an example. There has been a reasonable relationship in this portfolio. I am not directing the criticism at a personal level on this Attorney-General. This Attorney-General is doing the work of three or four ministers with half the staff. It is an absolute disgrace. The secretariats of this parliament have had to combine. That is not professionalism. If there were more ministers like this Attorney-General the government would be better placed. But the problem is that their workload does not allow proper scrutiny from him or his department or his officers or members of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This criticism is not directed at this minister, whom I have a lot of time for. That does not mean to say he is right on every issue. He gets locked into cabinet solidarity and he has to run the party line when he is in cabinet. This government treats the law with contempt. It does not have the Attorney-General as part of cabinet. He is in the outer ministry. What sort of symbolism does that send? Why? Because we have a lawless cabinet. This government's first cabinet decision in relation to a special auditor for ATSIC was thrown out by the Federal Court three to nil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) running around in relation to Wik. We were supposed to see the legislation by now. We will not see it till August. And they want the legislation through the parliament by Christmas. I give the government notice now: you have Buckley's chance. We will be scrutinising that particular piece of legislation line by line because we do not trust you. You say one thing and do another.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Attorney&hyphen;General is honourable, so I am prepared to give him trust. But the trouble is that he is a prisoner of this government and it is the government I do not trust. That is why we will scrutinise this legislation when it comes to the parliament. I know that there are members of this government who are in the same predicament that some of us were in in the previous government. They get locked in as well, but that is why committees of this House present an opportunity for us to give input from the House of Representatives. That is where you develop relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this legislation is so crash hot and necessary, then let the bureaucrats be subjected to examination by members of the House of Representatives. Let them be tested. If the legislation is so crash hot, then let us not treat this House with contempt and have a debate before we even have a Senate report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a proper ordering of business we may have an arrangement with the other place so that there is not duplication. I am not saying that we have to do a report on every piece of legislation that comes before this House. There is a proper management of affairs. We do not want to do a report and have the Senate do another report. But it is contemptible of this place to be debating this legislation without the benefit of that Senate report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. One was from a Dr Imtiaz Omar, who is from the School of Law of the University of New England. In the body of his report he talks about the diminution of the role of HREOC. That is what is happening here&mdash;they are gutting HREOC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government says it does one thing, but look at the detail&mdash;look at what they are doing. Recently we had a disgraceful performance by this government and the minders of this government because even before the report on the stolen children was tabled in the Parliament you had the spin doctors and the character assassins working the corridors of the press gallery doing a job on Sir Ron  Wilson and on Mick Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner. What utter contempt
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5794"> on the part of the executive and members of the executive for this organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the leaks coming out before the report was even tabled. With the tabling of the report, community opinion has changed. You have just had the New South Wales Parliament giving an unequivocal apology. You have had Henry Burmester, Chief General Counsel, properly examined in a Senate committee conceding that he gave advice late in the piece on what he was asked&mdash;but he was only asked specific questions&mdash;and that an unqualified apology can be given to the indigenous people of this nation without rendering us liable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I use that as an example because I remember the history of the attitude of members of this government to HREOC and the original Fightback package and the modification. Originally you were going to take HREOC out of the action. Then you backed off. Now it is going to be death by a thousand cuts. You impose budget cuts on them to the order of 25 or 30 per cent, so they will be mouthpieces. You do not replace certain commissioners. You have the Attorney-General saying to the Privacy Commissioner: `I want you to stay on so that we can look at privacy matters' and going and getting permission from the Prime Minister's office for the extension of his term. Then when he gets to cabinet with a recommendation, you have the mean-spirited people in cabinet rolling him. So the Privacy Commissioner's term is not extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why? Because you have a certain cabinet minister who remembers that the Privacy Commissioner worked for a former Labor Attorney-General in Victoria. This is a mean-spirited, vindictive government. We will look at sections of this legislation to make sure that you are not gutting HREOC. What we need, especially with a government with the majority that it has, is a vibrant HREOC as the guardian of the public&mdash;because that guarding is not coming from the executive. We have <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> personified 100 times over. It does not hurt if you have competent ministers, but with competent ministers you gut their resources, you give them a workload that is impossible to manage, and you sideline them.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That is not democracy; that is an abuse of democracy by the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the seven and a bit years I have been in this place&mdash;and this applies to both sides of the House&mdash;it has been debased by the executive. I am not saying that this legislation has been introduced one week and debated the next; it has not. But there has not been a proper coordination or tabling of the program. So I am probably using this debate to vent my spleen in relation to a few other things that have happened under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I don't trust this government, not one iota. Frankly, the performances of some ministers leave a lot to be desired. I think there is a repository of wisdom in the back bench: the member for Kooyong, the member for North Sydney&mdash;honourable members of this place, members who can make a contribution. The problem is that we no longer have a Liberal Party. It ain't a small `l' Liberal party; it is a conservative party with a capital `C'. You have a kitchen cabinet that locks in the cabinet, the outer ministry and the executive, and we get snuffled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these things are important. The attitude of this government is: `If Labor did it, we are going to change it. If it was done by the Labor government, it must have been bad so we automatically have to change it.' That is what is happening here, and there is a bit of payback. What I say to you is: justify it&mdash;justify some of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that I am not standing here in the parliament today on a detailed basis trying to shred this legislation. Why? Because I have not had the benefit of the expert advice by practitioners in the field as to the impact of this legislation, as to the restructuring. I am not going to get up here now and argue a case that I am not fully across, because that is not fair to this parliament. So I am left as the spokesman for the Labor Party in this House not being able to argue definitively on the detail of this legislation basically because I do not have the benefit of the Senate report to see what they made of the material that was put in front of them. That is a situation that cannot be allowed to happen again.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5795">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important piece of legislation. There is no doubt there are aspects of this legislation that deserve cross&hyphen;party support, but there is no way that this should happen again. This House should not be left in a situation in where we are arguing in a vacuum. We have to take our job seriously. There is cynicism out there in the community in terms of the parliament and in terms of us as parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a Prime Minister who today on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> justifies his trip overseas because he is allowed to like cricket. We all like cricket, but he sought the office of Prime Minister and he hung around for 22 years as a member of parliament to get it. I think there is an onus and a duty on the Prime Minister to be here when parliament is sitting. He can go to the third or fourth test. That is the message that is going out. We have a Prime Minister who will have a five-minute cup of tea with Blair and then see his soul mates Thatcher and Major. Then he will go to the Lords test. What message does that send?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What message does this piece of legislation being debated in the House of Representatives send to the community when members of the House of Representatives do not have the  benefit of a Senate inquiry into this piece of legislation? It shows an arrogance of and contempt for this executive that will come back and bite them. People out there in the community are starting to twig. The comfortable and relaxed nature of government that we were told we would have if we had a change of government is not happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many debates when I sat on the other side of the House I did not get up and defend what we were doing in the procedures of this House, because I did not agree with them. I sat in silence because I believe in party solidarity. But I heard the unctuous lectures from the then opposition about improving standards. I have not seen an improvement of standards. I have seen a debasement of standards in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen professional officers in this House have further resources taken away from them. I have seen professional officers who have served this House for 20 and 30 years still not knowing their fate as a result of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> restructuring. That is arrogance and contempt by the executive. I do not blame the parliamentary officers; I blame the executive. It is about time that we, as members of parliament on both sides of the House, strike back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you get elected to parliament, you think it is a great honour, that it is an opportunity to make a contribution&mdash;and it is. But in the end we can have no respect for ourselves if we continue to allow this to happen. That is why I get angry in a lot of these debates. My record speaks for itself. When I was in government, I took on the executive on these issues time and again in the caucus room and in this parliament. There is not one report that I tabled in this parliament where it can be said I was stood over or ran the government line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We tested the legislation, and we brought in recommendations when we knew the ministers did not like them. I will tell you the test of how successful the committee was in the last parliament. In the end we could not get references from the executive. In the end the references were quietly slipped to a Senate committee. Why? Because we exerted our independence. Who was on that committee? The current Attorney-General; the right honourable member for New England, Mr Sinclair; a former Attorney-General, the then member for Holt, Mr Duffy; the former member for Jagajaga, Mr Peter Staples; Wendy Fatin; and the member for Melbourne Ports, Clyde Holding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a committee that laid down the standard that this parliament could have pride in because it did not play party politics. It took its job seriously. It said on important pieces of legislation, `We want the House of Representatives to have a role in scrutinising legislation. We take committee work seriously and our reports speak for themselves.' They were more of an embarrassment to the government than anyone else. What do we have here? We have a situation where we copped it all from the other side. They have the opportunity and the ball has been fumbled. That is why I am angry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not accept automatically explanatory memorandums that are written by members of the bureaucracy. I am not saying they do it deliberately. They have instructions. They are professional public servants who have to provide material in accordance with the instructions and directions they are given. I know at a personal level, because their body language says it all, that they are not necessarily happy with the brief that they as professional public servants have to champion, but that is their job because they are servants of the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as members of parliament have to take our job seriously. I say to the members of the government: you will have an easy passage on this bill in the House of Representatives. We will not move a second reading amendment, and we will not move amendments to the bill in this place. We are going to reserve our position for when this matter comes before the Senate. Unfortunately, what you now lose as a government is an opportunity to examine our amendments in detail before they go to the Senate, because that is the benefit of this House being able to move some of those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the debate in relation to the Constitutional Convention we tabled a series of amendments in the House of Representatives so they were on the public record, so that the government knew our position, so that there was a proper debate when it got to the Senate. We are not going to have that opportunity. I am not saying we are going to be able to do that in every instance. We do not have the resources. You know that. But you will be judged. The more arrogant, the more contemptuous you are of the processes, the more that message will filter out. You

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not stand here and defend everything we did; I do not agree with everything we did, but what we did was not all bad. There were many achievements of the Labor government, and one of them was in this area. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is something we were proud of&mdash;professional, independent officers representing the vulnerable in the community, properly resourced. In our modern society, with the bureaucracies, it is not the executive that is the protector; it is organisations such as this&mdash;the Auditor-General, the Privacy Commissioner, the Social Justice Commissioner. What do they get from the executive government? They get gutted and whacked around the ears if they speak out, which is what their job is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 represents an important development in the Commonwealth's ongoing commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights in Australia. It provides for the establishment of administrative mechanisms which will enable complaints made under Australia's anti-discrimination laws&mdash;including the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992&mdash;to be efficiently determined and for these determinations to be effectively enforced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is, in essence, a response to the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. In that case, the court determined that the provisions within the Racial Discrimination Act, allowing determinations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5797"> be enforced through registration in the Federal Court, represented an exercise of judicial power which could only be exercised by a court and was thus unconstitutional. As the same provisions which were held constitutionally invalid in the Brandy case also exist in the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act, the outcome of Brandy was to render Australia's anti-discrimination laws effectively unenforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government initiated a two-stage response to the Brandy decision, commencing with a temporary restoration of the pre-1992 arrangements, under which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission could inquire into a matter and make a determination. But, if this was not acted upon by the parties themselves, it had to be enforced by a de novo hearing in the Federal Court. The second stage of the response was to refer consideration of a permanent solution to a review committee consisting of representatives from the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Finance and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which was already investigating the structure and operation of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, announced the government's response to this review on 28 January 1996&mdash;the day after the calling of the federal election. I should say in response to the honourable member that there were quite a number of decisions made after the election was called, but they were never implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's response is outlined in this bill, which provides for complaints made under Australia's anti-discrimination laws and complaints of breaches of human rights under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 to be investigated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. But cases which cannot be resolved through the commission's conciliation process will be finally determined in the Federal Court. This involves an extension of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In generating this outcome, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill also provides for a number of important access and equity reforms, as the Attorney-General (Mr
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Williams) pointed out in his second reading speech. The court will be able to adopt informal procedures, as it will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms. The court will be able to make rules of court which delegate any of its powers, apart from the power of granting injunctions to judicial registrars. Where there is hardship, either party will be able to apply to the Attorney-General for assistance for the proceedings. There will be a requirement that the commission assist complainants in completing the necessary forms to commence proceedings in the Federal Court, and the president of the commission will be able to prepare a report for the court on the complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms are part of Australia's ongoing and fundamental commitment to human rights: to safeguarding human integrity, freedom and equality, to opposing racism, to providing protection from discrimination, to tolerance and diversity, and to justice and equity for all Australians. Today, these basic tenets on which our human rights legislation rest are given heightened significance by the situation created by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I am 49 years old, almost 50. I was born in  Greece, but I have been an Australian for longer than the majority of the Australian population has been alive. I have always been overwhelmingly confident in, and committed to, Australia. Most of my mature life has been spent at the hard end of politics fighting the Labor Party, starting off on Malcolm Fraser's staff in June 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My experience has perhaps led me to emphasise political effectiveness, rather than making ringing declarations. Because my commitment to multiculturalism is well known and my opposition to the member for Oxley's stance is manifest, until now I have simply pointed out that many of the things she says are wrong and can damage Australia. But now that the member for Oxley is no longer a lone Independent but has become a leader of a political party, common decency and a concern for Australia and a concern for human rights demand that more be said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is important that we get the facts about Hansonism right. The first is that  a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5798"> number of people are superficially attracted to some what the member for Oxley says. The second fact is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is right when says of those attracted to her that `a few, no doubt [are bigoted, narrow&hyphen;minded and racist. Most, however, are not'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third fact is that, if any of the member for Oxley's opponents think she is not a real politician but a simple fish and chip shop lady, they are quite simply wrong. The member for Oxley is not just a real politician; indeed, she is a political manipulator and a disseminator of division of the kind we have rarely seen in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hansonism is two faced. One face tries to entice Australians who are neither racist nor bigoted by presenting the member for Oxley as an ordinary Australian, a woman who has had her share of hard knocks and who is just speaking her mind. The second face of Hansonism is the ugly face&mdash;the face that attracts the racists and the bigots. It attracts them because it reflects their prejudices, their resentments and their hatreds. This is the authentic face of Hansonism&mdash;the one she tries to constantly hide because it is unacceptable to the ordinary, decent Australians she is trying to enmesh in her movement. This needs to be exposed, not with rhetoric but with the member for Oxley's own words&mdash;and her own words do expose her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has said again and again, `I am not a racist by any definition of that word.' Yet in her very own words she has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My fear is that if we keep on going the way we are going . . . the yellow race will rule the world . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again in her own now notorious words, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians . . . They have their own culture and religion, form ghettoes and do not assimilate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Oxley has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want my critics to listen carefully, I want them to read my lips! I am not saying that I want all Asian immigration to cease.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But it is from her very own lips that the following statements were issued:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maybe I do come in like a Sherman tank, how else am I going to say that I want a halt on Asians coming into the country. You tell me. How would you say it?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us turn to the member for Oxley's attitude towards Aboriginals. The member for Oxley says she is not anti-Aboriginal. She has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've never denigrated the Aboriginal person, I'm saying the system is not right.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just listen to her denigrations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What Aboriginals have to learn is you don't go spending your welfare money on grog and you're getting round the place and you can't feed your kids.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just listen to her assertion that she is fighting for `the white community, the immigrants, Italians, Greeks, whoever&mdash;it does not matter&mdash;anyone apart from the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders'. Just hear her demand that the reconciliation process should be abolished because of what she says is a historical background of&mdash;and I quote her&mdash;`the massacre of blacks by blacks', `the virtual genocide of one Aboriginal tribe by another' and `Aboriginal cannibalism'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been accused of saying Aboriginals are not disadvantaged. That is clearly nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Anyone who says that Aboriginals are not disadvantaged is clearly speaking nonsense. But this is the nonsense that the member for Oxley does speak. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People are saying they are a disadvantaged race . . . what way, I would like someone to tell me are they disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I quote her again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I . . . challenge anyone to tell me how Aboriginals are disadvantaged when they can obtain three and five per cent housing loans denied to non-Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could go on with a litany of such distortions and deceptions, but I will take two more cases. At the launch of her One Nation party, the member for Oxley said&mdash;and she was shown on television saying this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you want race riots, religious fanaticism, gang and drug wars? Do you want civil war?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 minutes</EMPHASIS> , the member for Oxley was asked whether she really thought we were going to have civil war. She replied:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5799">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. And I didn't say those words either . . . let's clarify that `civil war'. That was an editor's headline.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, let us look at why the member for Oxley detests Australia's multiculturalism. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A truly multicultural society can never be strong and united. United States President Bill Clinton pointed out when he was in Australia that the world is littered with the bodies of people killed in failed and tragic attempts at multiculturalism.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nothing could more totally, utterly and transparently misrepresent President Clinton's views. President Clinton did speak of ethnic, racial and religious conflicts, but he concluded by saying&mdash;and I quote the president's words because they are important:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a lot of evidence that we can all do better than that. And when the world comes to Sydney they will see that. So think about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Think about how every day in every way when you bring in people who are those, like me, who trace their roots to England or Ireland or Scotland, to various Asian countries or South Asia or Latin America or the Middle East, every day you do that when the world is looking at you, you offer a rebuke to all those who would take away the lives and the futures and the fortunes of the children of this world, because they are different from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I cannot think of a better place in the entire world, a more shining example of how people can come together as one nation and one community than Sydney, Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were terrific words and they were delivered much more effectively than I could.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley's record raises two questions. The first question is: why is she doing this? The answer is straightforward: she is a manipulative politician who thinks she was elected because of her race appeals and who wants to be re&hyphen;elected and carry more people like herself into the parliament on her coat&hyphen;tails by continuing to incite racism while extending her base beyond hardcore bigots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley first gained her political reputation by attacking Aboriginals. She soon moved to attacking Asian Australians. This is the way that racists extend their range of scapegoats. They start off by attacking one vulnerable group, then they attack another and soon other groups become vul
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nerable. All Australians&mdash;not just Aboriginal Australians, not just Asian Australians, not just Australians of non&hyphen;English speaking descent, but all of us&mdash;need to ask: who will be next?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Which of us is the member for Oxley talking about when she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are so many people who do not think of themselves as being Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of whom does she speak when she asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where will they stand in any future crisis? Beside us or behind us or will they themselves be the crisis?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whom will she next accuse of `seeking to create more than one Australia'? Of whom will she ask:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you a citizen of Australia or a citizen of the world?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second question is: why does the member for Oxley believe that she can get away with her distortions; her denials of what she has said and of what has been published; and what she has built her notoriety on? I believe that the answer is contained in a statement on the back cover of her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pauline Hanson: the truth</EMPHASIS> . This is the book on which she owns the copyright, on which she receives the royalties and of which she has said again and again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've put my name to this book and I have backed this book.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is what her book says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We Australians are easily led. We are in more ways than one a nation of friendly and docile sheep.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not believe that the member for Oxley is going to succeed in her attempts to deceive and divide Australia. I do not believe that the Australian people are docile sheep. I believe that Australians are a clever, confident people and that we can stand on our feet and think for ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the vast majority of Australians support the multiculturalism that we have created in this nation, and that we support reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I believe that most Australians are coming to understand that the member for Oxley is inciting racism. I believe  that those people who are superficially attracted to Hansonism and those who say, `I don't agree with everything Pauline Hanson says&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5800">but,' do need to reflect on what Hansonism really stands for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hansonism does not stand for them and it does not stand for Australia. Hansonism is not about Aboriginal programs that have not fixed real disadvantage. It is not about the rate of immigration. It is not about foreign investment. It is not about tariffs. It is not about jobs. Hansonism stands for racism and bigotry, and these descriptions are not politically correct catchphrases. They mean that Hansonism stands for dividing Australia, for scapegoating vulnerable groups because of their race and ethnicity, for spreading fear and resentment and for sowing mistrust and suspicion amongst Australians about one another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 50 years, Australia has become a home and a nation for five million immigrants from over 130 countries. Out of the mass migration of the last half century, we Australians have created an admirable, decent and harmonious nation. Together we have created a society fundamentally based on fairness, on the appreciation of racial and cultural diversity, on tolerance and mutual respect and a commitment to reconciliation. In a world of racial, ethnic and religious conflict and violence, we have shown the way and impressed other nations. But that is less important than the fact that we have got it right. Hansonism rejects all this. If we want to be a decent, tolerant and united Australia, Hansonism needs to be rejected. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could change the orientation of the debate, I want to use a case in my own electorate to discuss the Human Rights Legislation Amendment bill 1996 and some of the problems that still exist with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. As a result of the problems with the legislation that we are discussing today, we still have unfairness and injustice in existing arrangements for people who are taking action through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There are necessary changes to be made to the legislation that we are debating. I want to draw attention to a particular constituent. She lodged a complaint of sexual harassment against her employer with the commission. The commission found in her favour and awarded her $17,000 in damages and loss of wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, although the commission is empowered under the Sex Discrimination Act to make determinations and declarations, these are currently unenforceable. As a result, my constituent has been unable to obtain the sum awarded to her and will be unable to do so unless she takes the case to the Federal Court where it will have to be re&hyphen;heard from the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costs of her appearance before the commission were met by Legal Aid on the understanding that she would repay the costs if the verdict were in her favour. The verdict was in her favour but she has received no money. At the same time, of course, she has incurred significant costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a highly regrettable situation and has had the opposite effect of that intended by the spirit of the anti&hyphen;discrimination regime, which is to afford equitable and accessible justice to people subject to discrimination through a process which is speedy, relatively informal and relatively cheap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One intention of this bill that we are debating today is to address the complex way in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5801"> which anti&hyphen;discrimination complaints currently proceed. The bill repeals the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's inquiry and determination functions and implements a scheme by which complaints not resolved through conciliation may be continued by way of application in the Federal Court in order to obtain an enforceable determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position has not always been so complex. Legislative changes in 1992 allowed the commission to register its decisions with the Federal Court. The changes gave these decisions the authority of an order of the court and prevented the duplication which now exists between the commission and the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The duplication has arisen because of the decision of the High Court in the Brandy case. The High Court found that the power in anti&hyphen;discrimination legislation which allowed determinations of the commission to be enforced through regulations in the Federal Court was unconstitutional, because it breached the separation of powers. The ultimate effect of this decision has been very harmful to some complainants before the commission. My constituent is a case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for this reason that I support the intention of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. It will assist complainants like my constituent who are required to seek help from the Federal Court in resolving anti&hyphen;discrimination matters which the commission has been unable to conciliate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the detailed provisions are flawed. No steps have been taken in the bill to address the fundamental issue of systemic discrimination. I understand that amendments to overcome these weaknesses have been suggested by the Senate committee examining the bill. Following the comments of the member for Banks (Mr Melham) earlier, there will be amendments moved by the opposition in the Senate to address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also timely, particularly following the contribution of the member for Kooyong, to look at the proposed cuts by this government to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that occurred in the recent budget. The government is actually proposing a cut of eight per cent to the human rights
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commission's budget in this financial year and a cut of 35 per cent in the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These very significant cuts have been justified on the grounds that the human rights commission's funding over the last decade has been disproportionate to that in other areas of government. There has been a significant need to increase the funding to make up for there not being any significant machinery to deal with discrimination in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This justification is one of the most hollow I have heard, because it ignores the facts that the commission has now acquired significant, additional responsibilities such as those that have occurred with the passing of the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and the Racial Hatred Act in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also argued that the amendments we are now considering will significantly reduce the human rights commission's role by abolishing its inquiry and determination functions. But according to the commission, these functions account for only about four per cent of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes may in fact help my constituent. She will not have to put her case twice. She will not have to go to the human rights commission and put her case; and then, because it is not enforceable, go to the Federal Court and put her case again. Unfortunately, what she will have to do, because she is going to want an enforceable decision, is take her case to the Federal Court. That is going to be a much more expensive path. Lawyers will be required, and the cost of taking her case to the Federal Court has been significantly increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These so&hyphen;called justifications are also a very thinly-veiled attack on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which is going to see its staff reduced by one&hyphen;third&mdash;60 out of 180 people are to go&mdash;with some of its most significant functions abolished or undermined. This would be disquieting at any time but, in a period when racial discrimination and racial vilification complaints are increasing and when there is a general community concern about the level of intolerance that is being displayed in some quarters, this is inexcusable. This is the time when we need
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5802"> a strong, articulate and well resourced organisation to speak out for tolerance of racial and other minority groups and against discrimination. It is alarming that the government has seen fit to weaken the commission at a time when our country really needs the strongest advocate possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it stands, this bill will do nothing to strengthen the commission. I urge the House therefore to consider both the Labor Party amendments to the bill when they come into the Senate and the serious consequences of proceeding with the planned cuts to the commission.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill implements the first part of the process of reform of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. The bill is directed at several acts that will be variously referred to here as the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. The bill not only amends the Commonwealth anti&hyphen;discrimination legislation so as to reform the functions and structure of the commission, but also specifically responds to the High Court decision in the Brandy case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts of the Brandy case bear looking into in relation to the background to this legislation. The plaintiff in that case and the third defendant had been officers of the then Department of Aboriginal Affairs and, as at March 1995, had become officers of ATSIC. On 13 March 1990, the third defendant lodged a complaint against ATSIC with the commission alleging breaches of sections 9 and 15 of the Racial Discrimination Act. The third defendant alleged verbal abuse and threatening behaviour on the part of Brandy, the plaintiff, while both were officers of the department. The third defendant, Bell, also alleged that ATSIC and its chief executive officer had not responded adequately to the complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 22 November 1993, the commission found in favour of Bell and declared that the plaintiff apologise to Bell; pay $2,500 by way of damages for pain, humiliation, distress and loss of personal dignity suffered by him; that ATSIC take disciplinary action against the plaintiff; that ATSIC apologise to Bell and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that ATSIC pay $10,000 to Bell. On 23 December 1993, the commission lodged the determination with the Federal Court. On 20 January 1994, the plaintiff applied to the Federal Court for a review of the determination. The case went to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at the particular law on the subject, one should note that  sections 9 and 15, making certain conduct unlawful, are contained in part II `Prohibition of Racial Discrimination' of the Racial Discrimination Act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law also provides that a written complaint, alleging a breach of part II, may be lodged with the commission. The commission then notifies the commissioner, who is required to commence an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the inquiry, the commission may make a final determination under section 25Z(1) dismissing the complaint or, if finding the complaint substantiated, make certain determinations, including that the respondent has acted unlawfully and should not continue such conduct; that the respondent compensate the plaintiff; and that the respondent employ or re&hyphen;employ the plaintiff. Section 25Z(2) provides that a determination made under 25Z(1) is not binding or conclusive between any of the parties. However, the commission must register the determination with the Federal Court at which time it takes effect as if it were an order of the court, and as a result is enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the argument that proceeded before the High Court, the plaintiff argued that the relevant provisions were invalid because they provided for an exercise of judicial power otherwise than in conformity with chapter III of the constitution. It was further argued that the commission was not a court established pursuant to section 71 of the constitution or constituted in accordance with section 72. The plaintiff also argued that this was so even though the Federal Court could review those determinations&mdash;and that is an important point: that the argument was still maintained, even though the Federal Court could review those determinations,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court accepted the argument put by the plaintiff and the court considered that  it was difficult to formulate a comprehensive definition of judicial power. It is as well to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5803"> look quickly at a couple of passages in the High Court's judgment. Firstly, I refer to page 9 of volume 127 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Reports</EMPHASIS>, and the section in the judgment of the Chief Justice, Chief Justice Mason, Justices Brennan and Toohey, where their honours said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, it has always been accepted that the punishment of criminal offences and the trial of actions for breach of contract and for wrongs are inalienable exercises of judicial power. The validity of that proposition rests not only on history and precedent but also on the principle that the process of the trial results in a binding and authoritative judicial determination which ascertains the rights of the parties. So, when A alleges that he or she has suffered loss or damage as a result of B's unlawful conduct and a court determines that B is to pay a sum of money to A by way of compensation, there is an exercise of judicial power. The determination involves an exercise of such power not simply because it is made by a court but because the determination is made by reference to the application of principles and standards "supposed already to exist". And the determination is binding and authoritative in the sense that there is what has been described as an immediately enforceable liability of B to pay A the sum in question. Consequently, even if the determination in such a case were to be made by an administrative tribunal and not by a court, the determination would constitute an exercise of judicial power, although not one in conformity with Ch III of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I quote, furthermore, some of the remarks of the balance of the court&mdash;Justices Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh&mdash;included at page 16 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Difficulty arises in attempting to formulate a comprehensive definition of judicial power not so much because it consists of a number of factors as because the combination is not always the same. It is hard to point to any essential or constant characteristic. Moreover, there are functions which, when performed by a court, constitute the exercise of judicial power but, when performed by some other body, do not.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to cite another case and then goes on to make this remark at page 17:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One is tempted to say that, in the end, judicial power is the power exercised by courts and can only be defined by reference to what courts do and the way in which they do it, rather than by recourse to any other classification of functions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I should add the qualification:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But that would be to place reliance upon the elements of history and policy which, whilst they are legitimate considerations, cannot be conclusive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Given that extensive lists of references it can be seen what a difficult question this issue poses.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view&mdash;with respect&mdash;the High Court got it right. It is important, in my view, that the High Court determined that the commission was simply that&mdash;a commission, a tribunal, a non&hyphen;judicial body&mdash;and as such was not empowered to make final determinations. As I said, that is eminently correct and I welcomed the decision when it came out. Section 71 of the constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is as well to note the significance of the word `court' and that section 71 contains no reference to `commission' or `tribunal'. Such terms are creatures of the legislature and were never intended to exercise final power in determination of disputes. The decision in Brandy reinforces again the role of superior courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any democracy a properly constituted court metes out justice according to rules of procedure and evidence which are the products of centuries of experience. Evidence is adduced with a body of rules and is then assessed according to objective criteria, not according to the whim and fancy of the presiding officer, not according to any particular bent, slant or angle on life or ideology that that person may have. It is unfortunate, as has been revealed in a number of examples in recent times, that ideology seems to come to the fore sometimes in some of the decisions we see from tribunals. It is not real justice, though. Only a court can mete out justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We often hear complaints about the courts as well, but the courts have been with us for many hundreds of years. They are the best thing that can be designed to determine the rights of individuals because in every case there is one argument on one side and an argument on the other side. One can never  say that hearing one side of the case determines the matter, because it never does. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for quasi&hyphen;judicial bodies, commissions and so forth to be enraptured in one side of the argument.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5804">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As anyone who has practised in the courts, particularly the criminal courts, will know, when you hear the opening of the prosecution case and the evidence&hyphen;in&hyphen;chief of the main complainant in the case, it is not a good feeling as defence counsel, because it seems at the outset that the odds are loaded against you&mdash;until the cross&hyphen;examination commences and the story begins to be whittled away. There is not one case I have ever been involved in where the story against you, no matter how strong, has not been whittled away at least to some extent&mdash;in some cases, to the whole extent&mdash;on proper cross&hyphen;examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the importance of the court process. It does that and ultimately comes to the right decision in the circumstances. It does not always reach the right decision and it is never right for the party who has lost, but in 13 years of practice in criminal and civil courts, particularly the criminal courts, I can think of only two decisions which I think were wrong&mdash;speaking as a subjective observer because I was defending. Of course, that is two too many, but it is not bad out of literally hundreds, perhaps over 1,000, of cases in which I have been involved. It is not a bad record, really.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to bear that in mind in considering what we seem to be going through now, that is, an agony of trying to find some other means or route of meting out justice that is cheaper and that somehow gets around the rules of evidence and reaches a result that pleases everybody. It cannot be done. You cannot do it. The sooner society realises that, the sooner we will devise ways of ensuring that there is access to justice for all who need to get justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems that is denying access to justice, in my view, is that, in trying to set up so many alternative means of getting justice, we are in the process potentially denying justice, because there are many people who cannot get legal aid in the courts and who do not approach the court. Once upon a time junior counsel would be able to do summary trials on legal aid because legal aid was available. Now legal aid is not available for summary trials, almost without
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exception&mdash;in Queensland anyway&mdash;and, lo and behold, everyone seems to be pleading guilty. Is that because they are guilty, or is it because, as many a defendant has said to me, `We just want to get it over and done with'? I cringe when I hear that. But it happens all the time. It is something we cannot sit in this parliament and ignore. We cannot go round and round in circles and think, `We will devise a commission or a tribunal or something else that weakens the rules of evidence.' Ultimately we destroy the system which is the best system, that is, the court system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure, there are areas in the courts that need reform. Mediation and so forth has been an important element of that. But we must not forget that easy justice is cheap justice sometimes and not real justice. Why couldn't the Brandy case have been dealt with in the magistrate's court? It could have been dealt with simply and summarily and disposed of once and for all. Instead, we had an exhaustive process that took it through the Federal Court and the High Court, and an enormous amount of money was spent. In the process the system is open to ridicule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is necessary to examine all of these matters. It should be noted that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's budget of $19 million was cut by $1.5 million. I can assure the House that half of that $19 million would go a long way in the legal aid process. There are many people who are singing out for justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some reservations about the plethora of commissions and tribunals to which we seem to be attracted. I do not mean to say that I have any fundamental ideological opposition to it. I am trying to say to the House that we need better access to justice across the board in many areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer, for example, to medical negligence. If you try to get legal aid for a medical negligence case, you would not have a hope on this earth. Yet I know of a case in which a woman lost her husband, and the circum stances were such that I advised that it would be a very difficult case on which to succeed. Legal Aid had asked me to give the advice free of charge. I said, `I won't do the advice free; it will take me three weeks to do it. It's
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5805"> a difficult matter but I'll give you some advice off the top of my head.' I was told, `Thanks very much, we won't give legal aid, anyway.' That is the process. A person who, in my view, has got a case which should at least be inquired into should be given the opportunity to have the case looked at by competent counsel and that counsel should be paid a reasonable fee for doing so. The process is such that that was denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole matter needs to be looked at. I support the bill; do not get me wrong. I think it is important that the courts review these sorts of matters. But let us also look at the potential dangers that may arise when human rights commissions and so forth embark on these inquiries and the damage they can do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time remaining to me I want to refer to one particular case, that of a small business in Queensland which sold pumps and seals for various pumps. A customer tried to purchase a seal. He asked if the seal was available. The business said they were not in stock and informed the customer to that effect. The customer became upset, raised his voice, shouted and became abusive to the persons who were there. He used obscene language. There was absolutely no justification for doing so because the seal was not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At one stage the customer said that a pump that was on display should be dismantled so that he could purchase the seal. He raised his voice; he was asked to leave. The customer remained on the premises, became more abusive and used obscene language in front of a number of women. He was finally persuaded to leave and did so in the company of an employee. Whilst on the footpath, the customer spat on the employee, an elderly man. He then drove away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After that, the business received a call from the human rights commission. It has been dragged into a dispute with this person, who has alleged racial discrimination over this matter. It has already cost the small business $1,600 in legal fees and an enormous amount of worry and concern over what is, on the face of it, a totally unjustifiable complaint. It is important that these sorts of matters be referred to local tribunals. I welcome any
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suggestion regarding the creation of a federal magistracy to deal with these sorts of issues so that they do not clog up the superior courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all, I support the legislation. This House should constantly be reminded of the need to upgrade legal aid facilities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself in an unusual position in that my party will be supporting the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill but I have very grave reservations about it. I think it is a very important piece of legislation. It revolves around the Brandy decision&mdash;a decision about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in which a penalty was imposed and Brandy took the commission to the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it a very important decision? One of the most fundamental issues of human rights is that we all have, under human rights, the opportunity to be equal in the eyes of the law. The previous speaker, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), highlighted another aspect of that problem&mdash;that is, it is all very well to be equal in the eyes of the law but you need to be able to appear, and you need to be able, if you are in a court, to have equality of representation. I do not believe that we can talk about the majesty and beauty of Australian law when people are not able to exercise their rights under the law. In fact, to me, this is a very grave, serious issue of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Why then is Brandy important? I need to take issue with the learned judges of the High Court. If at each and every opportunity they are going to make an interpretation of judicial power that prices ordinary people out of the law, then I think they ought be very uncomfortable about that; I think they need to review it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could say, cynically, that this is the best bit of judicial industry policy that I have seen. I say again, with great respect to the learned justices of the High Court, that most profes sions, most organisations in our modern society have gone through some form of reorganisation for greater productivity and greater efficiency. I do not believe that judicial processes or the courts should be exempt
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5806"> from that; indeed, I do not think they can be. I do believe that we need to hold on to fundamental principles of the law, but that does not mean that somehow the judiciary or the courts are a static, unchanging factor in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does that affect ordinary citizens? The best way of contrasting that is to look at the states where the states, under their constitutions and the interpretation of the High Court judges, allow a number of tribunals to be created. However, I have to say, with great respect, that I find difficulty in distinguishing the decisions made by these tribunals from decisions made by the courts&mdash;but that is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, there is the small claims tribunal. Citizens can bring forward to that tribunal disputes involving money of up to a certain limit. A tribunal that has a lot of activity in my electorate is the tenancy tribunal, where there are disputes between landlords and tenants. We do not rush off to a magistrate; we do not rush off to a superior court; we do not even rush off to our local solicitors and engage them. We are able to take the matter, as a tenant or a landlord, before the tribunal, outline the circumstances of the case and have a decision reached. Perhaps not many citizens are taking advantage of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, however, one area that screams out in the federal jurisdiction for a tribunal of this nature, and that is family law. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) made a very important speech in October last year where, consistent with his views, he said that he wanted to look at taking out of the Family Court all the non-court functions. I have no difficulty with courts looking and acting like courts. I happen to support his view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attorney wanted to establish those functions within the Attorney-General's Department. This, perhaps, is where I take issue with the Attorney-General because I believe that we need to have a tribunal for family law matters in which there are parties who wish to appear before the Family Court but who do not have the financial wherewithal to engage solicitors, barristers and QCs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Family Court always justifies its success by saying, `Look, only five per cent of our cases actually go to litigation.' But there has never been an exhaustive study to determine why more cases do not go. I think this is because of two factors: exhaustion, and financial exhaustion. In other words, they run out of money. Having spoken to many people about family law matters, I know that they not only spend their available cash on hiring solicitors but then get into debt to hire them and they reach a point of financial no return. But we are not giving people any other options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the concept, if you like, of alternate dispute resolution. I know that my own constituents, in fact, want decisions in their matters arbitrated rather than mediated. It would be ideal to have a family tribunal where you could take these matters in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are rights of appeal with these tribunals, but I do not believe that there should be a de novo right to take such matters to a superior court. I think they should be taken to court on matters of law&mdash;there is no argument about that&mdash;but not in de novo hearings, because really you just exhaust yourself in front of one tribunal and then repeat the exercise with your solicitors' and barristers' guns drawn. So I do not really support a de novo hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to make another point about mediators and arbitrators. I think one of the most fundamental principles of the law is that, certainly, the practitioners should have qualifications; in other words, there has to be some learning involved in that role. But there needs to be consistency of decision making. That is why you have appeals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, there needs to be a degree of predictability, so that you can actually approach someone and say, `Given these circumstances, what is the likely outcome?' I know that can be a bit of a lottery, but I think you need these elements. The trouble comes when you are involved with mediators and  arbitrators. You need to ask then: what are their qualifications? How do we learn of their decisions? Is there some reportability in their decisions, so that we can ensure there is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5807"> consistency? And, of course, there is that issue of predictability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, whilst as parliamentarians we ought to encourage alternate dispute resolution per se, we ought to be aware that there are some pitfalls, and there ought to be some safeguards in that&mdash;and it is not going to be the total answer. I say that, at the federal level, we are very much handicapped because of this Brandy decision by the High Court; that we are not able to introduce the same element. We are not able to have that change in the legal system by having these tribunals in which the states have been involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be very grateful if the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department or even the Attorney-General&mdash;perhaps the parliamentary secretary at the table&mdash;might be able to give me a definitive explanation about the difference between the exercise of judicial and administrative power. It is true, for example, that in the Brandy case an amount of money was awarded against one of the parties, and it involved two citizens bringing the case before the human rights commission. But please do not tell me that similar decisions are not made by some of the other tribunals that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, for example, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. That makes decisions about people's eligibility for benefits from the Commonwealth and their decisions involve money&mdash;either the applicant paying the department or the department paying the applicant. The Immigration Review Tribunal makes decisions about whether people are allowed to become permanent residents of Australia. Although there is not an absolute market in that, it is certainly of considerable value to the individuals. In fact, if I wanted to be a little cynical I could say, `Go to Moscow and you will get the going rate for a short&hyphen;term visa, long-term visa and permanent residency application.' It certainly has a value there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These decisions affect citizens, affect their rights. All I am trying to say&mdash;not as someone who is learned in these matters but as a layman&mdash;is that I find it very difficult that the High Court pronounces very stridently that Brandy is the exercise of judicial power but the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is not or
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Immigration Review Tribunal is not. I think that they make judicial type decisions, to be frank. But, as I say, it is easy to make the distinction that these are matters between the people and the Commonwealth and involve Commonwealth instrumentalities or departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saying very seriously that I certainly hope that the High Court will have an opportunity to revisit the Brandy decision. In terms of the development of administrative law, this is a very crippling decision, a bad decision. It entrenches the current situation whereby ordinary citizens who have rights in this country actually cannot afford to exercise them. Yes, if we want to look at the specifics of Brandy, people are going to be able to go to the human rights commission; they are going to get a conciliated decision. But if they actually want to get a decision that cannot be conciliated, they have got to go to court. The government does not have the money to fund all citizens to go to court. We do not have the money for legal aid to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could return to the family law situation, I notice that the shadow minister at the table is Mr Martyn Evans. He chaired a very important inquiry into the funding of administration of the Family Court. He, more than anyone, would know that in terms of judicial processes we are spending over $100 million a year on the Family Court. I believe that the legal aid the Commonwealth spends is in the order of about $125 million per annum&mdash;nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in total. The majority of that legal aid, of course, goes to family law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is patently obvious that, if we were able to get a tribunal operating in the family law area, there would be significant savings of money to be made. But I do not want honourable members to think that I am obsessed about savings. What it really means is that people are going to be able to go to the tribunal to put their case. You cannot argue in this country that everyone who wants to mount a case can mount a case, because they  just do not have the money. The Brandy decision really makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to set up a tribunal.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5808">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret to say that this legislation is not doing anything to increase the access of ordinary people. I am not talking about the rich and powerful, the wealthy, the influential; they have always had access to the law, they have always had access to solicitors, barristers and QCs. I have got no problem with that. I am talking about ordinary citizens; that is, people in jobs, middle&hyphen;class people and the poor. They do not have the wherewithal to exercise their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) said that maybe these tribunals are an inferior form of justice. That may be the case, but I have to say that I think that an inferior form of justice is preferable to no justice at all. An inferior form of hearing is preferable to no hearing at all. Until the High Court comes to grips with the implications of Brandy and what it means for tribunals and for the Commonwealth and until the parliament comes to grips with it, I cannot see much progress at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my remarks by referring to the issue in family law that is probably the most difficult. That concerns contact. At the moment, it is true that there is a presumption in the decisions of the Family Court and its registrars that the best interests of children are with their mothers. Overwhelmingly, residency orders go that way, and I have no quibble with that; I think that is the nature of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when the court also makes contact orders and those orders are not fulfilled, you need to make a case. To get that residency order overturned, you really need to mount a number of cases, and people just do not have the money. I can understand why the Family Court does not imprison people, particularly women, for breaching the contact orders, but we need to have a solution. I guess the ultimate penalty is reversing which parent the child stays with. The only way you can really allow people the opportunity to make a number of applications which, in the first instance, may be reversed but, ultimately, would be seriously considered is to have a tribunal, because they just do not have the money. They do not have the financial resources.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why when people separate and divorce should so much of the available cash go to the legal profession? Why should it go to the legal profession in legal aid? If you had a tribunal, presumably those responsible for allocating legal aid would insist in the first instance that matters be heard by a tribunal unless there were exceptional circumstances of stalking or domestic violence or something like that. Those cases should go straight to the Family Court. I have no  argument about that. But, in all other cases, why would you not in the first instance have the matter heard in a tribunal and, in fact, save that legal aid for the more serious cases? As the member for Dickson pointed out, we are failing to fund many genuine cases in many areas of the law. People are being denied their access to the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I really believe that the Brandy decision was, with great respect, a bad decision by the court. They have locked themselves into preventing a plethora of tribunals developing in the federal arena. I sincerely hope that the court will review its decision in the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this morning I was privileged to be in the House during the contribution of the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), who spoke about the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill and used it as an opportunity to talk about the human rights of Asian and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens in our community being impinged over a period by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kooyong gave a very powerful speech. I, like the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who spoke on indulgence soon after his speech, wish to be associated with his remarks. It marks a shift in the debate about Hansonism, as it has come to be known, where her own words are being used to condemn the sorts of statements that she has been making. It has been clearly put on the table that what she has been saying has been racist and bigoted and that it has not  been done out of ignorance but out of a purely crass, manipulative political motive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5809">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now 20 years or more since the Commonwealth began to officially recognise the barbarism of discrimination. We drew a line in the sand and defined the difference between right and wrong by instituting certain laws such as the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975, the Human Rights Commission Act in 1981, the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992. These laws were enacted to provide for equality and access to employment and housing for all  Australians regardless of colour, creed, gender or physical make&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is impossible to legislate people's attitudes, the growing awareness in the community that the elementary Australian principle of a fair go should be extended to everyone has seen a greater and wider tolerance and acceptance of all our fellow human beings. While there are no doubt prejudices still left over from a bygone era, in the main they remain below the surface, but not always.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are times when these prejudices spill over the top, where the intolerance of one can adversely affect the standing of another in any number of ways. If it is necessary to have a law, then it is equally necessary to provide suitable means to enforce it and to ensure justice for the aggrieved party. At the same time, we must ensure that the cost to the person or persons wronged of such injustice in terms of both finance and stress is kept to a minimum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of themselves, these laws do not provide for the delivery of justice. There has long been a recognition that the current system, with its inconsistencies and variations between the anti&hyphen;discrimination laws, is not the cure&hyphen;all it was intended to be and that it needed revision. The conciliation process adopted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has proven successful in many cases, but there have been problems associated with resolution of those cases in which conciliation has proven unproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill allows for major changes in two areas. It streamlines complaint investigations and conciliation procedures by bringing the various areas of discrimination dispute under
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the jurisdiction of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and it enables applications to the Federal Court for settlement of disputes where conciliation fails. I think it is fair to say that all of us would favour the process of conciliation over that of litigation in these matters. Certainly, my office has already taken some calls from constituents fearing that the increased role of the Federal Court in these proceedings will discourage claims from people who are less well to do but aggrieved nonetheless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people will be pleased to learn that the filing fees in the Federal Court will be waived in certain instances&mdash;for those holding Commonwealth health benefits cards; for those in prison; Austudy, Abstudy and legal aid recipients; children; and those who can demonstrate financial hardship. The Attorney-General's Department has noted that in excess of 30 per cent of all litigants would be likely to avoid paying the filing fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, we would like to keep those matters out of court if possible, but a court ruling is by far the most certain method of collecting any compensation that might arise from a dispute. The regime introduced by the previous Labor government was found to be unconstitutional as evidenced by the Brandy case, which a number of the speakers have touched on this morning and no doubt will continue to touch on during this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">HREOC is a non&hyphen;judicial body and does not have the constitutional power for dispute determination. While in opposition, the coalition made a vow to change the system and make it more workable. This bill, when passed, will give the system constitutional certainty and provides the most effective and efficient device for conciliation and determination of discrimination complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it remarkable that members opposite can criticise us for reducing funding to the commission. In all their years in office the only thing they learned about government was how to spend more money each year. They looked at the budget papers and saw an increase in spending on each line and be lieved that that was good in itself. But they never bothered with the bottom line. It was as if
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5810"> they bought us all a new TV, stereo and VCR and never figured out that we did not really need them, or that we could not afford to pay for them. They unfortunately equated higher spending with greater justice. We know from years of experience in so many areas that greater spending does not mean greater justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the reduced role, HREOC will retain an important role under these proposed new arrangements. Parties whose complaints reach the court may be assisted by a report prepared by the Human Rights Commissioner, and commissioners will also be able to join proceedings as a friend of the court. While the parliament cannot dictate to the court how it will conduct its own affairs, it is expected that the court will set up a human rights registry to assist clients and the judicial registrars will be appointed to handle the additional caseload that will eventuate from these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all, the new system will serve to bring about more definitive rulings and better procedures for compensation. In addition, I would hope that some of the more frivolous cases never see the light of day under the new regime. I recall recently an elderly woman coming to my office to complain that she had been dragged before the commission on a trumped up charge of sex discrimination. She had denied a tenant permission to make alterations to her building because of doubts about insurance liability. The woman who had been contracted by the tenant to perform the work saw this as enough reason to claim that she had been discriminated against on the grounds of gender. There followed some media coverage of the charge and the owner of the building had her picture on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, causing her some considerable stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it came to pass, my constituent was eventually cleared of any discriminatory behaviour, but justice was hardly swift in coming. The proceedings were protracted and her relief at the final outcome was tempered greatly by the financial cost to her of the whole exercise. It is to be hoped, then, that these new arrangements will aid in weeding out the Chicken Littles from the genuine cases
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of discrimination. I suspect the numbers of people who seek to exploit the system in this way are very few, but it would be to everyone's benefit if every case had at least some real merit to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Australian spirit is one of overall fairness, that attitude, sadly, does not extend to every one of our people, especially when times are tough. It has been the experience that some will go looking for a scapegoat for their own failure. It has also been the experience that demagogues will seek to exploit that uneasy and uncertain situation to their own ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After such an extended period of Labor government, many things needed to be righted, and still do. It is a fair and  reasonable expectation that Australians should ask a lot of questions about the way things have been and are being done in our country. That is the nature of our democracy, and debate on every aspect of public policy should be encouraged. The more debate, usually the more facts emerge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is distressing that some who are posing as nationalists and upholders of the Australian tradition seem intent on providing simplistic solutions to complex problems. The member for Oxley is a major proponent of this dangerous method. She has garnered media attention because she shoots from the hip without delay, thought or clue. She sells newspapers. She is a human headline who has won support in some quarters because some have too easily mistaken `outrageous' for `courageous'. While she has changed her staff regularly, her views have undergone no such metamorphosis. It seems to me that that she has come into possession of the Pat Buchanan playbook and is now attempting to appeal to a wider audience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake. The member for Oxley is a populist looking for yet more targets as she gallivants around the country with her shadow dwelling disciples preaching her facile mantra, laying blame for national problems at the feet of Australian minorities. Crime? To her we blame Asian migrants. National debt? Let us blame our indigenous  people. And on it goes from one issue to the other. I hear her defenders saying that she is saying only what
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5811"> many Australians are thinking. If that is the case, then those Australians are mistaken and we need to communicate better the modern realities and necessities of life in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these realities need to be put on the record. Only 3.3 per cent of Department of Social Security welfare payments go to indigenous people. On a per capita basis, mainstream services and benefits are absorbed by indigenous people far less than they are by other Australians. Unemployment amongst indigenous people is about two or three times the national rate and mean income one-third less. The retention rates in schools are appalling. Indigenous health is such that only one-third will live to male pension age. Many communities operate without sewerage, electricity and adequate water supply. We have all heard that line: `I remember the days when we could leave our doors unlocked when we left the house.' I am sure that many of our indigenous people would be more than happy to lock their doors if they had them. Home ownership is less than half that of the national percentage. The number of occupants per household is nearly double.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not fool ourselves that this is a privileged class of people, as the member for Oxley believes, or at least wants us to believe. Nor should we swallow her fantasy about the make-up of our population. It seems to me that she is trying to revive the old fear that we are about to be overrun by what used to be known in the times of the White Australia policy as `the yellow peril'. I think we have moved on from those days. Certainly I hope so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that under five per cent of our population is Asian born. That figure will increase to just 7&half; per cent over the next 30 years. I noted with interest this week the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and, in particular, the possibility of prosecution and fines for telling mistruths in election campaigns. It occurred to me that the member for Oxley may well have to increase the cover charge for her One Nation floor show if she does not clean up her act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many scars that must be healed if Australia is to move forward and become a power in our region and throughout the world. We have unlimited potential, but we are held back because other nations are looking for excuses to question our integrity, especially on matters such as race relations. Reports from several high&hyphen;ranking officials from Australia who have returned from Asia confirm that our trade is suffering because of some of the nonsense that is being talked in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourism market&mdash;the best chance we have to show the world the sort of nation we have and the people we really are&mdash;is being similarly affected. These empty&hyphen;headed cries for a return to the policies of yesterday have reopened these scars and will continue to make our progress difficult. In a world economy, we must be competitive and cooperative. We must be beyond reproach in matters of race relations. Even more important, we must be seen to be beyond reproach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Matters of race and discrimination in our past are very much in the news with the release of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into the stolen children. This report goes a long way to explain the depth of our feeling over indigenous people and their treatment. It contains a litany of horror, recollections of experiences from those who were taken from their families or had children taken from them. It is part of our history&mdash;our very recent history at that&mdash;and cannot be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a long report and its price will sadly prevent many Australians from buying it. Still, these true stories are required reading. I was particularly struck by the reminiscences of Fiona, who remembered all too well her experience of 1936 when she was five years of age. She was accompanied by her mother, two of her siblings and three cousins on a truck from Ernabella to the United Aborigines Mission in Oodnadatta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That night, Fiona saw her mother leave the mission and never had the opportunity to say goodbye. Taken from her natural environ ment, Fiona adjusted to the ways of life of Europeans, moved to the suburbs of Adelaide

I am saddened that some have taken the release of this report as another opportunity to grandstand in an attempt to win points from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we support the general idea of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the current context in which we approach this matter is a sad one because of the Howard government's actions in relation to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in which there has been an announcement of a reduction of 40 per cent in its budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just heard the previous government speaker, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), waxing lyrical about how the Hanson phenomenon has to be stopped, how racism has to be stamped out and how we have to do more things to improve our international image. But actions speak louder than words. The reality is that the government in its action in reducing the budget dramatically of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is sending a very different signal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The different signal is this: notwithstanding the language and the propaganda, when it comes to having the resources to deal with the issues of discrimination and the issues of human rights, this government is cutting those resources in a dramatic way. It ought to be condemned for that. It is a sign of what is happening across the board with respect to this government on the issues of race, multiculturalism and human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening across the board is that we have had somewhat reluctant comments from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;and some not so reluctant comments from some other ministers&mdash;coming too little too late. At the same time, when you look at the actions, you see that the actions are not in any way
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5813"> consistent with the comments that the Prime Minister has made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good the Prime Minister going overseas and saying, `Australia has been condemned unfairly on these matters,' when he was responsible in the first instance for not doing enough. It is universally accepted throughout this country that he did not do enough about the Hanson phenomenon. We also have actions by the government which appear to be giving ground to the very positions of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her supporters. One of those is this dramatic cut to the budget of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at the recent history of Australia, one cannot imagine a time when it was more important to boost the budget and support of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission rather than to reduce it. That comes on top of a reduction of 55 per cent, $5.5 million, to the campaign against racism, which has not started yet, although it is one year since the time it was announced. In the first year of its budget, not a penny was spent. Not a penny was spent because of the fact that we have a situation where we have had a lot of talk from this government in recent times&mdash;not so much earlier, when it was necessary&mdash;about how we need to stamp out the problems created by Pauline Hanson and her supporters, but we do not have sufficient action and we do not have sufficient resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those two things together&mdash;the cut to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the cut to the campaign against racism&mdash;ought to be condemned. They illustrate a certain amount of hypocrisy on the part of the government in relation to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that on the human rights question this government is cutting out resources across the board. This government is not as concerned about these matters as it ought to be. I believe that is a very serious issue. By the way, it does not just go to the question of the role of the commission on matters of race. In the case of the sex discrimination issue, the government, because of its cuts to budgets, decided not to replace the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who has a very
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important role to play in ensuring that there is equality between men and women in relation to a whole range of issues in this nation. What happened is that, instead of replacing that commissioner, they merged that position with the position of the Privacy Commissioner. They have one person doing the two jobs. That is a huge task for the one person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for that was obviously some attempt to save a small amount of money in the context of a situation in which we are facing increasing complaints about discrimination from all levels, especially discrimination against women, discrimination against indigenous people and discrimination against people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds&mdash;especially, in recent times, people of Asian background&mdash;as a consequence of the Hanson phenomenon. The fact that there has been a dramatic increase in complaints about racial discrimination clearly shows that the Hanson phenomenon has had an impact in our society and cannot be ignored. How can the commission carry out its functions and its role if it is not properly funded and if its resources have been substantially reduced? The government cannot be seen to be serious about the Hanson phenomenon while it is doing things of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look at a little bit of history in relation to this question of how to deal with racial issues, because you will recall that in the last year of the Keating government we attempted to pass the racial vilification bill. What happened in relation to that bill was that the conservative parties that had control of the Senate with one of the minor parties decided that they would not support punitive sanctions in that bill, which basically meant that only civil remedies were available for people who have been discriminated against or who have been abused because of racial vilification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that has meant is this: because we now have the Hanson phenomenon and we have people actually being vilified, the law cannot take action against them. They have to take civil action in civil courts. That was the result of the conservatives' failure to pass the racial vilification bill in its full meaning when
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5814"> they were in opposition. Nothing has been done to fix up this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you read some of the comments of the member for Oxley&mdash;and some of her comments were reproduced on page 6 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 18 June&mdash;in my opinion, they are contrary to the racial vilification bill. Unfortunately, nothing very much can be done about it because there are no punitive sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were discussing the racial vilification bill, the issue of freedom of speech arose. Of course, whenever you are discussing this question of whether people can express racial abuse, others who want to say, `Yes, they ought to be able to do so,' bring up the question of freedom of speech. But both sides of the House, when this matter was discussed, agreed that there is a limit to the freedom of speech; that is, racial abuse and abuse of people on the basis of their race should not be admitted in this country. What have we had from the Hanson phenomenon and from Ms Hanson herself? We have had comments similar to those which the racial vilification bill was intended to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister was first asked to comment on the maiden speech of Ms Hanson, did he emphasise the racial vilification act? Did he emphasise the Racial Discrimination Act? Did he emphasise the human rights commission's role in these matters? Not at all. On the contrary, he emphasised her right to freedom of speech as if there were an unlimited right to freedom of speech, irrespective of questions of racial intolerance and racial discrimination. That is what he did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister failed even to refer to the balance which this House had sought to achieve when it passed the racial vilification bill and when speakers on both sides of this House made the point that there is not an absolute right to freedom of speech. There is a universal right, but it is limited in one specific way throughout the world in considerations of this kind&mdash;that is, freedom of speech does not extend to being able to attack people on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the Prime Minister in his first comments on Ms Hanson's maiden speech
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> failed completely to talk about that balance, to refer to that issue, it was assumed and widely accepted that she had an absolute right to talk about these matters&mdash;and she continues to do so&mdash;irrespective of the fact that we ought to have been having a very thorough examination as to whether the comments by Ms Hanson are contrary to the intentions and to the letter of the racial vilification bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you say things like, `I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians, who have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate,' and the comments are taken up and directed towards individual people, that is racial vilification. Individuals are vilified because they are of Asian background, irrespective of the fact that they may have made a significant and very important contribution to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When did we last see in human history the claim that a race of people form ghettos and do not assimilate&mdash;this idea of condemning a whole group of people? We saw that before the Second World War and during the Second World War when it was directed against the Jewish community and later on when it formed the basis of the extermination of the Jewish people. It is not a very long way to go from racial vilification comments to violence against individuals and to organised attacks against those groups of people. We do not want this in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, by not condemning this matter from the very beginning, totally failed the nation. As I said before, rather than talking about the member for Oxley's rights to freedom of speech, he should have been focusing on the need to balance freedom of speech with responsibility in terms of these issues. After all of this process, we are now in a situation where internationally our reputation has been sullied. The Prime Minister now, a year later, goes overseas and says, `This is all very unfair. Australia is not like this at all.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the Hanson phenomenon was allowed to spread and it was allowed to multiply. In the context in which we have economic problems and other problems in this nation&mdash;which we can address, notwithstanding the fact that we have differ
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5815"> ences of view in this place about how they ought to be addressed&mdash;we know that people will try to blame others of different ethnic cultures and of different races. When people feel threatened, when people feel their economic future is insecure and when they feel some angst about the future, it is a common phenomenon for them to try to blame people of a different race or a different culture for their problems. Therefore, we have had this idea that the immigration program in the last few years has been somehow responsible for our current ills, notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence from economists that immigration is a net positive for the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not even carry out a campaign to counter these lies being put about by the member for Oxley and her supporters. No campaign is carried out to show the enormous positive benefits which this nation has had from immigration, from multiculturalism and from the fact that we have managed until the Hanson phenomenon arose to be a harmonious nation in which people from more than 200 different cultures and traditions were working together and trying to build a better society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then all of a sudden, because of the economic problems I mentioned plus because the Hanson phenomenon was allowed to continue in that way without much counter from the government until recently, we now are in this extraordinary position where a society which was previously held up as a model of multiculturalism and as a model of people working together by the United Nations itself in its conferences, is threatened. Because of these serious tensions and divisions, the rubric of our society is threatened. They threaten to divide our people and threaten to create an image of Australia internationally which is a very bad one and which will rebound on us, not only economically but also in terms of the standing of the nation internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have said, `Oh, this is a problem because of its economic consequences.' Of course the economic consequences for this nation will be extremely serious. But it is not just an economic question; it is a fundamental moral question. If the United Nations Universal Declaration of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Human Rights means something it means that all peoples, irrespective of their culture and racial background, have the entitlement to equal treatment and equal worth. Australia was one of the founding nations in signing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But, in recent times, some members of this House&mdash;and I do not just refer to the member for Oxley&mdash;seem to have forgotten about that. We are left, therefore, with a situation in which we now have to carry out a positive campaign in support of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me back to the problems that we have with this bill. We will be moving a number of amendments in the Senate to seek to strengthen this bill. We will also be continuously making the point to the Australian people that if you are serious about human rights, if you are serious about racial discrimination, if you are serious about discrimination on the basis of gender, if you are serious about doing something to improve the image of Australia as a nation in which human rights are respected then you do not cut the budget of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;and certainly not by 40 per cent. That is a disgrace. It indicates that the government has lost its way in relation to these very important issues facing the Australian nation. As I said, it is no good the Prime Minister complaining internationally about these matters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) opposite, one could have forgotten that we were in fact debating the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1966. The honourable member appears to have digressed rather substantially into a wide-ranging attack on the approach of this government to free speech and also on the approach of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to comments made by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say there is not very much uttered by the honourable member for Calwell that I agree with, but I defend very strongly his right to say what he wants to say in a democracy. It has been said that when freedom is curtailed freedom is lost. I certainly under
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5816"> stand the robust debate which has taken place in Australia over the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley. I can understand why many people feel hurt and upset by some of her statements. I can also appreciate that there is a very great risk to Australia's trade with our region resulting from those comments. But I think at the end of the day we have to appreciate that Australia is a democracy. We have freedom, stability and a way of life that is the envy of people throughout the world. Sometimes, accompanying those freedoms, we have to put up with situations which not all of us entirely like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I was a speaker at a seminar organised here at Parliament House recently by the Japanese Embassy to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the signing of the trade treaty between Australia and Japan by a former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr McEwen. During that seminar, which was attended by a number of Australian members of parliament and a number of Japanese members of parliament, the moderator, Mr Frank Devine, the former editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, asked the Japanese delegation what the Japanese Prime Minister of the day would do if a Pauline Hanson&hyphen;like figure emerged in Japan and made comments of similar ilk. It would surprise the honourable member for Calwell to know that the leader of the Japanese delegation said that the Japanese Prime Minister would do nothing. He said in effect, `Japan is a democracy. People have the right of free speech in Japan.' That is what would have happened in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that members opposite, particularly the previous speaker, the honourable member for Calwell, have condemned this government's approach when we as a government have not really supported the views of the honourable member for Oxley at all. We have said that in Australia there is a democracy and that people are entitled to say what they want. Of course, what they say ought to be tempered with responsibility. The thing is, though, that in a democracy people are allowed to express robust and differing views. I think it would be a sad day if the thought police prevented anyone on either
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> side of the parliament getting up and expressing an honestly held view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have certain concerns about comments made by the honourable member for Oxley, but I believe that, in a free society, it is important that the honourable member for Calwell, the honourable member for Oxley&mdash;indeed, all honourable members&mdash;and members of the Australian community generally have the right to express their views. Of course, as I said, those views ought to be tempered with responsibility. But, at the end of the day, we have to come to a decision about whether Australia is a democracy or whether Australia is not a democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I reject also the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell criticising the coalition's approach to the Racial Hatred Act 1995 when it was a bill before the House. We believe very strongly in free speech. We think it is one of the fundamental freedoms that we have inherited from a thousand years of democracy. Our democracy is robust. I think it is very sad that the honourable member for Calwell seeks to criticise the government for standing up for what most Australians would accept as one of the very basic rights in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister himself has been very even&hyphen;handed about this whole issue. If you have listened to what the Prime Minister has said and if you have looked closely at what he has said as he defends the right of people to speak their minds, you will realise that he said those rights should be tempered with responsibility. He has not hesitated to point out where he disagrees with the honourable member for Oxley. I believe that the Prime Minister has an entirely appropriate approach to this whole matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have great confidence in the good sense of the Australian community. This is a wonderful country. We are a nation of settlers, along with our indigenous people. It ought to be appreciated that Australians are able to consider both sides of the argument, and I am confident that they will take a very sensible and balanced approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the honourable member for Calwell, I intend to address some elements of the bill in my speech. This bill has two main pur
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5817"> poses. Firstly, it aims to amend the Commonwealth anti&hyphen;discrimination legislation to reform the administration functions and structure of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Most importantly, it is a response to the decision of the High Court in the case of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which found that the commission as a non&hyphen;judicial body did not have constitutional power to determine disputes finally. And the fundamental change proposed in the bill is that the commission will no longer conduct hearings or inquiries in relation to matters that cannot be conciliated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill make the commission more focused. The president effectively becomes the chief executive officer of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and, as such, will  have responsibility for implementation of cooperative arrangements and other administrative tasks.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important change is that the complaint investigation and conciliation function will be centralised in the office of president.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also simplifies dispute resolution procedures in human rights matters by eliminating the second tier of review in the commission&mdash;that is, the commission inquiry, which was not directly enforceable. It also provides that matters that cannot be conciliated or are not suitable for conciliation will be dealt with in the Federal Court. It says that the Federal Court will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms in determining proceedings brought before it under the legislation, and it does permit the judges to delegate some, if not all, of their functions to judicial registrars. Of course that will assist the Federal Court in dealing with the additional caseloads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes provision for the commissioners other than the Privacy Commissioner to appear as amicus curiae to argue the policy imperatives of their legislation before the Federal Court, subject to the court granting leave for that to be done. The bill also proposes a number of access and equity reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Court will be able to adopt informal procedures, as it will not be bound
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by technicalities or legal forms. Some people would say that the Federal Court is not the appropriate body to handle matters which were previously looked after by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, but because of the decision of the High Court in relation to the separation of powers what we have done is bring forward what we believe to be a sensible compromise, a compromise which will provide for conciliation and which will provide for remedies when those are required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When there is hardship, either party to a proceeding will be able to apply to the Attorney&hyphen;General for financial assistance, and I believe that that is a very important inclusion, because the last thing that this government would want would be for people who are not able to afford to access remedies to be locked out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also envisaged that friendly procedures will be developed. Some people might say that friendship and the Federal Court are mutually exclusive terms, but what we have done is to bring forward this balanced approach to the Brandy decision. We believe that the Federal Court judges will be able to work the systems through so that in fact we have a situation which is eminently workable, fair and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry also about the contributions made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the honourable member for Calwell. Again, they seem to have forgotten the particular bill that we were talking about. In addition, I think it was unfortunate that the honourable member for Banks has sought to politicise this matter and that those opposite have sought to criticise the government. What they have not done is to say that this bill is the government's response to the mess that was set up by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government implemented the scheme that was found by the High Court to be unconstitutional. One would have thought that the former government should have done its homework, should have checked to see whether what it was doing would have been allowable under the law of Australia. It did not, and indeed the result is that the High Court brought down its decision which has
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5818"> ultimately resulted in the bill currently before the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within constitutional limitations, the bill provides the most efficient mechanism for the conciliation and arbitration of federal discrimination complaints. Most importantly&mdash;and you would be aware yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, what importance the coalition places on keeping its election promises&mdash;as a party going to the polls we promised that we would implement this bill. The bill before the chamber is yet another indication of the fact that, unlike our predecessors, this government is prepared to keep its election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administrative structure of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be made more efficient, which is a first step to making sure that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is able to serve the country well as we go into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were also some criticisms coming from the Labor Party speakers over budget cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There was a suggestion, I think, by the honourable member for Calwell that, by reducing the budget to the commission, somehow this indicated that the coalition was not interested in human rights matters and was not interested in making sure that we had fairness and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be recognised that the coalition has required the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to find savings, as other government departments have had to find savings. Bureaucracy not only runs riot in other government departments but also is present in the commission. We have cut the budget by $1.5 million per annum while the loss of the hearing function will result in savings of $600,000. And it ought to be noted that the balance will be able to be found through increased efficiencies in the commission itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, unlike its predecessor, realises that one has to balance the books. We simply cannot go on spending at the rate that the former government was spending. We have to accept that we must have income to meet our expenditure. By continuing to build up huge budget deficits year after year, our
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> predecessors were mortgaging the future of our children and grandchildren. We all recall that sad and sorry saga prior to the election last year when the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, both told us that the budget situation was in surplus. We sought to find out what the information actually was, and we were told that the budget was in surplus but that exact figures were not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine our surprise on the Monday after the election when the incoming Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), was presented with the figures, which must have been available to the former government prior to the election. Far from having a budget that was in surplus, we actually discovered that there was a deficit of some $10.3 billion, and we had to fix the problem. We did not create the problem. We did not create the situation where there was a $10.3 billion deficit, but we had to fix it. We take responsibility for fixing it, and we will not run away and shirk our responsibilities to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other government expenditures have had to be reined in because we simply cannot go on spending more than we as a nation earn. The response of those opposite always seems to be to write more cheques and to spend more money, but at the end of the day the people of Australia do require fiscal responsibility and they do appreciate that one must essentially run a nation's books in the same way as one would run one's own household accounts. One simply cannot go on spending more than one earns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we had to make savings. We would have preferred not to have cut government expenditures in some areas where we have had to, but at the end of the day the Treasurer had the intestinal fortitude in two successive budgets to stand up and say that enough was enough. There was a change in government. We were given a mandate by the Australian people to be economically responsible, and the government has ensured that we have not shirked
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5819"> our mandate and have not shirked our responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill has, as I said, two essential elements. One makes some amendments and reforms to the commission itself and the other one is a very effective response to the Brandy case. We did not create the problem that made it necessary for this bill to be brought in, we did not build up the budget deficit, but we have had to find the savings. We did not implement the scheme that was overturned by the High Court in the Brandy case, but we have also had to fix this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really sickening to find the Labor Party coming into this chamber with speaker after speaker after speaker pouring criticism on the government over a range of matters that is not relevant in any way, shape or form to the bill currently before the House. In addition to that, not only are those criticisms not relevant to this bill but they are absolutely and completely wrong. I commend the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the government for bringing this bill to the parliament. It is a bill that is necessary, balanced, fair and equitable. The regime that will exist following the passage of this bill will have an entirely appropriate mechanism to listen to and deal with complaints in relation to discrimination. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fellow came to me recently to review a book. He was a Hungarian&mdash;a refugee. He came out here in 1948 as a reffo. His first job was working for the army as a civilian and his boss was an army cook, who apparently liked grog and used to abuse him for his own shortcomings&mdash;`You useless reffo this' and `You useless reffo this, why have you done this?'&mdash;but this fellow said, `When I realised that I could abuse the boss back I thought, "What a wonderful country this is."' That has been a hallmark of this country and this is what the likes of the member for Calwell and the member for Sturt want to sweep away with the nonsense they are putting forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very critical of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill before us. If you look at funding in real terms, you see the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is still getting more than it got in 1989&hyphen;90, and that is an indictment of this government, for it is quite clear to me that this pontificating group, set up at taxpayers' expense and whose members draw large salaries from taxpayers and seem to think their duty is to continually denigrate us, should be swept away. That would save money to be put into much more useful things. If you gave me $10 million for Aboriginal housing, I could do more for Aboriginal housing than government has ever done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that there is now a concerted policy of the Liberal Party to attack Pauline Hanson. I suppose she must pose some sort of a threat to them, so they denigrate her at
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5820"> every opportunity. If you go back to Pauline Hanson's first speech in this parliament it was a naive, honest, from&hyphen;the&hyphen;heart speech. It is the sort of speech that a politician should make and there should be more of those speeches in this parliament. There was nothing in that speech that warranted the vilification she got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you saw across this country was a united effort from the media, Australia's sick academia, politicians from both sides and the churches to destroy this woman, and to destroy her so completely that no&hyphen;one would ever raise these issues again. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) let the cat out of the bag in his speech. In that 2&half;&hyphen;hour diatribe of voodoo incantation that passed for debate in this House, he said, `Free speech is all right but you can't let free speech interfere with free trade.' Then, having realised what he had said, he said, `I can't see how anyone could doubt the benefits of free trade.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I doubt the benefits of free trade. I have always supported bilateral trade and I will support fair trade, but free trade is a nonsense. It has done enormous damage to this country. That is simply irrefutable. If the minister wants to I would be very happy to engage in a debate with him on that issue. But that was it. They were quite happy to keep this argument milling around on the race issue but they did not want it to touch free trade. That is, of course, what is concerning the Liberal Party now. They are locked into this dogma of rational economics&mdash;the creation of Paul Keating probably more than anyone else. It is a dangerous dogma. It is not an economic policy; it is extreme ideology and it is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the Hilmer report is not about competition; it is about oligopoly. Once you get rid of small business, big business will collude. The mistake that all these people make when they go back to Ricardo and Adam Smith is that they forget that these people made it plain that they were talking about competition within national boundaries, not without national boundaries. The whole thesis and doctrine was based on competition within national boundaries.</PARA>

As I said, they are fetching high salaries paid by the Australian taxpayer. They seem to think their job is to continually denigrate us, a denigration which is not justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saying this again, Mr Deputy Speaker, to refresh your memory because I have already said it once. In my view, this organisation should be swept away entirely, but the government does not have the stomach for that. I hope they will have the courage to do it in small doses and continue to cut its funding so that it is no longer an oppressive threat to Australian sensibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In debating this bill, there has been an implication by many speakers that we are a racist country. I have made it clear in my speech that we are not. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has made several attempts to do this. I remember when Irene Moss wanted to do a paper to show how racist we were. Unfortunately for Irene, even their slanted investigation proved that Australia was probably less racist than most of the migrant groups who came to this country. So she turned it into an attack on Australia and its Aboriginal affairs record. This was at a time when there was an inquiry under way into Aboriginal deaths in custody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall entering one of the committee rooms here by mistake when she was holding
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5822"> forth about the terrible situation in Kalgoorlie. This is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for you. She was saying how Aboriginals were disproportionately represented in the unemployment statistics for Kalgoorlie. Of course they are. The mining companies will fall over backwards to employ an Aboriginal if he can speak English, he can turn up for shift work and he can turn up clean. That is where they fall down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of Aboriginals in Kalgoorlie. They have two ways of getting a state house: they can go on the Aboriginal housing list or on the normal state housing list which everyone else goes on. They get two bites of the cherry. So there are a lot of Aboriginal people in Kalgoorlie. There are also a lot of Aboriginal people in Kalgoorlie because we have not done the right thing by their communities. They leave the communities and impact on the edge of town by becoming fringe dwellers. There is no mechanism to get them back to their communities. We have set up these communities in areas where there are no employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After we kicked out the missions, we have been providing education in the central reserve area for 40 years. In that 40 years, we have not managed to get one Aboriginal to year 12, nor do we look like achieving this. But it is not through lack of money. It would be cheaper to send every child to the most expensive boarding school in Perth. The record is abysmal and the reasons for it are quite obvious. They are not attended to, in my view, because of cowardice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, an Aboriginal woman said to me, `Our kids aren't getting educated because they're not going to school.' Why doesn't the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission look at this? Obviously, it is important that they get an education. The woman said, `Education is vital to our people but you don't care. If they were white kids, you would make them go to school.' I said to her, `You've got it wrong; we make the white kids go to school because we don't care. We say, "That's the law and you're going to school," but we're so frightened of your culture that we daren't do it with your kids.' She said, `That's crazy, our kids are the ones who want
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an education.' I said, `You tell your people; don't tell me.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have allowed football matches to become cultural events. A football match will take kids out of school for one week in two during the football season. Then we wonder why they cannot get an education out there. Also, a lot of these kids know&mdash;they are smart enough to know&mdash;that there are no jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said repeatedly in the House that it was interesting to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) take up my diagnosis when he said he thought the problems with Aboriginals were hygiene, health, housing, education and training&mdash;exactly the things I have been saying. But he left out the one vital factor&mdash;employment. If you leave one of those things out of that formula, the wheels fall off everything. You have to attack it across the board. You do not just say, `This year we will look at this' or `This year we will look at that.' Clearly, some work can be done on human rights in this area, but it will never be done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Much more can be done by having sensitive and sensible policies in government and by politicians actually representing their electorates, not kowtowing to party dogma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell, in speaking on this bill, talked about limits to freedom of speech. You either have free speech or you do not have free speech. The limits on free speech are not as he put it. There have always been limits on free speech with regard to inciting people to violence. I think there should be those limits; I do not think we should be allowing incitement to violence. Yet we have seen recently in the papers journalists and others inciting people to violence, saying, `You should go along and attack Pauline Hanson.' People have been saying that they expect Pauline Hanson will be shot. That is an incitement to violence, but nothing will be done to these people because they are running what is considered to be a politically correct view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member said that this will lead to what happened in Nazi Germany. We have moved well past Nazi Germany. Let us look at the situation in Cambodia; let us look at the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5823"> situation across Africa; let us look at the situation in what was formerly Yugoslavia where the member for Calwell was taking a partisan position and supporting one side against the other&mdash;the Croatians against the Serbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at acting analytically, you cannot apportion blame like that because they are all as bad as one another, including the Muslim element.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill before the House, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, repeals the human rights and equal opportunity inquiry and determination functions. This is in response to the High Court's 1995 decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which found that the commission, as a non-judicial body, did not have the constitutional power to finally determine disputes. The amendments will implement a system that will facilitate a resort to the Federal Court, by way of an application, in order to obtain an enforceable determination in the event that complaints lodged cannot be resolved through conciliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major thrust in these amendments before the House will centralise the three following complementary acts: the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. These acts will all be centralised under the auspices of the Office of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which will determine all complaint investigations and conciliation procedures that formerly arose under the three previously mentioned acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) said in his second reading speech, the coalition government remains firmly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and, over the next few months, the government will be considering further reforms to the commission. However, specifically, the reform of the administration of the commission and the efficacy of the structure is addressed in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, this bill brings forward several important access and equity reforms and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5824"> initiatives. In regard to the court, a great deal of informal procedure will be encouraged and less emphasis will be placed on legal forms and technicalities. Human rights matters will be especially provided for through special registry procedures. Also, in keeping with the access and equity principles, the commission will be required to assist complainants in completing the required forms so that proceedings can begin in the Federal Court. Further, a copy of the report will be made available to the commissioner or the parties by the president after a complaint has been terminated and after the report has been finalised by the president.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very pleased to note that, with regard to the issue of financial assistance towards proceedings, parties who may be unable to proceed because of financial restrictions will now be able to apply to the Attorney-General for consideration of financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the amendments contained in this bill are difficult and complex, however necessary. As I mentioned earlier, the amendments are intended to combine the three different schemes currently in effect into just one complaint handling procedure that is standardised and is to be incorporated into the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by reiterating the necessity of these amendments. While the commission and the commissioners will have had some of their quasi&hyphen;judicial functions removed, importantly, however, the bill retains the commission's role in conciliation, as this has proven to be the most effective way of resolution. In fact, it is important to note that most complaints are resolved at the conciliation stage. Finally, the bill clarifies and delineates the commission's role in conciliatory complaints from the commissioner's advocacy role for the protection of human rights. I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The excesses of executive government are limited in our society in two ways: firstly, by the opportunities citizens have at the ballot box and, secondly, by the separation of powers between the executive branches of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government and entities like the judiciary and so on. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission plays a very important role in defending the community from discrimination in the face of uncaring executive government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) calls for the abolition of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. And I suppose there is some concern on my behalf that that sentiment is shared by members opposite. The commission is independent from the state for very good reasons. The National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> exemplifies the important work done by the commission. That report fearlessly exposes the worst excesses of governance in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the government's response? It was to attack the report's author, Sir Ronald Wilson, who had the temerity, in the government's mind, to expose the national shame of 100,000 children being stolen from their families. Had we not had a fearless author in Sir Ronald Wilson, the community would not know of this national tragedy. Had the commission not been resourced to carry out this work, then the work would not have been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view the government does not support the very essential work of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It has cut its funding. It is not just a budgetary measure, in line with what it has done to all parts of national expenditure, with some exceptions. It is not just a budgetary measure, in line with those cuts applied to government departments and other public entities. It has applied a political cut, a cut designed to undermine fundamentally the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 40 per cent cut in funding is a political cut. A 40 per cent cut in funding is designed to fundamentally weaken the very important function of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is designed to interfere with the capacity of the commission to defend the human rights of the nation's
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5825"> citizens. This is at a time that we have an absolute outbreak of intolerance. There has been a 50 per cent increase in complaints of discrimination. In this environment of a massive increase in complaints, we have the government cutting the defender of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do people go when they are racially discriminated against? The member for Kalgoorlie talks about verbal vilification as being essentially affectionate colloquialism. I do not agree. In any event, the discrimination that members of our community are subjected to does not just go to verbal abuse; it goes to fundamental access to things like employment, schools, education, child care. These are some of the things that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was formed to defend equal access to. Why should an employer refuse to engage an employee because that person is a woman? Why should an employer be able to refuse to engage an employee because that person is of Asian origin or Aboriginal descent? Clearly they should not and, in my view, the majority of the Australian community agree that there should be a body to ensure that those infringements of human rights do not take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the decisions of the commissioner are enforceable. But let us not kid ourselves. If we cut funding for legal aid and for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission then we are creating enforceable justice, but only for a few&mdash;those who can afford it. The majority miss out. The Federal Court is already overburdened in light of the government's refusal to appoint more judges. This point the government conceded yesterday when it moved to diminish the issuing of warrants for telephone intercepts. It said that the court is overburdened with work; therefore, we will bump the job down to the AAT. So the government is adding extra work for the court but without sufficient additional resources for the court to execute timely justice for victims of discrimination. This is not just a problem that the Federal Court faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has refused to replace the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, and this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leaves the very important function of gender discrimination to be performed by other commissioners in general that are already overburdened with work. The fact is that that sex discrimination work will not be done, simply because this government refuses to replace the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. It is true that people can seek defence from discrimination in the workplace by joining strong unions, and many are now doing so thanks to the government's abrogation of its funding responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also attacks the fundamental operational arrangements of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by making significant changes to the structure of the commission. It proposes that a sole figure, the president of the commission, will have enormous powers to determine what does and, more importantly, what does not get examined by the commission. There are several problems with this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission was established with so-called special purpose commissioners who were appointed to these positions because of their expertise in and understanding and knowledge of particular forms of discrimination. These special purpose commissioners include the Privacy Commissioner, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, the Human Rights Commissioner, the Race Discrimination Commissioner, and I suppose at one stage the Sex Discrimination Commissioner may be replaced. These commissioners have been appointed to these functions to carry out specialist work and they have carried out their work diligently, assisted by the fact of their specialisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's lack of respect for the skills and expertise of these commissioners and their contempt for the positions themselves is illustrated by the fact that they have not replaced the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Sue Walpole. Ms Walpole resigned over three months ago and the government has not yet replaced her. In Australia we are relatively lucky in relation gender discrimination, as women mostly are able to work, to study, to choose whether they will marry and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5826"> whom they will marry; generally, choices which are available to men are available to women. However, there are still many forms of discrimination against women in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many women in the Australian work force are still subjected to workplace harassment and they are still not represented equally across all occupational groups or at all levels. They are still clustered at the bottom, and middle at best, in most industries in Australia. In addition to the discrimination faced by women in employment, there is still inequality before the law in cases involving domestic violence, where the inability of applicants to get legal aid essentially leaves women exposed to unsafe circumstances. There are many other areas of discrimination against women in our society, but I will not go into them ad nauseam. Suffice to say that there is still a need for the a sex discrimination commissioner and that the failure to appoint a replacement to Ms Walpole shows the government's extreme contempt for Australian women, particularly those women who may from time to time seek to rely on the very important function executed by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centralisation of complaint investigation and conciliation in the office of the president is problematic because it devalues the role of the special purpose commissioners. It enables the government to sit on its hands and not appoint anyone to the position of vacant special purpose commissioners while individuals in our society suffer from discrimination on the basis of their sex or for any other reason. In addition, there are no details in this bill of what guidelines the president is to follow in exercising the powers of complaint investigation and conciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the point of having specialist commissioners who are expert in their areas if the basic bread and butter issues for many people are decided by one person who may not necessarily have the expertise or life experience to understand their situation? The role of individual commissioners now seems to have been severely cut with any member of the commission being able to examine a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular case for race, sex, disability discrimination and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One expects that experts in social justice, discrimination and human rights are well placed to deal with these issues across the range of groups within our society. By and large, the experiences of cases from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission show that this is the case. However, there are still nuances of discrimination which may only be understood by someone with a significant experience dealing with that particular form of discrimination. Hence, the case for specialist discrimination commissioners is soundly made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brandy case in the High Court determined that the second tier of review in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was not directly enforceable. That is pretty obvious. By removing the second tier of review, however, this bill proposes that there be no checks and balances for individuals who take cases to the commission&mdash;that is, if you think you got the wrong decision from the commission and wish to challenge it, it is straight off to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government was very concerned about the lack of access that many people in the country had to judicial processes. In 1994 the government commissioned a number of reports on this issue including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law: women's access to the legal system</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law:  justice for women</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS>. All of these reports showed there were significant barriers for many people in our society which stopped them from accessing and obtaining justice from the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, these reports showed that it was those who were already disadvantaged and discriminated against&mdash;women, people with disabilities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and migrants&mdash;who were most at risk of not being able to access the legal system. It is a fortress. If you do not have substantial resources, you cannot scale the walls to get a bit of justice inside of those walls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By transferring the execution of human rights jurisdiction to the Federal Court in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5827"> essence, complaints will likely require a higher level of legal assistance. The explanatory memorandum to this bill states that it is not expected that the amendments will significantly impact on the legal aid budget. It is beyond me how there will not be an increased need for legal aid assistance when increasingly there will be determinations formed in the Federal Court. Clearly, what is going to occur is that people will be trotted off to the Federal Court and they will fall off because they will not have the resources to fight those cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ninety-five per cent of cases that are determined at that second tier of review are complied with. It is only the minority of cases at this stage which require enforcement at court. This means that, despite the fact that these determinations are not strictly enforceable, they are effective in meeting the needs of those they are there to serve. They resolve the problems, or most of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government was serious about assisting the commission to assist its client group, it would retain this tier of review allowing determinations to be checked by the Federal Court where there was non&hyphen;compliance with a determination of the commission. We had a model of operating a commission in this way with the Industrial Relations Commission. However, as Howard promised in the last election to stab the IRC in the belly&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister, colloquially known as Jobless Johnny, promised the community that he would stab the IRC in the belly, he is now attempting to do the same with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to address the issue of the timing of these proposed changes. Since the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> race debate has been fuelled by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), there has been an increased incidence of discrimination in the community reflected by a 50 per cent increase in the number of complaints lodged to the commission. That is broadly reflective of many things that I am sure members sensitive to what is going on in their electorates see, such as increased abuse and increased discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the environment of increased discrimination evidenced by an increase in complaints of 50 per cent, we see the government hack, slash and burn this commission to the magnitude of 40 per cent, leaving essentially a shell that is some kind of an apology. It says, `Look, we're doing something about the problem. We've got this commission.' The government can say that, but, in reality, the commission's fundamental ability to deal with these issues has been comprehensively compromised by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the government to fundamentally compromise the ability of the commission to deal with these issues, particularly at a time when we have increases in these problems, is, quite frankly, outrageous. The move to have all matters which cannot be conciliated dealt with by the Federal Court of Australia is a more costly proposition and it makes the funding cuts to things like legal aid even worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that gravely concerns me is the lack of community consultation about this legislation. There are major changes which will affect a major institution of this country. This government does not seem to have given any groups the chance to fully examine the legislation. The shadow minister has already made some pertinent points about this issue so I will not waste the time of the House repeating them here&mdash;suffice to say that the Senate report should be considered before these changes are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a reason why the government does not want this bill properly debated: the government fears that its agenda, which is a highly political agenda of trying the dismantle the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, is going to be exposed and it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5828"> knows that that agenda is quite offensive to the majority of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is offensive to the majority of the Australian community, I believe, if a person does not get a job because they are a woman or cannot be served at a pub because they are an Aboriginal. Those things are offensive. They go against the grain of what Australian society is about. Australians do support institutions which stop that from happening. The government fails, I believe, in justifying dismantling the commission and changing its fundamental structure without consultation, without adequate process and with contempt for the way that business is carried out in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the government does not want the commission to work. It does not want the sort of tremendous activity delivered in the stolen generations report. It does not want the executive challenged by the separate entities of the states such as the judiciary and instruments like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the start that one of the very important checks and balances on the excesses of executive government is the separation of powers. The separation of powers is not clearly understood, quite often, by those conveniently in government or those on the more conservative side of politics. They are checks on the very excesses which perhaps people are motivated to perpetrate. Organisations like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are the defenders of the faith. They are the defenders of members of the community who are most powerless against those who are very powerful. Those who are very powerful and well resourced can fight things add nauseam in the courts. That is why we set up this commission when Labor was in government&mdash;to provide an accessible mechanism to enable the most powerless people and ordinary Australians to defend their basic human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what is wrong with basic human rights? What is wrong with women having equality before the law? Clearly, it is not something this government is committed to because it is dismantling those protections which are there to execute people's human
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights: the rights of women, Aboriginals, migrants and people with disabilities. It is a shameful thing this government is perpetrating in the area of human rights and equal opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill the first thing I would like to say is that, whilst Australians are concerned about some of the things that we have just heard about, one thing they do not like is zealotry, wherever it is found. I think that at times there have been some well intentioned people who, in the name of human rights, have sought to perpetrate things on the Australian community which defy logic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The things that we most take for granted, oddly enough, are the things which we need most: air, water, food, shelter, our families, and freedom from racial, religious, political and sexual persecution. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Australia has served a valuable role and will certainly continue to do so under this government and also under this legislation&mdash;albeit, at least in my view, in a much more practical form. Firstly, it is important that people understand what the Human Rights and  Equal Opportunity Commission is. I read from the January 1997 Occasional Paper No. 4 from the Human Rights Commissioner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission is an organisation established by an Act of Parliament. It is therefore independent of the Government. It has been given functions and powers to monitor government action. It investigates individual complaints of human rights violations and broader systemic human rights situations. It promotes better protection of human rights through laws, policies and programs. Because it is official its views must be accorded weight. Because it is independent it cannot be told by government what to do or how to do it. It is in a unique position to contribute to Australia's efforts to promote human rights internationally.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Therein lies, I suppose for all governments, the potential problem with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in that by necessity from time to time it will be a critic of government, whatever the political colour of that government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will amend the Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation to reform the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5829"> functions and the structure of the commission. It also responds to the High Court's decision in Brandy v. the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 1995, which found that the commission as a non-judicial body did not have the constitutional power to finally determine disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does a number of things. It confers on the president of the commission the role and functions of chief executive; it centralises complaint investigation and conciliation in the office of the president; it simplifies the legislation by implementing where possible common definitions and best practice procedural provisions for complaint handling in the one act; it simplifies dispute resolution procedures in human rights matters by eliminating the second tier of review in the commission which was not directly enforceable; and, finally, it enables matters which cannot be conciliated to be dealt with in a Federal Court. In my opinion, that is quite appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes consequential amendments to related legislation: the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Defence Act 1953, the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996. As the commission's determination making functions will be transferred to the Federal Court, there will be savings of around $600,000 a year generated from the commission. One other consequence of this will be that matters not able to be conciliated by the commission and determined in the Federal Court will increase the court's workload and that will be dealt with by the appointment of judicial registrars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been criticism, as we have heard, of the government's decision to cut the budget of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by $1.5 million per annum, offset to some extent by the $600,000 savings from the transfer of its determination making functions to the Federal Court. However, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, like almost all areas funded by the Commonwealth, has had to make a contribution to the nation's fiscal consolidation. You can only spend, as we have said so often, what you earn.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $1.5 million out of a budget of $19 million is in proportion to savings in other areas. From that $1.5 million is a $600,000 saving in any case. If you want to create further antagonism toward the commission and bodies like it in Australia, then quarantine it from other areas of necessary fiscal consolidation. In a country where it has been necessary to make reforms to aged care, to higher education, to low income dental health care, to labour market programs and a whole myriad of things which are affecting Australians, to have quarantined the commission would have added further fuel to the fire under the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full impact of the savings has been deferred until the transfer of its determination making functions go over to the Federal Court. In relation to the latter and the cost of access to the Federal Court, there will be waiver provisions in cases of hardship and those on income support. The bill also provides for the Attorney-General to provide funding assistance in respect of Federal Court proceedings in cases of hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vesting of conciliation functions in the president is a sensible move to avoid duplication and inefficiencies. Commissioners will retain their core functions of education and raising awareness of human rights issues in Australia and overseas. In 1992 the then federal government introduced the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which amongst other things amended the newly enacted Disability Discrimination Act to allow registration of the commission's determinations in the Federal Court, which could have the effect of being an order of the court unless the respondent applied to the court within 28 days for a review of that determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission presented a constitutional challenge to that 1992 act. The commission had found that Brandy had breached the Racial Discrimination Act and had made a determination including payments of damages. Once registered in the Federal Court, Brandy challenged the constitutional validity of the determination on the basis that it was an exercise of judicial power which could
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5830"> only be conferred on a court and not an administrative body such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court took the unanimous view that provisions within the Racial Discrimination Act which allowed determinations of the commission to be enforced through registration in the Federal Court was contrary to the principle of separation of powers. Hence, what the government is now doing is clearing up a problem which had been created by an ill&hyphen;considered piece of legislation. As the Sex Discrimination Act and Disability Discrimination Act had identical enforcement provisions, these provisions were also invalidated by the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to the Brandy decision, a two-tiered response was announced by the previous government. The first was the restoration of the pre&hyphen;1992 enforcement process which enabled hearings in the Federal Court. The second was the referral to a committee comprising the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Finance and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself. The final recommendations of which were principally, first, the creation of a new human rights division of the Federal Court; second, complaint handling to occur in two stages, conciliation to be attempted by the commission first and, if a matter could not be resolved through conciliation, new proceedings would be commenced in the Federal Court; third, the establishment of judicial commissioners of the Federal Court; and, fourth, empowerment of relevant commissioners to apply to appear in any Federal Court as a friend of the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives effect to the principal thrust of those recommendations, but it also continues to confer on the commission important and essential powers. It is quite wrong for speakers on the other side to suggest in any way that the government is diminishing them. Those powers are promoting an understanding of each act, fostering research and education consistent with the spirit and principles of each act, preparing and publishing guidelines for the avoidance of unlawful discrimination, making inquiries and determinations on matters referred to by the minister, and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intervening where appropriate with the approval of the court. The bill does, however, alter the role of the president who will not be able to delegate to another member of the commission any power or responsibility in relation to the handling of complaints or referral of discriminatory awards or determinations, which is a key variation from the commission's current operation. Krysti Guest from the Parliamentary Library's Law and Bills Digest Group points out that a governing assumption underpinning the anti&hyphen;discrimination model is that conciliation provides a more equitable forum for discrimination complaints. This is for a number of reasons, dominant amongst which is the view that the current modes of formal justice are ill-equipped to come to terms with the problems of socially marginalised groups and that the cost of formal litigation is prohibitive for most individuals and small businesses. The simplicity and inexpensive nature of the less formal modes of justice encourages, or at least does not discourage, victims of discrimination to file complaints. The process guarantees not only privacy and confidentiality but also the ability to have the problem resolved in an environment of legal immunity, flexibility and, dare I say, creativity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to a couple of other issues related to human rights. I would like to read another passage from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Occasional Paper No. 4 January 1997, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a human rights record in which we can justly take pride.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is not to say that we are perfect. Not by any means. The history of two centuries of European settlement in Australia reveals the most flagrant violations of the human rights of Australia's original peoples and their descendants. There are other examples of where we have failed: the White Australia Policy that persisted for almost seventy years after federation, the continuing under representation of women in positions of responsibility and influence in the community, the denial of the rights of lesbians and gay men, discrimination on the basis of disability, times when our international relations have favoured trade over human rights and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, we can take pride in what Australians have achieved: a predominantly tolerant, pluralistic society with a high level of respect for people and  general recognition that each individual is entitled to certain inalienable rights and freedoms.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5831"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we relate to other societies we do so on the basis of who and what we are. We take with us our commitment to advance the human rights of all people. Our international relationships arise from our national interest, that is, from self interest, but we see the universal protection and promotion of human rights as an essential part of our national interest. Australia's national interest also has other components: trade, security and international politics. Where we run into trouble is when action demanded by our concern for human rights is different from action taken following assessments of these other interests.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human rights are also a central part of our vision for the international political and legal system. For that reason from the beginning of international human rights law Australia has been a strong supporter of the development of a legal framework and legal mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are policies supported by all Australian political parties in the federal parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Non-registered party. Thank you very much. Given the important role that Australia has played, as has been recognised by our own Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the international fora which deal with human rights, I challenge the member for Oxley to come back into this chamber and repeat something that she said in her first speech. She called on the Australian government to withdraw from the United Nations, to stop spending all the money that it currently does in the United Nations and redirect it to other perhaps more pressing priorities as she may see them at home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been watching on television the sorts of people who have attended the rallies which have been organised by supporters of the member for Oxley. I feel that most of the people who go to those meetings are basically decent people. They are not inherently racist individuals. They are not inherently evil people, although I suspect that a number of them are. But I think that if most of them understood the consequences of what the member for Oxley has called for they would be quite embarrassed to have been a part of supporting a move that has been very divisive in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When on almost any night of the week in any part of Australia you can turn on a television and see news footage of the United Nations in action in some of the poorest war&hyphen;torn countries of the world where human rights that we take for granted&mdash;as I said, water, shelter and freedom from religious and political persecution&mdash;are the subject of abuse, I ask the people attending these meetings to ask themselves whether they really want to be part of a process and of a country which withdraws from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been remarks made by a number of speakers here including the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), and I know in the past the member for Oxley, about multiculturalism. I urge all Australians, particularly members of the House, to read an excellent document from the Race Discrimination Commissioner 1997 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face the facts</EMPHASIS>. There is a question here: what is multiculturalism? A number of my constituents frequently ask what this is. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multiculturalism is a policy based on rights and responsibilities which has been endorsed by Australian governments for managing a unified nation which is culturally diverse. The policy of multiculturalism replaced the previous official policy of assimilation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are important overriding principles of multiculturalism which can be summarised in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">loyalty to Australia</EMPHASIS> : all Australians should have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia's interests and future first and foremost;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">acceptance of the Australian system</EMPHASIS> : all Australians are required to accept the basic structures and principles of Australian society&mdash;the Constitution, Australian laws, tolerance, equality, democracy, freedom of speech and religion, English as the national language and equality of the sexes; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">mutual respect</EMPHASIS> : all Australians have the right to express their culture and beliefs and this involves a reciprocal responsibility to accept the right of others to express their views and values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multiculturalism is about inclusion and recognition within the principles enshrined above. It recognises the right of all Australians to enjoy their cultural heritage (including language and religion), and the  right to equal treatment and opportunities for everyone regardless of their backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I know there are some people who have distorted what multiculturalism is about, both those who are for it and those who are against it. But that is what multiculturalism is about
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5832"> and that is what it ought to be about in practice. Again, I challenge the member for Oxley to come into this chamber and tell me that she does not support multiculturalism as it has been defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I urge the honourable member for Oxley to urgently view the excellent film called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Castle</EMPHASIS>. The film depicts a very simple, decent, hardworking Australian man of Anglo&hyphen;Saxon background. As they are trying to take his house away from him, he says, `I'm starting to understand how the Aboriginals feel.' I say to the honourable member for Oxley: when you watch that film just take that message home with you. Finally, when I wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> I said this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grief is a necessarily painful emotion which, to varying degrees, we have all experienced. When anger at the loss competes for expression, confusion reigns . . . Nations, like people, grieve as Australia did after the inexplicable yet preventable tragedy of Port Arthur. We faced our moment of truth with grim determination, both to understand and pursue a course of action that would serve the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even those who are opposed to our national response were prepared to give begrudging recognition to those who led at personal and political risk to themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pauline Hanson is a lightening rod for grief and anger, the expression of which has legitimacy. Many Australians grieve over changes that few want and even fewer understand. Others are angry that the Australia they once knew has changed as they lunge for a seemingly everyday person offering an expectation that reality cruelly will not meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also within each of us a constant tension between on the one hand what we want for ourselves, a self-interested resentment in the unfamiliar, and then on the other a need to do what in our best selves we know to be right. Ms Hanson has stumbled upon the former, finding to her surprise what a powerful force it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every day brings further evidence of change over which we appear to have little control. The closure of BHP's steelworks, for example, represents a significant part of our economic and cultural past now leaving us. It also should further heighten concern among those already aware that it is "five minutes to midnight" for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Oxley is not to be ignored because the issues that she has raised go to the very heart of why there was a change of government last year and why it was so decisive. But our responsibility is to articulate to Australians an understanding of why we do
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> anything at all for Aboriginal people, why we run a human rights program at all, why we send money to the poorest people in the world, why we have an immigration program, how it is functioned and for whose benefit it ought to be run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When parliamentarians follow public opinion, which is what the member for Oxley is doing, other than lead it, when we feel that in some way we have to prescribe to populist views then the nation is vulnerable. When we allow facts to bow to bias and some of the nonsense that has been perpetrated by some people in Australia over the last year, the whole nation is vulnerable and evil in all its forms finds an environment in which it will flourish. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I could not agree with him more in his reference to that particular line in the film. It seems ironic that he brought that movie up when we are talking about human rights and equal opportunity and access to justice and equity. One of the major messages out of that film was that very thing&mdash;a simple member of our community, a very ordinary bloke, with an ordinary family, badly needing to access justice. It seems a timely tie&hyphen;in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult to talk about the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill without reflecting on the basic role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;HREOC, as we call it&mdash;and the massive cuts that appear to be happening to the funding of HREOC: 40 per cent or about $30.2 million over four years. These cuts are devastating, in my view, to the very notion of human rights and equal opportunity. If ever there was a time in our society for ready access to the services of HREOC it seems to be right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a bit of a look at HREOC and its areas of responsibility. I understand that they include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice, human rights, privacy, race discrimination, sex discrimination, disability discrimination, along with the general roles of complaint handling, legal services and so on. I was interested to look in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5833"> the 1995&hyphen;96 annual report of HREOC. Some of the words of the President of HREOC are worth quoting to this House. His foreword states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity to actively engage in the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms is the hallmark of an independent human rights institution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, an effective national institution is one which, while cooperating with government wherever possible in the pursuit of its objectives, is nevertheless capable of acting independently of government when the occasion arises.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The changes that this bill are bringing in obviously include a new role for the Federal Court to cases that would have come under HREOC in the past. I understand that. Many previous speakers have addressed the Brandy case in specific terms. But there are implications for that particular change which I think the government simply has to acknowledge and respond to. The bill is going to have an impact on legal aid. There is no doubt about that. It is highly likely there will be a higher level of legal assistance required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the bill does not state that extra funding will be made available to legal aid commissions and community legal centres to deal with the increase in demand for legal assistance due to the transfer of hearing functions to the Federal Court. The Commonwealth directly funds disability discrimination community legal centres and women's legal centres, and it is these services which will likely see the greatest increase in demand because of the use of the Federal Court. Non&hyphen;lawyers who work for these services will have rights of audience under proposed section 46PN, but there is still likely to be a need for additional training and staff to cope with the demands of judicial hearings. I am concerned to see that there does not appear to be any financial action on the part of the government to address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Human rights matters are Commonwealth matters and under the Commonwealth's current legal aid policy the Commonwealth considers itself responsible for the provision of legal aid in Commonwealth matters. It should be noted that the Attorney-General (Mr
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Williams) has explicitly stated that the Commonwealth does not consider itself responsible for providing legal aid in all Commonwealth matters, only in matters of priority. The obvious question that comes from that is: how uncertain can we be whether human rights matters are priority matters under this government's interpretation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the government give a very important commitment to this community that it would instigate an anti-racism campaign. It is now 15 months since it has come to government. Where is this campaign? How long is it going to take before we see it? How patient do we have to be? What has happened to the level of its budget? I understand that it has been cut. The community believes in a fair go in this country. That is a very important part of being Australian. A fair go means just that&mdash;access to justice for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what have we seen since the change of government? We have seen dramatic cuts to legal aid. I have just referred to the fact there is going to be an increased demand in that area&mdash;over and above the cuts we have seen across the board. We have seen enormous increases to court fees&mdash;the very gateway to accessing justice. From the Family Court right through to the High Court&mdash;at every level&mdash;people are having to pay extraordinarily high levels of fees to even lodge papers, let alone get a case before a court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been cuts to organisations that assist people&mdash;in areas of violence, discrimination, support and counselling. Now we are seeing a 40 per cent cut over four years to HREOC. There are very strong messages coming from the government when you consider all these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts are going to devastate the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which has already seen a 50 per cent increase in the number of race related com plaints since the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) delivered her inaugural speech in this place last year. While the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) defends the right of the member for Oxley to speak out, those who defend the victims of the member for Oxley seem somehow, financially or otherwise, to be getting attacked themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5834">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the victims of racism who are going to suffer. HREOC also protects the right that all Australians have to be free from discrimination regardless of their sex, age, sexuality, physical or mental disability and religious and political beliefs. These cuts are going to see at least 60 people, one-third of the commission's staff, lose their jobs. This will have a flow&hyphen;on effect on HREOC's budget because I understand that the government has given them no transitional funding with which to cope with the massive redundancy payments that will result. This will lead to the loss of even more of the services that HREOC provides. The community really needs to understand clearly what these decisions together and individually mean to the very fundamental well-being of the society or the sort of society we wish to live in. There are very strong messages coming out of this government at the moment and they are of huge concern to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker and speakers before him have made mention of the role of the member for Oxley. When we talk about discrimination and the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission we are talking about a range people&mdash;and obviously we all deserve to have protection&mdash;such as those with ethnic backgrounds and disabilities, women and Aboriginals. We all need to feel safe and secure that regardless of who or what we are or where we are from we are here on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was personally pretty alarmed a few weeks ago to read that the gentleman in Canberra who wants to start up the One Nation party in the ACT has a problem with not only the extra benefits that go to women or Aboriginals but also the extra benefits that go to people with disabilities. I challenged him on this at the time. I am waiting to see whether or not the member for Oxley has paid any curt attention to this particular reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about freedom of speech, responsibilities and protection through legislation, such as the legislation that established the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, for those in our community who
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need it, we are talking about real human issues. I am sure the overwhelming majority of people in this House agree with what I am saying about the need to have that protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot stand and demand it and you cannot stand and promote it while, at the same time, refusing to acknowledge that you are not providing adequate resources for it. Cuts of this nature and changes like the ones proposed in this bill send the wrong message. On the one hand, they send a message that we like to feel that we believe in certain things and, on the other hand, that because we have a budget bottom line that we want to see in black not red, according to our accounting procedures and our philosophy of funding, we are going to be forced to make certain cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not good enough for me. If you do not govern an economy but govern a community you might have a hope. If you govern only an economy these are the outcomes that you will see and you have to bear the responsibility that comes with them. When we see an organisation like HREOC facing the sorts of cuts that they are and the changes to the legislation that are going to occur and when we see this, particularly in the climate in which it is occurring now, I fear for what we are going to see created. I warn the government to pay heed to the climate in which these decisions are being made. It is never the right time in my view, but there could never be a more wrong time than right now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important debate because it involves the parliament not merely making judgments about the nature of the fiscal cuts being imposed on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission but also gives all members an opportunity to examine the work of the commission and make a judgment about its role in our society. Strong arguments have been put that in many cases some of the roles that have in the past been performed by  the commission could be safely exercised by the courts and within the framework of our legal process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a view with which I can agree for several reasons. The first is that the legal processes within our system in Australia are essentially a role for the legal profession
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5835"> whose costs have increased quite dramatically. That, allied with the cuts in legal aid, means that many citizens who have rights to enforce are placed in situations where they are refused legal aid and have to speak for themselves in our judicial system without the assistance of professional advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, like many members in this House, constantly have coming before me many women who are caught up in matrimonial disputes. They are trying to survive and look after their kids while the principal breadwinner and wage earner not merely maintains his stranglehold on the resources but, in many cases, has undisclosed finances which his wife knows about but cannot adequately pin. The result is that despite the best efforts of the courts and the many counsel and solicitors who are by nature compassionate&mdash;but the fact is that they have to run legal offices&mdash;people's rights are being constantly affected and eroded within our judicial system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say, simpliciter, that when you look at the human rights commission much of the work that it does can be effectively transferred to the judicial process, I think fails to understand that rising legal costs are going to put many of our jurisdictions out of the reach of ordinary citizens. That includes access to our most important court, the High Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at the work done by the human rights commission and its most recent contribution, which is causing considerable controversy in our society, the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> I believe the parliament can be justly proud of the human rights commission for producing this report. I am concerned to see that some of those in this parliament who have a narrower vision of our history have attacked Sir Ronald Wilson. The reality is that if it had not been for the commission and its structure we would never have seen this report. I do not know of any other institution in Australia, not the parliament, not our political parties, not our tertiary institutions&mdash;although many people have obviously contributed to that with tertiary training&mdash;not our churches that could have produced this document.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of some regret to me that this important document is not getting the level of consideration that it deserves from the government. The reason I say that&mdash;and I speak as one who does not believe in generational guilt; how can I feel guilty because I am a first generation Australian with immigrant parents&mdash;is that I do feel that every Australian, if we are to reconcile a dominant white population with its indigenous inhabitants, has to face the reality of our history. In facing that history, this document tells a story about which I believe, for a dominant white community, all of us can feel both a sense of grief and in some senses a sense of shame because our indigenous people were really, over many years and many generations, subject to policies that were clearly genocidal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe it is asking too much of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard); I do not believe it is asking too much of this parliament that, on behalf of this generation which has a duty towards reconciliation as a community and as a parliament and as a people&mdash;many of whom would be in my own position because they or their forefathers were not here at the time&mdash;we simply say that we are sorry. The person who is in the best position to do that is the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He seems to have an emotional block. I do not know what it is. He seems to feel threatened. He first of all said that he could not do it on legal grounds. He has legal advice that says that is nonsense. He does not feel a generosity of spirit which enables him to reach out to our indigenous people and say that, not only should this not have happened, but that the existing generation of Australians are capable of coming to grips with this period of our history and capable of confronting the genocidal acts and the brutal treatment that occurred. On that basis you can build a new understanding and new relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron)  on the radio this morning. What did he say? He said that he does not feel any guilt. I do not know what he feels. I hear him saying, `Our emphasis is on health, education, employment and housing.' Members of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5836"> political parties that constitute this government have been saying that for as long as I have been in this parliament. That is not to say that these issues are not important. They are important. But there are these constant reassertions: We deny the history; or: We will not accept responsibility for it because it was not us; or: What we are about is health, housing and education and, at the end of it, if you give them a house, give them an education, give them those things that we so value, then they will finish up just like us. God help us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at the smugness of those assertions and the underlying philosophy, that is not just a denial of our Aboriginal people, it is a denial of Australia's heritage. There is within that community, despite the things that have occurred to them, a feeling and a wisdom that goes to the very nature of this great continent. Until we as a community are capable of coming to grips with this report, capable of saying first of all thank you to the human rights commission for the work they have done and acknowledge the great contribution of the commission&mdash;rather than spend time regretting that Sir Ronald Wilson produced this document and chaired the committee&mdash;and walk away with a sense of guilt, what sort of people are we? I do not know of any nation which does not have very black spots in its history. Most of them come to terms with this. The process that is going on in South Africa, for instance, is a very important process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister, supported by some of his colleagues, has not only walked away from his human responsibilities in this matter, but at the same time, in terms of the judicial process, there have been mean and, I believe, despicable attacks upon the High Court because it applied what is so important to some of the monarchists opposite&mdash;the common law of England. By interpreting the common law of England and applying it to our contemporary situation, the High Court developed the concept of native title. What was the resulting comment from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer)? He said, `This was an exercise in judicial adventur

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is it that these monarchists, who are so anxious to kiss the dress of the Queen, do not realise that one of the great things for which all Australians can be eternally grateful is that, if our relationship with England did nothing else, it gave this community a Westminster system of government and the basic concepts of a judicial structure based on the common law of England? It is all very well for these monarchists to be at Lords at the right time; it is all very well if they can kowtow to the English gentry, who might well acknowledge them. But, when it comes to the hard fact of coming to terms with the great benefits that our relationship with England has given us, all of a sudden they not only condemn the court but involve themselves, through some state premiers and political leaders, in deliberately misinterpreting the court's judgment and deliberately creating fear within our rural communities by telling them that somehow or other they are all under threat potentially from some local group of Aborigines who will claim their land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and many other members of parliament had delegates from the National Farmers Federation come to see us this week. What staggered me was that they were decent Australians who were entitled to be told the truth by their leaders that the High Court of Australia said, `If there is any conflict between native title and a pastoral lease, the lease will prevail.' Nobody seemed to have told them that they were not under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is a structure that has been given the responsibility by this parliament of dealing not merely with the human rights of individual groups but with the human rights  of the average Australian citizen. I believe it has done its job honourably and well. I believe every member of this parliament owes it a duty to recognise the contribution that it has
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5837"> made not merely to Australian individuals as citizens but to our community. For my part, I regard its greatest contribution as being to bring the average Australian, the average parliamentarian, the average citizen to a knowledge of an exercise directed against our indigenous people which we had to know about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for some considerable period. I often relied on the advice of my predecessors who were members of other political parties. I do not believe that Ian Viner, Peter Baume and other distinguished ministers who were members of the Liberal Party were aware of any of this&mdash;and I was not. We were not aware because, basically, the pressure upon us was a pressure to deal with the problems that we had to confront on a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had applications from various organisations to provide funds to reunite families, but because this was essentially part of a history of state administrations, the depth of it, the inhumanity that was involved and the genocide that was involved were not known to us. I am thankful for the work that the human rights commission has done. I am profoundly sorry that I was not aware, in my period of office, of the depth of the agony of Aboriginal people at this level. I was aware of many other problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have any problem about being part of a parliament which is able to come out and say, `This is our history. We acknowledge it. We are sorry for what happened to you and, as a community, we want you to be part of a reconciliation process which will strengthen you as individuals, strengthen us as individuals and, more importantly, strengthen this great nation.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I want to enunciate a number of principles that I think should guide our thinking whenever we debate human rights in this place. I am very attracted to the notion that a core of a civilised society is what Ronald Dworkin calls `equal concern and respect for all persons'. That is very much what the former member was saying: equal concern and respect for all persons. That goes beyond equal treatment before the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In protecting individuals' interests and human rights by rules and laws, we are effectively protecting, too, the public interest in ensuring that all people enjoy minimum levels of respect. By acting to respect individuals as a community, we protect ourselves and our standards. I think that, at the moment, the government is losing sight of the very fundamental importance of recognising and respecting human rights for every group in the community. That is happening here and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a product of the 1970s, I was always very impressed by the Kennedys and, in particular, by Robert Kennedy's approach to the question of human rights. In a speech he gave in South Africa I think he captured it very well. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must recognize the full human equality of all our people&mdash;before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this not because  it is economically advantageous&mdash;although it is; not because the laws of God and man command it&mdash;although they do command it; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And this must be our commitment outside our borders as it is within.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On all of these points, at the moment the government is well and truly missing the boat. In this legislation, it is substituting the notion of individual user pays for action by the whole community to foster equality. We should, as taxpayers, be fostering equality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government appears prepared to overlook, for very short&hyphen;term trade advantages, gross violations of human rights in China particularly. I must say, I have been ashamed to see the government's position, for instance, on the handover in Hong Kong. I have also watched as it has backtracked on human rights objections against the Chinese government. I have taken a little time in the last couple of years to read about human rights violations in China&mdash;some through individual accounts and some through the records of organisations like Amnesty International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is no doubt at all of the continuing existence of, for instance, labour camps which sell products to countries such as Australia. We should be objecting both to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5838"> the existence of such camps and to the sale of such products to our country. The government, too&mdash;as we heard from the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding)&mdash;have been refusing to acknowledge the justice of the recommendations, contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> document, of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's inquiry into the stolen children; had they responded to it decently, it would have brought us all home. Instead, they have failed to apologise and have humiliated Australia in the eyes of the world. They have humiliated Australia in the eyes of many of its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have also adopted a very biased approach to issues of native title; they have given preference to commercial interests over decency. We have also seen very significant cuts to legal aid, making access to the law difficult for the disadvantaged. The most recent cuts, of course, have been to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself. Those cuts to HREOC continue the traditions which I mentioned earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems extraordinary that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his government appear to be attacking those who speak out against racism but are happy to support racists by trading preferences with them. That is something which we should bring home to the community every time we have an opportunity. You cannot be taken seriously if you allow for the possibility of these organisations and individuals taking seats in our parliament particularly, potentially, in our Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These particular cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be devastating, removing over 40 per cent of its budget. This is at a time when we are seeing a substantial increase in the number of race&hyphen;related complaints, largely since the speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) last year which the Prime Minister refuses to condemn. Indeed, he sees it as a matter of free speech. To cut those funds is to double the injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to look at why we have legislation like this. It is largely because there are no constitutional civil rights enshrined in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our constitution. Our founding fathers, ironically, apparently believed that the common law tradition, would be sufficient protection. I found the following observation in Rayner's recent publication very interesting. In discussing this notion of the founding fathers that the common law tradition would protect our civil rights in Australia she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their motives in this were not entirely innocent. The draft constitution of 1891 included a clause specifying that no State government could `deny to any person, within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of the laws', and a similar clause was proposed during the 1898 constitutional convention.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Highly laudatory; what happened to it?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the clause came up for debate, the Victorian attorney&hyphen;general, Isaac Isaacs, pointed out that it would invalidate existing laws that discriminated against Chinese and `coloured' people. At this point the convention dropped the proposal like a hot potato.8</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rayner goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a sad commentary on the limited vision of these great men that they were prepared to accept a Constitution that was conspicuously silent on the issue of equality before the law because they were not prepared to grant non&hyphen;Europeans equal status in their new nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to say that there still seems to be some of that sentiment around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have relied on legislation such as this to ensure that there is no discrimination on the basis of sex, race or disability, and to allow complaints of overt discrimination to be resolved. What we are seeing in these new amendments to the legislation are significantly backward steps. What we are seeing from the government at the moment&mdash;in this and other areas that I have already mentioned&mdash;is a very mechanical and unenthusiastic lip service being paid to human rights and to equal opportunity. The cuts to legal aid amounting to $120 million are part of that. The cuts to HREOC of some 40 per cent, add to it. The reduction of funding, too, to a great many community organisations which protect and support minority groups is also part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government appears not to be able or not to be willing to, as Martin Luther King  put it, transform democracy `from thin paper to thick action'. We get no thick action from this government. I guess it is not surprising when you look at the attitudes of many of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5839"> members of this parliament on the conservative side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I was most impressed, not to say flabbergasted, by the attitudes that were expressed in interviews given to the Australian Electoral Studies Group after the last election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It showed a great divide between our party and the parties on the other side&mdash;the Liberal and National parties. When asked about whether they thought equal opportunities for migrants had gone too far, nearly 36 per cent of the coalition endorsed the view that equal opportunities had gone too far or much too far, compared with the Labor Party's 4.7 per cent who held such a view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, they thought that Aboriginal land rights had gone too far or much too far in 72 per cent of cases, compared with five per cent on this side. Further, 30 per cent said that equal opportunities for women had gone too far as opposed to 4.6 per cent on this side. When asked whether government help for Aborigines was extravagant, 54 per cent agreed as opposed to the Labor Party's four per cent. Their lack of enthusiasm for these matters is not surprising at all. It is very sad, but it is not surprising because those are the views of the members in this place, or at least of a significant number of the government members in this place. In my view, it is certainly not the view of the wider community. I believe that the community generally thinks that our procedures under law&mdash;whether under legislation such as this or more broadly&mdash;should be fair, equitable and accessible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to point out that the effects of this legislation, if fully implemented, will be very significant in the area of protection of human rights. Firstly, there will be significant additional costs to complainants, and these will constitute considerable obstacles to remedying various injustices identified by individuals and groups in our community. It will certainly have a deterrent effect, partly because of the more formal court proceedings and also the possible awarding of costs. Because of the cuts to legal aid, it will only be selectively available to some. Secondly, there is a very important potential loss of expertise and it will diminish the role of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> specialist human rights commissioner&mdash;but more on that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point to a couple of submissions that were made to the Senate committee investigating this legislation. I think it would pay this House to listen to some of the submissions that were made by a great many organisations that have in fact been taking part in the detailed examination of this legislation&mdash;something that, I regret, is not occurring in this place to the same extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two academic lawyers have been particularly critical. Rosemary Hunter, for example, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fundamental feature of human rights legislation is that it cannot be treated simply as the province of lawyers. The legislation needs to be accessible to `ordinary people'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill, as it currently stands, will make the legislation less accessible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That can hardly be a desirable outcome. Similarly, Beth Gaze from Monash University, having examined the legislation carefully as an academic lawyer, speaks in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am extremely concerned at the impact that the proposed amendments will have on anti&hyphen;discrimination law in Australia. I believe that they will make complaints in the federal system virtually inaccessible&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and underline `virtually inaccessible'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to most complainants for reasons of cost. I have not seen any justification for taking this step which is contrary to the well&hyphen;established approach to legal costs which has been taken throughout Australian anti&hyphen;discrimination law ever since it was adopted. It is hard to understand why a government, which claims to put great emphasis on individual rights, is taking steps to close off access to the primary avenue for individuals who are relatively powerless to complain about the sort of unfair treatment which is generally agreed to be unacceptable in a modern, democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, what they are pointing to is the fine irony that these legislative changes constitute further discrimination against those  seeking remedies for discrimination. I wonder how the government can defend that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will look in a little closer detail at some of these changes&mdash;firstly, the increase in court fees, and in particular filing fees, in addition
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5840"> to whatever legal costs individuals may incur. Almost all of the submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill make reference to the increased costs and their inequity. For instance, the Combined Community Legal Centres Group gave us the example of Maria&mdash;hypothetical, but similar to cases that they have seen. The case study says that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maria is subjected to sexual harassment at work. Her employer is a large company.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not an unusual circumstance. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to her sexual harassment complaint being resolved, she resigns and gets another job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, not an unusual circumstance. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, she's not suffered any economic loss. The case fails to settle at conciliation. Had the matter proceeded to hearing in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, there would have been no court fees and the cost of running the case would have been her legal costs, which we will underestimate at $4000 for a three&hyphen;day hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated award for pain and suffering based on similar cases in this jurisdiction would be between $5,000 and $7,000. Given the new Federal Court fee structure, she will now need to pay a filing fee of $500, a day hearing fee at $400 per day for three days of $1,200, setting down fees of $1,000, her legal costs of $4,000&mdash;a total of $6,700. Given the awards in this jurisdiction as mentioned earlier&mdash;$5,000 to $7,000&mdash;there is no cost benefit to her pursuing her case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of such cases to proceed also thwart the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act. Respondents will not be encouraged to revisit their obligations under the act and other employees are likely to be subject to discriminatory treatment in the future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is worth remembering that it is not just the individuals concerned who benefit from this action, but people generally&mdash;in this case, particularly women subjected to sexual harassment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to anti&hyphen;discrimination remedies under this legislation will be significantly reduced, mainly as a result of those court cost increases. Again, the possible awarding of legal costs will combine to form a further disincentive, so the combination of court fees and legal costs will almost certainly often outweigh the individual benefits of proceeding. As I say, we all lose as a result of that outcome.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will almost certainly be fewer cases, too, resolved at the conciliation stage, and many people said this in their submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It will encourage the respondents, who are usually better resourced, to pursue the complaint to the hearing rather than resolve it, because they know that the costs will knock out the complainant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $120 million worth of cuts to legal aid have also undermined access already, in that the New South Wales and Victorian legal aid commissions have announced that they will no longer grant access to and for discrimination cases. So we are seeing the effects of other government actions on this anti&hyphen;discrimination legislation. As one of the submissions put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will if put into practice put so many obstacles and deterrents in the way of complainants that it may . . . compromise their capacity to pursue avenues open to them at law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the law may appear to allow it, but the costs militate against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also seeing in this bill loss of informality of proceedings. The circumstances will not be so user&hyphen;friendly and there will be considerable difficulties for people, for instance, whose first language is not English or who have a mental illness or some other form of disability. There are complex rules of evidence which will make it very difficult for those people who cannot but be unrepresented as complainants&mdash;they cannot afford the legal costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some have also commented on the significant loss of expertise and skilled people who work in the area and understand the specialist issues because of the changes to this legislation. Many submissions queried the wisdom of excluding commissioners from involvement in complaints, given their expertise and the non&hyphen;judicial nature of their approach. The National Pay Equity Coalition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the view of National Pay Equity Coalition that a specialist understanding of sex discrimination, in particular, is required in complaint handling, particularly with those complaints that arise from either indirect or systemic discrimination. In a number of workplaces, these forms of discrimination are demonstrated by the lower levels of access by women to promotion, training, superannuation and other goods and services. In other
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5841"> areas, the discrimination stems from the application of a workplace agreement. These areas are complex and require detailed investigation from the member of the commission who, by their appointment, is deemed the principal office holder and expert with regard to this form of discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We feel that the measures contained within the bill provide for an inefficient use of the expertise within the commission.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill clearly decimates the roles of the specialist commissioners and no adequate reasons are given. We are being deprived of the experience of hearing and determining individual complaints, and it is almost certain that the generalist commission will lose touch with the day to day issues of discrimination as has been found in other places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I began by saying how important it is that, as a community, we respect individual civil rights and liberties. What I see in this legislation is a significant step backward, and I am very concerned indeed that this government appears not to recognise the importance of human rights; rather, it sees those people protesting about the breach of them as a noisy minority. It is important that we ensure that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission can continue its excellent work by adequate funding and appropriate legislation. At the moment, we have neither.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 has generated considerable interest. There has been a wide&hyphen;ranging debate which has not, at all times, focused on the contents of the bill. Nevertheless, I thank those who have participated and I propose to make some comments on what has been said. I anticipate, however, that in the short time remaining before question time I will barely make a start on the reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing that the opposition, through the member for Banks (Mr Melham), have indicated that they will pass the bill in this House. I note his indication that the opposition will reserve its position for debate in the Senate. Regrettably, this seems to be becoming a habit on the part of the opposition in relation to bills in my portfolio. It may be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it is simply a consequence of the shadow Attorney-General's being in the Senate. It also seems to be something to do with Senator Bolkus not getting his act together, the opposition not getting their act together, and therefore not being in a position to indicate what the view of the opposition is at the time the debate goes on in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since most legislation&mdash;in my portfolio at least&mdash;commences in this House rather than in the Senate, it is a nuisance, not only for the government but for the public as well, because it means that the minister responsible is not able to respond to community views that are expressed through the opposition. The member for Banks, in this particular case, for example, hardly even referred to the provisions of the bill, and he really only debated the procedure and the process by which it came to be on for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I was somewhat disappointed and a little surprised at the tone of the speech of the member for Banks, which was a touch angry and a touch bitter. His recurring theme was that the House of Representatives was being treated as a rubber stamp. His principal point was that the House had not had the opportunity to consider the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which is considering the provisions of the bill and which is due to report shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the member for Banks is suffering from some misconceptions. In the normal course, this bill would not have been referred to the Senate committee until after its introduction into the Senate; that would have occurred after the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives. As it was, the government initiated the bill's early consideration by the Senate committee to expedite the airing of the various issues that we were sure would be raised in relation to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is desirable, from the government's point of view, that the new scheme is put in place  as quickly as possible in order to replace the current cumbersome complaint and enforcement mechanisms operating within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has had two full days of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5842"> hearings and has received substantial evidence in relation to the bill. A range of issues have been aired, and all of them are on the public record and were available to anybody who wished to speak on the bill in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note that the opposition is reserving its position until after the debate in the Senate. But the member for Banks is disingenuous to suggest that there was no opportunity in this House to make detailed comments on the bill or, indeed, that the House is being treated by the government as a rubber stamp.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. The young people in her electorate clearly are much more far&hyphen;sighted than those sitting on the other side of the House who have opposed the common youth allowance. The common youth allowance is one of the most significant measures in a generation to improve assistance to young people from low income families in this country. It replaces five complex and fragmented income support schemes with one single and simple program that will be of great benefit to these young people as they move from one stage of their life to another. It provides additional assistance to 137,000 young people on income support, including many young people in regional and rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The single most important aspect of the common youth allowance is the fact that at last it gives the right message to young people that the dole is not an acceptable alternative to investing in your future life with education and training. The common youth allowance gets rid of the schemes that the Labor Party left to the present government, which actually provided financial rewards to young people who preferred the dole to building up their skills. The fact is that Labor's approach to income support for young people actually encouraged young people to go on the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was very interesting to read the statement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> editorial this morning, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of unemployment benefits for young people under 18 . . . has long been a debilitating factor in Australian society. In too many cases it has encouraged young people to leave home prematurely and inclined them to welfare dependence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the Labor Party supported and did nothing to change in 13 years of government. It was never going to change this situation. It is up to this government, with the common youth allowance, to break this vicious cycle and reward young people who
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are prepared to lay down proper foundations for their future lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common youth allowance expresses some very fundamental values of this community. It expresses values of personal responsibility, of family responsibility and of taking responsibility for your own life and planning something worth while for the future. At the same time, the Labor Party is trying to destroy legislation in the Senate which is there to provide further opportunities for young unemployed people. It is trying to destroy the work for the dole legislation and it is trying to destroy the government's reforms to employment services to make sure that unemployed people get much better opportunities to obtain jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When in government, the opposition pushed youth unemployment up to 34 per cent. It is a party which has nothing positive to say at all to young people in this country or to their families. It is out of touch with the basic values of this community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lyne for his question. A welcome change embraced in the youth allowance package is the extension of rental assistance to a very large group of young Australians for the first time ever. This means a lot to many country people who have no choice but to send their children away from home to study. Many of these people have been able to obtain Austudy in the past, both under the Labor government and under the coalition&mdash;more so under us&mdash;but those students have not had access, in any form, to rental assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum rate of rent assistance is $98.80 a fortnight at the moment. That new payment, in terms of its eligibility to this new grouping of people, will now become available under the youth allowance package.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have already stated, the resources flowing to schools follow the students from the Commonwealth. There is additional Commonwealth funding for every student who goes back into school. The Commonwealth is also putting additional resources into schools, including in Tasmania in the electorate of Franklin, to encourage students to undertake relevant vocational educational opportunities. I am now making the point that one of the senior representatives of principals in Australia has made the point that schools have to accept the challenge; we have to accept that secondary education is not just the right of the best 70 per cent of students. The Commonwealth is putting schools in a position where they can respond. The previous government did nothing to put schools in such a position. In fact, it provided students with a financial incentive to get out of school and live a life on the dole. That did the students no good and it did harm to the quality of the society in which they live.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. The concerns that he has are ones that are well understood. The issue in relation to young people, particularly in rural and regional Australia, was highlighted when a number of members from this House&mdash;the member for Sturt in particular and, I think, the member for North Sydney before he joined us in this parliament&mdash;participated in youth forums in New South Wales and Queensland in 1995. They heard the views of many young people at that time about the disincentive that young people experienced with the regime that was in place at that time. Despite calls from welfare groups, Labor made no attempt to address these iniquities, and they allowed the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complex system that we had in place to remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's highest priority is to deal with jobs, and in particular jobs for young people. We are about encouraging young people to go into education and training so that they will be less likely to be unemployed. The opposition, on the other hand, judging by its comments, obviously prefers a situation in which young people are encouraged to remain on unemployment benefits rather than acquiring further skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say no amount of scaremongering in relation to these matters will change the facts. The facts are these: we will spend an additional $25 million in the first year on program costs as a result of this new initiative; we are introducing a parental means test which is more generous than it was under the Austcare arrangements of the Labor Party; and we are introducing a system where everyone on newstart as at 17 June will not have their payment affected in any way. This measure is particularly beneficial for those who are in regional Australia. There are many young people in rural areas who need to travel away from home to participate in education. This will be the first time that single people living away from home will receive up to $75 a fortnight. That will be particularly beneficial for those in rural and regional Australia. Together with this, there will be an increase in benefits for those under 18 who are away from home. They will be up to $100 a fortnight better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been allegations that these changes will be detrimental to the unity of families in the bush. I have this to say about such allegations: would you prefer to see a disaffected, depressed unemployed young person or one who is working constructively towards their own future. I have to say that the carping of the opposition in relation to this issue is a clear indication of their unwillingness to address the needs of young people in our community. This government wants to see young people, particularly those in region al Australia, boosted with self&hyphen;esteem by the skills that they have been able to obtain.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5847">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would encourage members opposite to have a look at the way in which the issues here have changed very significantly in the day or so since this was first announced. I draw to their attention the editorials in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne&mdash;which was very supportive about the need to encourage young people to learn more in preparation&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. I could not see more persuasive statements than those I saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today, which I would encourage honourable members opposite to read. I quote this one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's decision to ditch the dole for under&hyphen;18s and tighten access to benefits for 18 to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds should be vigorously applauded. so should its move to replace a range of youth benefits&mdash;including unemployment, Austudy and family allowance&mdash;with a single payment, and its effort to push the young jobless to improve their skills rather than remain idle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They force all but the poorest parents to taker greater financial responsibility for their offspring. And they close a bizarre gap which has financially encouraged the young people to be unemployed rather than to study and given students greatly increased access to rent assistance. Together, these changes help engender a culture of self&hyphen;improvement rather than welfare&hyphen;dependence and dole culture which has crept into Australian life.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Moncrieff for her question. Of course, there has been enormous response around Australia to the government's extensive reforms to vocational education and training. Unfortunately, under the previous government the apprenticeship system was allowed to run down and there was a fixation on the 30 per cent of students going through school to university&mdash;to the neglect of the 70 per cent  of students who are looking for other options when they leave school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5848">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Commonwealth is now engaged in the most extensive reforms in Australia's history. This year there are some 55,000 additional places in TAFE compared to last year. In the budget just brought down, the government has provided for some 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships for next year. And traineeship opportunities are already some 50 per cent above those available last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been many efforts to misrepresent this situation. I particularly noted the comment in this morning's press from the minister for training in New South Wales, Mr Aquilina, who said that as a result of Commonwealth decisions TAFE would lose 6,400 places in New South Wales. The fact is that total funding for vocational education and training this year under the Commonwealth budget is some $144 million above that provided in the last year of the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to TAFE training in New South Wales occurred of course in the Carr government's own state budget. In the recent state budget in New South Wales, spending on TAFE by the state government was reduced by $9 million. If there is any threat at all to TAFE places in New South Wales, it is a result of the decisions of the Carr government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Carr government is the only government in Australia which is dragging its feet on implementing the reforms on which all ministers agreed, even the New South Wales minister. But the Carr government is so much under the thumb of the Trades and Labour Council in that state that it is unable to introduce the reforms which are required to give young people these opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their federal counterparts are very well matched, because they are the people who not only pushed youth unemployment up to 34 per cent and neglected the students not going on to university but they are now trying to destroy the opportunities for 10,000 young people which would be provided through the work for the dole scheme. They are trying to destroy this legislation in the Senate. They are also trying to destroy in the Senate the government's historic reforms to employment placement services that will allow many
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young people to access the growing apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities that this government's policies are producing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, state and federal, has absolutely no credibility at all when it talks about youth unemployment and the problems young people are facing. Its policies made those problems worse and, at state and federal levels, it has lost touch with the needs of the young people of this country.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Australia has had a national drug strategy that has been a cooperative and a consensual effort between Commonwealth, state and territory governments and between  health, police and law enforcement departments. This is unusual around the world, and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5849"> I have only yesterday got to see the review of the second five years of the national drug strategy. This review was undertaken by Professor Single, from the department of preventative medicine and biostatistics at the University of Toronto, and Professor Rohl, from the Police Graduate School of Management at Charles Sturt University. I wrote to state health ministers yesterday with copies of this draft report, and when I have their agreement I will release it. But I can say that this draft report from two very independent and esteemed people, one on the law enforcement side and one on the health side, has said that our response to drugs is something that has been held up as an example right around the world and something that has given this country great credit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a concern, and obviously it has got a great deal of publicity, but to simply try to convene a summit every time you have got a problem is window&hyphen;dressing and I am not prepared to do it until I have had a chance to try to resolve the report that has been made and that we have got from state, territory and Commonwealth health ministers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just say I am very mindful that in 1986, when we had this first up, it was window&hyphen;dressing, it was basically publicity, and I am not going to make the mistakes that were made under the previous government.

In fact, in the last couple of months we have seen one&hyphen;third of CPSU members decline to have their union dues deducted from their monthly or fortnightly pay packets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the right honourable member for his question. I know that all members of the House would agree with me that the right honourable member for New England has a deep and abiding interest in Cambodia, as does the Acting Leader of the Opposition and many others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Latest reports suggest that the murderous Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot faces imminent capture, and that is something that we welcome. The demise of the Khmer Rouge armed threat to Cambodian politics would be a welcome end to a bloody chapter in Cambodia's history. There is, reportedly, agreement between the two Prime Ministers that Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders would be handed over to an international tribunal, if captured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome this. The Australian government believes that Khmer Rouge leaders who perpetrated atrocities on the Cambodian people should be brought to justice. The Cambodian government is in no doubt about our strong concern that those Khmer Rouge figures involved in the murder of an Australian citizen should be brought to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of these developments, I am particularly concerned at the recent escalation in incidents of politically motivated violence in Cambodia, such as the grenade attack on 30 March, and the violent clash between security forces loyal to the ruling coalition parties on the night of 17 June, to which the right honourable member refers. Inflammatory statements by Cambodia's leaders and their race to secure military and factional support, including from defecting Khmer Rouge forces, have unfortunately only added to these tensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed to restoring and rebuilding Cambodia's social and political institutions. We are providing $92 million over four years in aid programs in the areas of education, de&hyphen;mining, electoral assistance and health. Important priorities for our aid program are the promotion of good governance and institution building. I recently announced a contribution of $&half; million to support preparations for national elections in 1998, including the training of electoral officials. Our defence cooperation program is aimed at assisting in the development of a professional armed force, neutral in its political affiliation, with projects in mine clearance, training and health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me say that I expect to visit Cambodia in the near future, and will take the opportunity during my visit to pass some key
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5855"> messages to Cambodian leaders. I will impress upon them that the maintenance of the rule of law is critical to the implementation of the Paris peace accords and continuing support of donors in Cambodia's reconstruction process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. There is an exciting development in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is a drug produced by Eli Lilly called olanzapine, going under the trademark of Zyprexa. Up until now the drug most commonly used has been clozapine, but that has a good number of people on whom it does not work and also has side effects that may be jerking movements or what, in medical terms, is called extrapyramidal symptoms. Olanzapine only came into trials in the United States in the middle of last year. The trials have shown that it is in fact 10 to 12 per cent more effective than any medication for schizophrenia currently on the market, and it has 17 per cent less side effects. So for those people who have side effects from medication, it is terribly exciting. There are also rare occurrences when people are on clozapine where they have what is called a blood dyscrasia and the body does not produce white cells, so this is potentially life threatening. Olanzapine does not have the same side&hyphen;effects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This drug was considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee back in March and they recommended that, because it was more effective and because it had
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5856"> fewer side effects, it should be made available to the Australian public. What has been difficult here though is that this is a very high cost medication and just for this one medication across the period of the forward estimates, it will cost around $65 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am pleased to inform the honourable member that yesterday afternoon we did get permission to place this on the pharmaceutical benefits system from the first reprinting of the new schedule, which is 1 August. We expect that several thousand Australians will benefit from this very high cost medication. It shows what the benefits are of having a pharmaceutical benefits system that is able to cope with the highest cost, newest medication, including one as expensive as this. I expect that it will be a very exciting advance in treatment for people with mental illness.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<ANSWER PAGE="5856" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen the reports. Comcare has in fact not 400 but 215 people nationally involved in claims management, and of those about 70 are situated in Canberra. This review is not in any sense predetermined. It is a proper review into the claims management function. Clearly, the review&mdash;it has been made clear in what we have said about it&mdash;does not in any sense relate to benefits but merely the service delivery or claims management aspect. I can advise employees in the APS that no detriment to them is in any way involved in respect of this claims management review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comcare obviously handles a wide range of claims. Some of the claims which it deals with are stress claims. Let me give you an example of some of the claims that we have had. For example, an employee was involved in an affair at work. When the affair ended she felt she was unable to remain in the workplace and lodged a claim for stress. The cost to the Commonwealth to date is $80,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second claim: an employee was requested to attend a counselling session to discuss his work performance. He went on sick leave and lodged a compensation claim for stress. This employee has been absent from work since mid-1995. A third claim: an employee claimed a work related stress condition due to disputes with his employer. The disputes related to the payment of higher duties and the fact that his agency refused to provide him with a permanent position. The cost to the Commonwealth to date is over $192,000. This information has been provided to me by my department and by Comcare, but it shows the scope of claims which they have to face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a closing note, the government has a policy which is to ensure that the law reflects the original intention of the legislation. It is a pity that the Labor Party is opposed to

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Griffith for his question. I should first say that the government is committed firmly to assisting bona fide refugees. I make that threshold comment because I do not want there to be any doubt about my expectation that the department and the tribunal should act in accordance with our international obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this year we expect to receive some 10,000 applications for refugee status in Australia, and possibly more. That is 20 times more than we saw only seven years ago. The cost of assessing all of those claims through the various stages with judicial intervention, asylum seeker support and the like is over $60 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large number of the applications are not coming from residents of countries that are generally associated with human rights abuses. Numbers have come from the Philippines, Tonga, Fiji and Thailand. This financial year, the department has finalised more than 3,000 applications from those countries that I have mentioned and has been able to identify only four bona fide refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are turning up at my department and asking for a $30 work visa, the name by which we understand the protection visa is now becoming known. By lodging an application, such individuals can obtain work rights in Australia and they know that they cannot be sent home until after their refugee application has been properly assessed and considered by the department, possibly the Refugee Review Tribunal, accessing my discretion and applications to the courts. We also know that, in many cases, what they are seeking is access to Medicare, benefits for which they have in no way paid or contributed. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5858">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to do something about this. In March I announced the comprehensive series of reforms that are involved in remedying these problems that we are associated with. Some of these involve changes to regulations; others involve legislation that I will introduce as a bill next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notice has been given by Senator Margetts that there will be a motion to disallow some of these regulations. I understand that she has taken exception to the measures to address abuse on the onshore refugee program, even though there is a clear recognition from community groups, including the Refugee Council of Australia, that such abuse is taking place and is high. I have to say that I have been advised by leading members of that body of their concerns about the abuse that is occurring. What we are seeking to do is to remove the incentives that are now current in the system that make it wide open to this form of abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that we are seeking are, firstly, to have a $1,000 post&hyphen;decision fee for applications lodged with the Refugee Review Tribunal. That fee is intended to deter people from making frivolous review applications simply to extend their stay in Australia. The fee would become a charge payable. It may not have to be paid if they leave Australia, but of course it would obviously have an impact on any further application they might wish to return. The fee will not be payable by people who are found to be refugees, people who go to the courts and people who access my non-compellable discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it absolutely clear that these measures in no way attempt to deny access to the protection offered to genuine refugees; they are aimed at stopping exploitation. The other measure that I would hope we might see support for is the measure that will limit access to employment in Australia to only those people who claim refugee status within 14 days of arrival in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attempt at disallowing these regulations by Senator Margetts is only saying to those who abuse the refugee system that it is okay to slow down the processing system and it is okay to abuse it and to commit fraud against the Australian community. It is also saying
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it is okay to delay bona fide people being able to get prompt remedy by the grant of refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have commenced discussions with the honourable member for Denison. I would hope that the members of the opposition would see in these measures an appropriate response to what is a real and very pressing problem that we face. I would hope that they would accord to this government the same degree of cooperation that we gave when these sorts of issues were being dealt with when they were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to deal with one other matter briefly. Yesterday I answered a question in which I said that the cost of transport of the Chinese folk who arrived in Australia was $337,000. That figure was incorrect; it was $370,000.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to those very issues that we have outlined in our censure motion today and why we have called for the minister's resignation. Firstly, let me go to the ministerial code of conduct. In the very first section under the heading `ministerial conduct', at page 10 of the document which the minister selectively quoted from in question time today, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This clearly has been breached. It is also stated in this document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must not engage in any professional practice or the daily work of any business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates business and if the retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It says:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers should not exercise the influence obtained from their public office to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What does a phone call to Nick Greiner on behalf of your business partner amount to, if not trying to exercise influence `to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another'?
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5860"> In this case the `another' is not only a business partner; the `another' happens to be his brother. When you have a look at the share register and the structure in which this minister has set up his company, we find there are three shareholders: Mr Prosser, the minister; Mrs Prosser&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in this tawdry episode from the minister so far is that he has breached each of those guidelines. In terms of hands-on, I will come to hands-on with Mr Greiner in a minute, but let me go to hands-on specifically with the minister and whether he deals with his franchisees, with his tenants, in those shopping centres in Bunbury. In an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, I think on the eighth of this month, under the by&hyphen;line of Michael McKinnon there was a description of one of the minister's tenants in the key fruit and vegetable market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there can only be one Geoff in the hands-on management of this shopping centre, and that would be `lots of Bunbury,' the minister for small business sitting opposite me right now. It goes further because damned out of his own mouth in terms of hands-on activity the minister went on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small Business Show</EMPHASIS>  on Channel 9 on 18 May and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing I can say is that I still employ people myself. I see the forms that government send through. I still see those sorts of things come through.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue would be laughable if it was not serious. We know where this all started. This started because we had a look at his registration of members' interests entries. For the benefit of those masses in the gallery, the registration of members' interests says that we as members must conform with certain standards and we must provide to the registrar of members interests within a short period of time of each new parliament our pecuniary interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will say this about the minister: he has listed quite a number of companies under shareholdings and private and public companies. He has listed family and business trusts and nominees companies. They are all in there. He has listed Prosser Management, Prosser Automotive Engineers, Regional Property Investment, Prosser Homes, Prosser Automotive Engineers, Western Property Holdings Unit Trust, GD Prosser Engineers, the Ronald Walter Family Trust. When it comes to the real estate area, he declares for himself `Bunbury, various lots'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would think that, as this minister was given responsibility two months before putting these declarations in, he would have said, `Look, I have to put my hand up, I own shopping centres.' It is a touch more than Bunbury, various lots. It is a touch more than that; it is at least three shopping centres and, as he said today, at least 40 tenants. With the other interests that he has, it is closer to 80. The minister clearly has not only understated his contribution here in the registration of members' interests but also he has done so for other motives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we looked into some of these issues was that 12 months ago this minister established an inquiry into the concerns that small business people had about fair trading
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5861"> in this country. A little over three weeks ago that committee report was tabled in this place. It had implications in a variety of areas. It had implications for retail trading, tenants. It had implications for things like franchising. It had implications for the misuse of market power. It had implications and recommendations on legislative protection against unfair conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought and I think most small businesses would have thought that, if the minister for small business was a landlord, if the minister for small business also had a relationship as a landlord with franchisors who sublet the franchisees, just maybe there would have been a conflict of interest between him having responsibility for taking this report to cabinet with ministerial imprimatur with recommendations on what the government might do to assist small business&mdash;this constituency that the Prime Minister reckons he would lay down his life for; if he was in Australia&mdash;and this minister now saying that there is no conflict of interest despite his extensive holdings and that he can represent their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does that stack up? There was a touch of Abbott and Costello in some of the responses that we saw earlier this week. In question time when we were asking the minister and the Prime Minister who had responsibility for the fair trading inquiry and specifically retail tenancy elements, Mr Prosser said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is any area of perceived conflict of interest that will be handled by my colleague the minister for industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was question time on 16 June. Later in question time the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the government's response has been prepared, the minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the minister for small business&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will of course be in a position to pass policy responsibility should there be any potential of conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the end of question time we all went out of this House thinking this minister for small business still had responsibility for tenancy matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, by 7.30 and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> all had changed. I am told 15 minutes before the minister went on that program he got a phone
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> call from the oval office. I am told that that phone call basically said, `You are not going to look after retail tenancy matters and let's hope the rest of them are okay.' What the minister said to Barrie Cassidy was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My colleague John Moore will handle that particular area&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">meaning retail tenancy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I have already taken the matter up with him a short time ago.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is no wonder people were confused about this in the old Abbott and Costello fashion. On the same Monday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>  there was a very interesting article. This journalist had heard that Minister Prosser was going to be moved. So he made a few phone calls. He rang John Moore's office, the minister for industry. They said, `This is all news to us.' John Moore said, `I don't know if I have got it or not.' They rang the Prime Minister's office and were told, `No, that's not right. It is Mr Prosser. Maybe if there is a conflict, it will have to go to Mr Moore, but he is the portfolio minister.' As I said, it was a bit Abbott and Costello. It is like that old sketch: Who's on first, What's on second, and I don't know's on third. They do not know. They are going round and round passing the buck as to who has responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, it was demonstrated that there was a conflict of interest. Otherwise, minister, tell us this&mdash;and we are dying to hear your response&mdash;why were you relieved of responsibility for retail tenancy matters? If there is no conflict of interest, as you have maintained, why did the PM take it off you? Why did the PM ring you up 15 minutes before you went on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and say, `Geoff, sorry, mate, you are no longer in charge of retail tenancy issues'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the issue of franchising. In franchising, again, it started in the budget last year when this minister, as an offering up of savings, said, `No more funding of the  Franchising Code Council of Australia. No more funding to assist the dispute resolution process involving franchisees and franchisors.' Yet the committee report that I have referred to makes recommendations at 3.1 about franchising. This minister has a relationship, as a shopping centre owner, with franchisors.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5862"> He is also a franchisee in his own right with his petrol station. So surely recommendations 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, dealing with franchising in the fair trading inquiry report, must go to that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if the Prime Minister has taken responsibility off him for fair trading, why did he leave you, Minister, with responsibility for franchising? It begs the question: you cut out funding for the Franchising Code Council, and you have a clear interest in franchising because of your shopping centre ownership and your hands on day-to-day dealing there and, within three days of this report being tabled in the parliament, you gave an interview to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Small Business, Mr Prosser, rejected calls yesterday by a parliamentary inquiry for legislation to regulate the franchise sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was three days after the report, yet he is saying, `Cabinet has not made a decision on this.' But the minister has. Why has he? I think it is the question that was raised today about his interest in the Property Council that goes to that very matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he told us is that Prosser Automotive Engineers is a member of the Property Council of Australia. So what? As I said, there were four submissions made by the Property Council of Australia to the parliamentary committee of inquiry looking into fair trading issues. He is a member of it. They were representing him as a member of the Property Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You start to say, `Look, maybe that is not a bad thing. Maybe that is not quite true. Maybe he really is not represented by them, and they do not express his interests.' That might be so, Minister, except on 25 October last at the Hyatt Hotel in Perth you gave a speech to the Property Council of Australia. In that speech on all the retail tenants complaining about landlords&mdash;and, Minister, you are a landlord&mdash;you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these complaints are either unfounded or at least one-sided.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But wait, there's more. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the government's view that the landlords should be free to exercise their property rights in all but the most exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government's view! The inquiry had not even started, but it was the government's view put to the Property Council of Australia that, `Forget what they say. If it is going to disadvantage landlords, then it is all over, red rover.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know on franchising that Cash Converters, Chicken Treat, Pizza Hut and Farmer Jack's are all part of his shopping centre complex. Are you going to stand up here, Minister, and tell us there is no conflict of interest between you taking the recommendations of the franchising forward on behalf of this government and the fact that you, as a shopping centre landlord&mdash;as an owner of shopping centres in Bunbury, Western Australia&mdash;do not have a conflict of interest? We look forward to that particular contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I found of some interest in all of this was the revelation today about the very close relationships with the Coles Myer people&mdash;a board member of Coles Myer, I might say. We were a bit concerned about the Eaton site in Western Australia. We had heard that it was a greenfield site, the bulldozers went in and all the vegetation got knocked over&mdash;against the objections of the locals. The council felt a bit concerned about the member for Forrest. It is not as though this minister could walk down the street of Bunbury and say, `Gee, I don't recognise that.' He walks down the street of Bunbury and says, `I own this. It's all mine.' The council, rightly, was a bit toey about this. Yet, when they had a look at the Eaton site, they saw that there had been a regional plan that was established to look after the interests in terms of planning matters. I know a bit about it, being a former town&hyphen;planner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against the objections and against that plan, the minister and his companies lodged the development application, were not satisfied  with the result and went to the planning minister. In the consequent wash&hyphen;up of all of that, approval has been given. The rumours went around that they were looking for a Target store. Who runs Target? Who, do I hear? Coles Myer. Who is one of the directors
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5863"> of Coles Myer? Nick Greiner, Deputy Chairman. Who got on the old dog and bone to Nick Greiner? The minister.

I would have thought that, as the shadow minister for small business, he would now start to understand some of the issues that confront small business. One issue that does confront small business and one of the issues they are most concerned about is unfair dismissal. I noted in reading an article entitled `MP in unfair sacking row' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  of Wednesday, 19 April this year that it said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Labor speaker of the House of Representatives, Stephen Martin, unfairly sacked a pregnant staff member, the court has found.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I look at Laurie Brereton&mdash;and this is the one you like. What about Laurie? He puts down for his spouse's interest `None known to me'. Then in the next bit his spouse has a half share. The next one says for his spouse `None known to me'. So the opposition have a double standard. In government they did not know or did not choose to know. They put down statements like `None known to me'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the very point of the company which is the subject of this matter, the properties that the opposition seem so keen on&mdash;the Homemaker Centre, Minninup Forum Centre and Leschenault Quay&mdash;are all owned by Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd. On the registration of members' interest it says: `Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd'. What do they do? What are the activities of the company?

The new incoming shadow minister said, as I recall, that he would go and talk to small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a serious motion and this is a minister who should have resigned last year. And it is a government that cannot protect him any longer. The fact of the matter is that he is a minister who has breached the code of conduct not once but many times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He breached it last year by retaining directorship in Prosser Engineering and then going ahead to make decisions as a fuel distributor when he had responsibility for the diesel fuel rebate. He also advocated publicly a position on petrol temperature correction which advantaged fuel distributors. We wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) twice on this and have never had a satisfactory response. The fact of the matter is that this is a minister who just continues to defy the code of conduct and this is a Prime Minister who so far has allowed him to do it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5867">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of this motion is to say,`Enough is enough. The code of conduct stands for something or, Prime Minister, tear it up. Don't come in here with your unction and tell us you are going to lift the standards of ministers and then not seek to apply them.' The fact of the matter is that the minister has been in breach on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further fact is that every time he has been caught out his answer is to deny that he any longer has responsibility. That was his defence on the petrol issue. It was also his defence the other day on retail tenancy. He had this conversation with Minister Moore to give him the responsibility. Tell us, Minister, when you had that conversation, because that is very important to know. We believe you handed over the responsibility only after question time on Monday, between 3 o'clock and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report,</EMPHASIS> when we exposed you in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is true that you thought you had a conflict of interest at that point, you have clearly had it at every stage beforehand since you were sworn in as a minister, because you have been dealing as a minister with retail tenancy and franchising issues and have also been effective landlord of three major properties, shopping centres, in Western Australia. I will be interested to know when you also transferred responsibility for franchising to the minister for industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have to ask ourselves the question: are you saying that you have not taken one single decision on retail tenancy since you have been a minister; are you saying that you have not taken one single decision on franchising since you have been a minister? If that is the case, no wonder the business organisations are calling for you resignation. Also, if that is the case, what are you doing? You are earning your salary under false pretences. You are drawing a ministerial salary; you are given responsibilities, and every time you get into trouble you flick them off to someone else. You are gaining your money under false pretences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this place you have made great play of the fact that you are proud that you are a self&hyphen;made person. I congratulate you on that. The Labor Party holds no animosity about that.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We welcome it; we encourage it. But the fact of the matter is that when you become a minister you have to make a choice. Your counterpart in the Senate, John Herron, did. He also has an interest that was passionate about&mdash;his medical practice. And when the Prime Minister went to him he gave it up, because he knew he had to make a choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what you have to do. It is not that we say that you should never have built a business or that you cannot go back to it when you retire from this place or finish as a minister; it is just that when you are a minister you cannot do both. The reality is that you have wanted the best of both worlds, and you have hidden the extent of your interests to achieve the best of both. That is one of the charges we make of you today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not alleging any actual conflict. What we are saying is: all that is required to be covered under the code of conduct is the appearance of conflict. The evidence as it unfolds may prove that it has been actual; we may have some time to go on that. But all that is required is the appearance of conflict for you to have to comply and, having not complied, then resign. That is what Senator Short and Senator Gibson resigned for; not actual conflict, not a proven case of actual conflict. The Prime Minister consistently said that it was the appearance of conflict, and they went for that reason. You should go too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the declaration that you have made such a pathetic defence of today in the parliament, let us just go to this: did you tell the Prime Minister that you had these three shopping centres? Did you tell Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton? Mr Deputy Speaker, has he told Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton, who, the Prime Minister said, would run the toothcomb over? You know, when they got into the trouble with Minister Moore and many other ministers after the Short and Gibson resignations, the Prime Minister said he was going to refer these matters to his department head? He also told people on the record&mdash;this is the Prime Minister&mdash;that he had given his party room, his ministers, a real sounding out as to the way they needed to comply in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very interesting question, it is all very well to have something on this declara
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5868"> tion of interest, which we say is inadequate given what has developed, but did he tell the Prime Minister and did he tell Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton? It is a joke. On the record of interests he has `Bunbury, various lots'. As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, what he did was to get the comma in the wrong place. It should have said `Bunbury various, lots'. But what we have heard today is that it is not just `lots', it is `Bunbury, all'. In an interjection across the table, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) says that it is well known that the minister owns all of Bunbury. So it is not just `Bunbury, all', it is just `Bunbury'. Here's the minister with `lots and lots' but no declaration of the detail of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three shopping centres&mdash;who owns them? Prosser Automotive Engineers is the principal owner of these things. It is very interesting because the cover&hyphen;up of this minister does not go just to his declaration of interests in this parliament. It is very interesting to go to the annual return of the company&mdash;Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd. Listed under `principal activities', Minister, is `automotive engineers'&mdash;no mention of property and no mention of three shopping centres. We had to get it out of you in the parliament today that it owns the Homemaker, Minninup Forum and the Keys shopping centres. I would have thought they were reasonably `principal' activities. What are they worth, Minister? What are you trying to hide in terms of putting under the ownership of automotive engineers a company that you control and which has got three shopping centre properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the minister's defence? He says that he has declared it; it is all there. The problem is it is not all there and the reality is that, when we went to this issue last year, because of the fact that it said `automotive engineers' we just assumed that it was in the areas that it defined itself in. How would any reasonable person be expected to think that a company listed as `automotive engineers' would own three shopping centres? These are three shopping centres owned not by just any minister but the minister who has responsibility for retail tenancy and franchising.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Don't you think that constitutes an appearance of conflict of interest? You don't!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that, even if you do not list the details, there is a further requirement in the declaration of your interests in paragraph 13, which asks if there is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Membership of any organisation where a conflict of interest with a member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is blank in relation to this, Minister, and paragraph 14 asks about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any other interests where a conflict of interest with a member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is blank again. Not only has he not listed the three shopping centres, he has not listed his membership of the professional organisation that represents the top 100 property centre owners in the country, one of which is Prosser Automotive Engineering. It does not list his membership of that select group in his declaration of interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have copped it on this side from the Leader of the House saying, `Where are you in terms of your conflict of interest as members of trade unions?' The point is that we own up. We put in our declaration of interests that we are members and we are proud of it, but the fact is that we are among hundreds of thousands. He is one of 94. He is one of the top 100 shopping centre owners in this country and he does not declare it in his interests, nor does he declare his membership of an organisation that makes representations to government on his behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the point that that organisation of which he is a member made a submission calling for no toughening of the Trade Practices Act and no further legislative underpinning in relation to retail tenancy&mdash;a position that the review that had to hear this thing unanimously recommended should be done. This is the minister who has responsibility for making decisions in relation to that report. So he is a member of an organisation saying `Don't do it' to himself making the decision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That clearly is a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, let us go to the revelation today: the fact that you had made a phone call to Mr Greiner, not just any director of Coles Myer but the former Premier of New South
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5869"> Wales&mdash;another Liberal and another mate. Whom did you want that mate to talk to amongst his mates in Western Australia? Was it the Premier, Richard Court? Was it the former minister for planning, Mr Lewis? We would like to know, but do we hear it from you? No, because your pathetic defence is that you have complied. The fact is you have not complied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the other thing that we would like to know of this minister is: what was the conversation when he rang Mr Greiner as director of Coles Myer? Did he seek the contact specifically of the property manager for Coles Myer? Was the Eaton shopping centre site part of that discussion, and will he table the letter that his brother subsequently sent to Mr Greiner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this demonstrates, if it demonstrates nothing else&mdash;and let us see what the further evidence produces&mdash;is that he clearly involved himself in the activities of the business. He cannot come into this place and say that he is not there involved in the day to day business of the operations. I might say that I remember that this was a problem that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) got himself into with Ralsten, but he produced a letter that said that he was divorced from the day to day operations of the business. His letter, from Wilson Wilde, the other shareholder, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also confirm our agreement that I will not disclose or discuss with you the affairs or activities of the company during the period mentioned above&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the period being when he is a minister. If your argument, Minister, is that you are not involved in the daily affairs of the company, that you have separated yourself because you became a minister, produce the letter. The minister for industry was required to do it. The Prime Minister required it of him, and he did so. If this is the claim of the minister for small business, then he likewise must produce such a letter. Otherwise, it will be demonstrated that he is again misleading this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that he has not produced one iota of evidence today to show that he should not be censured and be forced to resign. He has breached the code of conduct thrice: involving himself in the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">day activities of the business, retaining a directorship against the guidelines and retaining shares in companies that clearly involve a breach of interest, a conflict of interest, because they are shares and directorships associated with issues, amongst other things, of retail tenancy and franchising&mdash;clearly areas within the ministerial responsibility. It is for that reason that this minister deserves not only to be censured but also to be asked by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) to resign. If he does not do it, the Prime Minister, between overs at Lords, ought to be watching this with a great deal of concern. He ought to be making the phone call and saying, `Geoffrey, time is up.

But the fact of the matter is that the minister's business success is well known in Bunbury&mdash;in fact, the bloke in the McKinnon article says that. People refer to that fact. The fact is that, because he is a good landlord and he lives there and is known around the street, people know what the minister has done over the years in Bunbury.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was commenting on the comments made in the second reading debate by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) as to the process by which the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill came to be debated at this particular juncture. The member is asserting that the government has mishandled the timing of the debate, but we totally reject that suggestion. I make a number of points in reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of months ago, my office discussed with the office of the shadow  Attorney-General the reference of the provi
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5881"> sions of the bill to the Senate committee, the timing of its report as well as the timing of the debate in the House of Representatives. At one point, Senator Bolkus's office requested that debate in the House not occur until after the Senate committee had reported. My office indicated the government's desire for passage of the legislation as soon as possible to overcome difficulties that the previous government had in fact sought to overcome itself. Senator Bolkus's office took that comment on board, and we did not hear anything more about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the initial stage of the reference to the Senate, the Senate fixed a report date considerably in advance of the reference. It was some date in April. Even that was not achieved. It is now due to report some time in this month. Given the length of time the bill has been in the public domain&mdash;a period of I think more than six months now&mdash;we simply reject the suggestion that it ought to be postponed any longer, and I have already indicated that the hearings by the Senate committee have been completed. What we do not know only at this point is what recommendations that committee will make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks also lamented the failure of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to consider the legislation. He would know as well as anybody that the legislation is usually referred to one or other of the committees. In this particular case, the Senate committee was the one chosen. He would also know very well that the reference to the House committee does not prevent it being referred to the Senate committee, and there may well be duplication. In this case it was not seen as appropriate that there be duplication, it being anticipated that the legislation would largely be uncontentious. It was seeking to do what the previous government itself had sought to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks seemed to suggest at one point in his speech that the bill constituted part of an agenda for dismantling the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. He seemed to suggest that it was the government's policy that if Labor did it it must be changed. The simple response to that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rather wild assertion is that the amendments contained in this bill are necessary to respond to the decision of the High Court in the Brandy case and the restructuring of the commission to strengthen the role of the president. They are initiatives which follow from a report commissioned by the previous government. The reforms in the bill are consistent with the views expressed in relation to the direction of the commission by the previous government when in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the debate, I indicated it was wide ranging. In fact, it did not deal with specific provisions of the bill to any great extent at all. Broader issues were focused upon. In particular, reference was made by a number of members to the current racism debate and the role of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in relation to that. Reference was also made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report on separated children. Reference was also made to foreshadowed budget cuts to the HREOC budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to comment on the first two matters that I mentioned except, in relation to the first, to mention that there was a speech by the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) in which he canvassed issues in relation to the current racism debate. I note that he drew commendation from both sides of the House for his contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the budget cuts, this was the subject of debate earlier today when the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department appropriations under Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 were considered in the Main Committee. In relation to that, let me just briefly mention that the government is committed to a strong and independent federal human rights body. Any reduction in funding is not reflective of a lack of commitment to human rights nor is it politically motivated. The changes simply reflect a need across government to ensure that, in difficult financial times, funds are applied and directed in an efficient and streamlined manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission's growth over the last decade has been disproportionate to that of other areas of government. Over the past nine years, funding to the commission has in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5882"> creased from about $4 million to more than $20 million&mdash;a 500 per cent increase. Over the same period, staff numbers increased from about 51 to 200&mdash;exceeding at one stage even 220.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction to the commission's funding in the 1997-98 year is in real terms only the four per cent efficiency saving applicable to all agencies within the Attorney-General's portfolio. Legislation currently before the parliament is the government's first step to improve the structure of HREOC and its operations. The legislation is consistent with changes previously foreshadowed by the Labor government. On that basis, any suggestion of a political motivation for it must be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further reduction in the commission's funding for subsequent years&mdash;1998, 1999 and beyond&mdash;amounts in real terms to about 27 per cent. Given the 500 per cent increase over the last nine years&mdash;this has to be seen in context&mdash;it is a significant reduction, but there is a great deal of room within the commission for efficiencies. If the commission acted in a more corporate and collegiate manner, then it would not need anything like the budget it has nor would it need anything like the staff numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government&mdash;and I have stated this publicly in the past&mdash;will be giving further consideration to reform of the structure of HREOC. I hope to bring recommendations before the parliament within a few months. The reforms under way and those to be brought will strengthen the role of HREOC as an independent watchdog. Australians will continue to have the ability to make complaints under federal anti-discrimination laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the bill. The bill has two main functions. The first function is to respond to the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. In that decision, the High Court found that the commission, as a non-judicial body, did not have the constitutional power to finally determine disputes. Its second function is to amend Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation to reform the administration functions and structure of the commission. These reforms are designed to enhance the protection and promotion of human rights of all
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of HREOC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) have criticised the bill on the ground that it will make it more difficult for persons alleging discrimination to pursue their issue. This criticism is based on some factors, such as the more formal nature of the Federal Court proceedings, exposure to an adverse costs order and payment of various court fees. In response to those assertions, let me make some points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, the existing system is, as already explained, unsatisfactory because there are potentially three levels of dispute resolution: conciliation, the commission hearing and, if the hearing leads to a determination of a complainant, enforcement in the Federal Court by way of a hearing de novo. Under the proposed scheme it is envisaged that there will be a human rights registry of the Federal Court and that many matters will be referred not necessarily to judges but to judicial registrars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although subject to review by the Federal Court judges, decisions of judicial registrars are enforceable if no review is sought. I am advised that there has been ongoing liaison between the commission and the court to develop user-friendly procedures. In relation to matters to be referred to judicial registrars, although this is ultimately a matter for the court, as I said, decisions are enforceable on their own merits if no review is sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, although it is true that the usual rules as to payment of fees in the Federal Court will apply&mdash;and that would be the case should it be necessary for a person to initiate enforcement proceedings&mdash;fees apply to enforcement proceedings under the present regime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have gone up under our government. The government is pursuing a proposal under which the people who use courts will pay for the use of them. However, people who cannot afford to pay for them will not be required to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5883">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Family Court, 40 per cent of litigants do not pay because they are either on benefits or can demonstrate hardship. The same principles will apply in the Federal Court. The current jurisdiction of the Federal Court has few people in that category because it is generally a court for business and government rather than a court for the ordinary litigant, but the same rules will apply when the court deals with human rights matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the bill contains a number of initiatives designed to reduce formality in the Federal Court proceedings and possibly lead to less reliance on legal representation. The government believes the proposed scheme strikes an appropriate balance to provide people with access to a remedy for discrimination and the desirability of parties thinking seriously about the manner in which they conduct themselves during the course of a complaint once it becomes necessary to consider involvement in Federal Court proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition&mdash;typically for bills in the Attorney-General's portfolio&mdash;have indicated they will move amendments in the Senate. I say typically, because in the Attorney&hyphen;General's portfolio area the opposition position on the bill is rarely explained in this House. We have to wait until the Senate considers the legislation before we hear what the opposition's view is. The government will consider any amendments that the opposition seeks to move in the Senate. It will also consider on their merits any recommendations made by the Senate committee when it eventually gets around to reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly mention some of the comments made by individual members. The member for Jagajaga has a constituent with a particular difficulty. In the interests of time I will not explain it, just to say that the bill will overcome that problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If she is able to demonstrate hardship she will not have to pay fees. I welcome the comments of the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) in support of a proposal I have floated in relation to the establishment of a federal magistracy. If that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is able to be established, that would overcome a lot of the problems that are raised in argument against the use of the Federal Court. There would be additional informality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley (Mr Price) raised the merits of the Brandy decision. I do not want to comment on that. He also sought some legal advice in relation to the difference between judicial and administrative decisions. I invite the attention of the member for Chifley to the report of the Brandy case where there is something of an explanation of the nature of judicial power as distinct from executive power. The report is in volume 183, Commonwealth Law Reports at page 245. The relevant passage is at pages 256 and 257 in the judgments of Chief Justice Mason and Justices Brennan and Toohey. One of the differences between the tribunals he mentioned&mdash;the Social Security Appeal Tribunal and the Immigration Review Tribunal&mdash;is the enforcement mechanism which was in focus in the Brandy case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) raised the question of spurious claims being brought before the commission. I think he had in mind the experiences of constituents. I think the procedures that are proposed in relation to bringing proceedings in the Federal Court will probably prevent spurious claims being pursued significantly by prospective litigants. They will have to think twice before going to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) seems to think that the government has merged the roles of the Privacy Commissioner and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. That is not right. The Privacy Commissioner is acting on an interim arrangement only, and the government intends to appoint a Sex Discrimination Commissioner. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I am indebted to the House and to you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) was quick to point out something that has been a matter of debate in the House in the past, that really the Labor government was at fault that the Brandy decision was brought down. In the debate on the amendments&mdash;I think it was in 1993 or 1994 or thereabouts that the amendments were enacted&mdash;it was pointed out by
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5884"> speakers, including me, that there was a prospect that the amendments would be held to be unconstitutional. It was, therefore, really not very surprising to a number of people that they were. I am indebted to the member for Fisher also for his defence of the budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel)&mdash;wrongly, I think&mdash;asserted that there had been a lack of consultation on the bill. I think his misapprehension is based on a lack of knowledge of what had gone on in the development of the bill and that it was to a large degree built upon a bill that had been created by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) asserted that more legal aid will be required and suggested that inadequate funds had been set aside. That is really a separate debate on legal aid. Again, that subject was canvassed in the debate in the Main Committee this morning on the Attorney&hyphen;General's appropriations under Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98, which has now been passed. She also raised the question of cuts to HREOC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) raised mainly the issue of the separated children report, about which I do not propose to say anything in this particular debate. He also referred to a tax on the High Court. That is an additional subject. I think he was the only one to mention it. I do not propose to say anything about that either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) raised issues relating to access to the court which I think were raised in a different form by other speakers. I have already commented on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to the members who have spoken for their interest. I think there is a genuine interest in the work of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I hope there will be a genuine interest and a constructive contribution when we come to debate further proposals for reform of the structure of HREOC which in the government's view are necessary. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments provide for transitional arrangements for complaints which have been lodged with the commission but which will not have been completed at the commencement of the new legislation. In summary, the transitional arrangements provide that a complaint which has progressed through the initial inquiry and conciliation stage and has commenced a substantive hearing with the commission will remain to be determined under the existing law. All complaints which have not commenced a substantive hearing prior to the commencement of the new law will be transferred to the new regime at the appropriate stage in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transitional arrangements have been developed in such a way as to minimise the impact on parties who have reached significant stages in the existing complaints process, while also taking into account the need to address the problems highlighted in the High Court's decision in Brandy and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In addition, the government amendments include a number of minor consequential  amendments and savings provisions which either supplement or make corrections to the original bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 seeks to amend the provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1993 which relate to the professional services review scheme. The national health insurance system we have in Australia, commonly known as Medicare and widely loved by the Australian community, requires firm but fair policing of any attempts to defraud the taxpayer or any attempts by medical practitioners to overservice. It is the responsibility of the national government to make sure that there is that fair policing of any attempts to misuse taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This responsibility was recognised by the previous Labor government, which moved to establish the professional services review scheme. The introduction of that scheme was supported by the then opposition. In the same manner, these reforms which the Howard government is seeking to introduce will have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the support of the Labor opposition. We believe that these reforms will clarify and strengthen the professional services review scheme. I add at this stage that I am grateful to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Department of Health and Family Services for the detailed briefing that they have provided to the opposition on the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains the following key elements. The first removes the provisions which would allow the determining officer to impose a fine on medical practitioners found to have engaged in overservicing&mdash;that is, to clarify any concern regarding inappropriate use of judicial power. The only financial penalties then are those relating to the repayment of medical benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second key element allows for an increase in the maximum periods of disqualification to three years full or partial exclusion from access to medical benefits. The third element allows committees to have access to documents, subject to appropriate privacy provisions, prior to the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth element clarifies a possible confusion that the committee may use sampling techniques in assessing a practitioner's conduct but may not choose to use such a technique. There was some concern, some legal advice, which might suggest that in some way the committee is obliged to use those sampling techniques. This amendment makes sure that that confusion is removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth element allows a greater range of referrals to appropriate professional bodies, where inappropriate conduct is discovered. All these changes are likely to improve the  Commonwealth's ability to fairly but firmly police Medicare and they therefore have the Labor Party's support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to note that these changes will not be retrospective, something which I could not say about every piece of legislation that this minister and this government have introduced in the last 12 months or so&mdash;in particular, the legislation on provider numbers for doctors in training.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that members of the opposition have been taking advantage of the opportunity during the adjournment debate to read into the record, and hopefully for the small number of people who might be listening to parliament, some of the records that were provided for the Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, which gave rise to the report known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> . I am one of those people who believe that, as to the separation of those children at that time, those decisions&mdash;and I think that most people probably agree&mdash;were often made in good faith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fact is that the decisions were wrong. They were appalling, there were disgraceful and they were grotesque. They affected little children who were physically torn away from their parents and away from their families, and who were subjected to emotional, physical and sexual abuse of the grossest kinds. As I say, we have taken the opportunity to read into the record some of these accounts. Let me read into the record, for the benefit of those people who may be listening, the evidence that was given about and by a person known as Carol:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[Carol's grandmother was removed to Beagle Bay at the age of 10. She and her husband had 10 children. When her husband was transferred to the Derby leprosarium, all ten children were placed in the Beagle Bay dormitories. Carol's mother was 8 years old when she was removed. Carol was born in Broome in the mid-1950s. When she was three, her mother died leaving four children. Although her grandmother was still alive, Carol and her siblings were removed to the Beagle Bay dormitories. Carol spent the next 14 years there.]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Five generations of my family have been affected by removal of children. Four generations of my family have been removed from their mothers and institutionalised. Three generations of my family have been put into Beagle Bay Mission dormitories. Four generations of my family went without parental love, without mother or father. I myself found it very hard to show any love to my children because I wasn't given that, so was my mother and grandmother.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I think back on my childhood days&mdash;sad, lonely and unloved childhood days&mdash;we should have been treated better than we were by the Church. We were mistreated badly. I was abused by the missionaries from all angles&mdash;sexual, physical and mental. I am a strong person in myself. I had to be strong, I had no-one to turn to, no-one to guide me through life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.30am every morning, straight from bed, we had to kneel and say our morning prayers. 7am we had to go to church for mass. If we didn't we would be punished, like going without a piece of bread for breakfast or get the strap or whipped on our palms. 7.30am we had to thank God before and after our breakfast. 8.30am before and after class we said our prayers. 10am we had to say another prayer before we had our cups of milk and morning tea break. 11 am we had catechism taught to us which was part of praying and learning the history of our church. 12pm again we said our prayers before and after our lunch. 1pm we said another prayer before and after class. 5pm we prayed again before and after our supper. 6pm most times we had to go to church for Benediction or rosary. 7pm we would kneel and say the last prayer of the day, which was our night prayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were locked up every night. Also during the day on weekends and public holidays. That was only when we didn't go out on picnics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7am breakfast&mdash;very light which was only sago with milk or most times porridge. l0am morning tea time: one cup of Carnation milk. 12am lunch, very light sometimes one piece of bread covered with lard along with a small piece of boiled meat. We loved it all the same. 5pm supper, very light which was `bubble&hyphen;bubbles' which was only flour, sugar and water, and if we were lucky we would have a piece of fruit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had nothing else to eat, only if we stole vegetables from the garden. We had two big vegetable gardens. Every vegetable was grown  there yet we were never given any. We never had vegetables. Things that we never saw on our meal table yet were sold elsewhere from Beagle Bay Mission. When it was my turn to work in the convent kitchen I saw that all the vegetables that our people grew were on their meal tables.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone would think we were doing the laundries for a big hospital, how many times and how we washed the missionaries' laundry. Every Sunday evening we had to soak the missionaries' laundry. Every Monday morning we washed clothes by hands or scrubbing board. We then had to rinse and put it into the big boilers. Then rinsed, then starched, then rinsed, then squeezed and hung out to dry. We had to iron all the clothes, plus mending and darning.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Carol goes on to detail some grotesque experiences that she had. We have suggested that, while people perhaps now should feel no personal guilt, it does not take very much for us to say to those poor people who are still

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to respond to a shameful piece of deceit, deceit framed as a question during the last question time on Thursday of the last sitting week of parliament. The question by the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) pertained to Richmond RAAF Base, a central feature of my electorate of Macquarie. In his question, the member for Fowler referred to the:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . government's announced closure and sale of RAAF Richmond, contained in the defence efficiency review . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is totally wrong, but not only is it wrong, it is far worse: it is either a case of appalling ignorance or of blatant dishonesty. Either the member for Fowler had not bothered to read the defence efficiency review, to which he so loosely referred, in which case such a statement was grossly irresponsible, or else he was aware of its contents and deliberately chose to distort it. Either way, it is a pathetic and unabashed case of scaremongering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is determined to try and score points regardless of the truth, regardless of the facts and regardless of the anxiety they create in the broad community. For the record again and for my constituents in the electorate of Macquarie, the facts are these: the government has not announced the closure of RAAF Richmond and the government has not decided to sell RAAF Richmond. The defence efficiency review merely indicated a number of properties whose usefulness would be evaluated in the medium term. The comments by the member for Fowler were totally and completely misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RAAF base is central to the economy and the culture of the Hawkesbury. It employs 3,000 people, including 200 defence civilians. In addition, another 100 contractor personnel are employed by other industries on the base. A substantial number of ADF personnel reside in the Hawkesbury-Nepean region&mdash;either on the base, in Defence Housing Authority housing or in private housing and others in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> local privately owned homes. They spend their pay packets in the local community, their children attend school in the local community and many of their spouses work in the local community. In short, they are a part of the community of the Hawkesbury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all, the RAAF Richmond base brings about $2 million a week into the local economy. These are the direct benefits. The indirect spin&hyphen;offs in employment, income and job generation are enormous. Clearly, for these reasons, RAAF Richmond is essential to the Hawkesbury, essential to its economy and central to its community. Its closure would be, in a word, devastating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fact is obvious to anyone who lives in the Hawkesbury. What is needed on this issue is a careful analysis of the facts, not the cheap dishonest fear campaign of the member for Fowler and other Labor members obsessed with short-term political point scoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I might add that on defence issues Labor's credentials are hardly what one would describe as impressive. Under Labor, defence spending as a percentage of government outlays declined until it had reached an unacceptable level. The former government sold $180 million worth of Defence properties in its last five years and short&hyphen;listed another $500 million worth of properties for sale. In its own white paper some years earlier it had raised doubts about the future of RAAF  Richmond. Labor has no credibility at all on issues of defence or, for that matter, on any other issue. It certainly has no credibility on the issue of RAAF Richmond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach by the member for Fowler on this question is the same approach we have seen time and time again from Labor&mdash;cheap scaremongering, deceitful misrepresentation and total disregard for the concerns of the community. These tactics have come to dominate this opposition. When they have a record they are ashamed of, when they have no constructive policies to present and when they have nothing else to offer they resort to fear and deceit. Their response to the future of Richmond RAAF base is typical of such an approach&mdash;an approach that we have seen in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5892"> the last year from Labor to cover for their own shameful lack of policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When an opposition has nothing constructive to say, no positive policy alternatives, and nothing to offer the voters of this country it does what Labor is continuing to do: it resorts to deceit, dishonesty and fear. On the issue of RAAF Richmond, as on most issues, the opposition stands condemned by its own record, tactics and dishonesty.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5892"><TITLE>Kyi, Aung San Suu

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon on 19 June 1945. The Australia Burma Council has organised celebratory messages and  greetings to be sent to her on this day. I very much regret that it was not possible to find time in this House to debate, however briefly, a congratulatory notice of motion put down by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and me. The Australia Burma Council said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be encouraging also for the Australian Parliament to pass a motion supporting Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and for the media to give Burma special attention on this day.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amidst the turmoil of increased political oppression, slavery and the recent death in custody at the hands of the SLORC of National League for Democracy's, Monywa Tin Shwe, the world's most admired political leader and pro&hyphen;democracy campaigner, Nobel Laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi who turns 52 next week, will never give up fighting for the freedom of her people. Denied access to her husband and children for more than a year, she will once again celebrate her birthday alone.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Aung San Suu Kyi was the daughter of the great Burmese nationalist politician Aung San who was born around 1914. He became the recognised leader of Burma immediately after World War II and formed the first government&mdash;and then, along with several other of his ministers, he was assassinated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that stage Suu Kyi was two years old. She went into exile with her mother. She was educated in India and Burma and worked for the UN in New York. She was exiled by the military government of Ne Win. She returned to Burma in 1988 and became the leader of the National League for Democracy. Although she was placed under house arrest in 1989, her party won the May 1990 elections, gaining 81 per cent of the seats. As we know, the army refused to cede power and she remained under house arrest until July 1995, attracting international support for her cause. She was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and the Simon Bolivar Peace Prize of UNESCO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I visited Rangoon on 18 and 19 March in an attempt to see Suu Kyi, bearing greetings from her husband, Dr Michael Aris, whom I have met several times in various continents and regard as a friend, and her son Kim whom I also met in Oxford a few days earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation with Suu Kyi when I was there was that she remained under virtual house arrest. The telephone has a terrible habit of dropping out, so it is impossible for her to sustain contact with the outside world. Her husband had gone for over a fortnight without being able to speak with her. She is forbidden to have a satellite based mobile phone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I went up with the officials from the embassy on three occasions, we were turned away by soldiers, police and officers of the  SLORC. Each time a cameraman appeared from behind a bush and took photographs of us all, details of our names and who we were. It is a very oppressive situation. I know that Suu Kyi had been advised that I was about to attend. I hope she was looking forward to the visit, as I certainly was. She is, for practical purposes, denied free access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quote a terrible paragraph from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>, under `Mental health services':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party. . . concluded that,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mental distress is a common and crippling problem for many Aboriginal people and appropriate services are a pressing need. Advances in the understanding and treatment for mental health problems have been
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5893"> impressive since World War II; this progress has yet to benefit Aboriginal people. Culturally appropriate services for Aboriginal people are virtually non&hyphen;existent. Mental health services are designed and controlled by the dominant society for the dominant society. The health system does not recognise or adapt programs to Aboriginal beliefs and law, causing a huge gap between service provider and user. As a result, mental distress in the Aboriginal community goes unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House my concerns, and the concerns of many Central Coast residents, about the obvious deterioration of one of the most significant regional tourist attractions, and an important piece of our heritage, situated in my electorate of Robertson. This facility is called Old Sydney Town and it is situated at Somersby, on the Central Coast of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to preface my remarks by recording my strong support for and firm commitment to the Old Sydney Town complex. My comments tonight are not in any way designed to denigrate the complex or in fact to cause them any adverse publicity. The concerns raised by Central Coast residents, and also raised by some staff members at Old Sydney Town, have now reached a level where action must be taken to secure the future of this magnificent place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Old Sydney Town is situated on a parcel of land owned by the New South Wales Labor government. The attraction itself is also owned by the New South Wales state government, but it is leased to an overseas based entertainment company. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have had a long association with Old Sydney Town. In fact, from the very first days after it opened, in my younger days in one of my many business ventures, I had reason to visit Old Sydney Town on a daily basis for many years. I witnessed first hand the growth of this very important heritage program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1983, as the then Liberal candidate for the state seat of Peats, I called
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the Labor government to secure the future of Old Sydney Town because I was alarmed at the deterioration that I had seen in the park. I was determined to save this most valuable resource for future generations and, at that time in particular, for the 1988 bicentennial celebrations. In November 1983, the state government responded to my call to secure the future of Old Sydney Town by announcing a five&hyphen;year plan which would secure the future of the complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1985, the then New South Wales Minister for Tourism and Sport, Mike Cleary MP, called for tenders to lease the theme park. Later, the minister announced that the successful lessee&mdash;Far East Hotels and Entertainment Pty Ltd&mdash;had guaranteed somewhere between $15 million and $20 million to revamp the park. In addition to that, the minister also approved up to $5 million from state government moneys to further assist the program. Mr Deputy Speaker, where has that money gone? Was in fact any money ever provided from either party, and what was it used for? The Australian community demands answers to these questions, and they certainly deserve answers to these questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the promises made by the minister, and as a result of the lease agreement, was that the historic church should be completed; that was in 1985. As a member of the Kariong&hyphen;Somersby Rotary Club, which meets every Friday morning at Old Sydney Town, I have a reason to regularly drive past  that church, and I can assure honourable members and the Australian public that the church is still in the same state that it was in in 1985, with no roof, no windows and totally incapable of providing dry or shaded areas for tourists to watch the programs and shows that take place inside that church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also areas of the park which are closed off because they are not safe for the public. I well remember the many weddings and functions that used to take place on the vessels <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Perseverance</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Contest</EMPHASIS>, which were moored in the harbour at Old Sydney Town. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Perseverance</EMPHASIS> used to be a beautifully rigged twin-mast vessel and it was very popular for those sorts of activities; it was also used extensively by Australian film
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5894"> crews. The masts are now gone and all that is left is one decaying mast sticking up in the middle of a rotting hull. The other vessel, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Contest</EMPHASIS>, has sunk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Old Sydney Town is manned by many loyal and dedicated staff who, week after week, toil to ensure the standards of Old Sydney Town are kept to the best that they possibly can be. But they are concerned; they are distressed by the obvious lack of injection of funds into this very important historical asset, and I am told that they are concerned about the very future of the park.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Hon. Mike Gallagher MLC has also been contacted by community members on the Central Coast, and he is intent on raising this issue in the New South Wales parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in the mid-1980s, I was at the forefront of the fight to save Old Sydney Town to ensure that this Australian heritage asset did not disappear. Central Coast residents pressured the Wran government into doing something about this precarious situation in the mid-1980s, and it is my intention to be at the forefront of this push again by the Central Coast community, some 12 years later, to save Old Sydney Town before it reaches the point of no return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the Premier, Bob Carr, to do something about the deplorable state of this valuable heritage asset that belongs to the people of New South Wales and of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5894"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last month or so, members of the opposition have been reading into the record during the adjournment debate stories from the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. That report, as you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> . During those few weeks since May, over 90 of those stories have been read into the record of this parliament by members of the opposition. As Chief Opposition Whip, I thank them for doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shame that in that time the government's heart has not been softened. It would seem that many members of the government have not had their hearts softened either, because anyone who has read this report could not help having their heart broken over the plight of these children who were taken away from their parents for no other reason than that they and their parents were Aboriginal. They were put in institutions across this country, often by people who thought they were doing the right thing, but the reality is they could not be considered in any way, shape or form to be doing the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made a speech in this House in October of last year about this report when it was in its final stages of being brought together. When making a speech&mdash;this often happens with members in this place&mdash;things go through your mind that you might not have thought about when preparing your speech. I have three sons and, while making that speech, I thought: what would I have done if someone had taken one of my kids away from me, for no other reason than that child was my child? I do not think I would have been half as forgiving as the Aboriginal people have been. I think I would have been seeking vengeance myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most amazing thing that comes out of this report is that the people who were offended against&mdash;the Aboriginal children and their parents&mdash;do not seem to be wanting vengeance. All they seem to be asking is that  someone say, on behalf of Australia, `We are sorry we did that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the state parliaments in this country have done that. Yesterday, there was a very moving ceremony in the New South Wales parliament. That parliament asked an Aboriginal woman to take the floor of the House and speak on behalf of the children who were taken away. She said that a lot of very sorrowful things had happened to her and that the one thing she would do would be to fight for her children.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5895">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government says that they have various reasons for not wanting to do this, surely as a parliament we could now come together and say that we are sorry to these people. In evidence given to a Senate estimates committee last week, the government's Chief General Counsel, Mr Burmester, said that he believed the government could construct a form of words that would allow the parliament to make that apology and not incur any liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of the people who were offended against&mdash;a number of these people who were children in the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s&mdash;have said that they do not want compensation. They just want someone to say, `We are sorry.' You do not need to look far to understand why there are higher levels of crime and social disruption in Aboriginal communities than the European community in Australia. In New South Wales a quarter of the Aboriginal people, who are now my age, were taken away from their families. How else can those people grow up except by having dislocated lives? Their children will also have dislocated lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one way of helping that one inch is for the parliament to say `We are sorry' on behalf of the Australian people, we should. I am certainly sorry, the opposition is sorry and I am sure many members of the government are sorry. I am sure that you too are sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. Surely we can all say that in order to heal some of the wrong that has been done. I thank my colleagues for what they have done to help with that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5895"><TITLE>Kyi, Aung San Suu</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I, too, would like to register a birthday wish with a difference. Although not a constituent of mine, Burmese political leader and campaigner for democracy and human rights, Aung San Suu Kyi, is a member of a much larger constituency&mdash;that of mankind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aung San Suu Kyi will not spend this day, the day of her 52nd birthday, in the company of her husband and sons, but will remain confined to her house, behind the barricades
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> erected by the Burmese military regime.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This birthday wish is a tribute to her and the courage of those members of the National League for Democracy who, guided by the strength and determination of Aung San Suu Kyi, risk their lives daily to continue the struggle for democratic rights in their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a personal birthday wish rather than a speech on international relations. It is a heartfelt message of goodwill that in no way attacks the sovereignty of the Burmese state. It is a simple reminder that, for many people around the world, a birthday is not a day of celebration but simply another day in the year of an ongoing struggle for the freedom that many people take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aung San Suu Kyi's struggle is not about distribution of political power. It is not a cynical bid by a disenchanted leader to regain the privileges of public life. It is simply a struggle for her right to be free&mdash;for freedom of expression, freedom of political association, and the freedom for the Burmese people to elect the person they want to lead them. I am relieved to say that these are not issues that the average Australian will have to face on the day of his or her 52nd birthday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aung San Suu Kyi's fight is a peaceful one&mdash;one which avails itself of no other weapon than the courage to stand and be counted. What she demands from the rest of the world&mdash;from countries like Australia&mdash;is a recognition of the plight of the Burmese people, and an assurance that the support of the Australian people for what she is doing will never wane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aung San Suu Kyi has never truly seen herself as a leader, or a martyr of a cause.  Her Nobel Peace Prize has never changed her understanding of the ordeal that she has been through. She sees herself as someone no more traumatised by her fate than so many among her 40 million fellow Burmese. Such an unassuming approach reminds us of the universality of her struggle. In every country where basic human rights are denied, there are people who stand up for human dignity, whether or not their sacrifice makes it into the history books.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5896">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of Burma's National League for Democracy are not superhuman in their demonstrated courage and determination; they are simply expressing virtues which are inherent to us all&mdash;courage in the face of adversity, and a passion for what is right. The average Australian may never have to call upon such virtues, or may be able to express his or her passion for justice in the context of democratic debate. But I would like to think that we are all capable of standing up for the right of every human being to live with dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aung San Suu Kyi's messages are based on moral, ethical and spiritual norms which we would all recognise. Differences of language and culture should not lead us to ignore the struggle of the Burmese people, or to turn a blind eye in the name of a government's right to sort out its own domestic problems. The Burmese leadership&mdash;the military regime of the SLORC&mdash;is not representative of the aspirations of the Burmese people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the restrictions placed upon her by the authorities, this courageous fighter for freedom still speaks out fearlessly against her country's military regime. In so doing, she embodies the energy and courage displayed by her late father, General Aung San, in his fight for independence. Like many great leaders of the past, she has set the stamp of an idea on an era&mdash;an idea of freedom for an oppressed nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aung San Suu Kyi constantly reminds her followers that their fight for freedom should never violate their basic obligation to respect human life. Her weekly messages to her own people and her wider audience in the `free' world are of human qualities which give rise to dignity and freedom. Sadly, these are messages which are yet to reach the hearts of the leaders of a regime, who are still chasing legitimacy and who have recently intensified their crackdown on their political opponents&mdash;namely, members of the National League for Democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without losing sight of the wider issue of democracy and freedom, I mean this birthday wish to be personal. As a backbencher of a small parliamentary democracy, representing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 90,000&hyphen;odd average Australians, I hope that Aung San Suu Kyi's next year of life can be happier&mdash;that she may be reunited with her family, and that she be given a chance to live not as an international figure in the struggle against oppression but simply as one of the 40 million&hyphen;odd Burmese people with the normal hopes, aspirations and concerns of her fellow country men and women. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I would like to return to a subject that I touched on very quickly yesterday and that is questioning the commitment of this government to the national drug strategy and providing Australians with the best policies possible to combat the illegal drug trade in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do so because I was struck yesterday by what I believed was the total and utter disinterest displayed by the Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge) when he got up to answer some of the questions raised by us on this side of the House. He responded quite clearly and, I believe, quite precisely to all of the matters raised by myself and my colleagues in the debate surrounding his health portfolio, but he studiously avoided responding to any of my comments regarding the pitiful amount of money the government has now set aside for the national drugs strategy in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also refused to comment on the growing amount of calls for a national drug summit. In relation to the national drug strategy, I will not shrink from admitting that the program has had a real reduction in budgetary support almost every year since it was initiated by the Hawke Labor government in 1985. It is a disappointment and I do not deny that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me, however, is that at a time when Australia is awash with drugs, or more precisely when it is sinking under the weight of the drug trade, particularly heroin, we can little afford further cuts to the national drug strategy. It displays a total and utter disregard for our current predicament. It is either that, or it is because this government is simply blase or unaware of the scale of the drug emergency which our country now faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reducing the funding for the national drug strategy to $33 million, as indicated here in the appropriation bills, when close to $4 billion is taken in by government in excise and taxes on tobacco and alcohol&mdash;something I brought up again yesterday&mdash;is really a contemptuous joke. To quote the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), the Minister for Health's learned medical colleague, it is completely `tokenistic'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5900">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes me want to tear my hair out when I see that, in the past fortnight, three more people have died of drug overdoses on the streets of my community. As I said yesterday, kids of 11 and 12 are now shooting up in our car parks, our public toilets and our back alleyways, yet this government is allocating $1 billion to what I can only describe as whistles and balloons for our federation celebrations and only $33 million to help save people from the ravages of drugs, both legal and illegal. It is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that while the Minister for Health was ducking the government's commitment to the national drugs strategy, he was also studiously avoiding responding to calls I made during the debate in detail for a national drugs summit; calls, I might add, which have been made with increased urgency not only by myself but also by various other individuals and organisations around this country. By other individuals and groups, I mean the directors of public prosecutions of New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria; the Australian Medical Association; the Royal Australian College of Physicians and various members of this House, on both sides of the parliament, I might add.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must admit I was quite shocked when I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday that a spokesperson for the Minister for Health responded to the Australian Medical Association's call for a national drug summit by saying such a meeting would be nothing but a `talkfest' and would achieve `zilch'. I believe that is disgraceful arrogance from the minister's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister may want to have a chat to his spokesperson about `talkfests'. While people are dying from drug related deaths at record levels, not just in Cabramatta, but all over Australia&mdash;I said yesterday during this debate that something like 1,182 people died in 1995&mdash;the government has no problems spending that $40 million on the ultimate in talkfests, the constitutional convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, our Minister for Health and our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) cannot see fit to providing the impetus to solving our nation's terrible drug tragedy by convening a national summit. They just cannot see how a national summit would provide national consensus, would plot new directions and would produce new strategies to deal with this drug problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the minister that I do not make this request for petty political purposes. I do not make this request in order to make him or the government look bad. I make this request because I am sick of seeing kids in my area and young adults throughout south&hyphen;western Sydney destroying their lives and the lives of their families because of heroin abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nation's current drug policies have failed. They are not about to get better. I put it again to the Minister for Health that discussing the recent evaluation of the national drug strategy at the Australasian Police Ministers Council and the Australian Health Ministers Conference in July this year will at best lead to change of the most marginal variety. We need dramatic change. The only way we are going to achieve that dramatic change on a national level, with national consensus, is via a national drug summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The onus is now on the Minister for Health and particularly on the Prime Minister to swallow their misgivings and to take this step. I want to make it clear again that I am not saying that Australia's drug problem began on 2 March last year. I am not apportioning blame in regard to why Australia is currently being swamped by heroin&mdash;heroin of a level of purity never seen before in this country. What I am saying is that the coalition is in government now, and now is the time we need action. I repeat: the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister must act. It is not going to come about from the measly $33 million allocated to drug education in this budget.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the electorate of Wills, the impact of this, which could possibly lead to closure by church and community groups of their nursing home beds, would be disastrous.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on this aspect of expenditure, I express some concern about the cut in funding for labour market programs. In doing that, I would like to contrast the attitude of the previous Labor government with the attitude of the coalition government in its response to the high unemployment with which both governments were confronted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government's response to unemployment was to introduce a program of job creation and training under the Working Nation program. They attacked the problem in two ways by setting a number of targets. Firstly, they had a program of creating some 500,000 jobs in the last term of the Labor government. In fact, they exceeded that program by creating over 700,000 jobs in that period. The second target that the government set itself was to reduce unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000. I believe that that government showed some character. It was prepared to put its reputation on the line by making those two commitments to reducing unemployment. By doing that, of course, there was more possibility that unemployment would be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the current government has failed to do this. It has failed to set targets of any description in relation to reducing unemployment&mdash;other than, of course, cutting $1.8 billion from labour market programs, which is my basic concern in this presentation. But they have also asked the Australian people to be patient. First we were told that the reforms to the workplace reform legislation and the unfair dismissal legislation were going to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall very vividly, in the debate over last year's budget, coalition member after coalition member speaking in relation to the unfair dismissal provisions, as if that were going to be a cure&hyphen;all for all our problems. Now we quite clearly see that the unfair dismissal legislation has been changed, yet there has been no alteration other than, in fact, an increase in unemployment. The Australian people have been asked to be patient and they are still waiting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now being asked to wait a little longer for a range of government policies to be introduced, including the GST, before the Australian people can expect any fall in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5903"> unemployment. I think the danger that we all face is that we could see an improvement in the economy in many ways but a further decrease in unemployment. In other words, we could have a jobless recovery. I think this is very much a probability under this current government's policies, where it is not prepared to target job creation in many ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, all the indications are that unemployment is likely to grow during the remaining term of this government. Let me give you a few examples. A further 16,500 public service jobs will be lost in 1997&hyphen;98. The defence efficiency review will mean a loss of a further 8,000 jobs, including many in regional Australia. There is restructuring in the private sector, in Telstra, Burns Philp and CSR. With BHP, we will see some 2,500 jobs disappear with no apparent concern or action by this current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment in the manufacturing industry, which has been a great employer of Australians for many years, is now extremely flat. We are expecting further cutbacks in banking and in the financial sector. Mr Paul Orton, the New South Wales based policy manager for the Australian Business Chamber, has been quoted in the press recently as saying that most investment `means reducing rather than increasing jobs'. I emphasise: it means a reduction rather than an increase in jobs. I certainly do not believe the government is focused enough on job creation in this budget. I think a lot more finance could have been made available to help community based organisations and other organisations create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Australia's unemployed people just simply cannot wait any longer. They need relief now, not in a year or in two years. Last week's labour force figures showed a loss of 40,300 jobs in one month. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this particular matter, I have major concerns with the government's direction on the issues. I refer specifically to what I regard as a non&hyphen;solution to the question of creating jobs and the issue of work for the dole, which is not a real solution to the question of unemployment. I believe that youth unemployment is a major problem in Australia. But what is required is a budget strategy that is aimed at creating real jobs rather than pointing the finger, especially at the young unemployed on the basis that they are to be blamed for being unemployed, and coming up with policy options which are aimed at punishing young unemployed and their parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer not just to the issues covered by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs&mdash;namely, the dole diary and work for the dole&mdash;but also to the announcements this week about the youth allowance, which was worked out by agreement between DEETYA and the Department of Social Security. I regard it as highly unacceptable to basically rip away unemployment relief from people who are 18 to 20 years of age. I find it strange that we live in a civilised country such as Australia where we can vote at 18 years of age and, if necessary, join the Armed Forces and fight for Australia to defend our strong democratic system, yet at the same time the government suggests that we are dependent on our parents for relief if they earn more than $41,500 as a household, and that therefore it is up to our parents to support us if we are 18 to 20 years of age and unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the real problem is that the government does not understand the depth of concern and despair out in the Australian community on the all&hyphen;important issues of jobs and job security. Speaking about the question of work for the dole, in order to reinforce this issue, I think I should refer in passing to the performance of the new Howard government. I suppose I should emphasise that it is no longer a new government. In fact, it is 15 months old. One would ordinarily suggest that that is probably half the lifetime of a normal parliamentary term.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5904">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can already refer today, on a regular basis, to discussions becoming if anything the order of the day from the government about the potential next election and talk of double dissolutions. People are even thinking about the next election, which is an indication that the government is in power, it is considered as the government of the day and the Australian community now expect results rather than rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community is getting concerned about the lack of performance of the government, after 15 months, on the question of jobs. They do not see work for the dole as a solution to real jobs for our young unemployed. They are concerned, for example, that the number of jobs has only risen by 86,800 in the first 15 months. Perhaps an even bigger worry to them is the fact that the number of full&hyphen;time jobs has actually fallen by 700 in this period. The number of male full&hyphen;time jobs has fallen by 9,900, the number of people unemployed has risen by 39,000, and the unemployment rate has risen from 8.5 to 8.8 per cent. Last but not least, the youth unemployment rate&mdash;surprisingly, because the Prime Minister said he would be judged on this issue at the end of his first term&mdash;has risen from 27.4 per cent to 27.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That takes me to the question of the youth allowance, which is very much an issue for debate out in the public domain at the moment. Not only is it about taking away from young unemployed their entitlement to benefits, but it is also about hiding the unemployed. That is one of the real thrusts about it. They have all of a sudden realised that they are not producing the goods with respect to access to real jobs, so we now have changes to the definition of part&hyphen;time and full&hyphen;time work and the introduction of a new youth allowance which is all about hiding&mdash;from the Department of Social Security's point of view&mdash;the number of young unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time the government faced up to the fact that work for the dole is not a real solution to unemployment. Two days on and five days off does not do a lot for a young person's dignity. What their parents are saying is that they want five days on and two days off. They actually want a definite proposal which requires their young people to front up to a reasonable labour market program with an emphasis on training and a commitment to work; one that really works and achieves the discipline of work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I have not done my mouth stretching exercises yet. I question, however, whether the emphasis should be on the testing of literacy and numeracy rather than on improved teaching of these skills in the earliest years of schooling. I think that is where the emphasis should be, rather than later when perhaps the opportunity to maximise that training is well and truly lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am most concerned about the increased emphasis on non&hyphen;public school funding which threatens to widen the educational gap between the haves and the have&hyphen;nots. I say that as a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5905"> parent quite happy to pay $120,000, or thereabouts, after&hyphen;tax dollars to educate my kids at a non&hyphen;government school. Maybe `happy' is not the word; perhaps `willing' is a better word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that there is an unfair emphasis on supporting the non&hyphen;public sector in education, which will prove detrimental to those who do not enjoy the ability or the privilege to educate their kids. We are going to see that percolating up of opportunity, as we have seen with income distribution, to the top 20 per cent of the population, as has been the case in many overseas developed countries, particularly America and other places. We have a working poor and an educationally impoverished section of the community as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at HECS and Austudy, the more flexible arrangement for the up&hyphen;front payment of HECS and recognition of the increased cost incurred by rural families in sending their children away to study are both commendable steps in the right direction, though I question whether the Austudy changes go far enough. But I will deal with Austudy a touch later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to apprenticeships and traineeships, the $265 million dedicated to creating 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships is welcome, recognising the needs of young people to make the transition from school to work, as well as upskilling the work force in that program. In particular, the establishment of a one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship and trainee shop, like that presently being set up or trialled in Orange through the efforts and the guidance of Email, is very welcome. It should reduce the complexity of the process for both employers and prospective trainees and apprentices. But we are not generating jobs at the end of the day to soak up those people once they are trained and those privileged enough, the cream, who will be able to access those programs. Those who are not the cream of the unemployed will certainly still miss out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not necessarily supporting the workplace programs that the former government had because I think that, apart from some like Skillshare, they were too short and they did not offer much long&hyphen;term hope. I think that we have got to be far more creative in the programs. Work for the dole is only a pittance; it is only a token effort to address the unemployment amongst our youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I warn of the German experience where a country with the best trained work force in the world has unemployment around 12.75 per cent at last count. There the increasing trend is for trainees and apprentices to join the dole queues once they complete their qualification. It is okay to train our young people, but we also have to create real jobs to meet their understandable expectations of continued employment. Although we have reasonable economic growth and low interest rates at the moment, the job market for young people, especially, is extremely tight and, in fact, in regional areas, non&hyphen;existent for some. All the signs are that it will not improve quickly.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of work for the dole, the Premier of Victoria was correct when, on 14 March, he described it in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in condemning it as `crazy and irrelevant for the 21st century'. It is not often that I identify with the Premier of Victoria. I know that he is a very good friend&mdash;if anything, a mate&mdash;of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. But I think he understands that if you are really concerned about getting young people back to work, then you have got to be willing to invest in creating opportunities for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that the young people I meet with on a regular basis in many regions around Australia raise their concerns, from the department's point of view, about many types of issues. Firstly, they are rather concerned about the fact that this government, through its departmental activities, has actually reduced access to labour market training opportunities. The fact that in its recent budget it did not restore the cuts made to labour market programs that were announced last August represents a huge setback in the minds of those young people and, dare I say, their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They then refer to the increasing university fees and the requirement to pay back HECS debts sooner. They take the view that, yes, they are prepared to put their heads down and try their best, but the government should not be putting barriers in the way of creating educational and training opportunities, on the basis of which they desire to pursue real job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They then referred to the overall lack of a budget strategy and the fact that they would have thought the Treasurer's speech on budget night would have referred to the question of jobs and a jobs target as a number one priority. They said that when they actually read the speech they could only find the question of unemployment mentioned on one occasion. They then raised with me, from the department's point of view, the fact that prior to the budget&mdash;in actual fact, in the week prior to the budget&mdash;the Reserve Bank governor and the secretary of Treasury had said that, if you really want a capacity to reduce unemployment in Australia, you have to achieve an economic growth rate of four per cent or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What surprised them was that on budget night they only found a suggested growth rate of the order of 3.75 per cent. So, they really want an explanation from the government. If that is the target or the projection on the question of economic growth, they want an explanation today of where the jobs are going to come from. People at arms&hyphen;length from the government&mdash;the Reserve Bank governor and the secretary of Treasury&mdash;said that you have to achieve four per cent growth or more actually to reduce the level of unemployment. I think it is important today that the ministerial secretary actually outlines where those jobs are going to come from and how a projected growth rate of 3.75 per cent, which is less than that suggested to reduce unemployment by the Reserve Bank and the Treasury, will actually produce the jobs. It is also important to start to identify the regions and the industries in which those jobs are going to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise that because we have finally realised to some extent that, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> said on 14 June, there is a real jobs crisis. Its headline on the first page was `Jobs crisis knocks out another 40,300'. I know we had the 43&hyphen;bean explanation from the minister on that day&mdash;as Mike Gordon, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, referred to&mdash;but I do not know how 43 beans equate to 40,300 additional unemployed in one month. This is what worries young people: the fact that 40,300 disappeared in one month. That is the most recent outcome of the performance of this government on the question of jobs. That is why they ask how it can be said that work  for the dole is going to lead to real jobs, when they see more than 40,000 jobs disappear in one month.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5907">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What worries them even more is that, of those 40,000 plus jobs, 23,000 jobs&mdash;not an insignificant figure for one month&mdash;were full&hyphen;time jobs, and yet the government says that it is making progress on the question of reducing unemployment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, has said the key aims of New Labour's employment strategy are to give young and long&hyphen;term unemployed people new opportunities, help single parents back to work and provide lifelong educational opportunities to help everyone to acquire new skills. Mr Brown promised 250,000 young unemployed people subsidised jobs through a tax rebate of &pound;60 ($135)  a week to employers, involving either a community and voluntary organisation program, or a new environment taskforce. Each of these options for work will offer day&hyphen;release education or training leading to a qualification. Britain's long&hyphen;term unemployed&mdash;those out of work for two years or more&mdash;will be subsidised into work through a &pound;75 a week rebate for employers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Concerning the jobs for the dole issue, I think everybody is missing the point in this debate. While the former government, the current government and governments all around the world are thrashing around for an answer to the unemployment situation, we just have to realise that downsizing, rationalisation, privatisation, technology replacing jobs and the fact that there are no manual jobs out there any more means that we have to find a new definition for work. We have to find what meaningful occupations we can put a lot of these people into in the years ahead because we just cannot provide employment in the traditional sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We keep bashing our heads against the wall accusing each other of lacking any sort of vision in this area. We have to sit down and work out how we are going to soak up these people and whether we can work out jobs programs that are meaningful. They will be part&hyphen;time. They might be two days a week ad infinitum. They might be grafted onto other public programs, but we cannot look at the traditional way of providing jobs as we have done in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will reserve judgment on the government's radical changes to the provision of employment services through the PEPEs and so on. I am sceptical of how the new competitive arrangements will work in regional areas like mine where there are only limited employers looking for young people and where I do not envisage there will be the same level of competition as in the non&hyphen;rural electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, this market&hyphen;driven system will mean that the brokers will target only the cream of the unemployed for their programs, for only they will deliver the bounty on offer at the end of the day. Of course, with the new youth allowance, families with 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old kids cannot afford to keep them. They too will miss out on these training opportunities. Believe me, they will be out on the streets in regional towns and we will have an increase in delinquency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There could also&mdash;and I would hate to support the comment necessarily that Senator Kernot made&mdash;be more youth suicides because of this hopelessness that is out there. I know members of the coalition are concerned about this aspect of the youth allowance. I would ask the government to have a good, hard look at it again because it is going to leave many youths outside the safety net. We cannot just graft our youth back onto the family. It is simplistic nonsense to talk about this wonderful family concept as the answer. It is not the answer. We have dysfunctional families out there and we have got to take cognisance of that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning Austudy, to gauge the nature of public sentiment regarding the operation of Austudy I will quote some constituent letters which the parliamentary secretary should be interested in. This one says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austudy is a nightmare. You need an accountant to fill it in, but if you can't afford one of these you are penalised because you put the wrong answers in the wrong boxes.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just from my own experience, the emotional and financial strain that has been placed on our family makes you realise the enormous amount people have suffered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5909">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I fail to see how a family who qualifies for a low income rebate on tax does not qualify for Austudy. Do any of you live hand to mouth by day? Try it. You are institutionalising a system which will leave people no other option than to try to cheat it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That says it all, and to think that this same test will now be applied across the board in the youth allowance. This test is going to occur despite rulings by at least one member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal stating that the test is doomed to failure unless its whole structure is changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The test is far too complicated for the average person to comprehend. The reliance on estimates of future expenditure is ridiculous. It does not allow for the fluctuating nature of income derived from many rural farms and small businesses. The benchmark in many cases does not line up fairly with PAYE equivalent incomes. The phone service is inadequate, and while I am sure it has caught some of the smarties that it was meant to, the evidence I have seen&mdash;and we have done heaps of surveys in my electorate conducted by my youth officer who has put so much time and effort into this&mdash;is that in some cases it has also discriminated against the very people it was designed to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the government, in its desperation to cut funding outlays, has severely hurt Charles Sturt University in my electorate, and others, with cuts to the Commonwealth industry placement scheme. We all know what the Wood royal commission found about police training and so on. Charles Sturt has 3,000 students. It has lost $10 million in support. It must be restored, not patched up as the government is trying to do with it, it must be restored because this is the sort of study that Charles Sturt is now involved in that is vital to the community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pick up on an issue raised by the member for Calare (Mr Andren). I think there is a capacity to create jobs, and I am talking about real full&hyphen;time jobs. It is not to suggest that we should not be proud of our record, irrespective of who is in government, on the creation of part&hyphen;time jobs because part-time jobs suit the circumstances of some households and individuals or family units. However, it really comes back to the overall budget strategy and your capacity to create real jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of comparison I want to refer to this government's performance in its first 15 months compared to the performance of the Hawke Labor government in its first 15 months. I indicate for the record that in the Labor government's first 15 months, after March 1983, we cut the legacy of 10 per cent unemployment left to us by the then Treasurer and current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to 8.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last Thursday, he has been left with a big ship to turn around on the unemployment front. He appealed for patience and understanding. We also had a big ship to turn around in 1983 in our first 15 months because there was double digit unemployment. We made inroads into unemployment, we reduced it to 8.9 per cent in that first 15 months because we had a strategy that was about economic growth and the creation of jobs. Strangely, in the first 15 months of this government, not only has youth unemployment not fallen, unemployment itself has risen from 8.5 to 8.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the view that what we want to see from the department&mdash;and unfortunately I question the current budget strategy&mdash;is an overall strategy that has a focus on decent labour market programs and the creation of local infrastructure opportunities that can gainfully employ people, especially some of the long&hyphen;term unemployed, but also goes to the question of economic growth. I refer to the fact that we are concerned&mdash;and we are looking for the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5910"> ministerial secretary or apprentice minister's explanation today&mdash;as to how an expected growth rate of 3.75 per cent is actually going to produce those jobs. I hope to see him as the minister one day. I understand he has his eyes on the job of the Minister for Schools and Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), but he wants to be in cabinet, unlike the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go to the need to actually restore expenditure on labour market programs but, perhaps more importantly, I also want to deal with the question of the fall&hyphen;off in growth in apprenticeships and traineeships. At Senate estimates last week it was confirmed that there has been a fall of about 1,000 apprenticeships in the last year. That is despite all the hype about the new modern Australian apprenticeship scheme. I also found it surprising that the growth in traineeships has fallen from 117 per cent in Labor's last year to just 32 per cent in the first 12 months of the Howard government. I suppose that really goes to the question of whether or not you are prepared to restore expenditure on funding for apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent press release titled `Funding for new apprenticeships' the Minister for Schools and Vocational Education and Training sought to portray the government as providing $265 million for 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997&hyphen;98. That is grossly misleading, but I understand that, from time to time, the minister likes to fudge the figures. He has a record for that. He was well known for doing that in some of his academic writings prior to coming into the parliament.</PARA>

It is a real problem that the number of apprenticeships fell in 1996&hyphen;97, despite the government's so&hyphen;called publicity about MAATS and new apprenticeships, and the growth in traineeships fell from that achieved in the last 12 months of the Labor Party compared to the first 12 months of the Howard government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuing my contribution in this debate, I want to say something about the work for the dole program. I would like to put it in the context that certainly we cannot say that it will not do any good&mdash;it may well do some good in some areas&mdash;but we believe it is a second&hyphen;rate program. I believe it is a lazy program where very little thought was put into constructing it in the first place. One of the really great concerns I have about the work for the dole program is that it does not contain any provision for training, nor does it contain any provision for recognition of the skills that may be obtained during the short period of time that these people will be in employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of people have looked at this particular problem, in particular, Richard Sweet from the Dusseldorf Foundation, who recognises that the people who work for the dole will be  people on the fringe of the labour market who, for some period of time, may not actually get into full&hyphen;time employment. These people may well work for a month or a shorter period of time, they may move on to another job or may be unemployed for a while. They may then get into employment but in a different area to where they were before. But as they move
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5911"> through this range of part&hyphen;time work, they are not acquiring any recognition of the skills that they will probably attain during this period of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a great weakness in this program. I appeal to the government to look very closely at recognising the skills that people acquire during this period of training. They should be certified so that, as they move through their working life, they can take these qualifications with them. They should have a certificate which says that they have worked for X period of time in this particular type of work and that they acquired certain skills while doing it. If that weakness in the program is rectified, the unemployed people who go into this program will benefit greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have concerns about other areas of the work for the dole program. It appears to me that the government is taking a fairly pessimistic view of employment growth. I do not think it would have introduced this type of program if it felt that unemployment levels were going to drop. I believe that the government does not have any programs or plans to overcome unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that this scheme was introduced very hastily. It was introduced by the minister through a very short statement. There were many other problems confronting the government at the time. People could be excused for saying that this was a smokescreen to take attention away from some of the government's other problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming from a trade union background, I am concerned about the people who work for the dole. This program will be award free. Their rights will not be protected while they are working. They will not come under the recognised workers compensation provisions, although I understand that there may be some insurance that will protect them if they are injured. Members on this side of the House are concerned that people who work for the dole will not be covered by an appropriate industrial award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, this contrasts very distinctly with the programs of the previous Labor government. People who worked in labour market programs were covered by an appropriate industrial award. I believe this is an attack on the awards system that has protected working&hyphen;class people in this country for many years. Quite clearly, this government is trying to weaken the trade union movement and it is trying to weaken award coverage. Whether it is intended or not in the work for the dole proposal, this is certainly what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, many employer organisations are saying that this program will not make people job ready. For a start, it is for a short period of time&mdash;only two days a week&mdash;and so people will not be conditioned to arrive at work on time, do a good day's work, go home and then come back the next day, and do that on a continuing basis. If people who have been out of work for a period of time are going to get job ready, they need to have continuation of employment. They do not need spasmodic periods, where they work for two days one week and two days the next. I believe that the government is considering the possibility of bringing that all together so that people will work for a full week or for a fortnight, and then maybe have a period of time off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to the issue of youth unemployment. I remind the chamber that Mr Howard said that youth unemployment was the  biggest social problem facing Australia. He went into the election campaign committing himself to doing big things for the young unemployed of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I touch on the question of work for the dole, which will apply, for example, to 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. I have a question for the government: if I am a 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;old and, on the basis of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5912"> announcement going to the issue of youth allowance, based on my parents' household income I am not entitled to unemployment benefits, is there a guarantee that, if I am required to work on a compulsory basis, as suggested by the government, will I receive a payment for that compulsory requirement to participate in the work for the dole program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also raise what I find a strange proposition. I refer in passing to the Green Corps. The Green Corps is very small when compared with the old LEAP program. The majority of participants in Green Corps to date have actually had jobs or been in full&hyphen;time education. I find it strange that at the end of their program they are entitled to an additional allowance of $500 to go on to a further training opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why isn't a similar allowance available, for example, to people who will be compulsorily required to work for the dole? Work for the dole is not going to go to some people who have been fortunate enough in the past to have had jobs or been engaged in full&hyphen;time training or education opportunities. Surely those participants should be encouraged at the end of a compulsory requirement to undertake work for the dole to a grant of, say, $500&mdash;similar to Green Corps&mdash;to go on to a training opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that because, whilst I have serious problems with the question of work for the dole, the value of some of the labour market programs such as LEAP was that that actually gave the young person the opportunity to work themselves out from a personal point of view and to come to terms with their lack of discipline in work and some of the personal difficulties that they had. The time was used by them to actually work out what they wanted to do in the future, such as a traineeship or an apprenticeship. In that context, it is very valuable that they be given some additional assistance or encouragement to go on and take up an alternative training opportunity. We are putting aside the question of the value or otherwise of work for the dole and raising what we should be doing for those people who are going to have the stigma of saying to an employer, `Yes, I am a graduate of work for the dole; two days on, five days off. But would you please put that aside because I really want to do something with my life.' The explanation I am looking for from the government is of when we will get some additional encouragement for those people to actually get some financial assistance to go on to alternative training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that because I think youth unemployment is a major problem. I am vitally concerned with the fact that, after 15 months of this government, not only have they not made a dent in youth unemployment, but youth unemployment has risen in Australia. More importantly, we are getting suburbs and regions of very high youth unemployment. In fact, the national capital, that the Prime Minister has turned his back on as not being good enough as the centre of government any more, is an area of high youth unemployment. Those people out there in the suburbs of Canberra are looking for more than work for the dole and a Green Corps program that largely benefits people in terms of full&hyphen;time jobs or training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say in conclusion that we have got major concerns with the performance of this department but not in isolation. It goes to the whole budget strategy of this government. Unless we get a higher level of economic growth we are not going to make a huge impact on reducing unemployment in Australia. The truth of the matter is that the reduction in interest rates to date, and there have been four reductions, are not a vote of confidence with respect to the performance of this government. I suppose the Reserve Bank is doing what this government has failed to do. They are trying to stimulate some investment and encouragement out there. They have finally realised that they should not just be concerned about building on our
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5913"> achievements from the point of view of breaking the back of inflation. They have come to terms with the fact that the Treasurer is wrong to focus just on the question of the rate of inflation and they must be vitally concerned with the issue of unemployment. We have an all&hyphen;time high. We have also a deterioration I might say in terms of long&hyphen;term unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank all members who participated in the debate this morning because I think that it has been more constructive than these debates sometimes are. Perhaps this is the nature of the committee stage of debate. I do have a few comments to make. Naturally, all members on this side of the House share the concern of all members on that side of the House about the unemployment problem. It is, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has frequently said both before and after the election, the most serious problem that Australia faces. I am prepared to attribute good faith to members opposite and I hope members opposite are prepared to attribute good faith to members of the government on this subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, as a member of the government I am concerned that after 15 months the unemployment problem is not appreciably better than it was at the time of the election. I am concerned, as members opposite are concerned&mdash;we are all concerned. The Prime Minister is concerned. One of the reasons the Prime Minister is in England is to talk to the British Prime Minister and then later when he goes to America to the American President about their options for tackling this very problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing does slightly disappoint me about members opposite. They are quite properly drawing attention to the fact that after 15 months of this government the situation is not markedly different, at least in terms of the statistics, but after 13 years of their government, where were we at? In the 13 years of the recent Labor government, unemployment never dropped below six per cent and averaged over eight per cent. Their government presided over a great deal of restructuring in the private sector and public sector, all of which resulted in job losses. Full&hyphen;time jobs only rose by 7,000 between 1991 and 1996, at the same time as the former government ran up government debt of $75 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like from members opposite is a little bit more fair&hyphen;mindedness and appreciation that the level of unemployment is a difficulty, tragedy and disaster that many governments in many countries are grappling with. There are no magic wands, there are no quick fixes. If there were magic wands and quick fixes, does anyone think that they wouldn't have been applied long before now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, the government's strategy to reduce unemployment has four basic elements.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, we want to make the overall economy more buoyant and the very considerable interest rate reductions that we have seen are at the heart of that strategy. Surely we should get some credit at least for putting in place fiscal conditions that made it easier for the Reserve Bank to allow those reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labour market flexibility is very important. I want to stress that this government is not about reducing wages, this government is about increasing wages. What we want to see is the ability  of workers to work more productively and the ability of workers and managers to work productively together so that businesses are more productive. Better training and better education are a very important part of the government's strategy. I will touch on that in a few
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5914"> moments when I respond to some of the comments of the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) about apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there are some important structural changes that we are putting in place. Work for the dole is an important structural change because we are trying to establish the principle that people ought to be prepared to give something back in return for the support that society gives them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the comments of members opposite that the work for the dole scheme does not involve anything like the formal training that many of the former government's labour market programs involved. But the fact is that members opposite did not oppose the work for the dole scheme when it went through the House. I really think that great indignation from them is slightly phoney, given that they did not oppose it when it went through the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance changes are also a very important part of changing the culture of this nation. What we are saying with our changes to the benefit situation for people aged 16 to 18 is that they really should be in education or training. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take up a couple of questions raised by the ministerial secretary. In passing, I might refer to the Reuter's poll of this week. It touches on the question of interest rates and suggests there is about a 60 per cent view that there will be a further half per cent reduction in interest rates. It really relates to whether or not it represents confidence in the government's strategy to date, because this is what this poll says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thursday's May labour force data shocked the economic forecasting community. The typical economist now sees a 60 per cent probability of the Reserve Bank effecting another interest rate cut, compared to 35 per cent a couple of weeks ago. That really is made in the context of the unemployment problem that this government has created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also looking for an explanation from the government about whether or not the department was really comprehensively consulted by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on the recent announcement going to the immigration intake. What surprises and concerns me is that at a time when the government is trying to argue to the Australian community that it has reduced the migration intake because of the high level of unemployment, in its first 15 months it has in fact increased independent skilled migration by 50 per cent. As we all appreciate, that independent skilled migration group is the untargeted and not matched group with skills and labour market shortages. I raise that because at the same time the government has slashed $269 million from vocational and industry training programs and more than $2 billion out of jobs programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think it is important that there are ongoing and regular discussions between this department and the department of immigration on matching the skilled requirements of this great nation and the migration intake. What concerns me is that at the time that we have increased the independent skilled migration, the untargeted and not matched program, by 50 per cent, we have got a cut in government employment in these first two budgets of 28,000 jobs, many of which are in regional Australia. There are 8,000 Defence jobs to go. I suggest that jobs will also go as a result of the program of competitive tendering of information technology. There are 700 meat inspectors jobs to go as a result of the AQIS decisions of this budget. Then we have potential job losses of 12,000 as a result of changes to pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5915">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important process currently under way in this chamber. It is important that we raise questions and queries with a view to trying to get a better understanding of the issues and also to make suggestions about how current programs can be improved. That is why I raised the question of whether, in considering work for the dole&mdash;and we moved a series of amendments to improve it, which is not acknowledged by the government today, because we seriously questioned the value of that proposal&mdash;another proposal could be considered for a training grant of $500 at the end of work for the dole, similar to that received by people who participate and graduate from the Green Corps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are out there arguing that and, considering the issue of unemployment, that you also base your immigration intake on that now, what comprehensive discussions did or did not occur and what were the issues that were put forward by this department with respect to influencing the government's decision on immigration and the argument that it has been reduced because of the high level of unemployment and the deterioration in employment in Australia as a result of the first 15 months of this government's performance? That is vitally important, because from a bottom line point of view the real problem is that the budget hardly talks about the issue of jobs. It is mentioned once in the speech by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). There is no real job target, as ACCI suggested this week, of six per cent. All the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) can talk about is a cup of Nescafe and being patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 43&hyphen;bean solution is inadequate. People are concerned about the loss of 40,300 jobs in one month. We want explanations, not pie in the sky statements that the government is concerned about unemployment, at the same time that it says that people ought to be patient and that 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds should no longer be entitled to unemployment relief if their parents have a household income of $41,500. I would like to see the apprentice minister ring up kids, including kids who are 18 to 20 years of age, and deny them unemployment relief, because I tell you what, he would have a few troubles at home. It is hard enough to negotiate with your kids about pocket money at the moment, let alone saying to 18&hyphen;to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds that they are not entitled to unemployment relief because mum and dad have to bring up a couple more kids. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The problem with the former government's policy was that it had young Australians sitting in the pinball parlours and the video parlours of our inner cities. I do not pretend for a moment that that is what members opposite intended, but that was what their policy allowed and that is what our policy is going to prevent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem with the former government's policy was that the former government's policy gave people an economic incentive to go out of education and onto unemployment benefits. By equalising the conditions under which people get this allowance, we are ensuring that there is no disincentive to study. Surely that is a good thing. It is a good thing that there is no disincentive for people to get out of education and get onto the dole. Encouraging people, young people especially, to be on the dole is simply not on, and that is why this government

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EZ5">Mr ABBOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. One of the other issues that the honourable member for Batman raised was the Green Corps. He made the observation that only 50 per cent, or thereabouts, of the Green Corps participants so far were formerly unemployed, and that is true. I do not regard that as a problem because there is a difference between the Green Corps and labour market programs. Green Corps is not a labour market program; Green Corps is a youth environmental program. He is really, I think, comparing an apple with an orange. Green Corps is a different program, and I have got to say that it is an excellent program. So far, people who have been involved with the Green Corps and were previously involved with program such as LEAP, believe that Green Corps has taken the LEAP experience and built on it to produce a much better program. The whole point about Green Corps is that everyone who is in a Green Corps team is a volunteer, whereas, the people who were in LEAP were essentially conscripts, and that has produced a very different temper and ethos amongst the participants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Batman wanted to know about consultation between the immigration department and the department of employment over changes to the skilled migration rate. As far as I am aware, the normal consultations that go on between departments on these matters did go on. I do not see that there is a problem with bringing people into this country as independent skilled migrants because the fact is they are supposed to come in under that category only if there is work for them. Obviously, if there is work for people, there is no reason that they should not be brought in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding these comments prompted by the contribution of the honourable member of Batman, let me just say again that I think there is a real problem today when we have members opposite running around increasing the gloom and despair felt by some people in Australia. These are difficult times for many Australians. No&hyphen;one pretends otherwise. We have not entered an economic nirvana, just as we were not in an economic nirvana for the 13 years of the former government. But the fact is that every time we have outrageous and patently ridiculous statements from people like the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), it makes the problem worse. If their feeling for Australia was practical as well as theoretical, their contribution would be a lot more constructive than the sort of loud&hyphen;mouthed effort that we have got from them today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that I should take up the obvious self&hyphen;deception of the parliamentary secretary in relation to two matters that he has spoken about. The first point is about school participation. The suggestion that has been put forward by this  government is that it has some form of policy mortgage on the idea that young Australians should seek to better their educational opportunities rather than to be placed on unemployment
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5917"> benefits. The reality is that the period when Australia saw the greatest growth in participation at secondary and tertiary education was during the last 13 years of a Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before that period, participation rates nationally were below any international comparisons. We had literally thousands of our best and brightest people unable to go past year 10 in their education&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MELHAM" NAMEID="4T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr Melham</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rates were below 30 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were below 30 per cent. Thousands were without a framework to enable them to go on into higher education, into post&hyphen;secondary education through the technical and further education system and the universities. What the former government did was to radically transform the pattern of youth education in this country. A great majority of young people now complete year 12 education, and the participation levels through tertiary and post&hyphen;secondary education have massively increased. But there will still be those who complete their education at year 10. There is no way that this nation is going to have a system whereby all Australians will benefit from participating in education past year 10. That is the reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A failure to provide any employment opportunities for those people is the charge we sheet home to this government. In the past, when it was in opposition, the government criticised us for putting in place labour market programs which had a significant training component, saying that that was shifting people from the unemployment market and into `mickey mouse' schemes, as it described them, in order to take them out of the unemployment statistics. But those so&hyphen;called mickey mouse schemes all had elements of training to increase people's employability and job readiness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is now doing is putting in place an economic regime that simply says, `We will park you in the education system which is already bursting at the seams, notwithstanding that there is no discernible benefit that you will achieve and that there is certainly a disbenefit to the overall participation rates of those who would go on into tertiary and secondary education, because they could have got some benefit from it. We will park in the system all you people for whom that system will contribute no benefit at all, and that is the only way that you are going to receive any support from this government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that they shift people who are genuinely seeking employment across from the job search task into fruitless educational endeavour, they will take people off the unemployment lists. This is a way of disguising long&hyphen;term and short&hyphen;term unemployment amongst Australia's youth. For an opposition that had said that national unemployment amongst youth was a disgrace, what they are doing now in government is avoiding any responsibility whatsoever. What are they going to say? My colleague the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) made the point that, in Tasmania, there are going to be some 700 people who will now go into the already bulging high schools, in circumstances where there is nothing to give them any net advantage&mdash;simply because that will be their only way of gaining any income support. This is an outrageous and wrong approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would make about the independent category in migration is that Parliamentary Secretary Abbott simply misunderstands. There is no requirement for an independent applicant to demonstrate any employment need in this country whatsoever. The rest of the labour market programs require that; and what we have said is that the independent category should be scrapped and that all skilled migration should be linked to labour market needs in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am encouraged into this debate by the rubbish that has been spoken by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), because the facts speak for themselves. The former Labor government had a proud history over 13 years. The retention rate in schools doubled from over 30 per cent to over 70 per cent by the time our period in government was finished. The former Whitlam government's performance in higher education, in creating opportunities for those who did not have the money, was second to none. That is why I joined the Labor Party. I was one of 10 children. I got my university education, courtesy of the vision of the Whitlam Labor government, which opened up the universities. It is the role of government to create opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in just over 13 months of this government is that this is a government for the rich. It is not about creating opportunities. This is a government that leaves people to their own devices and says, `Oh, governments should not be involved in the marketplace,' but then it imposes its morality on the public. That is what you have got in store for the 16&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;year olds. That is your view of the family&mdash;your view of the path that they should take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government was a government that did not divide the communities, that had a safety net. Thatcher and Major were subsequently rejected in Great Britain. At a time when Mother England has rejected the Tories, the colonies have embraced them. At a time when America has rejected Reagan and Bush, poor old Australia has embraced the Tories. Why? Because after 13 years, they forgot what it was like to be under a Tory government. But we know what a Howard government will be like. What was John Howard's record in his period in the Fraser government as Treasurer in relation to this area? In relation to unemployment, it left us with unemployment at over 10 per cent. That is what we were left with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our period in government created opportunities in a changing work force in a changing society. The problem with your Prime Minister and your government is that you hark back to the old days. That is what we find offensive about this budget and these proposals. The old days have gone forever. You are not going to make people `comfortable and relaxed' in relation to this budget and what you have brought down. What you have done is betray the young people, on whose misery you piggybacked into government, offering them hope. That is what this part of the budget is. It is a betrayal of what you promised these people. You will be judged on your record. After just over 13 months, you do not deserve re&hyphen;election. This is a policy that is backward looking, that is insular looking and one that does not recognise the changes in our society that have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Lyons Forum is controlling this government. Your former adviser, where is he? The one who made the changes to Abstudy, where is he? You picked up his changes. He drafted your policy on Abstudy and what did you do? You picked it up and ran with it and where is he now? On the staff of the member for Oxley (Mrs Hanson). You criticise the member for Oxley, but what you do is ride on her coat&hyphen;tails. She is your creation. She is your leader's creation. The policies that you implement in this area are policies that she would embrace and endorse. It is a backward looking government and the people will finally and eventually wake up to you. In the end, what you preach is not what is going to happen out there in the  community. This policy will result in greater misery, in greater suffering and in greater pressure on the youth and families of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take up an issue referred to by the parliamentary secretary in his reference to the importance of Green Corps and the fact that it is a voluntary scheme for those who have got jobs or an education. I think the real problem is that he does not understand at the moment the biggest problem the Australian community confronts is the issue of getting jobs for those who are unemployed and those who lack a sense of job security in their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Green Corps might be all right in a time of high unemployment. The issue today is getting jobs for the unemployed. The issue today is not taking unemployment benefits off 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds; it is actually creating real jobs. He says, `Yes, they are volunteers.' It is strange that you reward volunteers with a training levy of $500 but you say to the unemployed, especially the long&hyphen;term unemployed, that all we can offer for you is work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of us cut our teeth opposing the coalition government's approach to compulsion with respect to conscription in Vietnam. We were not going to be thrown in as cannon fodder for Vietnam, nor are we going to accept in this day and age that young unemployed people ought to cop the stigma of work for the dole with no hope at the end of that compulsory program. Those programs that we pursued, such as LEAP, were especially important for regional Australia. I think the parliamentary secretary owes this chamber an explanation as to why unemployment in 77 per cent of rural and regional Australia is worse off as a result of the performance of this government in its first 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those communities embraced and supported decent labour market programs, such as New Work Opportunities and LEAP, but I suppose he needs to be reminded how desperate it is out there. He ought to start talking to his coalition mates in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, the people who cover the areas of Lismore, Coffs Harbour, Taree, Tweed Heads, Grafton and Port Macquarie, because unemployment in that region this week is 14.5 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the black spots of Victoria; the government likes to talk about black spots.

Let us go to the Gippsland region. We know the minister does not like to spend a lot of time in Gippsland; he finds it more attractive to stay in East Melbourne. What is the unemployment rate in the Gippsland region? It is 12.9 per cent compared to March 1996 when it was 9.2 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do intend to try to give explanations to as much as is capable of explanation in the various accusations and interjections from those members opposite. One important issue that the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) raised earlier was this whole question of apprenticeships and traineeships. I am advised by the department that apprentice and trainee commencements were 67,900 in 1994&hyphen;95, 85,100 in 1995&hyphen;96 and are estimated to have been 94,500 in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also draw to the attention of the member for Batman the advice I have received from the department that in this government's budgets for 1996&hyphen;97 and 1997&hyphen;98 Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training totals $1.354 billion, compared with an expenditure of only $1.2 billion when the Labor Party was in government. These figures, I am advised, show that the government has increased its allocation on vocational education and training by $144 million, or almost 12 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now wish to return to some of the more general comments that the member for Batman and other members opposite have made. As I have said, there is no easy answer to the unemployment problem. The socialistic answers of the 1970s failed. The ultra&hyphen;market solutions that were tried by the former government in the 1980s were disappointingly slow to work. Obviously, what the new government is moving towards is, if you like, a new paradigm which builds on the strengths of the market but which does not expect it to do everything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question that I really should pose to the member for Batman and other members opposite is: what is the Labor Party's answer to these problems? Over 13 years, as I said, unemployment averaged over eight per cent. So, plainly, the answers opposite were not so brilliant. The member for Batman seems to be suggesting that we should resurrect Working Nation, with all its $2 billion a year expense. Is the shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans) going to provide the member for Batman with $2 billion? Can the member for Batman guarantee that should he be whisked magically onto the government benches, that he would have an extra $2 billion to spend on this? Is that the kind of guarantee that the member for Batman can give,  because if he cannot give that guarantee, he is exposed as a phoney, as someone who waxes self&hyphen;righteous in opposition but does nothing in government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5921">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the answers that the member for Batman has? So far, the only answer that the member for Batman has come up with is the idea of job sharing. Job sharing was described as a ludicrous and nonsensical solution by his colleague&mdash;and, I dare say friend, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), his rival for the leadership of the national left faction.

They point out that after February 1998 they will experience negative cash flows for at least three months until payments for the employment services provided are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They say that, having had to operate as not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit organisations, skillshares do not have any cash reserves, let alone substantial ones. It is little surprise against that background that the Royal Western Australian Institute for the Blind has made the decision that it is unable to underwrite the temporary negative cash flow&mdash;at this stage estimated to be in the range of $45,000 to $70,000&mdash;and this leads to a scenario of the pin being pulled on Maylands skillshare. As they point out, it will be repeated with many skillshare organisations all around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I and a number of other members of parliament have also received correspondence from the north&hyphen;east employment project where they have talked about Dr David Kemp's plan to spend $200 million on school based employment programs. They pose this question: is there any way in which Dr Kemp might be persuaded that effective, efficient not&hyphen;for&hyphen; profit organisations already exist, at least in Victoria, to do exactly the job for which he proposes reinventing the wheel?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is exactly right. The abandonment of the CES&mdash;or the carve&hyphen;up of the CES&mdash;in my view will lead to a disaster in terms of employment placement at the very time this community can least afford it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After he left my employ, I asked for a check to be made of his mobile phone calls. It became apparent that he had made dozens of phone calls on a departmental mobile phone, going back to late last year, to the member for Oxley and to David Ettridge. Obviously, these had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with his duties as my staff member. They had absolutely nothing to do with his role in helping to liaise between the department and me. I wrote two letters to the departmental secretary seeking the investigation of those phone calls and seeking the recovery of any costs that were incurred that were not properly attributable to his work for me. I believe that those investigations are continuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not long after he left my office, I was contacted by David Thomas, a former employee of the member for Oxley, who let me know that while my former staffer was employed by me he had attended some functions which again had absolutely nothing to do with his employment by me or his work in liaising with the department, but had everything to do with the moonlighting he had been doing for the member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also written to the Department of Administrative Services seeking an investigation of one trip and one section of another trip, because again I am absolutely determined to ensure that no costs will be incurred by the taxpayers for activities which helped to enable my former staffer to assist the member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the behaviour of my former staffer is hugely embarrassing for me and for the local Liberal Party, but it is also a real problem for the member for Oxley. The member for Oxley has taken onto her staff someone with so little sense of propriety, someone with so little sense of discretion about the use of government resources that he was prepared to use those government resources quite freely in ways which had nothing to do with his work for me as the member for Warringah, nothing to do with his work for the electors of Warringah, and nothing whatsoever to do with his work for the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, information provided by David Thomas suggests that not only did he do this when he was working for me but now that he is working for the member for Oxley, even though he is employed by her in her capacity as an independent member of parliament, he is working full&hyphen;time on the establishment of the One Nation Party. This strikes me as being at odds with the spirit, if not the letter, of the provisions under which independent members get an extra staff entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very serious issues for the member for Oxley here. She preaches restraint in the use of government funds, but it is hard to see that it is being practised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things of substance that has not emerged in this discussion about these changes to support for young unemployed people is what they will do in terms of the shift between public and private education. The truth is that you inject large numbers of people into an education system where they know they are going to get no benefit, save that that is their only means of having income support and the only way in which their families can sustain their children with any form of commitment. The unemployment circumstances are such that they cannot find employment and this government is going to refuse them the opportunities to seek employment and to improve their employability through labour market programs or access to unemployment benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you force those unwilling participants into an already overcrowded state education system, then people will naturally say that that will degrade that state education system. They will not be going into private education because they do not have the means. The only sector of the education system they will be able to access is the already overcrowded and underfunded state education system. That will then carry the baggage of unwilling participants. Teachers will be baby&hyphen;sitting large numbers of people who will be getting no benefit and whose parents know they are getting no benefit. Those who wish to participate to gain benefit out of the education system will increasingly have to choose to fund their children's education in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as the natural damage that is occurring to Australia's families, we will get the pressure that this will place on family breakdown and the consequences it will mean for the impoverishment of many families who will not wish to force their children into this stupid position. As well as that, we will find that it will degrade the state education systems around Australia. Years 11 and 12 will be carrying unwilling, unwelcome participants. They will be therefore unattractive to people who have the funds to escape from those systems. They will move into the private education system. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, we get a two&hyphen;tier system of education where you get quality education only if you pay for it. Of course, that is being matched with a funding regime that increasingly benefits those newly established independent schools. Schools will be established in places where there is no check that they will not damage the participation of the public educational sector and where the transfer costs, as they emerge, will gut the effectiveness of the public education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are actually doing is trying to hide unemployment. This government is trying to hide unemployment by shifting it into forcing people into years 11 and 12 education when we, as the former government, had already increased participation to a degree which was hitherto unknown in Australia. We were actually getting people going through higher education. Now we will force unwilling participants, who will not be capable of benefiting from it, into that system. That will degrade that public education system. It will continue the transfer and shift of people out of public education into private education. A class&hyphen;ridden outcome, where wealth dictates your success in life, emerges as the likely outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what you can predict as a result of these very stupid changes. The only motivating factor that underlies them is a desire to obscure the fact that this government has nothing to offer to young Australians, who they bleated about before the last election as being their object of primary concern. Before the last election, the high rate of unemployed in that sector who were not participating in the education system was identified as this government's number one priority.</PARA>

It is not designed to increase job readiness. They will park them there, they will degrade that system's effectiveness, and they will increase the shift of people from the public sector to the private sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the most recent intervention by the parliamentary secretary and I can understand his feelings about treachery with respect to his former assistant, Mr Oldfield. He has raised very serious allegations today going to the operation of the parliament and the system of assistance, both to government and to the opposition, with respect to their staff. In that context, it is exceptionally important that he actually tables the correspondence that he has sent to the department setting out his allegations, so that the parliament at large and the Australian public understand the types of allegations he has detailed and required the department to investigate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only fair because I think that there is a genuine desire on both sides of the House at the moment to ensure full and proper parliamentary accountability with respect to the use of parliamentary entitlements. In that context, I fully appreciate why the parliamentary secretary is, if anything, really a little bit emotional with respect to these issues. I would feel the same way if it had occurred to me. So, I suggest that today, or at some date that is possible, the details of the allegations as set out in his correspondence be tabled because I think the parliament wants to know what is really at the bottom of this. The allegations that he has made today do not just go to his own staff; they also go to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to touch briefly on questions raised by the parliamentary secretary relating to an overall budget strategy. I appreciate that there is no quick&hyphen;fix on the issue of jobs. It is fair to say that both houses have different approaches but, from the Labor Party's point of view, it is appropriate that we detail what we regard as an appropriate strategy. It is a debate about ideas and not a question of a bottomless pit and throwing money at the unemployed. It goes to your capacity to generate economic growth&mdash;and I point the finger and suggest that a projected level of economic growth of 3.5 per cent is inadequate. That is not just my view; it is also the view of the Reserve Bank governor and the secretary of Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also suggest that economic growth alone is not necessary. It goes to government policy and to whether you have industry and regional policy&mdash;and I am pleased to say that the government actually embraced our automotive plan. We have paved the way and forced reform at an international level with respect to the globalisation of the economy and changes, for example, on the tariff front. But enough was enough. It was appropriate that both sides of the House came together on the Labor Party's industry plan for the automotive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it extends beyond the automotive industry to a range of other industries. It then goes to the question of regional Australia. You need to intervene and assist in regional Australia. It also raises the question of services to regional Australia. If you care about jobs, it is not smart to sack 28,000 public servants in the first two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That takes me to the final aspect of a program, having touched on briefly the issue of a trade policy. We have a pool of long&hyphen;term unemployed. Unfortunately, more and more of those  people are in particular suburbs and regions. You have to have targeted decent labour market programs that you are prepared to invest in to try and get those people job ready, back into
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5926"> the discipline of work and back to work. We are prepared to debate the ideas. There is no quick&hyphen;fix, but you have got to have a strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this government, I dare to suggest, is that it does not have a job strategy. It has a mind&hyphen;set which extends beyond a role for government actually intervening and getting its hands dirty. It should be trying to facilitate, to push and prod, to attract investment, to create jobs and also to deliver those vital labour market programs that are so important to get people back into the discipline of work so that they have a capacity to change employers' attitudes to ensure that the employers finally accept that those people who could have been forgotten are worthy of employment. That is what it is about. We should not push them aside and forget them. We have to intervene and assist and invest in their future. They are worthy of employment; they deserve a second go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Green Corps is wrong. The majority of places have gone to people in employment and/or education. Our responsibility&mdash;that is, the responsibility of the parliament as a whole, irrespective of policy differences&mdash;is to accept that there is a role for government in assisting those people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will follow up on a couple of matters that emerged in relation to the comments of the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). It is not merely a matter, I would suggest, of referring matters in relation to the former employee for investigation and assessment. This is analogous to the situation that emerged in West Germany before East and West Germany merged, where it was discerned that Willy Brandt, when Chancellor, had had on his staff as one of his closest advisers a person who was working for and reporting to the East German authorities. When that fact was discerned, it was a matter not merely of how that had come to occur, what responsibility there was and what prosecution or action could be taken against that former employee who had betrayed the trust, but also of how the supervision and the character judgment of Willy Brandt was such as to have allowed that person to remain in that office for such a period of time and to carry on that activity under the nose of a person in Brandt's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are questions that actually go to Parliamentary Secretary Abbott's capacity, responsibility, supervision and management of his office. There is also the question of the degree to which he, ministers, other parliamentary secretaries and other members of the coalition parties may in fact have contributed to the situation through their failure to scrutinise the work that was being undertaken and also the character of, and the nature of the  responsibilities being pursued by, people in their employment who were actually working for a social force that has properly been characterised now by the Prime Minister as analogous
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5927"> to the kind of disruptive force that has emerged in other countries to the great detriment of their social cohesion. That situation was occurring under the watch of the parliamentary secretary, and we do not know whether similar practices are occurring with respect to any other coalition members, parliamentary secretaries or ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This goes also to a further question relating to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). If she was knowingly the beneficiary of work that was being performed by somebody who was on the payroll of another member of parliament, and if she was drawing from that a benefit to which she was not entitled, that is plainly analogous to a form of corruption of the process. It is a form of corruption because it goes to taking that which you know you are not entitled to&mdash;by reason of the fact that it was being paid for in order to be supportive of, in this case, the parliamentary secretary at the table. It is analogous to drawing from another member of parliament part of their postal entitlement or any other entitlement to which you yourself are not entitled. So, there are questions that go to the knowledge and the participation of those in the office of the member for Oxley. Those are fundamentally important questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has the parliamentary secretary asked that those matters also be pursued? If not, why not? Why have those matters not been sought to be put to the test? I would also ask the parliamentary secretary why his judgment of the character of those working for him was so remiss. What steps did he put in place to select people who were fit to occupy the office that he entrusted them to hold within his staff? It is not a matter you can brush off by saying, `These people betrayed me.' From what the parliamentary secretary has indicated to date, there plainly was a long history of deceit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was it that was so slack about his management of his office? What steps are in place to ensure that this does not happen in other circumstances where there may be people who are actually letting down those who have placed trust in them? What are the staffing processes that those in ministerial and other executive positions, including parliamentary secretaries, undertake to make certain that they are not appointing people to positions of high responsibility who will, as occurred in Germany, betray them. When that occurred in Germany, the criticism fell on Willy Brandt for his failure to manage his office, as much as it did on the betrayal of those on his staff. There are two questions there: what were the circumstances whereby your scrutiny of your own office was so deficient; and, secondly, what steps, if any, have you asked to be undertaken with respect to the member for Oxley's participation? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Denison (Mr Kerr) does raise two important issues. The sad truth is that it is impossible to control what members of one's staff do in their own time and outside of one's own office. I think I can give the chamber an assurance that none of the misdeeds of my former staff member took place in my office, certainly not in office hours, for the simple reason that it is an open plan office and anything untoward would immediately have been noticed by the other staff members who were sitting around him. The misdeeds took place out of the office and on the mobile phone, to the best of my knowledge, and I think I can reasonably make the assumption that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison also says, `How on earth could I have possibly employed this person?' Yes, that is also a fair question. All I say in my defence is that this individual was able to persuade a majority of a Liberal Party preselection panel&mdash;and it was not in a hard  luck seat which no&hyphen;one wants to run in, like Oxley, but a state seat which was traditionally a Liberal seat. It was a hotly contested preselection, he emerged victorious and I guess I took

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To enable this matter to conclude, may I raise the issue of what process does apply with respect to character checks of staff being employed by the executive? As minister for justice under the former government, I am aware, because I had some managerial and supervisory role in relation to this, that staff were required to be vetted not merely by those who recommended their appointment in the first place but ultimately, including when security issues and other issues were of concern, by officers of ASIO, for example, in relation to security vetting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were checks that were built into the employment system. I acknowledge, with respect to the former government, that there were occasions between the appointment process and the completion of those checks when those vetting processes were not taking place. But those checks would deal with associates and a whole range of other issues and would go to character and a whole associated raft of issues. I wonder whether, if not necessarily now, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) could take on notice whether or not those same arrangements still apply, and, if not, what arrangements are in place to ensure that mistakes are not made simply because somebody has a seemingly good public reputation yet may have participated in a way which could ultimately be very damaging to the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is simply an interest where your political interests have been damaged significantly because of that betrayal. But, potentially, a failure to assess the character and fitness for service of an employee of the executive could have much more significant security and other national consequences were that betrayal not to another political party but, for example, to another nation.

The government's forecast of economic growth in the budget is at 3.75 per cent. It is that that concerns me with the government's attitude and the parliamentary secretary's attitude, `Let's have a bit of patience. Let's wait, things will get better,' but 3.75 per cent growth is not enough to pick up newcomers to the marketplace into job opportunities. In our last couple of years of government we exceeded those growth rates. That is why this government piggybacked in on young people's fear of job opportunities that they thought were vanishing.  They were looking forward to a government that had promised them that they would address the issue of youth unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have had is a government in the last 15 months that is like a rabbit under the spotlight. They do not know which way to jump; they are frozen. We have had a number of interest rate cuts and the government says, `Oh, isn't this terrific.' The interest rate cuts that have occurred are a vote of no confidence in this government. They are interest cuts that have occurred because the economy is comatose. It is like a corpse and the interest rate cuts have been applied by the Reserve Bank to try and breathe life back into the economy, to try and kickstart building opportunities, housing opportunities and to create work opportunities. That of itself is not going to be enough to bring down the levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the budget figures themselves that are the cause for doom and gloom on my part and on the parts of other commentators. This government is not addressing this issue and it will not get better. They have a hands&hyphen;off approach&mdash;the previous Labor government had a hands&hyphen;on approach. We had a situation where there were external factors that affected unemployment. I can remember making my first speech in September 1990 and talking about the 1.7 million jobs that were created by the Labor Party until that time. That is when unemployment went bad as a result of external factors and other factors such as the TCF policy, the lowering of tariff barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has the opportunity to learn from some of those mistakes. But what do they do? It is a hands&hyphen;off approach. The only intervention that this government engages in is intervention against indigenous Australians. Instead of allowing the marketplace to rule and the rule of law and the Native Title Act that allows miners and Aborigines the right to negotiate, they want to intervene to take away the limited rights that the High Court gave them. They are interventionists against Aborigines, but they are not interventionists when it comes to creating job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the problem&mdash;the budget figures nail the lie, they nail the myth. Employment opportunities are not going to get better under this government. The growth is not enough. That is why you need intervention. The very areas that are suffering are the areas that voted for you overwhelmingly. Regional Australia is haemorrhaging&mdash;it is bleeding. Towns are closing. You cannot take away the tax office and all these other offices and you cannot rip 28,000 public servants out of the system and expect the system to pick up the slack. There is a multiplier effect, a knock&hyphen;on effect. That is why people now are starting to get alarmed. They are still reserving their judgment because there is enormous goodwill out there for this government. But when it sinks in that what has happened is a betrayal of the hopes and aspirations that were promised to them in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election, that is when you will see the shift. But that is of no comfort to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do need labour market programs. Working Nation was a successful program. The training programs were beneficial. Money spent on skillshare in my area saw 65 and 70 per cent outcomes in terms of job opportunities for people. Skillshare is a successful organisation. It has a great track record. You should be encouraging it. You should be opening up skillshare offices, not closing them down. I lost a CES in my area: that is what is happening.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating the estimates for this portfolio and especially in the discussions concerning unemployment, there is a need to stress the locational  disparity of the unemployment figures. That needs to be stressed to this government because it does not seem to acknowledge that that is the case. It is not only the absolute figures that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5930"> we are concerned with, the fact that there has been an inability by the government to reduce unemployment, but also the fact that on a regional basis, as has been outlined by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), in areas such as rural Victoria there has been increasing unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the unemployment figures in a region like mine, which I share with the member for Batman and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), and although the figures are not sufficiently disaggregated easily, we know that long&hyphen;term unemployment is increasing. Traditionally, in a region like the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, that has been a factor within the unemployment figures, that the long&hyphen;term unemployed in the region that we represent is great. Also, if you look at the figures that are supplied by the Bureau of Statistics you will see that in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne that female unemployment has increased by a large amount recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am trying to do by highlighting those factors is get the government to understand that it just cannot have a broad brush approach to the problems of unemployment. I also want to say that those programs that have not yet wound down, and those programs that are applauded by people like the Minister for Schools (Dr Kemp), are targeting areas where there is already a good labour market. They do not target areas where there are disadvantaged, unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You find that when you have things like the pathways programs going into schools, that that has been targeted to areas where it is for the easy outcomes. It is in areas where the labour market is in a more healthy condition than it is in other areas. There appears to be this tendency to put the programs in where they can get the easy mark. There does not appear to be a willingness to develop programs that are going to attack unemployment in regional areas such as the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There the problems of unemployment have been very severe for a long time, and there the problems have been exacerbated by the opening up of the economy to international factors. Things like tariff reductions have already had a dramatic effect there. That is why schemes like special assistance to people involved in the passenger motor vehicle industry and in TCF were so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area I represent we had both those industries as major employers. The dramatic effects of tariff reductions have been felt, and there is a need to target those people who are losing jobs in those industries. That is a feature that over the last year and a bit we have lost. This government is unable to understand that we should be maximising outcomes to ensure that unlike the United Kingdom and unlike the United States we do not see this continuing marginalisation of large areas of the nation. That is what will happen unless we attack and target areas of greatest disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not have that as one of our primary reasons for putting in place programs it will lead to the same problems of social dislocation and all the other matters that we see highlighted in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. I implore the ministers and the parliamentary secretary, who has been good enough to stay for this long debate, to have a look at these matters. They are important, and the government needs to be looking at ways in which it can at least give hope to people who are finding it difficult to find  employment, and to areas that are going to be in even more difficulty unless they get this type of assistance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since first coming to this place I have been very conscious of the need to lend my support to try to simplify or change federal laws or regulations that are inappropriate, unworkable or not working the way they were intended. Although this first matter perhaps pertains to the Treasurer's portfolio I want to mention that, and I have stated this before, the laws in relation to child support are the worst examples of legislation that can truly be called an ass, and I am sure a majority of members would agree with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why haven't we reformed the punitive, mentally destroying formula for setting non&hyphen;custodial payments? They are cruel and destructive in many cases, and I am sure other members would have cases on their files and would agree. It is an absolute disgrace that the previous government and now this one have not treated reform of this area with the urgency it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about making apologies for the stolen children episode of our history, and yet here today we have a federal act that is causing similar pain and disruption to many families&mdash;particularly children&mdash;and no apparent sense of urgency to introduce meaningful reform. While child support legislation, in my mind, is the most urgent in need of serious reform, number two, as far as complaints go during my relatively short time in this place, would have to be problems in relation to the Copyright Act 1968, and the way it is being mercilessly exploited by the Australian Performing Rights Association, or APRA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a problem that other members and I have raised on numerous occasions with the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and he has indicated reforms are possible but, as far as I am concerned, as with child support, the changes cannot come soon enough. APRA has embarked on an aggressive revenue collecting campaign over the past 18 months, based on a fact that a court ruled that the inside of a business could be regarded as a public place. APRA is now threatening businesses all over Australia that it will take them to court unless they pay licence fees to have a radio on in their premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give members an example. I recently visited a small butcher shop at Yeoval up in the top end of my electorate run by a young man in his 20s. You could not really begin to imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, how lonely this job is in a small place like that. I called in on a Tuesday about lunch time. This young man had had two customers through his doors that morning. The only company he had was the local radio. The week before he had been sent one of those threatening letters from APRA saying that his radio was a public performance of music and that he would be taken to court unless he paid the annual copyright exemption fee, which I would suggest was a darn sight more than that small butcher made in profits during that particular day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this young man pointed out, the radio was not on to entertain the public. It was there solely for his personal benefit. So small was his business that he did not have meat out in the display fridge, he had little signs with the prices for `short loin chops' and `sausages' spread out for the people coming into the shop. It was not worth his while to cut the pieces off and put them on show. He had to cut the meat to order from that he had in the coolroom. The  amount of income made by a small retailer in a little village like Yeoval is minimal and these APRA fees represent an unreasonable impost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised the issue with the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) last year. His reply to my representations showed an alarming lack of interest in the issue. The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) has shown a deal more interest, and I appreciate the problems
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5932"> he faces. The story of the butcher at Yeoval, however, is but one of no doubt hundreds of examples from around Australia of how small business is suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken the trouble to visit APRA headquarters in Sydney. I have heard their story. I realise our international understandings and obligations but, as the case of the Yeoval butcher shows, the system is unfair. Obviously there is double&hyphen;dipping of performing rights, given that the radio stations already pay substantial rights for playing the record. I have no problem with the performing rights for music played for commercial gain in gyms, for example, but the system is unfair and it is penalising business in my electorate, and no doubt elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the Attorney&hyphen;General to revisit this particular piece of legislation urgently. I also hope he passes on to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, the need to do something urgently about the Child Support Act. Those Senate reforms have been sitting around for a couple of years now and they must be addressed with haste, because some people out there are almost suicidal and their lives have been destroyed by the impost that that act places on them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am thankful that the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) is here because I have a couple of questions to ask him. There are only 11 days to go before the end of the financial year. I would like to know, and I am sure the House would like to know, what is happening to the legal aid agreements. A $120 million budget cut was imposed in the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. I am not holding him responsible&mdash;the bean counters got to him and did him over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) were working away to try to resolve the problem, and then the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went on the Laurie Oakes <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. He was not properly briefed. He said, `No, we are not going to change what we are doing.' I understand that a proposal was going to go back to the cabinet to remedy the situation, because they were acting on old figures and a few misconceptions. However, as a result of the stubbornness of the Prime Minister, legal aid is in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a great tragedy for me. I am a product of the legal aid system. I was only in private practice for three months and then I was proud to go to work as a public solicitor in New South Wales from 1979 to 1987, when I received appointment as a public defender. I worked as a public defender in New South Wales from October 1987 until February 1990, when I had to resign to run for public office because it was an office of profit. I have a commitment to legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legal aid cannot cover the field&mdash;it is there in partnership with the private profession&mdash;but the former Labor government looked after legal aid. When Labor came into office in 1983, the Fraser government had turned the Australian Legal Aid Office, which was a creation of the Whitlam Labor government, into a referral factory. There were discussions with all the states and territories. There was a merging of the Australian Legal Aid Office in New South Wales with the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission. An efficient system was then operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was repeated around the country. There was a one&hyphen;stop shop and there was a Commonwealth&hyphen;state arrangement. Then the bean counters got in. A lot of people do not understand what the definition of a Commonwealth offence is. Have we worked out what the definition of a Commonwealth offence is and what a state offence is? New South Wales has decided, in effect, to go it alone.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5933">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened with Western Australia? We are told that the federal government has yet to make an offer to Western Australia with 11 days to go. I ask the Attorney&hyphen;General: what is the current situation? There are only 11 days to go. Legal aid is in crisis in this country. I understand the pressures on the Attorney&hyphen;General and the bean counters, but what has happened to the legal system, with the increase in court fees and a whole host of things, is a disgrace. And I know it is currently being debated in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to justice now is a myth. It is the rich or the infinitely poor that are able to access the system of justice Even then it is a question of whether the poor can access it,  because people on pensions are missing out on a whole range of things. This is what is happening at the coalface. This is what disillusioned people who work in the system are telling me. If it was not for the goodwill of a lot of people working in the system, who are carrying the system by working extra hours, the system would be in total collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My question to the Attorney&hyphen;General is: what is the state of play? I know that you have to run the government line and these decisions are not solely your own, but I would like to know the current situation with all the states and territories. What is happening as of 1 July? What agreements have been signed up? What has not been signed up? What are the provisions in the Commonwealth area where there have not been agreements signed. I think we need to know. I am not holding him personally responsible. I know the pressures he is under but, in the end, he has to carry the can. That is what ministerial responsibility is about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might ask the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) a number of questions that he could address. My colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has raised the question of legal aid. I would like to ask a few specifics regarding other areas of the Attorney&hyphen;General's portfolio responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, in respect to the Australian Federal Police, I would be grateful if the Attorney&hyphen;General could indicate to us what the staffing impacts of the cuts that have been imposed will be. What will be the number of AFP staff that will be reduced as a consequence of those cuts, what areas of policy responsibility will be reduced, and what will be the effect on the schedule of those matters which are removed from the purview of the AFP?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I would ask in relation to these matters is whether or not there has been any reduction of our overseas AFP staffing officers and where they would be. The third issue in relation to the AFP is on the very apparent ready availability of drugs in this community. Does the government have any response to the increasing calls by police commissioners and others for a strategy that goes beyond simple enforcement and looks at some of the areas that have been put into a public debate by a great number of commentators, including a number of the most senior within the law enforcement community? I would also like the Attorney&hyphen;General to address the staffing reductions that will be consequential on the smaller, but still significant, cuts to the National Crime Authority and what that may do in respect of any menu of references the authority has under its jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area where I would appreciate advice is in HREOC. The Attorney&hyphen;General will be aware that that particular agency has suffered the greatest reduction of funding of any agency in his portfolio, and indeed, perhaps right across government, apart from the ones that were abolished entirely in the last budget. Plainly, there are going to be significant consequences in the capacity of HREOC to do its task, particularly in view of the increasing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5934"> pressure that is emerging on HREOC because of the unenlightened comments that have occurred over the last year since the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) welcomed the end of a pall of censorship and allowed the bushfires of racism to run out of control. What will the consequences be for the community for those funding reductions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area I would appreciate advice on is in relation to the Administrative Review Council's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better decisions</EMPHASIS> report. I would appreciate it if the Attorney&hyphen;General could advise us on the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> last weekend, which suggested that rather than implement the recommendations of the report there would be a move to go away from an effective system of merits review. Is that on the Attorney&hyphen;General's agenda?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, if I could turn to a matter which I think is going to be of very great interest to the community. I refer to comments made by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) in the previous estimates. He indicated that he was betrayed by a member of his staff who acted not at his behest but rather at the behest of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I wonder whether the Attorney&hyphen;General, having administrative responsibly for ASIO, could bring us up to date as to the percentage of staff of ministerial officers and parliamentary secretary officers&mdash;that is those serving the executive&mdash;who have been subject to the processes of character and security assessment through that agency. Can we be assured that judgments that are being made as to the appropriateness of staffing are not being made in a way which exposes us to the possibility of security risks? Judgments left to individual ministers can be plainly flawed as to the adequacy of character checks if those kind of agencies are not involved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Banks (Mr Melham) has raised a question of what is happening with legal aid. He asserted that legal aid is in crisis, let me assure him that it is not and let me assure him that the expectation of the government is that there will be arrangements in place on 1 July with all jurisdictions which will enable a delivery by legal aid commissions of state and federal funds for legal aid in each jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of announcements have already been made in relation to individual jurisdictions. In respect of the Northern Territory, the ACT and South Australia, it was some time ago announced that in principle, agreement had been reached with each of those jurisdictions for the continuation of a cooperative delivery through the legal aid or legal service commissions of those jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of Queensland and New South Wales, it has already been announced that in principle, agreement has been reached with those jurisdictions on the delivery of Commonwealth funds for legal aid through the state legal aid commissions but on an agency or funder provider basis. In the case of Victoria, there has been an announcement made that there will be a combination of the cooperative and the agency arrangements made, initially the cooperative arrangement and then the agency arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Negotiations with the two remaining jurisdictions, Tasmania and Western Australia, have progressed well. In fact, with one of them, the negotiations are effectively complete. With the other there is still some detail in relation to guidelines to be determined but we anticipate that  the requirements will be met in respect of both those jurisdictions in time for a 1 July commencement of new agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks made some comments about the budget cuts. Let me just say that the government policy is to eliminate budget deficits. One of the problems we have with the inability of the economy in recent years to maintain economic growth on a sustainable basis
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5935"> has been caused by the government debt generating foreign debt as a result of budget deficits and the government has turned around the budgetary situation such that the $10.5 billion deficit that it inherited for the year 1995&hyphen;96 will, by the year 1988&hyphen;99, be converted into a surplus. In other words, from a major deficit, through three budgets, there will be a surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect to legal aid, let me mention that legal aid is not the only item on the access to justice agenda. Community legal centres are increasingly an important source of legal advice and access to justice for individual citizens. There are some 115 of those organisations funded under the Commonwealth budget and funding for them, subject to the indexing, both upwards and downwards&mdash;efficiency dividend on the one hand and the CPI indexing on the other&mdash;has been maintained, and in excess of $15 million in the current year's budget has provided for CLCs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, you do not need legal aid money from Legal Aid Commissions to be able to obtain legal advice. In any event, legal advice itself is not necessarily the best means of resolving a dispute. In that vein, the government has recently provided some $6 million over three years for 34 new services. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I am indebted to the member for Banks and to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was talking about mediation and counselling services. It has been demonstrated very well that people who receive relationship education are much less likely to be divorced than people who do not. In fact, those who receive pre&hyphen;marriage counselling, or are the recipients of education services, have a very low rate of divorce. It may, in part, reflect the fact that those who seek that sort of advice are less likely to be unable to resolve conflicts that might arise in a relationship. But the fact is that it seems to be effective, we ought to be expanding it, and this government is expanding it. That means that there is less call on agencies like the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking to have mediation and counselling focused in community organisations where it is much more available and can be delivered much more inexpensively. That in itself provides access to justice, looked at in a broad way. What we are doing is preventing the need for money to be applied at the wrong end and applying money in an effective way at the front end. So the access to justice story is a bigger one and needs to be looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On legal aid itself, let me just add a couple of comments. There has been a major reform of the legal aid delivery system, resulting from the renegotiation of the agreements. The result is likely to be that there will be measures introduced by legal aid commissions, such as those that have been introduced by Victorian legal aid. There will be some categories of cases which will not be funded. That is appropriate. There will be some categories of cases where there will be funding cuts. That also is appropriate. Victorian legal aid has been criticised for imposing a $10,000 limit on partners and a $15,000 on separate representation of children for resolving issues relating to children, that is, residence or contact issues in relation to a particular family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An amount of $35,000 to enable parties to organise a separation seems to me to be more than adequate. If there is an impetus on the part of the lawyers to resolve the matter within  that sort of fee cap, there will be correspondingly an impetus for the parties to be a bit more reasonable and not to seek to extend hearings in the Family Court unnecessarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lack of application of the notion that legally aided clients should not receive assistance in excess of that received by or available to a person who is funding himself or herself. What we want to do in the guidelines is to ensure that the principle of provision
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5936"> of legal aid to legally assisted clients is limited to the sort of assistance that would be likely to be provided at their own expense by an ordinarily prudent self&hyphen;funding litigant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has raised a number of questions and, in order to answer those questions in some detail, I would need to take them on notice. Let me offer some broad comment, however. In relation to the Australian Federal Police, the only impact in the current budget on the Australian Federal Police is the efficiency dividend. I cannot tell him precisely what the impact of that may be on staff. I can assure him there is no area of policy responsibility that will be eliminated. But, in his former capacity as minister for justice, he would be well aware that the AFP, like other law enforcement agencies, is unable to investigate every complaint that is made to it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The member for Denison would be well aware of the need by the AFP, like other law enforcement agencies, to prioritise the matters to be investigated. The system that was put in place under the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Review in broad terms remains in place for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as overseas postings are concerned, it is my understanding that there will not be any overseas liaison officers currently in place removed. Without additional funding, it may be difficult to expand the overseas liaison service, but that presently in existence will remain. Those officers are in fact providing a very valuable service. In many cases they operate within one country, but have dealings with a number of others. The officers in Thailand, for example, regularly visit Vietnam and have contact with the liaison officers in Hong Kong who in turn deal with China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the NCA is concerned, again in the current budget there is no cut to the NCA other than the efficiency dividend. But in addition the NCA will, as a result of a new initiative, receive over four years an amount of $20.4 million for a special project in relation to fraud against the Commonwealth. It is anticipated that this will bring in significant revenue to the Commonwealth amounting to some $60 million potentially in tax that would otherwise be uncollected and $30 million in anticipated recoveries of the proceeds of crime as well. Far from cutting staff under the current budget, the NCA will in fact be able to place additional staff in Perth and Adelaide, among other places. I have seen different figures, but I understand it may be up to about six officers in Perth and up to four officers in Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is alleged by the member for Denison to have suffered the biggest budget cut of any agency. In fact it has not. It has only suffered the efficiency dividend, like all other agencies, in the current budget. What he presumably is referring to is the anticipated cut in next year's budget which is contained in the forward estimates&mdash;an amount of $4.3 million to come off the budget.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KERR" NAMEID="RH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr Kerr</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an effective 40 per cent cut.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not an effective 40 per cent cut. If you look at the figure from 1997&hyphen;98 to 1998&hyphen;99, it is 27 per cent. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its current form, was established under the 1986 act. Since then, it has grown from a budget of about $5 million in 1986&hyphen;87 or 1987&hyphen;88, I forget which, to a budget that at one point exceeded $20 million. It has grown from a staff of approximately 50 in that 1986&hyphen;87 period to a staff that at one point exceeded 220.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened is that each time a new function has been given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission they have been in effect given a new funding arrangement and, regrettably, a new commissioner. So we now have a commission which comprises a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5937"> president and six commissioners, each of whom has something that operates, in practical terms, as a separate budget. Attempts by the previous government to achieve a more corporate structure through a review of the commission failed because the review officers failed to agree on a report. Two members were prepared to sign the report, another member was not prepared to sign it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a time when money is in short supply and there is a necessity to bring the budget into balance or surplus, the funding available to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is, in general terms, more than adequate and it is appropriate that there be a significant cut to the budget. The commission is expected, in consequence, to run a more efficient ship, to run a ship that is administered corporately. There is in fact being debated today a bill which will enable some reform of the commission to take place. The effect would be to transfer complaint processing to a full&hyphen;time president, taking it out of the hands of the individual commissioners. The commissioners would then be able to focus to a greater extent upon the portfolio responsibilities in their own areas, but principally in the education area, which I suspect has suffered somewhat through the need for the individual commissioners to be involved in the conciliation of complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the commission will be able to live within its budget and still achieve much that is expected of it by the community. But, like every other agency in the government, it has to live within the government's means. That will mean that there will be some cost cutting. It will also mean that some things that the individual commissioners might like to do will not be able to be done. But hopefully it will mean that individual commissioners, together with the president, will decide on what are the priority areas for action, rather than leaving it to individual commissioners to engage in personal interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Administrative Review Council report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better decisions</EMPHASIS> has been considered by cabinet. The member for Denison is probably aware that an announcement has been made that the cabinet in principle accepted the recommendations of that report and established a interdepartmental committee to consider how the recommendations might be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen with some interest the article under the name of Roderick Campbell in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> last Monday, 16 June, and I am interested to see how what is suggested there would be consistent with the cabinet decision. Plainly, it is not. But let us not attempt to speculate on what cabinet might decide when the interdepartmental committee reports to it.

I am unable to answer his precise question off the top of my head as to the percentage of staff of ministers and parliamentary secretaries who are security checked through ASIO and through other means, but that information can be obtained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One issue that still needs clarification is the definition of Commonwealth offence. What happens in trials that involve Commonwealth offences and state offences, who is going to bear the brunt of that? You have a number of drug matters where the accused is charged with Commonwealth offences in relation to importation, and the accused could also be charged with state offences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens in bankcard offences? If you are dealing with a Commonwealth bank, you have a mixture of Commonwealth and state offences. I am interested, and I am sure the parliament is interested at the moment, in what constitutes a Commonwealth offence and what will the Commonwealth fund? Are there areas of disagreement as to what does constitute a Commonwealth offence, or are the officials still deciding what the definition means?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General has confirmed in his contribution today that the bean counters did get to this part of the budget. I think it is a false dividend. He talks about the efficiency dividend and the deficit and having to rein in the deficit, and at the same time he talks about a number of cases that will no longer be funded. That is going to produce false economies of scale because if an accused is not represented, will the judge discharge the accused because he or she cannot get a fair trial? If the judge does not discharge them, you will then have unrepresented accused and that will slow down the trial process. Trials that go for one week or less will go longer because the judge will be required to take more caution in terms of that trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this because I have had that experience. Jockey Smith was a classic when it came to representing himself. He could tie up the courts in New South Wales for six months at a time and then he would get legal aid on his appeal and get a fresh trial. That is what is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was a public defender, when I was a legal aid solicitor, the efficiency dividend was applied overwhelmingly by having a legal representative in there who had, in effect, no incentive to prolong a matter. Cases were run efficiently. Accused were getting proper advice. Pleas of guilty were being conducted at an earlier stage. Sentence indications were given. It was churning over. These cuts are going to mean that people are not going to get legal advice. With no legal advice they are going to go into the courts and clog the system up. There will be pleas of not guilty when there should be pleas of guilty. This is going to have a multiplier effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the judges are screaming blue murder. That is going to be the result. The bean counters are going to bring the system to a halt. There has been a clear message. Look at what the High Court has had to do. It has just had the efficiency dividend applied to it and it was left with two options: does it sit less often and not go around the countryside, or does it close to the public on weekends and public holidays? The High Court took the correct decision. That has meant that there is no access to that court on weekends and public holidays. The public cannot go through the court to familiarise themselves with the highest court in the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the High Court was left with no option. The High Court should be quarantined from the efficiency dividend. Fancy placing the court in that position. You have the President  of the Senate, Mrs Reid, attacking the court for that decision. They made the correct decision. To sit less often would have been the wrong decision. But that is something you can blame the bean counters for. Again, it sends the wrong message. There are some areas&mdash;and this is one of them&mdash;where they have got it drastically wrong, and time will show that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard Senator Reid as a good friend. We have worked together on many issues in Canberra over the years that we have both represented this area, particularly in the years when we both represented it in the Senate. She has not been one prone to the tendency of the conservative side of politics to attack public servants for decisions forced on them by governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all that time she has had it pretty easy. It was easy for her to attack because if there were decisions she disagreed with, she was always in power so she could attack the government. But decisions like this were not forced upon agencies. It is not that they did not have to make hard decisions, they did, but there was never a decision such as this, to close the High Court in Canberra with significant adverse consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the member for Banks is correct. The decision to close the High Court on weekends and public holidays was the lesser of the two evils facing the administration of the High Court. I do not welcome the decision; it should be reversed. But it cannot be reversed by the administration of the High Court at the price of limiting access to justice for Australians elsewhere. I do not want to take this. Obviously, I have a parochial concern. The Canberra economy has been driven into recession and continues to be in recession, and one of the few areas which has any growth element at all is the tourist industry. One of the significant elements of tourism is access to the great national institutions, of which the High Court is one. That is of great concern for me as the member for Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But actually, I am more concerned about the decision for other Australians. At least the people of Canberra and the people from the region&mdash;even as far away as Sydney&mdash;can make arrangements to come to see this great institution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will approach the issue that was raised by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) from a slightly different perspective and take up the issue of cuts to the legal aid budget. It is plain that the budget savings that were proposed and put forward in the 1996&hyphen;97 federal budget will not be achieved. Whatever savings are ultimately achieved will be significantly less than were provided for in the budget, and so all the disruption and pain, all the destruction of national uniformity, and all the destruction of the work of the Legal Aid Board&mdash;which was established with a view to actually getting some coherence in the system&mdash;will be suffered for a return which will be nowhere near that which the Treasurer, Mr Costello, announced in relation to the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that some of these new arrangements are not yet in place and that some may never be put in place, because of the difficulties of negotiating them. But I would appreciate it if the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) could advise us of the difference between that which was set out as savings to be achieved in that budget and the ultimate reductions in Commonwealth expenditures that emerge, because the savings will be nowhere near those which were first projected. In other words, all this cost has been for very little gain to the budget, and certainly not the substantial gain to the budget that was projected. There will be a substantial shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the Attorney&hyphen;General's undertaking to find and to tell us about the percentage of those in ministerial employment who have been subject to the scrutiny of the security services and the like. I would appreciate it, though, if he could give us some indication of whether that process has been attended to merely partially or comprehensively. It is a matter of grave concern if, after 18 months&mdash;notwithstanding that staff would have had to have been  employed without the capacity of all of this to have been gone through beforehand&mdash;the scrutiny process is still substantially incomplete. Plainly, if that is so, we would wish to know
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5941"> why it is that that lack of responsibility&mdash;in terms of our perception of our vulnerability in these key areas&mdash;would be allowed to be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the minister's willingness to provide some detailed advice relating to the cuts to the AFP. I wonder whether the minister could actually undertake to table or provide the menu as adjusted to take into account the ongoing funding reductions that that organisation is suffering. I do not accept that the only reductions have been those related to efficiency gains because, in fact, there have been associated detriments to the overall effectiveness of the AFP which I think go well beyond the normal burden that other organisations have had to suffer. I think there was an accelerated efficiency gain that was imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have two final points to make and, again, I appreciate the Attorney's comments in relation to the apparent inconsistency of the cabinet decision and the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, but I would appreciate the Attorney's assurance that he will fight to maintain merits review. It is not enough merely to observe that this inconsistency apparently has emerged within officials. Given that he has a cabinet decision which supports his position and, given that the Attorney does have a responsibility to ensure that fair processes are capable of being obtained by Australian citizens, whatever the arguments for or against better decisions, I would appreciate his undertaking that he will fight to maintain a fair system of administrative review with a merit system built in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I would make is in relation to a matter which overlaps with my immigration responsibilities. The Attorney would be aware of reports that a number of North Koreans, some of whom are alleged to have had significant criminal records of kidnapping, rape and other like offences, recently arrived in Australia on visitors visas. The Attorney may or may not be aware that I have publicly called for the minister for immigration to review those processes to advise us how this might have happened.

Both members will be aware that my department assisted the High Court in a review with a view to seeing what measures were open. A number of options were canvassed and two mentioned by the member for Banks were among them. Obviously it is better that the court close at weekends than the court cease to be an itinerant court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the member for Canberra put it plainly when he spoke about tourism. The High Court budget is not a budget designed for tourist purposes. It is an advantage to the court that it is known to the community and it is seen to be accessible. It is open whenever the court is sitting&mdash;it is open on week days. Not every public institution that tourists would like to visit is open on weekends. If the Canberra Tourist Bureau would like to make a contribution to the High Court budget in order to assist, I am sure the High Court registrar would be pleased to receive the funding. I am told that it would, in fact, cost something like $8 per tourist to keep the High Court open on weekends, having regard to the number of people who visit.</PARA>

We need to monitor what is going to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make the point that I intended to make earlier on. We have reached a point where the community has said, `This is the amount of money that is going to be available for legal aid.' If the courts have a different view as to what is required for legal aid, then the courts have two choices. One is that trials cannot go ahead and the other is that the courts can review and reform their processes. There is a lot that can be done. Legal aid has tended to be treated as a bottomless pit by some legal practitioners. Courts have not really had regard to the limited resources available to litigants, and the time has come when there should be a clear focus on that. I think the onus now, having regard to what has been achieved, is on the legal profession and on the courts.</PARA>

The consequential questions that were asked related to the difference between the previous core funding for the environment, which was in place prior to the last election, and the reduced expenditure under the coalition as a result of the transfer of functions out of that core funding and other budget reductions. So the first question is: is the government yet in a position to identify what it says is the shortfall between previous core funding and current core funding?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I would appreciate the minister's advice on relates to the RFA process in our own state of Tasmania. As the minister may be aware, the RFA process in Tasmania is moving towards a conclusion, albeit it is unlikely to be concluded by the 30th of this month, as was anticipated at an earlier stage. One of the obvious issues which is causing concern to participants in that process is the question of the reservation of forest types on private land. By way of background, a simple summary, it is plain that the scoping agreement targets of reservations of 15 per cent of forest types that were in place pre&hyphen;1750 and the 60 per cent old growth and 90 per cent wilderness targets simply cannot be met in Tasmania, in any credible way, without massive destruction to the forest industry and without there being an associated preservation of some of those forest types on private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty emerges as to who is going to take funding responsibility and management responsibility for those reservations. At present, it is my understanding that the Tasmanian and Commonwealth governments are deadlocked on this issue. Why has the Commonwealth yet to ante&hyphen;up some serious proposal for it to take some responsibility to ensure the success of the RFA process? The Labor Party, in government, established the RFA process and wished that process to conclude to its successful end point. The current government asserted that it is committed to that. Yet the whole process could founder on the failure to provide a sufficient confidence in the system that necessary reservations on private land will be protected, not necessarily by acquisition, as some urge, but by at least some Commonwealth involvement  in a management process and a commitment to necessary funding. This may need to be evolved should there become some issues of a compensation or the need to protect the forested areas from land clearances or from some other initiatives that might emerge down the track.</PARA>

It is at least $187 million short of its pre&hyphen;election commitments on funding to the national trust to date and will not apparently ante&hyphen;up even a modest amount of money to secure confidence that forests on private lands can be built into an outcome in the RFA, which will enable us to have both an environmentally credible and an employment credible solution to that issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that that was one of the most indefensible abrogations of national responsibility which has ever been perpetrated by any national government in Australia. At the time of that debate, when that matter was being considered, I said that the government was, in effect, saying to the Australian people that&mdash;despite the fact that many of the great river systems of Australia are being serious degraded; despite the increasing salination of Australian rivers; despite the destruction of Australian forests, the degradation of the soils, the impoverishment of many of our coastal areas&mdash;if the Australian people and the Australian parliament were not prepared to allow it to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra, then the Australian environment could go to hell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the government told us, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know. That is what the government told the parliament, and that is what the government told the Australian people as well. If one&hyphen;third of Telstra were not to be sold, then the Australian environment&mdash;with all of that deterioration and degradation and the threat to Australia's future arising from that damage to the environment&mdash;could go to hell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a deplorable decision. It was an abrogation of national responsibility in the extreme. It was one of the worst examples of a decision made by a national government that has ever been seen in Australia. I want to make this point as well: I have very serious reservations about the genuineness of the proposed Natural Heritage Fund. If one&hyphen;third of Telstra is sold and it realises what may be available from it&mdash;and that has been estimated at possibly $12 billion or $14 billion&mdash;then $1 billion of that will go into what has been referred to as the Natural Heritage Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the genuineness of this government in the disbursement of those funds and the application of them to particular problems of the environment in Australia. I am concerned, because it simply repeats a practice which has become apparent in the operation of the government of Australia under the present coalition government. The other one is the Federation Fund. It is going to be interesting to see how those funds are applied, to which projects they go, and in whose electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example is the reintroduction of a program called the roads of national importance. There is one road of national importance, Mr Deputy Speaker, for which you, in particular, have been persistent and courageous for years in pursuing work: the Pacific Highway. Money
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5945"> will be allocated to that, but I am concerned about where the rest of it will go. I believe very firmly and very genuinely that those funds will be used to pork&hyphen;barrel. There will not be a strict application of funds according to objective criteria and objective priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have thus got three examples. The Natural Heritage Fund has ostensibly been established to correct the degradation of the Australian environment. I will be watching to see what projects those funds are applied to. The Federation Fund will be another slush fund, another pork&hyphen;barrel fund.

As I said, I opposed the sale of Telstra and I opposed the funding of environmental programs and projects in that way. But since the decision has been made by the government&mdash;and presumably at some time in the future, then, the fund will be established&mdash;I want to put in a very strong bid for Lake Macquarie in New South Wales. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not very far from you and I know that you are a frequent visitor to the beauties of that lake. It is the largest coastal saltwater lake in Australia. But, because of its location, because of the nature of the urban development that has taken place around it and because of the nature of the very high risk industries which have developed around Lake Macquarie&mdash;in particular, power generation and mineral concentration and processing&mdash;there has been some very serious degradation of Lake Macquarie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because those particular examples of degradation have taken place as a result of the national contribution which that region has made to the national economy and to the national welfare, I believe that a more than adequate case can be made out for restoration and remediation of the problems of Lake Macquarie being financed from national resources by the national government. I want to mark the spot as far as Lake Macquarie is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have written to the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) asking that top priority be given to the needs of Lake Macquarie, in relation not just to some of the heavy metals that people have referred to recently as a particular problem but to the whole question of having an estuarine management plan developed. Very clear priorities can then be determined in relation to Lake Macquarie and appropriate funds can be provided to make sure that that magnificent lake system is returned to a pristine condition. It will be able to continue to make the very substantial contribution that it has made in the past to the future of Australia, not only in terms of urban development and industrial development but also because of the extremely important recreation and tourism role that it fulfils at the present time. It is one of the most magnificent saltwater lakes in the world and it must be preserved and restored.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a lot of environmental issues of concern in this great nation of ours today and if we had more time we could raise quite a few of them. The particular one I would like the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) or his representative in the chamber to be aware of is the proposal relating to the Fitzroy River, which is one of the great wild rivers remaining in Australia. The proposal is to dam the river and erect other irrigation infrastructure. I believe that that is something that he ought to consider. Certainly back in 1983 the Franklin Dam established the precedent and the right and responsibility of the Commonwealth to be involved in these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the two or more dam projects that might be proposed on the Fitzroy River will almost certainly be located at Diamond Gorge, a remote and beautiful site north of Fitzroy
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5946"> Crossing. It is a haven for rare bird species, such as the gouldian finch, the purple&hyphen;crowned wren and also species such as the rock ringtail possum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tim Fisher&mdash;not the Deputy Prime Minister, but Tim Fisher of the Australian Conservation Foundation&mdash;has pointed out that a whole series of adverse environmental impacts would come from such a proposal, including significantly reduced wet season flows and much larger dry season flows, which would effectively reverse the natural flow patterns. In addition, the dams would create impassable barriers to fish, particularly migratory fish that have to move up and down stream to complete their live cycles, and the ecology of the river would be radically affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these and many other reasons, I would urge the Commonwealth and the Minister for the Environment to be involved in this issue. The Fitzroy River is one of the last, long wild rivers remaining in Australia and, in my view, to dam it would be an environmental tragedy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to the Department of the Communications and the Arts estimates that are also before us, with particular relevance to the arts matters. I will try, in terms of the agreement between the whips, to compress three or four issues into one and a half contributions because I know that we need to make sure the minister has some time to respond to a range of issues across a range of portfolios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to first raise some issues concerning the film industry. Overall the film industry is in the position of the arts as a whole from this budget. They are expected to be thankful because the extent of the cuts this year is not as great as the extent of the cuts last year. The cuts are nevertheless substantial when looked at cumulatively. We have a small cut to the Australian Film Finance Corporation arising from the efficiency dividend. The efficiency dividend, however it is described, still comes from the program money available to the Film Finance Corporation this year. That was made clear in the Senate estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have on the face of it a $6.2 million cut to the Australian Film Commission, which is substantial, but underestimates the true position. The parliamentary library research indicates that in 1995&hyphen;96 the forward estimates were expected to increase to $50 million and yet we find the Film Commission budget at $29.7 million. On the face of it, there is a direct obvious cut on the budget papers, acknowledged by the government, of a cumulative $6.2 million to the Australian Film Commission. In fact, compared to the Labor government's planning, it is a much greater cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in addition the pressure on Film Australia, speculation about its privatisation and the uncertainty about what will happen there. In cumulative terms for this industry that means that we are cutting its research and development. That is essentially how the Film Commission is most simply described. It is more than that but is that. We are cutting its venture capital because that is essentially what the Film Commission and the Film Finance Corporation supply. Then this is compounded by the impact of cuts to the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The film and television industry is more than just an industry because it says a lot about us as a nation in its cultural role. In other circumstances, I would speak about that at length, but we have the agreement to be brief. I will not go into that. I will simply acknowledge that we must recognise it. It is a very important industry and it creates lot of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have been seeking, and what we did not seem to get out of the Senate estimates committee, is whether the government has made any assessment of the cumulative impact on  production and employment in the film industry of the continuing cuts to the Film Finance
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5947"> Corporation, the Australian Film Commission and the ABC, let alone the prospective cuts to Film Australia. That is one matter on which I would like some response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I am concerned about the continuing speculation about the sale of Artbank. It might be fortuitous that it is under both the Communications and the Arts and Finance portfolios. We might be able to get some response on both accounts if the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) is representing the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) here also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Artbank has not for five years made any call on the budget and there is no prospect that it ever will. Yet by proposing to sell it there is a major threat to the income of emerging visual artists in Australia. There is a threat to the income of artists and private galleries where we have what I would have thought the conservatives would think is the ideal form of support for an industry, not grants but commercial purchases of the work of Australian artists against which a return is anticipated, that is being achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the cultural or financial benefit that the government sees itself achieving by persisting with its attempts to sell Artbank? When it is going to stop the insecurity and the uncertainty that the continuing playing with this important enterprise is having in the visual arts in Australia and on that important organisation, Artbank? Those are the first two matters I wish to raise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other two matters which I wish to raise, which I will try to do briefly, relate to the heading in the estimates concerning cultural development assistance and some matters to do with literature. In the cultural development assistance area, it is true that the cuts to the Australia Council and to cultural development assistance overall are not as great as last year. On the face of it they seem small, but when we start looking at them we find more emerges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to get some clarification about the details of the $1.5 million cut in cultural development assistance to fund the ongoing activities of the Visions of Australia program. I was the minister who initiated the Visions of Australia program. I welcome the fact that the government has made a continuing commitment to it, even if only till 1998&hyphen;99. I would rather it had been more substantial through the forward estimates period, but even that is welcome. But to do so, it is not extra money for the arts. The arts area is being called upon to fund this by other cuts, and nobody yet knows where that cut is going to fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the problem that, following last year's two per cent across-the-board cuts to all the great Australian arts institutions funded through the major organisations fund of the Australia Council, we see the evidence this year that virtually all of those agencies are suffering great stress because of the difficult economic times, which is putting pressure on sponsorships and ticket sales. There is nothing in this budget to assist those organisations and nothing to compensate for the two per cent cut last year. We still find the funding for the Australia Council at less than the 1995&hyphen;96 funding. What does the government have in mind to assist Australian arts in general and, in particular, my current concern, which is the major national organisations and the major organisations fund?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other hidden cut in the budget is to the National Film and Sound Archive. I welcome the commitment to build the new building for the National Film and Sound Archive. It was a scandalous decision last year to cancel the commitment of the previous budget to build a new building. I welcome the fact that there is now some funding through the Department of Finance to meet part of the cost of a new building. But when we look, what we find is that  at least half the cost of that building is going to have to be met by cuts in the other ongoing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5948"> activities of the National Film and Sound Archive and the Department of Communications and the Arts. That has not been made public, but it is clear, on the face of it, and what we want to know is: what are the implications of those cuts for the other programs of the National Film and Sound Archive and for the arts in general?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not got time to talk about the public lending rights; I have discussed that before. I think this government has led a most mean spirited attack upon arts in Australia, but I will discuss that on another occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to ask one question about libraries. The government went to the election with a commitment of $11.4 million for what has now become known as the on-line public access initiative, merely to match a budgeted commitment of the previous government. But it obviously was not a core promise because what you have provided was $2 million, not $11.4 million. That was in the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand, and I would like the minister to confirm, that applications were received for $25 million of funding under that program. Last week a distribution of the $2 million was announced. There is nothing further in this budget. What prospect is there of your $11.4 million promise ever being met?.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker and members for your contributions. Given the limitation of time, I will try to do justice to those matters, and what matters I cannot deal with I will undertake to get some answers on for honourable members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison (Mr Kerr) raised several matters. The first one was with regard to overall funding for the environment and whether core funding, the promise that had previously been made, had indeed been met. We undertook, prior to the last election, that we would spend an additional $1.15 billion over the five years, on top of the previous government's forward estimates. That is an average of about $230 million each year. In 1995&hyphen;96, the previous government spent $212 million on environmental programs, and your forward estimates for 1997&hyphen;98 were $171 million on environmental programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1997&hyphen;98, we will spend $255 million, an increase of $84 million, a 50 per cent increase. Your forward estimates for next year, that is 1998&hyphen;99, were to be $147 million. So we will spend in 1998&hyphen;99, $267 million on environment programs, an increase of $120 million. That is an 80 per cent increase. And this is despite the environment program having to find savings announced in last year's budget of $34 million to help repair, of course, the deficit that we inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the environment programs&mdash;when you look closely at the figures against what we said we would do, and against your own forward estimates which were part of what our undertaking was&mdash;are contrary to what you have said and contrary to what I read recently in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Age</EMPHASIS> by Kenneth Davidson, and in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. I think that they are the basic figures that one should start with and then, in addition, of course, there is the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5949"> of your forward estimates. And they are the figures. I understand that they have been put down in the estimates, as well, by Senator Hill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that it does answer the question. The other issue that was brought up by the member for Denison concerned the RFA process. It related to the question of private land and how that would be treated in the process of the negotiations. The negotiations, I can report to the Chamber, are at a penultimate stage. We may meet the 30 June date&mdash;one is still hopeful. Negotiations and discussions are continuing with all the relevant parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the preservation and reservation of the private land to which you refer, is an issue that is actively being considered by the states and the Commonwealth, as you would appreciate. The point that was made by the member for Denison was that are there are ways in which acquisition, or a management process, or funding, or compensation, or other such initiatives might emerge to give effect to the desire to reserve significant species within private forestry to meet the overall criteria of the CAR reserve system under the Janis criteria. I accept the point that is being made by the member for Denison. These are very difficult issues but we, like any sensible people within the broader parliament, would want to get an RFA that is successful, to give some sustainability and certainty in the forest industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How that might be funded, if indeed funding is required, is a matter that is actively being considered by my colleague Senator Hill and by me when I assume the position, as I did last week, of Acting Minister for the Environment, and I am sure, if that occasion arises again, that I will give it very active consideration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The point about mining issues&mdash;because they were involved in the RFA process&mdash;involves my colleague, Senator Parer. The member for Charlton (Mr Brown) basically made three points. The fact, of course, is that the parliament has approved the sale of Telstra and therefore given effect to the government's policy. So I acknowledge your right to make the points that you have but, of course, the parliament has chosen to go in a different direction from that of your own views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning your question about the NHT, the genuineness of the fund, we believe that the process of assessment of projects involves states, local government and independence of the technical assessment panels. I am sure that they, for example, would be looking closely at the applications for Lake Macquarie funding. We are very cognisant of the need to have a fund of that size vested with genuineness and integrity and we have tried to put in place processes that will deliver those particular outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first project of the Federation Fund was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as being the National Museum here in Canberra. We are developing criteria about the assessment but, broadly, they will be major items such as a national museum that will be looked at in conjunction with the states around the nation. That too will be a transparent process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Roads of national importance&mdash;the other point you made&mdash;do not really fall into either of the portfolios that I am involved in. From your remarks, and as a former minister for roads, I think you appreciate the need for such a program. That is a matter for my colleague Minister Sharp. I think there has broadly been a very warm welcome of that proposal by local
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5950"> government, and indeed federal members and states, as being a necessary matter to pursue. I take notice of the points made by the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). It was not part of the budget process, but I am sure that comments that he has made will be passed to Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) raised a range of issues, all of which I do not think I am going to be able to do justice to at the moment, partly because I do not have all the information. Some of it may have been dealt with in estimates, but I will undertake to find out the points that you have referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broadly speaking, you asked the fundamental core question of whether or not there has been any assessment of the cumulative impact of the changes that have arisen in the budget with regard to the film industry. The information that I have, provided by Senator Alston, does not answer that question specifically, but it does point out that the funding for the Film Finance Corporation was maintained. There was a reduction of $5 million in the television production fund to which you referred, but there are continuing access arrangements for the tax deductibility for films, which I think you acknowledged, if I recall your remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning your point about the R&amp;D being reduced, in a sense that is still available through the tax deductibility provisions. The TPF fund still continues, but it has been reduced. That, of course, is to meet broader budget objectives so it may not be quite as detrimental as you point out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of Artbank and the continuing uncertainty, the government is still considering that matter and the points that you made are, of course, noted. I make the point that I know there is no diminution of the personal commitment  from the minister responsible in this area, Senator Alston. I am sure that he will be making decisions that will give effect to recognising the qualities in Artbank. Whether it should be operated by government or by some other private arrangement is the issue that government will have to decide upon. They will obviously be considering that matter in some detail and will make a decision in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning the cultural development assistance and the $1.5 million cuts to the Visions of Australia program, which you yourself commenced, it has been indicated that that will be continuing and you have welcomed that. We certainly welcome that. Concerning maintenance of the funds for the Australia Council, those funds are actually maintained at the same level as in the previous budget, as I understand it. That is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of the library, I simply do not have any information about that, and I do not have any knowledge on that matter but, as I understand it, funds have been applied. Your point was whether or not the amount that is applied is equal to the amount that was anticipated to be applied&mdash;some $25 million versus the $11 million. I would assume that what is taking place here is funding over a period of time. There is a commitment to library matters.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Telstra has advised that it is concerned to abide by recommendations made by a competent authority, in this case the Western Australian Government, which has
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5958"> posted Wittenoom as an area sufficiently contaminated with asbestos fibres as to be dangerous to a person's health.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I am advised that service to Wittenoom has not been discontinued. Telstra has entered into an interim agreement with the residents of Wittenoom to maintain the existing service, so long as it can be maintained, or until permanent service arrangements (as described below) can be implemented.
