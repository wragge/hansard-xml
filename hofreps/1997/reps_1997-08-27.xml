<PARA STYLE="Para">This motion implements the government's response to two old reports of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure: the 1992 report on standing orders governing disorder and strangers and the 1988 report on the publication of tabled papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanation for us dealing with these reports is that we asked the committee to go over all outstanding prior reports of the committee, update those reports and advise the House accordingly. The government has therefore responded. We have consulted with the opposition and other members on the proposed changes to the standing orders and we understand that the opposition is in agreement with the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very briefly, the changes in relation to the standing orders governing disorder and strangers are essentially housekeeping in nature and are in accordance with recommendations of the Procedure Committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will include a reference to sessional orders in part (d) of standing order 303 in relation to the naming of a member; transpose the wording of standing order 308 so that the less severe action of suspension of sitting is referred to first ahead of the reference to the more severe action of adjourning the House in the event of grave disorder in the House; enable a motion requiring a  mem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7020"> ber to attend the house to be moved without notice under standing order 309; remove from standing orders 309 and 310 the references to taking a member or stranger into custody, as the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988 now qualify such actions; remove from standing order 311 the reference to members or other persons being brought to the bar for disciplinary action as such action would be most unlikely given the provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988; require senators, when in the senators gallery, to observe instructions concerning order issued by the chair, standing order 312; and omit standing order 313, which nominally restricts the daily admission of visitors to the general galleries. The restriction was relevant in the old House where gallery space was limited but is no longer necessary on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis in this Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now refer to the government response to the publication of tabled papers. Last but not least on the issue of tabled papers, we are proposing to remove the present anomalous situation of tabled documents being treated differently by the two houses of parliament. The Senate has for many years accorded absolute immunity in respect of all documents tabled in the Senate. In the House at present tabled papers attract absolute immunity only if a publication order is carried. It would be true to say that most members and the community at large would not be aware of its distinction or its implications and would assume that anything tabled in the parliament is a readily available public document. The amendment before the House in relation to standing order 320 will provide absolute immunity for all documents tabled in the House so that there is uniform treatment of papers tabled in the parliament. I thank the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) for his cooperation in these sensible reforms.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The passing of the motion will establish a detailed procedure dealing with protection of persons adversely named in the House. In brief, the procedure envisages that any person adversely referred to in the House may make 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a submission in writing to the Speaker. The Speaker would then have to be satisfied that the submission is not trivial, frivolous, vexatious or offensive and that it is practicable for the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges to consider the submission before referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges. The committee has to be then similarly satisfied before going ahead with its consideration of the submission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reporting to the House on a submission, the committee may recommend that no further action be taken or that a response by the complainant in terms agreed to by the complainant and the committee be published by the House or incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same procedure has been in place in the Senate since 1988 and has apparently worked well. It appears that the relatively stringent ground rules in the procedure are effective in filtering out vague complaints and guarding against rash and clumsy approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All members would be aware that there is a level of concern in the community about the use sometimes made by members of the privilege of freedom of speech in the parliament. It is said to be misused on occasion. I am sure members on all sides are aware of these concerns. The matter was considered thoroughly by the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege some years ago. It concluded that the privilege of freedom of speech was of fundamental importance and that it should not be circumscribed. It recommended, however, that a right of reply procedure should be introduced  in each House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, the Procedure Committee recommended that we introduce the procedure that is now before the House. The procedure will enhance the parliament's standing as, consistent with the rule of natural justice, citizens who feel genuinely aggrieved by adverse mentions in the House will have the ability to seek to reply to the comments made about them. It is my understanding that in the Senate the procedure was never exercised retrospectively when it was introduced in 1988, and now the government intends that any use of the procedure in the House will also be in relation to future proceedings after 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7022"> passage of this motion. This motion is long overdue. Again I thank the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) and other members of this place for their cooperation,  and I commend this motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of parliamentary privilege has been a contentious one for some time. It has been practised in this place over many years, but the original concept was first adopted in the UK Bill of Rights as far back as 1688. The concept of privilege was conferred to ensure that elected representatives of the community could carry out their duties without fear of intimidation or punishment and without improper impediment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is important for us, as members of the parliament, to recognise that, whilst we obtain the privilege in being elected here, it also imposes a responsibility on us to ensure that Australian citizens are not disadvantaged by our immunity. The right of reply, which is proposed here, allows them the opportunity to make their case to the Privileges Committee and, where appropriate, to ensure that the record accurately reflects events. It is just and fair that citizens have the right to ensure that they are able to represent themselves where they feel they have been aggrieved by adverse mention in this place. It is consistent with our system of natural justice and the Australian fundamental sense of fair play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate was the first parliamentary chamber in the world to adopt this practice, and it has been in their chamber since 1988 and used very successfully. The Senate Privileges Committee has developed a number of practices in relation to applications for the right of reply. Such an example is the practice that citizens need to make an application within three months of being named in the chamber. While this is not necessarily a hard and fast rule, it does ensure that applications are genuine and in the spirit of the resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate resolution, which was introduced in 1988, has never been exercised retrospectively, and it is the Labor Party's expectation that any use of this procedure in the House will accord with the practice of the Senate and relate to future proceedings. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a significant occasion for this House and for the Australian people, and I join with the government in commending the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Members may recall that in March this year the House agreed to arrangements enabling the use of electronic communication devices by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for a trial period until the end of the last sittings. The arrangements were derived from the recommendations of a 1994 Procedure Committee report on the application of modern technology to committee proceedings. Members may also recall that the chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), reported to the House at the end of the last sittings on the committee's very positive experience with the use of videoconferencing facilities during the trial and recommended strongly that the House extend the use of such facilities to all its committees in light of the efficiencies and cost savings that could be achieved in committee proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The successful trial of the arrangements is the basis of the motion now before the House to extend the arrangements to all House committees so that they may make use of modern technology as appropriate in future committee proceedings. In putting forward this motion, the committee has also had the benefit of the very encouraging views of other

The extension of these facilities to all other committees is viewed by us as a step forward.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The excise and customs duty on avgas contains a component to recover the costs of aviation terminal and en route navigation services provided to the general aviation sector by Airservices Australia. In reviewing the costs of providing these services for the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year, Airservices Australia proposed a reduction in the duty of 0.6c per litre, which represents a five per cent decrease in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reduction in costs to aircraft operators follows the implementation of an election commitment by the government. This commitment was to freeze the airways component of avgas duty in 1996&hyphen;97, except for movements in the consumer price index, while working towards the implementation of a fairer system of funding for the general aviation sector's contribution to Airservices Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is one item of legislation that has been brought forward by this government which is almost unbelievable. This amendment is not designed to withdraw any legislation that was introduced by the previous Labor government and it is not designed to amend any legislation that was introduced by the previous Labor government, because the previous government's industrial relations legislation was withdrawn entirely by the Howard coalition government. What this amendment proposes to do is to amend this government's own legislation in relation to unfair dismissals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are provisions in the government's Workplace Relations Act, as we know, to deal with the question of unfair dismissals. What this amending legislation proposes to do is to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7025"> withdraw the protection against unfair dismissals&mdash;using the government's own expression and term&mdash;from all of those employees who are employed in small businesses which are identified as businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. Not immediately but as soon as the amendment becomes operative, any people who become employed by a small business will have that protection withdrawn from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The protection was designed to ensure that employees right across all employment areas in Australia would not be subjected to harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal. In this amendment the only exception for those people employed by small business is apprentices. That is an interesting exception too, because it causes us to raise the question as to whether this proposal to withdraw that protection from employees in small businesses is fair, just and equitable, whether this government in introducing this amendment believes that the amendment has those qualities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the amendment has those qualities, why then exclude apprentices? Quite clearly the government is embarrassed about the application of these provisions to apprentices in small businesses, but it will apply to everyone else, including trainees. Any young employee not identified as an apprentice will have this unfair dismissal protection withdrawn from him or her. The government, to protect what shambles of a reputation it has left, has chosen to exclude apprentices because it is embarrassed and ashamed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is claiming that this legislation is designed to assist in its package of proposals to benefit small business. Small business is not concerned about this issue. As some of the other people speaking for the opposition have indicated, small business is concerned about economic growth, they are concerned about sales and they are concerned about the capacity of their own businesses to satisfy the growing demands of a buoyant, growing economy. If the government was so concerned about small business or about the economy generally, it would be ensuring that the economy was growing instead of applying the brakes to the extent that it has been.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes the removal of protection from a large and growing number of employees. It will apply only to those employees who are employed by small business from the moment they are employed after the amendment becomes effective&mdash;it will not apply to those current employees in small business&mdash;but obviously that will be a growing number and eventually it will overtake the lot. Since the government itself identifies the question of unfair dismissal in the terms that I have indicated&mdash;harsh, unjust or unreasonable&mdash;it is clear that the government is prepared to see employees in small business dismissed in a harsh, unjust or unreasonable way. There is no other explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this is an amendment to the government's own legislation, we are not unmindful of the fact that the government is using this simply as another device to belt industrial protection which exists in Australia for Australian employees and which in a very real sense has developed a coherent structure of industrial protections since, I suppose, 1904, the original Arbitration and Conciliation Act, which incidentally, Mr Speaker, as you know and as all members should know, was introduced by a conservative government, a coalition government under Deakin. Deakin made the point when he was introducing it that it was designed, in effect, to civilise the industrial system and the industrial process. It is this government, the contemporary coalition conservative government, which puts all that asunder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will continue to be some forms of protection under the anti-discrimination law and the common law, particularly the common law in relation to contracts, but that obviously is not enough. If it had been enough, the government would not have made provision for questions of unfair dismissal in its legislation in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for the opposition, Bob McMullan, the member for Canberra, last night gave some good examples of unfair dismissals for which there will be no protection for employees in business with fewer than 15 employees when this exemption becomes fully operative. He included examples where males or females subjected to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7026"> sexual harassment in the workplace in a small business can be unfairly dismissed without any recourse to the court or to the system&mdash;harsh, unjust and unreasonable. He gave examples of employees who had refused to cook the books for their employers who wanted to rip off the taxation system and who had suffered unfair, unjust and unreasonable dismissal, with no protection. He gave examples where employees would refuse to carry out instructions which could have endangered them or their workmates and as a result of that could be dismissed without protection&mdash;unfair, unjust and unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a shameful piece of legislation. This government should be ashamed of it. I will be interested to hear members of the government get up and try to defend it and attempt to justify it&mdash;people who I know have some conscience, people who have concern and people who have considerable experience in areas of this kind. Shame on them!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members are aware that this legislation is discriminatory. It discriminates, for example, between employees in large and small business. If you are in large business you are protected; if you are in small business you will be thrown to the wolves. It discriminates between those who were employed before and those who are employed after the proposed amendment begins to operate. If you were employed before it you are protected; if you are employed after it you are thrown to the wolves. It discriminates between apprentices, who will continue to be protected, and others, including trainees of the same age as the apprentices. If you are a kid in small business and you are a trainee and you are dismissed in an unfair, unreasonable or harsh way, you can be thrown to the wolves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not suggesting that all owners, all proprietors, all managers in small business are the wolves, but clearly some of them are. We know them. Don't let's pretend that they are not. We know that some of them sexually harass. We know that some of them intimidate. We know that some of them try to rip off the taxation system. We know that there are some people who will take short-cuts on questions of safety. We know they are there and we on this side believe that their employ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ees should be protected against them. The government and those on the other side who support the government do not believe, apparently, that that protection is necessary or desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the legislation that the government is introducing is fair and equitable and just and appropriate, why exclude the apprentices? Is it because the government is embarrassed that this legislation, which it is responsible for, will apply to apprentices, that apprentices will be seen to be sometimes dismissed as a result of harsh or unjust or unreasonable procedures by small business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the member for La Trobe, Bob Charles, last night when he was attempting, obviously in an embarrassed way, to defend the government's proposal, make out a case against any unfair dismissal protection and the ways in which that might be implemented. What he did not do was to make out a clear case in favour of this discriminating legislation. I think we are going to see, in the pattern of the government supporters' approach to this legislation, criticism of unfair dismissal legislation and the need for proprietors, owners and managers to have some flexibility in their approach to management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process of their doing that, they will be in effect endorsing the type of comment which has been made by their own Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I want to give an example of that. On 7 July this year on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today Show</EMPHASIS> the Prime Minister was urging striking workers at Hunter Valley No. 1 mine, an area just near me, employing some of my constituents, to accept the pay offer that they had been made. The Prime Minister's comment in relation to that was almost unbelievable to me; it was incredible. He told the workers, `The pay deal you are being offered by the company is greatly in excess of what you now have and I think it is only fair and reasonable that'&mdash;and I emphasise these last words&mdash;`a company be able to run its mine.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sentiment which underlies this government's approach to the whole issue of industrial relations. The government believes that the people who have any proprietary interests in business are the owners and the managers; the employees are the factory 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7027"> fodder. The government believes you have the bosses and the workers; you have the masters and the servants. The point I want to make in connection with this is that that exists no longer. Production is a social process undertaken by equals. There are no longer masters and servants. Production is a social process undertaken by equals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an offence as well for the Prime Minister to say to my constituents, `Listen, cop it. Here's a pay deal that you're being offered which is greatly in excess of what you now have. In effect, we'll buy your dignity, we'll buy your self-respect, we'll increase your pay packet and you can cop it.' My constituents at Hunter Valley No. 1 mine said, `Like hell we will!' and they were right. I endorse them, I support them and I applaud them. They will not sell their rights. They have fought hard enough and long enough in order to secure those rights and they will not sell them. I urge them and appeal to them to never sell their rights and to never accept a proposition that it is only the manager and the owners of a business who have any right to say how it operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude on this point: I repeat again, for the benefit of those people who do not know the changes that have taken place in the last 97 years in Australia, that production is now a social process. Production is undertaken by equals. Production is no longer a relationship of master and servant. We will not allow that to return, nor will the trade union movement, nor will the honest, dignified and honourable employees throughout Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As an Australian who is concerned about jobs for the unemployed and who is concerned about the young people who have not had a chance to even take their first tentative steps into the work force, I rise today to support the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . This bill is designed to exclude from the federal unfair dismissal provisions new employees in businesses with fewer than 15 workers. The particular proposed amendment does not affect employees' rights in relation to unlawful dismissal. Let me stress that. The previous speaker, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), seemed most concerned that some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how a clock was being turned back to Dickensian times where employees were once again to be subjected to conditions in the mines where children have harnesses on their backs pulling out coal. Let me remind the previous speaker that this proposed amendment does not affect employees' rights in relation to unlawful dismissal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will not apply to existing employees, only to employees who are employed after the passage of this legislation. Some people may argue that all employees should be subject to the same work force regulation. I think the previous speaker was trying to say that. But, unfortunately, this ignores a fundamental reality. Small, often family businesses, those with fewer than 15 staff, typically do not have the resources to sustain a long, drawn-out legal battle with an employee who has been given a bit of an opportunity to make some extra money from the boss when they have been dismissed on the grounds of some activity which has endangered the rest of the work force, or has been illegal in itself, or it might be that the business can no longer afford to employ that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any activity requiring management time to be diverted from normal business activity could and in the past has created a serious threat to the viability of many small businesses, and therefore of course to the very jobs of the other people employed there. If the boss goes down, so do the other people's jobs. We do not believe that is in the interests of the Australian economy, and certainly the work force out there has had it in the neck for too long. They along with the employers in this day and age want a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A culture of fear was created by Labor's unfair dismissal laws. The reality of falling victim to a vexatious claimant became commonplace in the last years of the Labor government. Businesses knew that, no matter how justified their dismissal of an employee was, they could expect to see the charges of unfair dismissal laid. They knew that along with that went costly financial and emotional implications&mdash;the damage to their business's reputation and the loss of their good standing in the community, as stories were circulated about how they had treated that employee in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7028"> a cavalier or illegal manner. In a small community, you can imagine that the damage done to a small business can last for a very, very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So commonplace were these vexatious unfair dismissal actions under Labor that small businesses&mdash;the small shops, offices, the little garages, the little manufacturers&mdash;began to think that it was in fact safer not to take a risk with the employment of a young, inexperienced new worker, perhaps someone new to the community, someone they had not known before, someone who did not have references that they could check out. They decided that it was better not to take the risk to take on that new person in fear of being taken to the cleaners through the unfair dismissal laws that gave a vexatious claimant a windfall final payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every member of this House will have files of horror stories in their electorate offices where small business people have recounted to them the usual cost&mdash;about $8,000 out of pocket&mdash;if someone decides to `go you' for unfair dismissal. The horror stories are all about how it is much better to roll over, pay the $8,000 and try to get on with your business, than stand up for your rights, and for fairness in the old unfair dismissal claim process. Is that what this nation wants to have happen? Is that what this nation really needs to be on about when our most important priority as a government is jobs, jobs and more jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just how many businesses are going to be affected by this amendment? The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia has calculated that 55 per cent of private sector jobs in Australia are in the small business sector and that accounts for 1.1 million of the 1.2 million jobs created in the decade to 1994-95&mdash;in other words, 92.5 per cent&mdash;were generated by small firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our large firms have used the recession to become labour efficient. They will not be the major sector taking up Australia's unemployment slack, because they are essentially efficient users of capital. Smaller firms employ people to produce and the larger ones employ capital to produce. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, businesses 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with fewer than 20 people represent 94 per cent of the businesses in Australia and two&hyphen;thirds of these employ fewer than five people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across Australia, we are talking about tiny little outfits with perhaps the husband and wife and one or two people. They are the sorts of businesses who are caught up in Labor's absurd unfair dismissal merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round. You can imagine a dairy farmer and his wife taking on, for perhaps the first time in their lives, a young person to support them with their milking. They have an unfair dismissal claim brought against them. That $8,000 that should have been going into their own business support pays this person off. In the future, they do not employ another person. They work harder and longer hours in their dairy exercise, trying to make up for the employed staff that they have had to pay the $8,000 for. They are driven further and further, without holiday, without relief on the weekends, because the fear of taking on another person who might yet again take them to the cleaners is just too great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy. Allowing small businesses to grow, employ, export and invest is a top priority of this government, and it is certainly a top priority in my electorate of Murray. Any impediment to the short&hyphen; or long&hyphen;term survival of a small business is a serious threat to this government's key objective: to push down unemployment levels and create an environment where there is real work for all who can do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's small business package is critically important for the growth of regional economies and for Australia as a whole. Manufacturing in the region which I represent in northern Victoria is almost totally dependent on small, local primary industries&mdash;industries where the average employed unit is less than five&mdash;but, unlike most of the rest of Australia, we continue to have a predominance of local ownership of businesses. We have lots of cooperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most significant effects of the dependence on primary industries in a region like ours is the seasonal fluctuation in employment. This can vary by 50 to 100 per cent each year. So we must have flexibility in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7029"> work force arrangements. It is essential for the survival of businesses which follow the seasonal cycles of round&hyphen;the&hyphen;clock work and down time. Under the Labor work force relationships regime, too many enterprises were straightjacketed into inflexible arrangements which took away their ability to negotiate with their employees and which took away, in the long run, their ability to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw countries like New Zealand revolutionise their meat works sector with enterprise agreements which put ownership largely back into the hands of New Zealand nationals and put abattoirs back into a profit mode. Australia still limps along behind. In Victoria, an abattoir owner was driven out of Dandenong by relentless industrial unrest over years. The workers were pitted against the owner in such a manner that, eventually, he simply walked away. He has now opened up a greenfields site abattoir in my electorate. It is operated in a most highly efficient manner as a totally exporting abattoir with workers whose loyalties are absolutely to the business and who understand that their own futures and their own ability to continue to support their families is dependent on the viability of that business in the long term. They understand that they are in a partnership. It is that sort of worker&hyphen;employer relationship that is the difference between survival and bankruptcy in all economies. Throw unfair dismissal laws, such as we had, into that arena and the sense of cooperation and equal dependence on one another goes; and instead you have an atmosphere of opportunism, conflict and divisiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill still imposes a number of obligations on employers with regard to termination of employment. Employees will continue to have the right to take action against unlawful dismissal. The prohibited reasons for dismissal under the Workplace Relations Act are substantially the same as under the previous Industrial Relations Act. The bill, as the previous speaker mentioned, does not affect the rights of apprentices because apprentices are already excluded under the federal unfair dismissal provisions by regulations under the act on the basis that they are under a contract 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of employment for a specified period of time. Nothing in this amendment affects the responsibility of employers to treat their employees in anything other than a lawful manner. We are not setting the clock back; we are in fact marching forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every successful business person knows that their business is dependent on a loyal, skilled and efficient work force. Quality of service and quality of output depend on employee attitudes to their work and their sense that they are valued by their employers. A good manager knows that employees expect fair reward, recognition and respect in return for their loyalty and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any small business that tries to take unfair advantage of its employees' exemption from the unfair dismissal laws could and should expect to see the productivity of their remaining work force fall, and absenteeism and staff turnovers rise. They should expect to reap the consequences of being un-Australian and poor business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this amendment, employees are still protected by the Workplace Relations Act 1996. In particular, section 170CK protects employees against dismissal for any discriminatory reason; for example, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. No&hyphen;one will be able to be dismissed on any of those bases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 170MU and 170WE prohibit dismissal of an employee if she or he engages in protected industrial action. Section 298K is about freedom of association. It prohibits dismissal which involves victimisation or is otherwise contrary to freedom of association. Section 170CM prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age. This is with the exception of cases where there is serious misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's commitment to the new amendment for micro&hyphen;business was announced on 24 March 1997 as part of the government's small business package. Since that date, I am sure that representatives from both sides of this House have heard of its unani 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7030"> mous support and have received congratulations from the small business sector of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are no longer going to see the balance between the rights of employers and employees tipped so far towards the side of the employees that the work force is jeopardised. In fact, the young, the least experienced and people setting out on their first job were finding barriers to their employment because of the reputations of others in the work force who had gone before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of unfair dismissal claims has dropped dramatically since the Workplace Relations Act came into effect on 31 December 1996. In the first half of 1997 the number of federal unfair dismissal claims was down 55 per cent over the same period in 1996. If all the unfair dismissal claims in the past were bona fide, why have we had that incredible drop in numbers since we introduced this new legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One business leader in our area has told me that this new unfair dismissal amendment is going to make the difference between him working longer and harder hours himself and putting on six new employees&mdash;young people who he thought would probably make a good go of it but the risk of taking them on under the old regime was too great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a long and proud history of worker advocacy&mdash;a history peppered with world firsts: milestones like the eight&hyphen;hour day and the secret ballot, which is called `the Australian ballot' in the US. What this simplified, more flexible system does is recognise the independence and individuality of Australian workers. It gives them a chance to speak for themselves and to work out arrangements that work for them and their employers as they try to deal with one another in a way that ensures that business is sustained and grows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not yet seen the full impact of a new system where industrial relations are more cooperative but I can assure this House that, with our government's intention of bringing back a balance, we will see more jobs&mdash;and that is what this government is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can but wonder at the reasons for debating this Workplace Relations Amendment Bill in the House today. Are we debating this bill because the government honestly believes it will bring tangible benefits to the small business sector&mdash;the constituency it likes to call its own? Or does the necessity for this legislation arise from some base and cynical motive that puts the coalition's interests above those of hundreds of thousands of decent, hardworking Australians&mdash;an agenda perhaps driven by the H.R. Nicholls Society?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the evidence presented to date would indicate that the latter is the case. Please allow me to explain. There has been much hue and cry over the previous government's unfair dismissal legislation and regulations&mdash;in particular, its impact upon employers&mdash;ever since the Labor government first addressed this issue back in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition made no bones during the last federal election campaign that one of the centrepieces of its industrial relations policy would be the rewriting of the unfair dismissal legislation. But the only serious review of the operation of Labor's unfair dismissal legislation showed that the conservatives' hyperbole was simply not supported by the facts. Amongst claims by opponents of the scheme were suggestions that, firstly, the legislation by its nature encouraged too many claims, many of which were not serious and were simply unjustifiable. These led to increased pressure on employers through increased legal costs and time commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second claim that I would like to draw the House's attention to is the fact that Labor's scheme was costing jobs. We had claims like the one from the Executive Director of the Employers Federation of New South Wales, Gary Brack, that anecdotal evidence indicated that the unfair dismissal laws may have dissuaded Australia's small business sector from creating an extra 100,000 to 200,000 jobs. I cannot imagine where he could have pulled that one from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Court of Australia&mdash;unlike Mr Brack&mdash;has carried out a thorough investigation of the workings of the unfair dismissal legislation and has provided 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7031"> what can only be described as a detailed critique of many of the employer criticisms of the previous law, in its 1995&hyphen;96 annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the basis of the findings detailed in that report, Chief Justice Wilcox was able to claim, during the 1996 election campaign, that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were generally working well and that, rather than employees being to blame, the main problem was the bad conduct and poor human resource management practices of many of the employers who were involved in unfair dismissal cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the 1995&hyphen;96 Industrial Relations Court annual report's findings were that the controversy over the unfair dismissal provisions was fuelled by a degree of deliberate misrepresentation. It found that the Labor government had not successfully explained and justified its laws; hence, public perceptions, according to the court, were able to be unfairly swayed. It also found that in 1994&hyphen;95 only 12 per cent, and in the following year 15.8 per cent, of the finalised cases were resolved either at or after trial. In other words, most of those cases did not even come to trial; they were effectively settled out of court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From late 1995 onwards the total number of unfair dismissal applications represented approximately only two per cent of total involuntary terminations&mdash;far from the perception that employers actually had a good success rate under the old law. So much for the claim by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) that employers suffered at the hands of vexatious claimants, given the court's findings that employers had a good success rate under the old law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The court also found in its report that, contrary to some suggestions, people who win unfair dismissal claims represent a fairly normal cross&hyphen;section of the work force. Finally, it found that, although according to ABS figures 91.7 per cent of employers have fewer than 20 employees, a survey of those employers involved in unfair dismissal showed that only 33 per cent of respondents were small businesses, proving that small businesses are indeed underrepresented in unfair dismissal actions. So much for what the member for Murray termed Labor's unfair 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dismissal merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round. The Industrial Relations Court annual report's findings clearly put paid to such claims on her part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the coalition had set its course and we saw the unfair dismissal laws undergo extensive amendment as part of the government's Workplace Relations Act. This of course came into effect on 1 January this year. The government has since been falling over itself in attempts to praise its own policies. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said of the legislation in parliament on 23 May last year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is replacing Labor's arrangements with a new unfair dismissal scheme&mdash;a system which provides employees with access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal, based on the principle of a fair go all round. It is a scheme that . . . ensures legalism is minimised, while discouraging frivolous and malicious claims . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Similar sentiments were uttered by the same minister on 21 November last year, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous . . . system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. That was Labor's legacy, and the government has buried it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite demonstrating that many of the allegations levied against Labor's unfair dismissal regulations were fatuous and clearly without foundation, and despite the government singing the praises of its own recent reforms in this area, it now wishes to exempt small business from the operation of its own unfair dismissal laws because it says that this is necessary to boost employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government, in mounting this argument, is admitting that its Workplace Relations Act has added to the tide of unemployment, then I can see why it would want to exempt small business from it. The evidence to date suggests that changing the unfair dismissal laws has not led to an improvement in employment. Since January this year, when the new laws came into effect, national trend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7032"> employment growth has continued to fall according to the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compared to the government's lack of faith in its own legislation, I find myself in the somewhat novel position of counselling it to have a little faith and give its own scheme a chance to operate before it loses confidence in it. After all, it has only been up and running now for a few months. The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 22 July this year summed up the situation rather succinctly when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government wants to amend the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Bill to make them less exacting on small business&mdash;those employing fewer than 15 people&mdash;because it thinks present provisions are an impediment to employment in the business sector. Mr Reith seems to overlook the fact that it was he who introduced the present provisions less than a year ago, claiming that they provided a `fair go all round'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is now saying the laws need to be changed because they still represent a disincentive for small business to employ people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The editorial went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, from the employees perspective, why should they be in any different position just because they are employed by a small business rather than a large one? The danger here is an erosion of the principle of equality before the law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What this legislation undeniably does is create two classes of workers. We will have an estimated 1.6 million workers in small business who will lose their right to challenge for unfair dismissal and who, in the quite correct words of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), will be thrown to the wolves. These workers will be compared to around 6.8 million of their colleagues in the non&hyphen;small business sector who do have access to unfair dismissal provisions. The opposition, and in particular the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), who is at the table this morning, have clearly demonstrated many cases where dutiful and hardworking Australians would be denied basic justice under the government's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can demonstrate many recent examples from the retail industry, for example, where employees in small business have needed to access unfair dismissal procedures. One such 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case involved a 23-year-old employee in a delicatessen section of a supermarket who had been employed for six weeks and was sacked simply because a newer employee had more experience. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said on the John Laws program in January last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard&hyphen;working employee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet, if this bill exempting small businesses from unfair dismissal procedures passes, I contend that is exactly what we will have, despite the Prime Minister's claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to unfair dismissals, at no stage prior to the election did the coalition ever foreshadow that it would exempt small business from unfair dismissal laws. In fact, the coalition made it quite clear&mdash;as, indeed, did the member for Flinders, my electorate neighbour&mdash;that small business exemption was not on the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, as well as some of the points I have already detailed, the opposition believes the following key issues. We believe that the proposed exemption to unfair dismissal laws is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Bell report; that the proposal will also add to job insecurity; that the proposal does not distinguish between unfair dismissal claims on the basis of the merits of the case; that the proposal is fundamentally flawed and unfair to small business employees; that the proposal is fundamentally unfair to many decent employers; that the proposal may work as a disincentive to the growth of small businesses; and, finally, I contend that the proposal may encourage the use of artificial employment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is abundantly clear that the government is not enacting these changes because it is heeding a call from the small business sector. A recent Morgan and Banks job survey showed that 80 per cent of small businesses stated that the current existence of unfair dismissal laws would not affect their decision to employ further staff. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index showed that just five per cent of small businesses were concerned about industrial laws. Also, in a survey the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Indus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7033"> try ranked unfair dismissal laws as coming seventh in a list of eight main impediments to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to conclude my comments by highlighting a source of pressure which I alluded to in my opening paragraph and which I think is driving the government's agenda on this issue. Michael Warby, the H.R. Nicholls Society board member, said as recently as last Thursday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Workplace Relations Act is a policy failure and a political failure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government betrayal of basic promises was not only morally wrong, it was also politically foolish. It has broken basic promises, not only without benefit to itself, but in ways which positively damage itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Warby went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this matter, the government can be respected neither for its moral backbone nor its political acumen.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Michael Warby went even further the next day by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only does the act do little or nothing for hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians, this pallid compromise signifies a government giving away its political soul for a mess of pottage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I contend that it could well be that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is at least, in part, attempting to mollify the H.R. Nicholls Society, of which his close friend the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is a prominent member, by arguing so hard for a piece of legislation that he inherently knows is both unwarranted and unfair.</PARA></SPEECH>

Indeed, these unfair dismissal laws have been on the minds of small business owners in Swan for quite some time, and they want them changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's workplace relations reforms, encompassing the Workplace Relations Act and now the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, were overwhelmingly supported by the people of Australia when this government was elected in March 1996. This bill seeks to amend the Workplace Relations Act to exclude small businesses with fewer than 15 staff members from the operation of the federal unfair dismissal provisions where the staff member has been employed for less than 12 months. This is a commonsense measure that recognises that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7034"> small businesses of this size face additional pressure and the current laws are especially damaging to business growth and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current unfair dismissal laws have had a disproportionately adverse effect on these small businesses, with the proprietor being obliged to attend the unfair dismissal hearings personally. We are not talking about BHP; we are talking about small businesses, whether they be a bakery, a newsagency or a lunch bar. They do not have a personnel manager, they do not have a chief of staff or a human resource manager or a proprietor. More often than not, the small business owner personally employs these staff, pays them each fortnight, works alongside them and works extremely hard for long hours to make a living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know those on the opposition benches are a bit out of touch with small businesses, as they cannot see past their ACTU roots, but the current unfair dismissal laws are damaging to these businesses. Let me give you an example of a business proprietor in my electorate who is currently embroiled in an unfair dismissal appeal&mdash;an appeal which has had several adverse effects on not the employee but the employer. This person, who had a formerly successful real estate agency, is now busy and preoccupied with this protracted legal case. It is having a negative effect on both the productivity and the success of the company. The agency proprietors are throwing bad money after bad money trying to bring this episode to a close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case was resolved originally with the court awarding several thousands of dollars to an employee who has been paid a retainer but who was not selling anything. Obviously the employer, after a certain amount of time, decided this was not viable. The person was costing the company money and was not bringing in any returns. He was not being productive. There is no sin against wanting to be productive or wanting to make a profit. The agency proprietor, whom I have known locally for some time, had dormant multiple sclerosis which has resurfaced as a result of the trauma of this case and the associated financial and business costs. This person is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> presently wheelchair bound, adding further stress to the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commonsense would tell you that the employer should have the right to employ the best person for the job in their own businesses. Of more concern is that this proprietor will now be extremely wary of employing more staff, which is obviously a disincentive for jobs. Unfortunately, the environment that the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith has left us with is that small businesses now view taking on staff more as a gamble which could have a costly side effect if it does not pay off. Instead, we should be encouraging small business owners to think, `Business is going well. I need more help to expand. Employing more staff is going to help me. Employing more staff is a positive move. Employing more staff is good for business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said in the House that I do not deny for one moment that there are some unprincipled employers who unfairly dismiss staff. However, realistically, employers have nothing to gain by dismissing staff at will. Recruiting new staff is a lengthy and involved process which is followed by a large investment from the employer in time, money and training as well as experiencing the productivity slump that often occurs with the commencement of new staff. Any good business person will tell you that a high turnover of staff is certainly not good for business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even so, under the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, employees are still protected by the Workplace Relations Act in the following ways. Employees are protected against dismissal for discriminatory reasons such as AIDS, pregnancy, et cetera. Employees are protected from dismissal if they take part in industrial action and seek a certified agreement or an Australian workplace agreement industrial action. Employees are protected from dismissal involving victimisation in the freedom of association section of the act. Employees are protected if they are an apprentice in small business in recognition that their formal qualifications may be affected by dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amused to hear the Labor Party say over and over again that small business does not want to change the unfair dismissal laws, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7035"> that small businesses which employ fewer than 15 people or small businesses with staff who have worked less than 12 months do not want to be exempt from the laws. They are oblivious to the calls from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, from the Australian Hotels Association, from the Australian Retailers Association and many others for the ALP and the Democrats to let this amendment pass and go through the Senate, where we know it will probably be log&hyphen;jammed on the instruction of their leaders&mdash;their weak leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to invite those members of the opposition to take some of the phone calls that I receive in my office on this issue from the small business owners in Swan. These include small business owners that completed the survey which I mentioned earlier. These include the small business owners that welcome the government's move to give them a fair go after listing the current unfair dismissal laws as a major impediment to growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very same businesses were ringing my office to find out further details in the legislation and to find out when it would come into effect. They wanted to get on with it. They were generally gob&hyphen;smacked to find out that it was being blocked in the Senate by the Labor Party and the Democrats. They asked, `Didn't the Labor Party say they were going to support this? Didn't the Labor Party say the legislation made sense? Doesn't the Labor Party want to help us?' These are the real concerns of the business community and the employers out in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot speak for the Labor Party, naturally, but the opposition also said that the work for the dole scheme was not wanted for the voters, and the backflip of the member for Brand, Kim Beazley, on that is now legendary. Since the legislation on work for the dole was enacted, more than 17,000 work for the dole handbooks have been requested by community groups looking to take part in this. Since work for the dole was instituted, there have been more requests from the unemployed to take part than there are positions available. In other words, it is very popular; they want to be a part of it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then the government also has been looking at the possible extension of the scheme because of the overwhelming support from industry. This is the same initiative that the Labor Party said the people of Australia did not want. Work for the dole and now the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill both are examples of how the Labor Party has not learnt its lesson since March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP refuses to listen to the unemployed and small business owners of Australia. Small businesses in Australia know what they want, and now they have to look to the coalition to get that delivered. They are now working with the coalition to achieve the goals that will bring real benefits and create real jobs, not the mickey mouse training jobs that the previous government gave to unemployed Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is evidence that the coalition listens to employers around the country&mdash;employers who provide jobs and create a workplace, not the people who make a living out of telling people how to create problems in the workplace, that is, the declining trade unions and their officials. It is high time that balance is restored in our unfair dismissal laws to give small businesses a fair go, at the same time protecting the mechanisms that assist workers who have been unfairly dismissed. The Labor Party knows this is wanted by the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this amendment because it allows small businesses to get on with what they do best, which is providing jobs for all Australians, particularly our young people. I hope that the opposition finally admits to this. I say to the member for Brand, Mr Beazley, that small business people looking for work at the moment would certainly welcome another backflip from you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996, as has been pointed out, in order to exempt businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provisions of that act. These changes do not affect the rights of employees in relation to unlawful as opposed to unfair dismissal, and obviously that is as it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7036">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government extended minimum protections to all workers and established that federal laws were dominant over state based systems in regard to the termination of employment. However, a series of regulations amended this cover to allow exemptions for fixed&hyphen;term, casual and probationary employees, and, again, in 1994 further changes were made to exempt employees engaged to perform a specific task and probationary employees whose terms of probation were determined prior to hiring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was nothing new in this. As an employer in the media industry, I had utilised such understandings for many years in the hiring of journalists, camera operators and editors in a highly competitive environment where excellence of product and no room for inefficiency were hallmarks of the news business. That flexibility and workplace arrangement gave me the freedom to review employment after three months, and I must say that only once in 20 years was it necessary to invoke the terms of the out clause in the agreement. That was in a workplace that involved about 15 to 20 workers. So it was a small employer although the company overall was fairly large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Keating government was trying to accommodate employers who regarded the Industrial Reform Act 1993 as too inflexible, there were other employers in the community going about their business with no difficulties in reaching probationary agreements with their employees. However, there were obvious difficulties for very small businesses which were unable to absorb the inefficiency of a poorly performing employee if that employee dug his or her heels in or where the reasons for termination were obvious but the employee was prepared to exploit every avenue of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfair dismissal law was a disincentive to employment, and that was made patently clear to me when I spoke with many in the course of the last election campaign. However, I put to the House and the government that, if we think the unfair dismissal issue is the key factor impacting on small business, then we are way off the mark. One dominant, major concern of small business, by quite an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amount more important than the unfair dismissal provisions, apart from continuing slack demand and a public that has no spending confidence, is the exploitative rental regime, particularly in major regional centres. Overheads for small business are crippling and continuing high interest rates for business loans are also part of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax system is another concern, with this government taking some small steps towards removing compliance costs on tax, particularly in the area of fringe benefits. But they do not really benefit the very small business much at all. Small business is struggling, and the 800,000 small businesses in Australia are not prepared to take on that extra one worker&mdash;not because of the unfair dismissal law, but because of all those other costs of doing business in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a cautious supporter of a goods and services tax as part of overall tax reform in this country. But the more I look at it the more it seems it could well be another huge impost on small business, with 800,000 small businesses becoming tax collectors and the only real beneficiaries being the tax assessment industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax reform is the single biggest issue confronting this economy. In emphasising the cost to employment of the unfair dismissal laws, the government is being too cute by half. The unfair dismissal laws are not the reason small business is not putting people on. It is those other slugs&mdash;indirect and direct taxes&mdash;that hit business at every turn. I spoke with a tax expert yesterday, and he said that most small businesses declare only about 50 per cent of their income to survive&mdash;not necessarily to avoid their public responsibilities but to survive. They simply cannot afford to put more people on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reasons for small business failure lie in the pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>, from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Here lie the secrets to struggling small business. It has nothing to do with unfair dismissal laws, which the government has trumpeted as virtually the only reason why small business is reluctant to employ.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7037">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for regulation of franchising; failure of banks and finance companies to fulfil obligations to clients; unfair conduct in commercial transaction affecting small business&mdash;it is all there in the report. The Wallis report on the financial system is still there on the shelf alongside the fair trading report. Each has a wide&hyphen;ranging set of recommendations for improving the lot of small business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retail tenancy and franchising are probably the two major issues affecting the small business operators with whom I speak. Unfair dismissal regulations are way down the list. In one of the contributions to this debate last night I think I heard that something in the order of three per cent of respondents to surveys say that unfair dismissal is their major concern. It is all those other things that are impacting so heavily on small business that we should be legislating on and dealing with to get small business moving again. The people I speak with say, `We want to be in a position to employ before we worry too much about the terms and conditions of employment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me recount the tale of one employer in a small smash repair business in my electorate. That business, which employs 30 people, was caught by the operation of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. They paid their compulsory superannuation contribution late, but they paid&mdash;as they were asked to by the fund&mdash;directly to a fund and not through the voucher system, as required by the act. They thought that by paying the amount, which was about $13,000, late they had met their obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, they have since found out that the act does not recognise such payments, and they have been forced to pay the same amount to the tax office, as well as interest, a late payment fee and an administration charge. That was $21,000 all up, on top of their original obligation of $13,000. They have been forced to pay more than twice for one innocent oversight. I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) seven weeks ago, detailing the plight of this small business, but so far I have received no response.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is needed is an amendment to the act so that a small business of this nature is not penalised in such a way. In all innocence these people paid the same superannuation contributions on demand to both the fund and the tax office. They paid twice and, so far, advice to me from the firm's accountants, the super fund and the tax office is that the double payments remain in force and are likely to do so. That is not a very happy group of operators of small business out there in terms of the sorts of promises that were made about helping small business to get back on its feet. How absurd that set of situations is for them. It is little wonder that my constituents are wondering what all the hype about a new deal for small business is. This problem could be solved by a simple amendment, but that seems to be too difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming message I get is that the climate for small business has to improve markedly before confidence returns. That will only come through taxation reform, the overhaul of the ridiculous anomalies in the system, exemplified by the case I have just recounted, and through implementation of the recommendations&mdash;which go to the heart of small business confidence and ultimate survival in this country&mdash;of a bipartisan committee of this House. This and future governments will never again have quite the opportunity to tackle these issues head on and show real leadership on the big ticket items affecting our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been argued that this bill is necessary to ensure continuing growth in employment in small business and that it reflects the special burdens carried by small business in defending unfair dismissal claims. It has been argued that it does not affect the rights of existing employees or apprentices and is consistent with the exemptions available under the ILO termination of employment convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no great objections to these arguments. What I do object to is the emphasis given to this measure as the panacea for curing the ills of small business. It will not do that, and every small business operator knows that. It is no good standing here in question time and arguing the unfair dismissal case and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7038"> saying, `That is what is worrying small business out there,' because it is not. These changes will have but a marginal impact on the viability of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have detailed the big ticket items confronting small business and the reasons why small business is not generating the employment it should. I believe employment should be based on mutual trust. It certainly is in most rural and country employment situations. The complexity of unfair dismissal laws has acted, no doubt, as a barrier between employer and employee but it is not the major barrier to small business revival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that these amendments will enable some unscrupulous employers to exploit their current position of strength in the labour market. This does tilt the industrial legislation more in favour of the employer. But, if it helps encourage more jobs, I can only support it, with those reservations. But, as I have said, unfair dismissal laws are not the albatross to small business and employment growth that this government would have us believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Get out there and talk with small business operators, many of whom are now looking beyond the government and the opposition for answers to their problems. Sadly, some of those apparent answers being peddled by populist reactionaries are not answers at all; they target quite unfairly groups within our society as the cause of our economic ills. But small business's frustration&mdash;that times are not improving and that both this government and the one before do not understand&mdash;is such that many are prepared to embrace a simplistic asking of the questions that bother them, thinking that they are also hearing the answer.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment is very clear. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 to this Bill will provide that an employee (other than an apprentice), who is first engaged by the relevant employer after the commencement of the Bill, will not be able to make an application on the ground that the termination of his or her employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, or on grounds including that ground, if he or she was employed by an employer who employed no more than 15 employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exclusion will not affect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the rights of existing employees;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the rights of apprentices; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the rights of small business employees to take action against unlawful <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is important at this point to clarify what we consider to be `unlawful'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>  states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Unlawful' (as opposed to `unfair') dismissal includes dismissal for discriminatory reasons such as sexual preference, age, union membership and family responsibilities. It is also unlawful to dismiss a worker because they engaged in protected (lawful) industrial action in negotiating a new certified agreement or Australian Workplace Agreement. Allegations of unlawful dismissal are initiated in the AIRC. The Commission must seek to resolve a claim by conciliation before determining whether to refer it to the Federal Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With that in mind, there have been many examples put forward by the ALP here today and yesterday. These statements are nothing more than blatant attempts to mislead the people as the majority of these examples were unlawful dismissals. They would not stand up in court and they would constitute an unlawful dismissal and, of course, as I said, be challenged. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7039">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point it is now necessary to define `unfair dismissal'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Unfair dismissal' refers to those situations where the employer's conduct in bringing the employment relationship to an end can be characterised as `harsh, unjust or unreasonable'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As far as that is concerned, it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Actions for unfair dismissal are instituted in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) which under the present law must give weight to the interests of the employer and the dismissed worker in determining both the merits of the case and any remedy granted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many small businesses are doing it tough, and the current `square peg in the round hole' legislation is not helping. Some people have a perception that if an employer can dismiss someone then there is no job security. This thought process is not correct and, in fact, more often than not it could not be further from the truth. This amendment will create employment. Small business relies on the people in its employ to work and make the business prosper. An employee who is working in the best interests of the business is the employer's greatest asset. Anyone who owns a small business or who works at one knows that this is a fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this because of those who worked in my small business, my panel beating shop in Clermont. I refer to Mr Steve O'Neil, Dallas Tolhurst, Darren Herman and Glen Crawley. These people were not only my employees but also some of my most trusted friends. This happens in small business. A small group of individuals work not just to make the boss a buck but to ensure that the shop keeps its head above water because they have families to feed. If the business is unsuccessful, everyone loses. It is never an easy decision for a small business employer to let someone go. I know that the majority of small business operators who are doing it tough will often go without so that they can keep people on. I know that this is the case because I have been there. I did it tough and I survived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of the fence, I have employed people who just do not fit; they do not get on with the other staff, they might take from the cash till, as we have heard from some employers in other operations, or they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may continually not turn up to work, which only puts pressure on the others because they have to carry the load. The list of all the individual problems that happen when people do not fit into a business goes on. You cannot afford to keep these people on the payroll because ultimately it causes division amongst the staff, the camaraderie starts to fall apart and the business goes backwards. It is like being in a marriage: if you cannot trust your other half, you are in trouble. The relationship between employees and small business is the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In line with this argument, under the Labor government's unfair dismissal policy small business employers are reluctant to take on staff because of the fear that, if they did not work out, they could not let them go. Should an employer try to let someone go they are in for major compensation payouts. No employer can afford this. In other words, you cannot employ whoever you like&mdash;not to mention the fact that it is the employer's business and, therefore, they should have the right to manage that business as they see fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the way small business works. Many in the parliament may not understand this because they never had the pleasure or, after the impediments placed on small business by the Keating Labor government, felt the hardship that small business operators are battling through nowadays.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CADMAN" NAMEID="SD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr Cadman</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LK6">Mr MAREK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The person who instituted it? I can see where you are coming from. They were an interesting team. The trouble is that they have lost half the team.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This unfair dismissal legislation is for the employers of not more than 15 permanent employees. That must be very clearly understood. I can understand why it has been capped at 15 because I have worked in operations of more than 300 people. Sometimes it happens in big business that people get set up or picked on, or there are some restructuring processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember a case in a large company this year where an individual was looking at being dismissed for allegedly writing some graffiti 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7040"> on a noticeboard. The individual stated that he did not do it, and there were no witnesses. The company decided to make an example of the person, with no proof. This is a perfect case where the unfair dismissal law should work. Incidentally, I know the individual I mentioned personally. The person is a sound, honest, upstanding individual in the community and there is no doubt in my mind that they did not do the alleged act. As I did at the time&mdash;and I would do it now&mdash;I would back the person to the hilt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very understandably there are two particular cases here: for businesses with 15 or less get rid of the unfair dismissal laws&mdash;it is as simple as that&mdash;but for large businesses, where, as I said, you have 100&hyphen;odd people working there and people can be set up and those sorts of things, it is reasonable to say that there have to be safeguards in place for dismissal. In big business they are still in place, and rightly so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many small businesses have learnt to operate without staff because of Labor's anti&hyphen;dismissal laws. It is interesting to note that years ago small businesses, because of the unfair dismissal laws and all the imposts that were put on them, learnt to get away from having employees. A lot of them have restructured their operations. I remember in particular a shop that sells a lot of stationery in the township of Rockhampton. They have restructured their floor plan. They had about four staff and the husband and wife worked in the place as well so there was a total of six. Because of the imposts and all the things that were going on and the heartache that was caused by having to let one employee go and having to pay so much compensation, they decided eventually to let most of their staff go because they could not handle the heartache. They were also going through a severe time of downturn in the market and sales were low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So they got down to a position where there was just him and his wife. They restructured the floor plan, put the cash register at the front door and operated like that. I must say that they have said to me in recent months that it has been very hard&mdash;there is just he and his wife running a business where they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had six people before, and they are doing it tough. At present one, as I said, is on the till and the other roams the shop assisting people at the shelves&mdash;helping them to get what they want&mdash;or restocking the shelves and, of course, working back late at night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently these people are doing horrendous hours and it is affecting them. They have said to me that they could employ people tomorrow because they are doing fairly well now&mdash;business has picked up and they can afford to take people on. The gentleman said to me that he would immediately take on three people if they did not have to go through the pressure of the unfair dismissal laws because it is like anything: you do not know who you are going to get in your business until you start them, and it is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, once again we are in a position where these unfair dismissal laws are causing nothing more than heartache. We have heard the Labor Party carry on and say various bits and pieces about them, saying, `We have already amended the unfair dismissal laws once,' but that was to tidy it up, the way it used to be. Now we need to fix it up for small business to make it operational. This amending legislation is fundamental to the growth of small business and if ever there was an issue to go to the people then this is it. I commend the bill to the House and deplore the Labor Party's petty politics on this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), said that these unfair dismissal laws were causing nothing but heartache. The only problem with that observation is that it is the government's unfair dismissal laws that are now in operation so, if there is any heartache being caused, it is being caused by the government's legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill takes away the rights of all new employees in businesses that employ 14 or fewer staff to protection against unfair dismissal. This is manifestly, on the face of it, a bad thing&mdash;workers should have protection against arbitrary or capricious dismissal by their boss. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Workplace 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7041"> Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said this prior to the election when they were busy promising that they would not do what they are now proposing to do with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government says this bill ought to be supported&mdash;notwithstanding the damage that it does to workers' rights&mdash;and its big claim for it is that it will reduce unemployment. That claim is entitled to be tested because this nation is clearly not doing well enough in reducing unemployment. I want to say to the House that this claim is nonsense and that it is just one more example of the Liberal government dressing up its ideological agenda in the guise of a cure for unemployment. I want to demonstrate this by taking the House back through the Prime Minister's track record of miracle cures for unemployment, of which this is one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go to Barry Cohen's book, we find the Prime Minister saying about unemployment in 1979 that the most effective response to unemployment is to have more jobs. We want to see how well the Prime Minister has progressed since then. Back in August 1995, he talked about unfair dismissal laws as being a cure for unemployment. He said the coalition would deliver `some fair and balanced unfair dismissal laws which will improve the job prospects for young people'. That was his cure for unemployment in August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we move on to January 1996, we come across miracle  cure No. 2: tax breaks and less red tape for small business. These were the `key planks in the coalition's plan to reduce unemployment', according to the Prime Minister in January 1996 as quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. In February 1996, just prior to the election, we hear of miracle cure No. 3: education and training. At the time the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition was offering a combination of policies to attack [youth unemployment]&mdash;to provide a good education system, to offer effective training programs, and to give a new emphasis to the apprenticeship system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We move along to September 1996. There has been a change of government. Unemployment has not been cured. On the contrary, it is going up. We come across miracle cure No. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 4: pass the 1996 budget. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality was that unemployment in this country would not be turned around until the policies of the new Government were allowed to operate. These policies include the passage of the Budget and the passage of the industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was in September 1996. Indeed, the budget was passed but, regrettably, far from producing jobs it had an adverse effect on them, as reported by the Treasury recently. We also heard at that time of miracle cure No. 5: the Workplace Relations Act. In October 1996 we heard from the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It remains the fact that in the medium to longer term a freer market will  over time produce a lower rate of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was supported by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in January 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think you'll see the significant improvement in unemployment when you get the significant improvements in the industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was miracle cure No. 5: the Workplace Relations Act. We move on to miracle cure No. 6: a committee, of all things! The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The great difference is that for the first time we have a committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the cabinet's employment committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose principal objective is to marshal all economic policy towards the goal of job creation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business agreed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To have a high&hyphen;powered economic committee, a sub&hyphen;committee of Cabinet, focussed on the issues, meeting on a regular basis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How regular?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">taking advice, looking at the issues from every angle, I think it's a very sensible and welcome move.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was miracle cure No. 6. Also in October 1996 we come across miracle cure No. 7: privatise the CES. Let me quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> , from the Prime Minister again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revamp of the previous Government's Working Nation jobs package is also being cited as another reason why unemployment will fall. The theory is that private sector placement agencies will do a better job in placing the unemployed into real and sustainable jobs. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7042">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again in October 1996 we get miracle cure No. 8: micro&hyphen;economic reform. The Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[Prime Minister Howard] said he remained committed to accelerating microeconomic reform to create more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One month later, November 1996, miracle cure No. 9: test every government policy for its jobs impact. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 13 November 1996 reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard's statements have again drawn attention to his commitment to test every Government policy against a benchmark of its potential impact on employment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One month later, cures Nos 10 and 11: trade liberalisation and falling interest rates. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister Howard said his government had set the foundations for lower unemployment, especially with industrial relations reforms, interest rate cuts, trade liberalisation and proposals to ease paperwork demands on small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But still unemployment remains intractable, going up rather than going down. So in February of this year we got miracle cure No. 12: work for the dole. Again, the Prime Minister, in February of this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want the work&hyphen;for&hyphen;the&hyphen;dole scheme to be one element of the total armoury of policies that the Government has in order to tackle the problem of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the government's miracle cure No. 12: work for the dole. But it did not work either. So we come to miracle cure No. 13, in June of this year: move. That is what he said to the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister Howard sparked a bitter row yesterday after suggesting Australians should consider leaving home to find work. "The thing about the American economy and American society is that people have a culture of shifting around in pursuit of jobs that Australians don't have," Mr Howard said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> . I wonder whether the Prime Minister was reading Steinbeck's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Grapes of Wrath</EMPHASIS>  at the time he made that observation. July 1997 was a rich month for miracle cures. We saw miracle cure No. 14: removing the capital gains tax on proceeds invested in small business. Let me quote again: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During a garden party speech, [Mr Howard] said the best way to boost employment was to create the conditions for small business to prosper. He said the Government had made great strides in that direction through . . . removing the capital gains tax on proceeds invested in new businesses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We also saw miracle cure No. 15: a meeting!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Speaking on Townsville radio stations, Mr Howard made it clear he wanted to explore more radical methods of tackling unemployment, and confirmed he had set aside a full day (August 5) for the Cabinet to discuss the issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We all know what happened at that meeting&mdash;nothing. The Prime Minister was not there, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) was not there, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) was not there, and nothing whatsoever was decided. We also saw in July miracle cure for unemployment No. 16: cut wages. Let me quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This week, Mr Howard called for a national debate on Australia's minimum wage and its adverse link with unemployment . . . "I don't want anybody out there thinking we're sitting on our hands whistling and hoping unemployment is going to come down".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Heavens no&mdash;not when we have got to miracle cure No. 16. He was supported by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), who said that lower wages generally produce lower unemployment. So now unemployment has become our fault. The Prime Minister said one month before the election, `If I have one message for the Australian people, it is that I can make a difference,' but they now say that unemployment is our fault. We also saw miracle cure No. 17: investment projects. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many things coming on stream in the next few months that will help the employment outlook. . . . Literally tens of billions of dollars in investment is waiting to go in the resource sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Miracle cure No. 18 was low inflation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy is strengthening and that will flow through to a much better employment outlook in 1998 . . . if you look at the very stable low&hyphen;inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We also saw miracle cure No. 19: economic growth. When asked questions by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>  about the fall in the number of Australians in full&hyphen;time employment, the Prime Minister referred to the economic growth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7043"> indicators. To talk about economic growth is only marginally more useful than his 1979 effort, that the most effective response to unemployment is to have more jobs. It seems the Prime Minister has not come very far at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All his unemployment cures, including the bill before the House, turn out to be either banal remedies taking us nowhere, pure stunts, like the cabinet employment committee and the special cabinet meeting, or things that suit the Liberal Party's ideological agenda of the moment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the Prime Minister's unemployment cures have one other thing in common: they do not work. Unemployment was 8.5 per cent at the time this government was elected.

So when the Prime Minister comes along with his next miracle cure for unemployment, the 20th miracle cure for unemployment&mdash;and what is the betting that that will be a GST&mdash;we need to remember that none of these cures has worked.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is not the party it used to be back in the 1940s and 1950s, when it had people of ethics working for it in the party and in the parliament, people with real values, the values of the working man and woman, although in those days I guess it was the values of the working man in the majority of cases. The Labor Party does not represent those people now. It certainly does not represent the disadvantaged in our community. It does not represent anyone other than the union movement. I say that because the union movement pulls the strings in the Labor Party. The union movement has in here as representatives of this party a number of former employees of that movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who does the union movement represent? Does the union movement represent the young people in Australia today? The answer is no. If you look at the membership lists of the union movement you will see that young people are not joining unions. Does the union movement represent women workers? If you look at the membership lists you will see that it does not represent women workers. Does the union movement represent the new industries, the growth industries? Does it represent the information technology industries? Does it represent the hospitality industries? Does it represent the services industries? Clearly it does not. The unions have dwindling memberships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So who does the union movement represent? Just taking a cursory glance at the front bench and those speaking on this bill, they represent an employment agency for the Labor Party to bring their people into parliament. Let us look at the shadow ministry and the opposition front bench. What was the shadow minister before he came into parliament? He was a union man. If you look at the list in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Parliamentary Handbook</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7044"> edition has just come out&mdash;of those on the opposition front bench we have the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), a former teacher. He was a university lecturer, I guess. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) was another teacher. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) was a union leader. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) I would recognise as an engineer. We need more engineers in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), a former member of parliament, was an electronics trainee, according to the list. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) was a union member. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) was a union member. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) was a union member. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) was a union member and a teacher at Williamstown High School. In fact, he was my teacher. What is he doing in here? He is a bit old for this place, I would have thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was in community affairs. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) was a union member. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was a party member and adviser. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) was a lawyer and member of a union of lawyers. The honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) was a public servant and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) was a union member. They were all union members. The honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) was a union member. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) was a union member. The honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), who is speaking on this bill&mdash;another union member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does this tell you that there is a conflict of interest regarding industrial relations on this bill? The opposition complained bitterly about the conflict of interest of our former small business minister with his small businesses. Surely this shows a clear conflict of interest. Not one of these opposition members has been a small business operator, yet they are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in here saying how bad this bill is for small business. They do not understand how small business operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us think about the former Labor government. I have a book here called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">How Labor has failed Australia&mdash;13 years.</EMPHASIS> Let us all remember how Labor failed Australia. As a small business operator in the late 1980s I remember when interest rates were 24 to 26 per cent. The then government gave us the worst recession in 60 years. They increased foreign debt by over 800 per cent over 13 years. They gave us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government introduced fringe benefits taxes. They increased the whole tax base by increasing wholesale sales taxes. They increased taxes by over $10,000 million in their last three years after they had promised not to put up tax in 1993. They had the worst current account deficit in the OECD, including Mexico. We were worse than Mexico! That is what the Labor Party gave us. They gave us falling investment levels for 13 years. They gave us falling average weekly earnings resulting in less disposable incomes, which was hurting small business. They gave us the unfair dismissal laws, which Mr Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith, introduced. They also gave us unfair levels of provisional tax uplift factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition have no idea of what operating a small business is like. They have a lot of ideas on how to manipulate the system, how to get the union movement into the parliament and they talk about all these great issues, but they have no answers for small business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember my first experience with a union operator. I was a manager of a company in Perth. Unfortunately we retrenched 15 people at that time because of poor economic circumstances in the mid-1980s. I had a union man, he was 65, come into my office, lean all over my desk, belt my desk and say, `You are going to pay, son; you are going to pay.' `Pay what,' I thought. I did not know what he was talking about, but this went on. This particular union operator did not reappear with these workers that were put off. I then negotiated with these workers and my own employers to re&hyphen;employ these people into the company. We were successful enough to get them back in. It was my first day as manager on the job, which was a bit of an experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had another experience on a work site as a builder's labourer. I came back from a 10-minute morning tea sucking on my milk. An employer said to me, `Where have you been?' I said, `I got the milk.' He said, `You can't take 10 minutes to get milk these days.' I said, `How long do I take?' He said, `It is 7&half; minutes for morning tea, half an hour for lunch and 7&half; minutes for afternoon tea; no more.' I thought then, `There must be something wrong with workplace relations if you cannot go to a milk shop, buy a bottle of milk, come back and renew your strength before you start moving those rocks.' I got an interest in workplace relations then. I learnt then that the confrontation the Labor Party talks about and the confrontation the union movement wants&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been a small business operator, I understand that there are a lot of things involved in small business that take your 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7046"> mind off employing people. There are things like worrying about the daily sales figures, your own family, where the food is coming from this week and how you are going to do it. It affects your health and it affects a whole lot of other things. You have standards to meet and you have documents to fill out. You are not thinking about employing people, because you know that if that particular employee does not work out you are going to be hit with a massive bill of over $8,000 through an unfair dismissal claim and the costs involved in all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare (Mr Andren) said that it is not high in the minds of small business operators. I agree that it is not high in the minds of small business operators. But, if they were allowed to employ people, if the hardship of employing people was taken away from them, making it easier for them to employ people, that worry would go and it would help small business operators to deal with those other worries that they have. He mentioned the fair trading report. He said that there was no mention at all about unfair dismissals in the fair trading report. Having been a chair of that particular committee for a short time, I can tell you that it was not part of the terms of reference; that is why it was not even mentioned. We did not discuss it. We did not ask one question about it. We asked about other things other than employment and unfair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were still in business&mdash;I sold my business, therefore it must have been successful&mdash;I would be employing people on a casual work rate, employing them on a three-month agreement renewable every three months. I think that might be what a lot of other employers are doing at the moment, hence the reason for casual employment rates increasing. I wonder what would happen if we were able to diminish&mdash;in particular this amendment helps people with fewer than 15 employees&mdash;the worry of those employees of unfair dismissals, whether that would give them more security of tenure. I think that may in fact happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will benefit small business. It will benefit micro-businesses, those that really are thinking about trying to expand but 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot because they are worried about unfair dismissal procedures. Small business employers do not want to take advantage of people&mdash;some do, but not all of them do. They want to grow their businesses. The only way they can grow their businesses is to increase their sales. The only way they can increase their sales is probably to have other people do some work to help them. They may be doing that through subcontracting out right now, they may be doing it through casual labour, but they may want to have permanent employees working for them. They have not been able to employ people because they are afraid of this unfair dismissal provision, which in some cases involves costs of up to $8,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since last year we have had some examples of how this is working. I have some figures from Western Australia. In the week ending 31 January 1997 there were three applications relating to unfair dismissal. In that same week last year there were 32. In the week ending 4 July 1996, 49 applications were lodged. In the same week this year, there was none. That is clearly an indication that the Workplace Relations Act that the Hon. Peter Reith introduced is in fact working; it certainly is in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this amendment bill because I know it is going to work for small business. It is going to give them enough confidence to be able to go out and employ people. Those who speak against it do not understand the world of small business. I encourage them&mdash;the young and the restless&mdash;to understand small business a little bit better than they currently do. They should talk to those who are in it, talk to those who are successful in it, and try to find out how it works and what they think about it. They do not necessarily think about employees all the time, because they are thinking about other things. But, if they had employees to help them, they would readily go out and employ. What stopped them in the past was unfair dismissals. This will help them and I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure, after that contribution from the thick and the useless, to be able to make some comments on the Workplace 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7047"> Relations Amendment Bill. The mask is off in this legislation. The Liberal and National parties are reverting to type. They are reverting to the traditional position that they occupy&mdash;the class position of unfettered support for employers and complete lack of any interest in ensuring that justice is available to employees, be they in large or small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they are about is ensuring that the people whom they see as their supporters have got an unfettered right to hire and fire regardless of whether there is any justice in their actions and regardless of whether the people, who are the subject of those actions, are actually being subjected to severe injustice&mdash;and these people include a very large number of people whom they would tag as battlers. They see small business people as battlers. They are battlers, but the battlers who work for small business, oh, no, they are not entitled to similar treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this law does is exempt employers who employ under 15 employees from unfair dismissal legislation requirements. There are, in fact, one or two precedents for this. For example, the technological change and redundancy clause that is in most awards as a result of an ACTU case back in the mid-1980s has a similar exemption from requirements for redundancy pay for smaller businesses under 15 employees. There is, though, a substantial difference between the two. There is a difference between providing minimal redundancy pay entitlements which, under the TCR clause, are fairly minimal anyway, and basic human rights&mdash;the basic right to have your day in court; to have your situation judged by an independent umpire to determine whether you have been treated fairly, whether your life has been turned upside down and whether your livelihood has been removed unjustly by dismissal by an employer. There is a fundamental difference between the two things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that can be said about the legislation is that it creates substantial loopholes. There is clearly no rationale&mdash;no logic&mdash;inherent in the figure 15. There is no reason why employers who employ over 15 employees are more likely to unfairly dismiss their employees and, therefore, require the intervention and the protection of the state as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposed to employers who have fewer than 15 employees. What this distinction does is set up an incentive for employers to avoid the reach of the legislation by structuring their organisations in a way that means that they are separate business units, for example, with 12 employees here, 14 there, 10 there, and the like. It will happen, and the people on the other side of the fence will not care. They will not know about it. There will be a larger reach of this legislation than they pretend as a result of people exploiting those loopholes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told last year by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), then Minister for Industrial Relations&mdash;he has now had a name change and has a new plate up&mdash;that Labor's unfair dismissal laws had been fixed; that we had a brave new world of the conservative government's unfair dismissal laws that would provide justice to employers and employees. We were told that they had removed the negative features of Labor's unfair dismissal laws and that unfair dismissal protection was still available to all employees; there was still a court that people could go to, a forum where they could litigate, if they felt that they had been unjustly dismissed&mdash;but there was now a balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation today is an implicit acknowledgment that that legislation was a failure. We were told that this was going to solve the alleged problems associated with the unfair dismissal laws that Labor had introduced. Yet, within months of those laws having been passed, the government is back in here proposing changes. It was amusing that, when the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, introduced some finetuning&mdash;and it was finetuning&mdash;to Labor's unfair dismissal laws, this was described in the media and by the then opposition as a backflip. Nobody in the media has yet described what we are seeing today as a backflip, but why isn't it? It is an implicit acknowledgment that they have failed. It is an implicit acknowledgment that their laws have failed. Yet, it is not seen as a backflip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also gives an indication, which we have seen hints of from time to time, that this will not be the end, by the coalition, of the H.R. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7048"> Nicholls Society agenda. There have been a few touch ups from the H.R. Nicholls Society and other associated uglies in this debate in recent times, and people on the government benches are smarting as a result. They are pretty touchy about it because they have seen Peter Reith and Cheryl Kernot dance and they do not like it&mdash;the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in particular, is of that view. What this legislation indicates is that there is going to be a workplace relations bill mark 2 and substantial further deregulation of the labour market, and it may even be before the next election rather than after it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December of 1996, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that the new unfair dismissal laws, passed by the parliament last year, provided a fair go all round. Now, all of a sudden, he is going to gut those laws and remove unfair dismissal protection entirely for people working in businesses with fewer than 15 employees. Yet, those same laws&mdash;that same protection for those same people&mdash;only nine months ago were a fair go all round. There is a stark contradiction here which he, of course, has not explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that in the Bell report, with respect to government regulation in small business, there is no recommendation along the lines that we have before us today in this legislation. There is no suggestion that unfair dismissal provisions should not apply to small business, there is simply a recommendation that after 12 months the new laws be reviewed. We have not got anywhere near 12 months and the government has already decided that the new laws are inadequate and that protection needs to be removed from employees in smaller businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard, the Prime Minister, said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">John Laws Show</EMPHASIS> on 23 January 1996, `I am not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee.' He lied. We have a situation here where that is precisely what the House is being asked to adopt today: a law that says that, if you work for a certain sized firm and you are dismissed, it does not matter one iota what the cause of the dismissal was or how justified or unjustified that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was, you do not have the right to take unfair dismissal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) on at least one thing, and that is that not all employers are bad&mdash;there are good and bad, as there are in all walks of life&mdash;but the problem with issues of this nature is that inevitably the bad drag the good down. If the bad get a competitive advantage out of their behaviour, if they are able to squeeze their employees, mistreat them in various ways so that they can gain a competitive advantage, that puts the good employer on the horns of a dilemma. They have two choices: they can either sit back and watch their competitiveness erode and, ultimately, their livelihood put at stake or they can follow the example of the bad employer. There will always be a mix of responses to that; it is not a hard&hyphen;and&hyphen;fast, black&hyphen;and&hyphen;white situation. Nonetheless, it is a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that, in the final analysis, the number of employers who do behave badly will be a lot greater than the number of those who are intrinsically bad or intrinsically prone to mistreat their employees or dismiss them unfairly. Many will be forced to do it because their competitors do, and that applies to the issue of labour market regulation generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other claims that we heard ad nauseam in the debate on these issues in 1995 was that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were destroying jobs. If this were true, the country could thank its lucky stars that the government legislated, because you can imagine what unemployment would be like now if it had not. Look at what has happened to unemployment since the coalition has been in office. Since the coalition has been in office, unemployment has been steadily rising, in spite of the fact that they were handed an economy in fundamentally good shape. Long&hyphen;term unemployment in particular is rising steadily and, in some regional hot spots, it is becoming even more serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition told us that the unfair dismissal law was the primary problem, that it was preventing all those thousands of small businesses out there from employing people. Presumably, they are going to come back and say that there needs to be no unfair dismissal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7049"> law in order to ensure that all these small businesses are going to go out and employ people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistently in surveys small businesses indicate that the unfair dismissal legislation&mdash;and industrial relations regulation generally&mdash;is a relatively limited issue. It does not score highly as a major problem. Obviously, some say it is a major problem for them, but most do not. The most recent Morgan and Banks job survey of over 3,500 businesses indicated that 16 per cent of those surveyed said that an exemption from unfair dismissal laws would be of benefit to them. So 84 per cent are in a sense saying, `We are quite comfortable with a law that provides our employees with a right to an independent umpire if they believe they have been dismissed unfairly.' That is what 84 per cent of small businesses are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation indicates the real coalition position. As I said at the outset, the mask is off. Their real position is&mdash;and this goes back to the beginning of the 19th century&mdash;that a contract of employment is the same as a contract to buy a sack of spuds, that there is no difference between human labour and human participation in the process of production as to how it should be treated by the law and the law relating to the sale of a bag of jelly beans. It is a contract and that is it; and it should receive no separate or special status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Implicit in that view is that the status, strength and bargaining power of the two parties to a contract is fundamentally equal&mdash;the view that the worker's alternative to starve is a real alternative. It is equivalent to my decision today not to buy a packet of chewing gum because I do not feel like it. That is implicit in the conservative position on labour market regulation. That is where we got jobsback and the $3 an hour wage figures from. That is why no Liberal government has ever introduced unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were no unfair dismissal laws in Victoria at all until the Cain government was elected&mdash;none at all. There were Liberal governments in Victoria for decades. They felt that they did not have to protect any employee&mdash;not only in small business but in large business&mdash;from the threat of unfair 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dismissal. Why? Because they are the party of employers. It has been Labor governments that have introduced that protection, and it is always conservative governments that fight against it. If they could get away with getting rid of unfair dismissal laws altogether, they would do it. And this is probably the first step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan, who spoke before me, indicated that there have been fewer claims under the new legislation. I think the figure of 27 per cent fewer claims was quoted elsewhere. There is an obvious response to that. Does that mean that there are 27 per cent fewer instances of employers unfairly dismissing people or does it just mean that there are fewer people making claims? I would suggest to you that it is the latter, that there has been no change in behaviour in the workplace&mdash;there are still people being unfairly dismissed&mdash;and all that is happening is that a proportion of them are being discouraged or prevented from pursuing claims. That is a victory for employers who unfairly dismiss people. It is not a victory for justice and it is not progress. It is simply a situation of locking out the problem, sweeping it under the carpet and avoiding doing anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fallacy in the conservative position on all of this is the notion that if you make it cheaper and easier for employers to employ people they will. It is the notion of the benevolent employer who has got a bit of loose change. If you say to that employer, `You can employ somebody with that loose change,' they will. Employers do not employ people because they have got a bit of loose money lying around the place. They employ people because they have work for them to do that cannot be done under their existing arrangements. That is why employers employ people. Demand drives employment. Supply&hyphen;side views are fundamentally flawed, and that is the view that drives this legislation&mdash;the notion that if you make it easier to employ all these benevolent employers will go out there and suddenly put a whole lot of people on. The predominant thing that drives employment is demand. Therefore, issues of growth and economic activity are fundamental to that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7050">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now is the time to nail the critical furphy in all of this, and that is the question of labour market deregulation&mdash;the sort of view that is pushed by columnists like Judith Sloan, who has written one article that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has published about 48 times, and no doubt they will publish it again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I think what they do is get the paragraphs and throw them all up in the air; they come down in a different order and they are published as a new article.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very facile comparisons made between Europe and the United States. People say, `Unemployment in the United States is about five per cent whereas in Germany and France it is 11 or 12 per cent; therefore, because you have a less regulated labour market in the US, if you diminish labour market regulation and get rid of minimum wages and awards that will mean more employment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go through the reasons why that is a complete fallacy. Firstly, the experience in Europe is mixed. The Netherlands, for example, has an unemployment rate that is barely higher than that of the US; Denmark's is roughly the same. There are a number of other examples. Secondly, in the case of Britain, which is also highlighted as an example similar to the US, the figures are rorted. Under the conservative government a whole swathe of older men were pushed off unemployment benefits onto other benefits which do not give them an unemployed tag, such as the equivalent of the disability support pension which does not require them to be medically tested. Thirdly, roughly two per cent of the American unemployment problem is in gaol; there is nothing like that equivalent in Europe. Fourthly, illegal immigration complicates the equation, especially in the United States. You have an enormous black economy and an enormous degree of illegal immigration, particularly in certain parts of the US, which make it very hard to get accurate figures. Fifthly, there are other factors involved. One of the key factors contributing to unemployment in Europe, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly in France and Germany, is overvalued currencies and harsh monetary policy, which has its origins largely in the approach taken by the German government to the reunification issue. These factors tend to be ignored by the Judith Sloans of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the factors that they often run in debate about industry policy in Australia is the misallocation of resources that occurs as a result of intervention and not letting markets decide where investment and resources should go. If there is any merit in that criticism it certainly applies to Europe, with all of the agricultural protection in particular and the underdevelopment of the services industry as a result of a variety of government policies in places like Germany. If you actually take the arguments of the economic rationalists seriously then surely that makes a contribution to additional unemployment in places like Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting the comment of Lester Thurow in his very interesting recent book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Future of Capitalism</EMPHASIS> in which he points out that a person who is unemployed in France is actually better off than a low paid worker in the United States, at least in material terms. I recommend to members of the government work by Robert Solow, a very distinguished American economist, who studied the so&hyphen;called stickiness of wages, social factors and the like that do influence wages above and beyond formalities of regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final, outrageous and obscene thing about the Judith Sloan line&mdash;the deregulate the lot line&mdash;is that even if it is correct that solving unemployment will be the outcome of deregulating the labour market, it still means that the people who will carry the burden and pay the price are the lowest paid, economically and industrially weakest members of our society. Even if it were true&mdash;and it is not true&mdash;the people who will pay the cost are the weakest, poorest members of the community. They are the ones who are at the bottom of the scale, who are earning the least and who would earn less as a result of her approach, the approach of those who support her and the approach that is harboured by members of the government. Even if it were true, it would be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7051"> a massively socially unjust way to deal with the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A point that the government has to come to grips with is that the role of labour in our society is not one&hyphen;dimensional. Labour performs three functions in human activity and society. Obviously it is an input in the process of production, therefore the efficiency of that input is of great importance. That is not the only function of labour yet, according to the economic rationalists of the Judith Sloan school, that is all there is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But labour performs two other functions. The second is that it is still the primary means of the distribution of the proceeds of production, and we have an interest not only in it being an efficient input but also in it being a socially efficient and equitable means of distributing the proceeds so that we do not have masses of people with huge rewards and others starving. Its third role is essentially psychological. Most people define themselves by their role in the process of production. It still remains a dominant part of human self&hyphen;esteem, participation in society, acceptance and recognition. All of these are critical factors in people's participation in society. When looking at regulation of labour we have to look at three imperatives, not one. This legislation is an outrage and a disgrace. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The Democrats and the ALP voted for the disallowance of the regulation made by the government, hence the requirement for this bill now which represents a purer expression of government policy for small business. The purpose of this act is to allow an employer the right not to go through the process of some court action where the employment numbers are below 15 in his or her business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To pick up some points from the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), he started on the old chestnut of class&mdash;the battlers, justice, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the unfettered right of the employer. I think that the greatest thing any community can do leading up to the 21st century is to offer jobs to all of its people. All of this old world class structure approach is, I believe, related to another era and to almost another century&mdash;the 19th century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard about the H.R. Nicholls Society, the Bell report, the drag down effect and&mdash;I think he quoted&mdash;the 16 per cent of those employers who believed that they were badly affected by the current unfair dismissal regulations or legislation. But even if he is right about the 16 per cent, if we consider the number of employers and businesses throughout Australia who may take on just one more person because they find it more amenable to do so, that would mean tens of thousands of jobs. I doubt, of course, whether his numbers are right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of human labour and jelly beans was raised. If you were to ask employers whether they consider human labour&mdash;the cost of employment of people, in other words&mdash;in the same way as the buying of a bag of jelly beans, I think they would point out the number of protections that are in the law for all employees. Whether it is workers compensation, superannuation, occupational health and safety, training, whatever it might be, I would suggest that it is somewhat different from going into a shop and buying a bag of jelly beans, as the member for Melbourne was trying to have us believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The old perennial about starvation was raised. I would suggest it has been a long time in Australia since we seriously have raised that as an issue. The ALP were touted as the only people who could protect the workers from the terrible employer, and I think we all know the history of the last decade or more during which up to a million Australians have been unemployed. Some protection, some Labor solution to the issues of unemployment!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the issue of `cheaper and easier to employ', as if it were a matter of loose change, demand and supply. The issue of the ability to employ puts this old class nonsense right up there again. The reality, I believe, is that no more egalitarian society exists than

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a matter about whether you are of a class or not, and it is just an insult to suggest that it is. It is a matter of the initiative, the entrepreneurship and the ability of someone to create a business and to employ&mdash;and that is what we need. It is nothing to do with how we might view ourselves in a class or otherwise; that has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is to do with the ability of an individual of whatever gender, whatever religion, whatever belief to go out there and create a business and employ. It is an absolute insult to suggest otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need in this country are more and more and more of those sorts of people who are prepared to do it. The more incentives, the more capacity that government can give and the more it can harness individuals to do that, obviously the more chance there is to employ people who wish to be employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Judith Sloan, as usual, comes up in these debates. I happen to believe that her contribution to the labour market issues of Australia over the last decade has been overwhelmingly positive, honest, and has an integrity about it. Whether you agree with her or not&mdash;and I do not always agree with Judith Sloan&mdash;there is an integrity and a well researched case on which she bases her arguments. I always welcome her contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talked about the US, Germany and the UK. We all know of the issues of unification in the German situation which have created their own particular problems. We understand that in the US there is a dynamic private enterprise economy, and that that country does things in certain ways that perhaps Australia would not choose to. Nevertheless, it has a dynamic private enterprise ethic which has made it the greatest economic power ever in the history of civilisation. So perhaps it would not hurt us to look at, even if not to adopt totally, what happens overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would commend not only the US experience, with my limited knowledge of it, but also many European countries. From the point of looking at both sides of the coin, perhaps we could look at some of the Scandinavian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countries as well. I was quite interested in the Swedish model. I have only learnt in recent months that the Swedish experience has been somewhat disappointing and that delivery, in terms of employment outcomes, is very tough indeed. So let us not rule out what might help us to give every Australian who wishes to have a job the opportunity to have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that the government has brought into place to endeavour to encourage business&mdash;small business, particularly&mdash;are dealt with in the context of the financial position that we inherited; I think most Australians understand that. Nevertheless, the job has gone forward. We have the issues of the industrial relations bill that has been negotiated, particularly with the Democrats. We also have the issues of the Bell report. Many of those recommendations have been brought into effect and are continuing to be brought into effect, whether they relate to the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the rollover, the paperwork, the provisional tax uplift factor, et cetera. That does not mean there is not much to be done. There is still a lot to be done. But in the terms of this government's nearly 18 months in office, I think it is a commendable record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn back to the legislation and to the reasons the ALP brought forward the disallowance of regulations on 26 June 1997. It was said that the employees who have been treated unfairly would be left without any remedy. However, the previous government, the ALP government, which was recently voted out as of March 1996, also had a range of exclusions from its unfair dismissal provisions&mdash;casual employees, probationists, et cetera. Remember that you only have to go the first 12 months and after that you would be subject to the conditions of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point that the ALP brought forward in the Senate debate was that it is unfair to provide different rights for different classes of employees on the basis of the size of their employer. However, the different treatment is justifiable given the different impact of an unfair dismissal claim on a small business. It is as fundamental as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) made significant reference to the background 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7053"> of our opponents. That is fine. We all come to this place from different backgrounds, and we bring what we can to it. But this sort of approach only demonstrates the ALP's total ignorance and lack of understanding of those who work in small business. I repeat: unfair dismissal has a different impact on a small business. The fact that the proprietor has to attend hearings personally is just one example of the inconvenience that can occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objection was that there is insufficient  evidence that the unfair dismissal laws are still a problem for small business and insufficient evidence that limited coverage by the unfair dismissal laws will increase employment. The response is that the decisions on expansion to employment are influenced by many factors. The government should remove as many obstacles as possible. It is as fundamental as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To come back to the point the member for Melbourne made towards the end of his contribution when he talked about the weak and the vulnerable in our society, the best thing that any government in any society can do for its active members of society between the age of 16 and 65 is to provide them with regular work. Anything that a government can do to remove obstacles should be done. It is not about some theory of ours of sitting in this place having wonderful philosophical debates. It is about remembering that there are millions of Australians who look to us to give leadership in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objection that our opponents raised in the Senate was that the unfair dismissal laws as amended by the government in 1996 already require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to have regard to the impact of any order on the viability of an employer's business before ordering reinstatement or compensation. The obvious response is that this does not remove the burden of defence of a claim apart from any order made. You are still left with defending the claim. These things are practical matters. They take time, money and attention away from the job in hand of working a small business. We should never forget that we cannot wax lyrical without remembering that the reality is that there are millions of Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tralians out there trying to work, trying to create a business, trying to create wealth and trying to employ. The success of their businesses depends on their ability to produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU repeats the criticism and argues that it is a breach of Liberal Party policy to fail to provide access to an unfair dismissal hearing for any group of employees. The opposition should know a lot better. The response is quite clear; it is unequivocal. The response is, `However, the previous ALP government also had a range of inclusions from its unfair dismissal provisions, for example, casual employees, probationists, trainees,' and the ACTU agreed with all of this. The ACTU really needs to be consistent. Whether it is the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Democrats, if the ACTU treated us with consistency it would win greater respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is an important part of the government's program. It shows the government's support for small business and for ordinary Australians who are endeavouring to work in small business and to create small business. I welcome the legislation. I remind the Senate that we have a responsibility to every Australian to make sure we maximise every job opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . The former speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), said that the more incentive we can give small business to employ, the better. That is not objectionable, and indeed it is a worthy comment. But the incentive offered in this bill is the incentive of depriving workers of a `fair go all round'. They were the words shouted at the dispatch box by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), then the Minister for Industrial Relations, on a number of occasions when he referred to this government's approach to unfair dismissal&mdash;a fair go all round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, section 170CA of the act&mdash;the objects of the unfair dismissal provisions&mdash;specifically refers to that expression: a fair go all round. Reference is again made in that section by way of a note to a famous case of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7054"> Lotty and Holloway; the case relied upon for the concept of a fair go all round. In that case what did Mr Justice Sheldon say that concept involved? It involved the fundamental right of due process, of procedural fairness based on principles going back to the due process clause in the Magna Carta&mdash;a fair go all round. What did Justice Sheldon say? It was the absence of adjectival tyranny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is trying to restore to small business the ability to sack people by carrying out adjectival tyranny. The fact of the matter is that dismissal is a punitive weapon that strikes right at the heart of a worker's financial survival. It is not only a worker who is affected but also the worker's family. Put dismissal on one side of the equation and on the other the inconvenience that the former speaker mentioned of having to attend a conciliation conference. What a terrible thing! There is a worker and his family on one side, and on the other is the inconvenience of having to spend half an hour at a conciliation conference. There is no equation. There is simply no correlation at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ABS statistics show that federal unfair dismissal laws are going to affect at best seven per cent of small business employers. The government knows that its unfair dismissal provisions apply to only small businesses under federal awards; indeed, most are under state awards. So it is a con. Professor Ron McCullum, of the University of Sydney, said, `This is at best a symbolic gesture; at worst a big con.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a complete and utter con because, in any event, it will not quarantine small businesses from actions for wrongful termination. There are a number of cases where common law damages have been given because of the action of wrongful dismissal. It amounts to a breach of contract. Such cases include Gregory v. Phillip Morris, Wheeler v. Phillip Morris and the Georgevski case, to name a few. They are legion in the United kingdom and in the United States. They are cases in which damages for breach of contract have been awarded because workers have been wrongfully dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the government fails to appreciate that under section 178 of the act there still remains 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the right to impose penalties for breaches of awards, enterprise agreements or Australian workplace agreements. Because the jurisdiction has been referred back to the Federal Court, it has the power to grant injunctive relief, that is, to enjoin an employer from sacking someone unlawfully. So, again, a remedy is already there under section 178 of the act. It is a con to all concerned to say that this is going to quarantine small businesses from actions for wrongful dismissal. What it does is take a simple procedure out of the equation, one in which all parties are afforded a fair go all round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Court, on authority, has the power under its accrued jurisdiction to grant the relief of specific performance of a contract of employment. Turner v the Miners Federation is a well&hyphen;known authority for that proposition, where the contract of employment was specifically restored on the orders of the Federal Court of Australia. It is a con to suggest that this is going to quarantine small business. You should be telling your small business constituents, if they are feeding you that line, that they are under a fundamental misconception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paradox of the government's bill is that it is actually going to make life more difficult for non&hyphen;unionists. Section 170HA of the act specifically says that the unfair dismissal provisions do not prevent unions notifying industrial disputes and seeking awards or orders under other general provisions of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer again to well&hyphen;known cases where unions have been successful in obtaining reinstatement orders on behalf of workers: Ranger Uranium, the Boyne Smelters case, the Wool Dumpers case and the famous case of Vista Paper Products. These are all cases in which unions were able to establish an unfair dismissal remedy even before the former government's unfair dismissal legislation. They were able to establish a remedy because of the way their dispute notifications were framed on behalf of union members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, paradoxically, this government has deprived non-unionists of a fair go all round, but unionists still have these mechanisms. A speaker said earlier that employers were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7055"> anxious that they were going to be sucked down a litigation route. If anyone wants to know a complicated litigation route, they just have to be sucked into this system. They will then find out that a simple procedure which allows for conciliation, where the vast majority of claims are resolved, is far more preferable. You will find that small business owners facing these complications will be saying, `Take us back to a simple procedure, a procedure where everyone is given a fair go all round.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us test the rhetoric of the government and see whether it is correct that there is genuine anxiety on the part of small business in employing people. On the minister's figures, there has been a 56 per cent reduction in unfair dismissal claims under his legislation. Has this led to a 56 per cent increase in employment? No, it has not. It is absolute rubbish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said, the Morgan and Banks survey indicated that less than 16 per cent of employers were concerned about it. So we are talking about less than 16 per cent of seven per cent of employers, that is, small businesses under federal awards. How many jobs are going to be created because of dispelling this unfair dismissal claim anxiety? Not one job.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before you speak, you have a look at each other state's legislation&mdash;except Victoria, of course. If there is genuine anxiety, as was noted by the former speaker, existing small businesses have a way around it. They can employ people for a specified time. They can employ people for a specified task. They can employ people on a period of probation. They can employ people for a qualifying period. Indeed, they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can employ people on a casual basis. These options exist now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of beating up these fear campaigns when you are addressing meetings of Rotary and so forth, you should be trying to get Australians employed by dispelling the anxiety. You should be saying, `If you do have an anxiety, these remedies already exist.' They already exist in section 170CC and the regulations. With respect, those on the government benches are as bad as another infamous member of this parliament who is whipping up scare campaigns on various other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, as appears to be the case, the economy is slow because of insecurity&mdash;which results in the fact that people are not spending their money through small businesses thus reducing the turnover of small businesses&mdash;what is this bill going to do? It is going to do nothing at all to dispel that insecurity. How can you dispel insecurity by making it easier for workers to be sacked?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality these days is that virtually any worker over 40 has problems if they are dismissed, and if they are unskilled they are certainly worse off. If they have a disability they are worse off still and, in terms of disability, a lack of English skills is a significant disability. How are those vulnerable people going to feel more secure and more prepared to spend their money if they are deprived of a fair go all round? That is what this bill seeks to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that fundamental right, the concept of a fair go all round&mdash;which is a concept, as I have noted, based on principles going back to the due process clause of the Magna Carta&mdash;is to be removed, it should only be removed if it is clearly demonstrated, on the basis of fact and not of hollow rhetoric, that it is in the greater public good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, that cannot be demonstrated, for two fundamental reasons. The first is that, in any event, this bill will not quarantine small businesses from wrongful termination actions. They will still exist to give courts the ability to award damages and to give common law courts and the Federal Court the ability to award specific performance. The second point is that, if genuine anxiety exists, it should, as I have com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7056"> mented, be relieved by responsible leadership of the country. And that responsible leadership should point out to small businesses, if they experience that anxiety, the options they have, including employing someone on a three&hyphen;month probation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that is going to happen under this bill is that you are going to flatten the wage rates. Small businesses will be able to employ juniors and, as they start to creep up in age and are about to jump up another leg of their award entitlement, it will be out the door for them. But you will have to get them out the door before the 12 months is up. It is going to be a revolving door for younger workers, because you can only pay younger workers lower wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic growth unquestionably is being impeded by job insecurity, and that insecurity is fundamentally affecting small business. This bill is depriving workers of a fair go and adding to their insecurity and, hence, actually damaging small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that this bill is the first bill that may give rise to a double dissolution. If it does, it will do so&mdash;in the words of Professor Ron McCullum&mdash;on the basis of a con. If it is on that basis that a trigger is activated, this government is in real trouble. I, for one, would welcome an election conducted on the issue of whether workers in this country are entitled to a fair go all round.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A fair go all round&mdash;the concept which was introduced as a result of the election of this government and the policies we promised the people of Australia and which we enacted last year through the Workplace Relations Act&mdash;is a term never heard of or used by the Australian Labor Party before. In the time of the previous government the concept of a fair go all round was something we never heard of, but we have heard a lot of talk about it here today from my friend and colleague the member for Barton (Mr McClelland).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of my address today I will address a couple of the reasons why there is so much passion on the Labor side of this chamber about this Workplace Relations Amendment Bill before us. It amends various 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provisions of last year's Workplace Relations Act, essentially to finetune the arrangements that came through and, in a lot of other ways, to try to say to small business in Australia, `Yes, we know the bill mangled by the Senate is not what you want and need in order for you to get on with business and employ more people, so we as a government are responding, to try to make things better for you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also proves the pro&hyphen;worker credentials of the Howard government yet again. We are not anti&hyphen;union but we certainly are pro individual worker. We are about the return to Australian workers of freedom of choice and the right to choose. Let us face it, the original act&mdash;which we are amending today&mdash;did not go as far as many people in my electorate wanted. They certainly ended up with a compromise, watered down by the Senate alliance of the ALP and the Australian Democrats&mdash;the real left wing of Australian politics. Those two parties should stand condemned for the way they have let Australian workers down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made under the legislation passed last year. The states have certainly played their part with complementary legislation. There is greater flexibility and industrial relations have become more harmonious as a result of promoting the cause of workers ahead of the union movement. 0ver 1,600 new agreements have been ratified&mdash;47 directly&mdash;between employees and their employers. So we have bosses and workers talking with each other again, without the union bosses interfering. Over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved, and the safety net for workers&mdash;which people often talk about&mdash;is still strongly in place through the no&hyphen;disadvantage test. So a fair go all round is being proved on a daily basis in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still much more to be done. A small business operator told me the other day at Sunnybank in my electorate about how he has workers who regard the concept of the warning letters as a badge of honour. Some of his more militant workers regard the whole system of industrial relations as a big joke; they can do anything they like and, because he is a fairly small business operator, he is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7057"> held over a barrel. Because of the way the system still operates, he has to be able to take time off to go to hearings and conciliation sessions to try to sort out problems with his workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very unfortunate, because I submit that most bosses are essentially very good people. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) made this concession before, as the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) noted, and the honourable member for Barton agreed. Most bosses in this country look at their work force as a responsibility. They need them to work very hard and to work in the comfort of knowing they will be rewarded amply for their efforts. A lot of bosses I have spoken to simply say, `If I have a dozen workers on my staff I have 13 mortgages to worry about.' They worry very much about the lot of their workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill before us today is essentially summed up this way: it is a pro&hyphen;small business, pro&hyphen;worker and pro&hyphen;jobs initiative. It discriminates in favour of small business employers with 15 or less workers. It allows greater freedom for managers in small businesses to exercise their prerogative without any great fear of expensive and tedious unfair dismissal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bosses do not sack good staff. But when they want to exercise their managerial prerogative the system established by the previous government beats them up. This is certainly the fault of the ALP&hyphen;Democrat alliance in the Senate which did not allow the full range of changes the people of Australia so clearly voted for in the March 1996 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason members opposite are so passionate about the argument they are putting is the bosses of the big unions in Australia do not like it. If this is the case, then of course the members of the Australian Labor Party in this place certainly do not like it, because they are attached like puppets on a string to their union masters. Union bosses and the ALP do not like it because it prevents the unions from getting as a right the subscriptions and therefore the memberships of Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit union bosses in this country would be better off earning the support of workers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as shown through their membership by being proper advocates for workers, not just simply nest featherers at the expense of workers. I see a lot of trade union magazines from time to time. The ones I have seen lately are spreading a lot of lies about this current government to try to garner some new members. The rest of the magazines seem to promote the need to go out and headhunt new members for the union movement. We all know union membership is declining in this country as workers vote with their feet against the out-of-touch super union bosses and their lieutenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU opposes provisions in this bill related to freedom of association. People in other countries on this planet have died for the right to associate and, for that matter, to disassociate and here we have the ACTU opposing provisions in this bill relating to freedom of association. I guess it means the ACTU obviously has no faith in its own ability to prove on merit to workers in Australia it deserves the membership they would want of their unions. Rather, they want to ensure there are preference clauses existing in certified agreements to give union members an unfair advantage over non&hyphen;union members or, worse still, to discriminate against those workers who rightly demand not to be part of the union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just left staggered as to how the union movement will respond to the various challenges they face in an environment where workers believe the union movement itself is out of touch. What has the union movement done so far? They have got more out of touch by a process of amalgamation, creating bigger unions and bringing union bosses and hierarchies further away from average workers. This super union concept has simply made matters worse and has confirmed in the minds of so many Australian workers why the union movement is not worth supporting through the form of membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This pro&hyphen;worker government has included in this bill provisions for disamalgamation and for secret ballots initiated by workers themselves through the Federal Court to bring the union back to them and out of the high rise towers and the 7&hyphen;series BMWs like the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7058"> type I remember seeing the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who has just left the chamber, in on several occasions when he was travelling around as President of the ACTU. In fact, this policy approach by the government means that it will be possible for more unions to be established, not less. Better still, they will be unions responsive to workers needs, and this makes the union bosses even more beholden to the workers. The current approach seems to be the reverse. This bill tidies up matters relating to this disamalgamation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge is for the union movement to become more relevant&mdash;to become a `must join' organisation. If they are doing a good job, workers are going to say, `I have to be a part of that.' Obviously workers believe that the union movement is not doing an adequate enough job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly do support workers' rights to associate, to group together, to form unions. The concept seems very reasonable to me, especially if it is a mechanism to truly protect the weak. However, the organised labour approach in this country has lost the support of most workers because it obviously is a case of the super unions instead manipulating the weak. We have heard scare campaigns conducted in the course of this debate here today. These sorts of scare campaigns are the way the organised labour movement in this country and their puppets in this place decide to promote the need to be in a union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I encourage workers to get organised, to get angry if they feel they need to, and to take over the unions that they belong to. Do not allow your subscriptions, which are drawn automatically and taken from your wage, to be used simply by those who are actually trying to use you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another matter I want to touch on in regard to freedom of association. I once belonged to the AJA. When it wanted to be affiliated with the ACTU and the professional hacks took over I could not bring myself to be a part of that organisation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, this is no longer the case under the legislation we have introduced and with what we are talking about today. I submit in most cases a compulsory anything is bad. I turn to the example of the Queensland University of Technology Student Guild. The new president of the QUT Liberal Club, Lee Benjamin, wrote to me the other day. He will take over from a chap called Gurdip Singh, who did a great job in the Liberal club. Lee, and people like Dan Hillier, Karl Eaves, Cameron Kretschmer&mdash;even Kylie Lindsay, the daughter of the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is a member&mdash;and members of the Griffith University Liberal club, run by Cassie McAuliffe, are all concerned about compulsory student unionism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The QUT student elections are coming up in mid&hyphen;September. The guild controls $3 million worth of student funds each year. Who controls it? The socialist dominated guild at the QUT controls it. In fact, at last year's federal election it slipped $34,000 of the $3 million into my electorate to campaign to put the Liberals last. This was the use of everybody's funds in a purely partisan way. Happily, the campaign backfired because the students and parents of the students in my electorate were outraged. The guild played such a role in the federal election it basically turned the whole thing back around and assisted the Liberal Party campaign. I am

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just about to conclude my remarks. I certainly am very concerned about matters relating to unfair dismissal, and I have talked about it in the course of my speech here today. The whole area of compulsory unionism, which is also a matter we are discussing and have been discussing in previous contributions today, seems to me to have at its heart, in areas like university campuses in my city of Brisbane, something that needs to be addressed. As far as voluntary student unionism is concerned, it would be a sign to the universities in Queensland that power is back in the hands of the students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would have an effect on the financial base of student unions&mdash;it would stop their extensive support of Labor candidates in marginal seats&mdash;but, by the same token, I believe quite rightly the only good union is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> voluntary union. If unions&mdash;at the student level, the workplace level and at the national level&mdash;are being responsive and doing the sorts of things that workers need them to do, they are going to get the membership they want and, they say, they deserve. That really is what we are talking about here today: freedom for workers, greater flexibility in the workplace, greater rights for small and medium enterprise employers and, hand in hand as a result, greater challenges for the union bosses who are so very much out of touch and who, in so many cases, are represented by people in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious that the Labor member who was listed to speak has been so overwhelmed by the positive arguments put forward by the coalition that he has run away from the debate. The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  we are currently debating is a very simple piece of legislation that, once and for all, sounds the death knell for Laurie Brereton's jobs destroying unfair dismissal law for small businesses employing no more than 15 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened very carefully to the debate and to the contributions made by opposition members. The way they go on piously talking about the rights of the workers, about the legislation introduced by the former Labor government, as though somehow it was a paragon of virtue, is absolutely sickening. Madam Deputy Speaker Sullivan, they ought to remember, as you do, that when the Labor Party brought in its reform legislation in 1993 it shifted the pendulum away from the employers to employees resulting in employers, particularly small business proprietors, simply being too afraid to put on extra staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is not known as the friend of small business, yet even it appreciated that the Brereton reforms went too far. The Labor Party itself, by regulation and by amendment through the parliament, sought to water down the devastating impact of the unfair dismissals laws. When those opposite come in here today to complain about what we are seeking to do, I believe they are displaying a very great degree of hypocrisy. The Labor Party in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7060"> government ought to have done exactly what is being done in the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill: that is, giving a fair go to small business. If we can generate, as we are, the environment in which small business is not afraid to put on staff, more jobs will be created and more Australians, particularly young Australians, will have the opportunity of getting into productive work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on this side of the House and I suspect members on that side of the House, if they were honest, would have to admit that since the 1993 legislation became law there has been a constant trail of constituents to the doors of members of parliament complaining over the draconian consequences of the Brereton unfair dismissal laws, about the fact that they were simply not prepared to put on extra staff because they were concerned about the consequences if they found an employee was simply unable to do the job. As colleagues on this side have indicated, often an employer does not know how good an employee is until the employee is on staff. Most of us could relate horrendous situations where people who had been on the payroll for a relatively short period have been sacked and there have been very substantial claims made against employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this government decided that it simply was not going to huff and puff. We were not going to mouth pious platitudes; we were not going to go out there and tell an untruth. What this government has done is bring in legislation which once and for all will restore a situation where there is a fair go for all, where small business does not have the law slanted against it, so that small business will be able to give extra employees a chance of having a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Tanner interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that really is very important, and I am rather saddened that the honourable member for Melbourne is not supporting this legislation brought in by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As announced in the government's statement of 24 March 1997 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>, we aimed to have employees of small businesses employing no more than 15 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people excluded from unfair dismissals provisions up to the time they have 12 months of continuous service. This change was to be made by regulation but, regrettably, in the Senate the regulation was disallowed following debate on 26 June 1997. Predictably, the Democrats and the ALP voted for the disallowance of this very important regulation which would have given some relief to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, of course, was not prepared to wear these attitudes in the Senate where what they were doing was preventing small business from having an environment where it could actually put on extra staff. So the government announced on the same day that it would introduce legislation, and it brought in legislation providing for an indefinite general exclusion for small business from the draconian provisions of the unfair dismissals law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There also has been much noise emanating from those opposite about what this bill seeks to achieve. I think it is important to set the facts straight so that the people of Australia will know that this government is not attempting to destroy the rights of workers. We are not seeking to turn the clock back to the last century and we are not trying to deprive workers of a fair go. We are planning to create a balance. We aim to redress the inequities introduced by the Labor Party which remained on the statute books right through until we sought to alleviate them by a regulation. So what we are doing now is once and for all fixing up the disastrous changes that were made by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of a small business for the purpose of this bill will be an employer employing 15 or fewer employees. For the purpose of counting employees, a casual employee need not be counted unless he or she has been employed on a regular or systemic basis for at least 12 months. The bill does not take away employees' rights to take action against unlawful termination of employment, that is, dismissal for any discriminatory reason such as age or pregnancy or dismissal without minimum notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that employees will still be protected by the Workplace 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7061"> Relations Act, which protects employees against dismissal because of discriminatory reasons, as I have indicated, or because they have engaged in industrial action. The legislation will also prohibit dismissal which involves victimisation. Employees must also be given one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age, or pay in lieu, except in cases of serious misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all recall that, under the legislation of the former government, people who were stealing from businesses often succeeded in their unfair dismissals claims and that employers were unable to put off people who were sexually harassing staff or customers&mdash;they were unable to sack those who were dishonest&mdash;but I think it is important to recognise that this legislation does achieve what our predecessors should have done and what regrettably they did not do. The bill does not apply to existing employees but only to an employee first engaged by the employer after the new law comes into operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe very strongly in the rights of apprentices, and consequently the bill will not affect the rights of apprentices, who have particular need for protection, given the impact that any break in continuity of service may have in the matter of the attainment of their qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. It makes an enormous contribution to economic growth and job creation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be interested to know that there are 927,000 enterprises making up the Australian economy and that 810,000 of those are private, non-agricultural businesses, and that of these 97 per cent are small business. Small business generates one&hyphen;third of the gross domestic product and accounts for 50 per cent of total employment in Australia. It is responsible for almost half of business employment in Australia&mdash;that is, 3.6 million jobs. Over the past 10 years employment in the small business sector has been growing at the rate of 3.6 per cent a year, more than twice the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is increasingly innovative in Australia. In fact, over 40 per cent of firms 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employing between 10 and 19 people undertake some innovative activity. That is yet another reason why we must support small business and encourage it to grow and invest. We must create the environment, as we are in this bill, that will enable small business to be prepared to give people a chance, to put them on the payroll without being fearful of receiving horrendous verdicts against them in unfair dismissals claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government came to office inheriting a real mess. I think it was the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) opposite who said in a media release that, rather than fixing up the unfair dismissals law, the government should be restoring the economy or something to that effect. Everyone knows that when we inherited office in March last year the nation's accounts were in desperate need of repair. We inherited an economy loaded with heavy debts, huge deficits and high levels of unemployment. Interest rates were far too high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, as everyone knows in the Australian community,  that the coalition has set Australia on a new course of proper fiscal responsibility built on increased national savings, the maintenance of low inflation, reduced pressure on interest rates and restoring the underlying budget balance to surplus. The main building blocks for this are now in place. In headline terms, they include the recently passed workplace relations legislation, a successfully implemented budget strategy, inflation rates which compare favourably with our trading neighbours and five reductions in interest rates since our election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those things are of direct benefit to small business, and small business will obviously be much better off as a result of them. The government has also done more. But, despite everything that we had done, the one thing that people kept taking up with us was the need for us to protect small business from Labor's job destroying unfair dismissals law. Consequently, the legislation before the chamber has been introduced into the parliament, and we make absolutely no apology for it. We have on behalf of small business fixed up the economy and now we are creating an environment where small businesses will not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7062"> be terrified of what tribunals and courts are going to do to them when they put on people who simply are unable to shape up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has tried to suggest that this government is treating people unfairly and that they will be left without any remedy. But it ought to be remembered that the former government itself kept watering down the position of workers in its original legislation. Our predecessors were well aware that something needed to be done, but they did not have the political courage to do it. Everyone realises that the unfair dismissals law was an experiment, but it was an experiment that failed because it simply changed the situation to one where the employers effectively had no rights. We think that is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very pleased to bring this legislation into the parliament. It is not retrospective. It is legislation which will create a situation where small business is prepared to put on extra people. We look forward with confidence to the support of the parliament. We believe that we will obtain the backing of this House, but I urge the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine in the Senate to support this bill because it ought to be above party politics. </PARA>

If the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) were truly honest in reading the bill he would realise that the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is symbolic of the contempt that the Howard coalition holds not only for the job security of Australian workers but for the intelligence of the Australian electorate at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been born not out of genuine desire to provide Australian small businesses and their employees with the most productive and equitable workplace possible but out of helplessness and impotency and despair. This government is gripped by helplessness after failing to make anything even resembling a dent in this nation's unemployment figures in its first 18 months in office. The government is floundering in impotency when it has come to producing the goods for the constituency to which its fortunes are most closely tied&mdash;small business. We have a government whose backbenchers are wringing their hands in despair at the effect that their own policies and mismanagement have had in greatly adding to the deep insecurity many ordinary Australians are feeling in their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To try to drag itself out of the hole into which it has sunk, this government, for purely political reasons, has settled on this bill so it can at least be seen to be doing something 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7063"> constructive both for small business and on the jobs front. Too bad that it is more interested in showy political displays than in actually delivering sound and equitable policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill which could ultimately prove destructive for thousands of Australian workers and their families. As the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), pointed out in his speech in the second reading debate, the question of unfair dismissal has been surrounded by hysteria and myth making, driven in no small measure by the coalition when in opposition for its own political benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's complaints about the unfair dismissal laws were exposed as a load of hot air when it finally came to power. Its so-called new unfair dismissal arrangements bore many similarities to the old laws. As with Labor's laws, the coalition's unfair dismissal provisions contained in its Workplace Relations Act applied to all employers, irrespective of their size. As with Labor's laws, the coalition's unfair dismissal provisions excluded a number of classes of employees, such as those employees serving a probation period. But this did not stop the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) tripping over each other to inform the Australian people of just how many more would benefit now that Labor's unfair dismissal laws had been overthrown. Small business would boom, they said. Jobs would flow. The land of milk and honey was just around the corner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous . . . system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So said the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon. Peter Reith. So why, after the government has trumpeted its changes to all and sundry and shouted from the rooftops that its industrial relations reform agenda was now complete, does it now see the need to return to the drawing boards and do it all over again? That 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is what this bill is all about. As I said, it has to be seen to be doing something&mdash;anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the ABS statistics now show us, since January 1997, when the new unfair dismissal law came into effect, national trend employment growth has continued to fall. In Victoria, trend unemployment has even slipped into negative growth. The recently released Yellow Pages Index shows us that more than 80 per cent of small businesses believe that the economy overall is either in recession or at a standstill. Only eight per cent believe that lower interest rates have really done them any good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So out there in the real world the Howard government is not travelling too well. The electorate want jobs, and this government is not creating any. Small business want help, and this government is not giving them any. The polls are bad. The small business index is even worse, and it all leads to a helpless, impotent and despairing government looking for grand  gestures about which it can make even grander statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, we have this bill which, if passed, will exempt all small businesses from the unfair dismissal provisions in relation to workers employed on or after the commencement of the bill. This means about two million&mdash;and I repeat, for the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) opposite, two million workers&mdash;now protected against being unfairly dismissed will ultimately lose that protection. Their employment will be far less secure. So two million workers could be placed at the mercy of some&mdash;and I say some, not all&mdash;shonky operators and dishonourable small business owners who could take advantage. I believe those shonky ones will take advantage of the new laws to exploit their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government wants to paint itself as the worker's friend. This is not friendship; this is callous disregard and contempt. As I said in my introductory comments, it also shows contempt for the intelligence of the Australian electorate as well. Who said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 20 February last year that any exemption for small businesses concerning the unfair dismissals laws has been flatly ruled out? The Minister for Workplace Rela 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7064"> tions and Small Business. Why has he changed his mind? Because his promises mean nothing to him and he is full of contempt for the Australian electorate at large. Who said on the John Laws program on 25 January last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it with a law that is fair to both sides so that if you are doing your job properly you cannot be capriciously dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">None other than the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard), that's who. Why has he not stuck to his word? Because he is willing to place the careers and the futures of Australian workers at risk in a vain attempt to improve his standing with small business. Who said in Perth on 11 July 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're not going to replace Labor's unfair dismissal laws with a law that gives ruthless employers carte blanche.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister again, that's who. So why is his government doing just that? Because the Prime Minister allowing ruthless employers `carte blanche'&mdash;his words&mdash;is easier now than selling the government's previous reforms to the Australian people. The joke of it all is that small businesses really do not give too much of a damn about the unfair dismissal regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent Morgan and Banks jobs survey, conducted, I might add, among 3,500 small business organisations, revealed that 80 per cent of small business employers did not believe that the existence of the unfair dismissal laws affected their decisions to employ new staff. Only 16 per cent of small business employers believed that they would benefit from the proposal to exempt them from the unfair dismissal laws&mdash;only 16 per cent&mdash;yet we have a bill like this before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, these statistics were basically the same for all other sizes of business&mdash;medium and big business alike&mdash;which would indicate to anyone with their heads screwed on correctly that unfair dismissal laws are not a special concern of small business employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent ACCI survey of small business showed unfair dismissal laws ranked a distant seventh out of eight&mdash;far behind poor sales and a sluggish economy&mdash;in regard to what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employers saw as the main impediments to employment. If members on the other side would still rather not believe me, I ask them to take a look at the most recent Yellow Pages Index report on small business again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do small business owners out there in the areas say they consider to be the most pressing, most urgent matters crying out for federal government reform? If you listened to the government speakers opposite you would expect to find unfair dismissal laws at the top of the list, but it is not. It is at the bottom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only three per cent of small business people surveyed by the Yellow Pages Small Business Index regarded the unfair dismissal provision as an area crying out for urgent federal government reform. It is behind more important issues which have received nothing but neglect from this government after 18 months in office, such as the recommendations of the fair trading report and the need for a growing economy. If the opinions of small business owners are not enough for the government members, perhaps the cold hard facts as to how many small businesses are actually subjected to unfair dismissal claims will help them realise the futility of their current quest. The 1995&hyphen;96 annual report of the Industrial Relations Court shows that small businesses had fewer unfair dismissal claims than any other employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us start with the fact that the unfair dismissal filing rate was slightly under two per cent of all monthly involuntary terminations. Only a third of this figure is from the small business sector, and this is despite the fact that over 90 per cent of employers have fewer than 20 employees. These really are the cold hard facts and I believe they make a laughing&hyphen;stock of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. They make a laughing-stock of every single one of the government's speakers we have heard today on this bill&mdash;all full of mock concern and outrage that we in opposition would even dream of voting against the supposedly `fair' and `necessary' measures which this bill contains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speakers on the other side like to brag about how they are the party of small business. They make endless speeches about how 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7065"> their members spring directly from the ranks of small business. If that is the case, knowing what lies at the root of this piece of legislation and how useless it would be, they should be even more ashamed of themselves. I quote from experience because my husband and I owned and operated a small business in the Sydney suburb of Smithfield for 32 years and I employed up to six people. I know how to run a small business and I know what hard work it is: the hours you keep, the little time you have to spend with your family&mdash;especially when you are also trying to juggle a political career at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking as that former small business person I am amazed that the government is even wasting its time with this amendment. Speaking as a politician I can see that it is doing so out of the basest political motives. Australia does not need these amendments&mdash;the opposition recognises it, small business owners and their employees recognise it and, deep down, behind their wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth and all the moaning and groaning, the government members know it too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a government willing, for its own political ends, to sew inequity and unfairness into the Australian workplace. They promised a fair go, they promised `no open slather', yet now they seem intent on breaking these promises. Why are workers for large and medium businesses deemed eligible for protection under the unfair dismissal laws and small business employees are not? Why doesn't the legislation distinguish between vexatious claims and genuine ones? Why is the size of a business the only factor worthy of classification? Why do the Prime Minister and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business continue to travel the length and breadth of this nation calling on people to give their workplace reforms a chance to sink in while refusing to offer the same grace period to the unfair dismissal laws which were brought in at the same time and as part of that same legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answers are very short in coming, because the answer is simple. Appearances are more important to this government than actually delivering the goods. They want to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appear to have the answers for small business; they want to appear to have the answers for job growth. But just 18 months after taking office it is now all too apparent that appearances do not count for the small business owners and the workers of Australia&mdash;they are turning off this government in droves.</PARA>

But, if this move is to produce the sort of lasting productivity gains that the coalition claims it will, one has to wonder why it has not been extended across the whole business sector. It is reasonable to wonder, isn't it? After all, the principal act, the Workplace Relations Act, provides for such an extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill makes it clear that it will not have significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. By the government's own admission, revenue protection is not an issue here. The coalition continually asserts&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that small business is the engine room of the economy. In Western Australia, for example, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry has noted that this sector accounts for over 95 per cent of all the state's businesses and more than half of private sector employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) glibly referred to comments by a representative of the Council 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7066"> of Small Business Organisations of Australia in his second reading speech. He quoted Mr Rob Bastion as saying that the partial exclusion of small businesses from unfair dismissal was the `jewel in the crown' of the coalition's small business policy. Mr Bastion is cited as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is one which will actually create jobs . . . I am certain of it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is hardly a ringing endorsement of the rest of the government's small business policy, nor has it proven to be a very accurate prediction, given that the latest unemployment figures show that the jobless rate remains on the increase with a rise of 0.2 per cent to 8.7 per cent in July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soon after the introduction of the bill which led to the present principal act, the Assistant Director of the Business Council of Australia suggested that a more aggressive overhaul of Australia's labour market was in order. A spokeswoman for the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has responded that the government was waiting for employees to `avail themselves of the flexibility offered by the current legislation' before seeing whether greater change was necessary. Small business has known about the coalition's commitment to this legislation since 24 March 1997. Despite this unemployment has continued to increase and small business proprietors remain reluctant to engage additional staff. So why not make it easier for the private sector to employ by including all businesses in this exemption?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will not affect the rights of apprentices or of existing employees. Additionally, employees of a small business will continue to have the right to take action against the unlawful termination of employment. In short, this bill will continue to provide a satisfactory level of protection to employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current regulations which prevent an employee from being dismissed because of involvement in protected industrial action or because of victimisation remain intact. Similarly, the bill makes no change to existing rules that prevent a dismissal without a strict adherence to the statutory minimum notice requirements. At the same time it is designed to reassure small business owners that they do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not have to protect themselves from the law at every turn. It is designed to allow small business proprietors to become more productive, and to remove what has become a major constraint on big business competitiveness. It is designed to generate much needed economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, the government deserves credit for releasing an albeit small proportion of business operators from the onerous and outdated unfair dismissal statute. But the decision to extend the velvet glove to some enterprises while excluding others will only further complicate the original Workplace Relations Act. As a former finance minister of New Zealand, Mrs Ruth Richardson, noted last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the politics of reform you have to go for the first best. You only get one shot at reform, so you have to keep it simple and clear. There are no second chances at reform.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second best reforms, like the Australian Workplace Relations Bill, only yield fourth or fifth best results. You become a double loser because you deny the full yield of the reform, and because you suffer an enduring loss of credibility, when piecemeal half&hyphen;measures don't work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The principal workplace relations policy was supposed to be an `all or nothing' package, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker. Instead, the government agreed to a multitude of concessions in its negotiations with who else but the Australian Democrats to facilitate the passage of the legislation through the Senate. It became widely known, and still is, as the Reith-Kernot legislation, and I can understand why. For the minister to have come out of that meeting and present as some great achievement the concessions he made, his appeasement to Senator Kernot, without even having gone to his party room or even his cabinet, I suspect, for approval was one of the great public confidence tricks I have ever seen. But I have digressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may have been a necessary evil, but it disappointed many in the business sector and prompted one economist to describe the act as a `mild' piece of labour market reform that was `not radical enough to be expected to have major impacts on unemployment'. The minister conceded as much when he intro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7067"> duced this bill. He said that, although the existing Workplace Relations Act had introduced important changes, it had not gone far enough for small business. The same is true of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An acceleration of regulatory reform is essential if Australian industry is to reassert itself in the international marketplace. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> noted in its editorial of 12 February 1996 that the paperwork burden on small business could be reduced by 50 per cent but only `by a thorough tax  reform'. The money and time spent by small businesses complying with their burdensome taxation obligations will not be substantially lessened by chipping away at the edges of that particular problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way, if Australia is ever to recover from the disastrous anti&hyphen;employment impact of Labor's unfair dismissal legislation, exemptions from it must be more extensive than in the past and than is now proposed. It is a pity that the Democrats and the other minor party in the Senate cannot come to grips with that. Were it not for their decision to move a motion of disallowance against the regulation relating to unfair dismissal in the principal act, this bill would not have even been necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During debate on the Workplace Relations Act I said that those who opposed the bill were threatening Australia's economic future. The same applies in this instance. Small businesses are confidence driven. They want to see stability and consistency in government policy. Making regular amendments to industrial relations legislation or any other legislation which affects their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations does not inspire confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business made it clear in his second reading speech that the government's industrial relations policy is integral to its formula for promoting growth and development. Economic growth and development are especially important in the light of the most recent report by the Institute for Management Development, IMD, which compared our rate of competitiveness in the global marketplace with that our of our OECD contemporaries. The report confirmed that Australia is becom 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing increasingly uncompetitive and that this is due to three key factors. Our poor performance in the industrial relations area is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the IMD, industrial disputes, corporate credibility, compensation levels, yearly wage growth and industrial relations `contributed significantly to Australia's below average performance'. It was this result that prompted the authors of the 1996 spring edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Policy</EMPHASIS> to note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nowhere is reform more urgent than in the labour market. Labour market reform should be concerned with increasing flexibility and improving work practices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But industrial relations is not the only portfolio where the government must bite the bullet and start taking some hard decisions. As Dr John Marsden, the economic adviser for the Yellow Pages Small Business Index, noted in March 1997, the key drivers of small business are private consumption, non-investment dwelling and home building. He observed that, while a reduction in red tape is `highly desirable' in promoting employment, the government must `lift demand growth to ensure that small business shares in the 1997 upturn'.</PARA>

In March 1997, the Australian Certified Practising Accountants small business index demonstrated that 15 per cent of small businesses had placed the extension of the exemption from unfair dismissal at the top of their wish list from the federal government. This figure must be compared with the 80 per cent that believe tax reform was what was most critical to improving the lot of small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In introducing this bill, the minister said that the government `has been listening to the concerns of small business'. Then why does the government continue to refuse to give any kind of formal undertaking to introduce a total overhaul of our tax system? Despite what the minister had to say earlier this year, this bill should not be regarded as the `icing on the cake', nor the `final plank' in the policy change that we have had in connection with unfair dismissals.</PARA>

Today represents a significant step for me in fulfilling that commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am probably as well qualified as any other person in this place to speak about the effect of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill , which we are discussing today. I have run a small business now for 25 years. It employs 14 people. Before I entered the parliament, year after year I went through the concerns of whether I should employ another person, whom I desperately needed to employ, because it may be very difficult to change those circumstances if the person did not turn out to be the right person.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK6">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In running a business, people always have to be mindful of their expenses and income. Unfortunately, small business is not run like the government. Small business does not have guaranteed income. Small business runs from day to day and operates in the flexibility of the market. There are upturns and there are downturns. Small business people have to be very careful about how they manage in most instances the most expensive cost in running a business. In my mind as a manager, I did not employ people because of Labor's unfair dismissal laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not about sacking people. This bill is about jobs. It is about employing people. It is about giving business the confidence to employ more people as they need them. So I am backing this bill because, for me and for the small business community, it delivers jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed over recent months opposition members going around the country trying to exorcise the unfair dismissal laws they have implemented as if they were dead weight. They are trying to fool the business community into thinking that Laurie Brereton's job destroying unfair dismissal laws are no longer theirs; that suddenly, after some amendments they opposed to ease the burden on small businesses, they are now the Howard government's unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some news for members opposite: the small business community have not forgotten, nor will they forget, that the unfair dismissal laws were your handiwork. It was the handiwork of the Labor Party. Let me repeat that: the small business community have not forgotten, nor will they forget, that the unfair dismissal laws were your handiwork. The opposition no longer want ownership of their unfair dismissal laws, and that does not surprise me one bit. They will still defend them tooth and nail in this House for the benefit of their union mates. They will kick up a stink about any reforms to their laws, but they do not want to accept responsibility for them. That is the real difference between Labor and Liberal, opposition and government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a government we accept our responsibilities. We did not create the $10,000 million budget deficit, but we have faced up to our responsibilities as a government and we have done something about it. We did not drive apprenticeships and traineeships to their lowest level in recent memory, but we have faced up to our responsibilities as a government and we are doing something to fix it. The business that I am responsible for is a technical business. I can no longer find trained staff to operate that business because of what your lot did to the apprenticeship system in our state. It is just disgraceful.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7069">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same applies to the unfair dismissal laws. We did not dream up these ridiculous laws. The Labor Party did. The Howard coalition government did not implement the unfair dismissal laws. The Labor Party did. We fought them tooth and nail in opposition but now that we are in government we are facing up to our responsibilities as a government and we are doing something to fix that problem. We are for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Prime Minister Paul Keating recognised what Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws were doing to the Labor Party and its image in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election. Yet the best that Keating could come up with was a half&hyphen;hearted promise a few days out from the election to take a second look at the unfair dismissal laws if his government were re-elected. Thank heavens the government was not re-elected. That is the difference between the Howard government and the former Labor government: for 13 years the Labor Party said they would do something for small business and did nothing; we are actually doing something to ease the burden on small business and doing something about business confidence. And the ALP opposition does not like it one bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this bill provides the means for Townsville and Thuringowa businesses employing 15 or fewer people to be exempt from unfair dismissal action in relation to new employees who are, after royal assent of this bill, employed for less than 12 months. The small business community, including my small business community, want this reform because they recognise that under the previous government's ridiculous system they could not get rid of people who proved they simply were not up to the job, through no fault of their own. These changes will allow small businesses to take on new employees with much greater certainty. When it comes to employing people, confidence and certainty are very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind you that just the other week the Queensland state parliament voted in favour of similar legislation to what is proposed today. Queenslanders led the way in introducing workplace relations reforms at the state level, mirroring in many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> respects the changes that I am supporting here this afternoon. The state Minister for Training and Industrial Relations, the Hon. Santo Santoro, is to be commended for his leading role in this reform. Indeed, in Townsville and Thuringowa and throughout North Queensland, these changes to workplace relations at state level have been welcomed by many small business operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville Chamber of Commerce President, Mal Missingham, was quoted in the local media recently as saying that the exemptions would encourage small business to hire new staff, which I think is the central point of the reforms being debated today. This is why I say that this bill is not about sacking people; this bill is about jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said in his speech in the second reading debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this exemption is not just about removing a burden from small business, it is about the positive employment benefits of the expanded job opportunities that will surely result from the removal of that burden.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These changes will enable Townsville and Thuringowa small businesses to hire new employees with greater certainty, which can only enhance job prospects, particularly the job prospects of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly disappoints me when I hear the speeches of members opposite. I understand that they speak passionately and I understand that they speak from the heart, but it is such a shame that they are wrong. They do not understand the operations of business. They do not understand how this legislation can bring back business confidence and, with it, jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All small business operators from time to time have agonised over the process of taking on a new staff member at one time or another. Taking on a new employee is very much like taking a gamble&mdash;how do you really know if you have the right person until you give them a go? That is the dilemma. Small business people do not have the same personnel recruiting resources that bigger businesses have access to. They simply do not, and the ALP opposition and the unions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7070"> need to wake up to themselves to understand this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr James O'Donnell, the North Queensland Secretary of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, is certainly one person who needs a dose of reality in relation to life as a small business owner. He came up with the ridiculous claim recently that most problems small businesses face in relation to this issue are as a result of poor management, a statement which I think is reflective of the ALP's and the union movement's attitude to small business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the member for Melbourne supporting Mr O'Donnell? I would not if I were you. Mr O'Donnell needs to realise that small business operators do not have endless hours to spend in exhaustive recruiting processes. Mr O'Donnell needs to realise that small business operators cannot always afford to spend hundreds of dollars getting a recruiting company to do the hiring for them. Mr O'Donnell needs to realise that small business operators have to make all the personnel decisions themselves on top of everything else that they do. Mr O'Donnell needs to realise this, the unions need to realise all of this and the ALP needs to  realise all of this as well. The fact is that you do not know until you give someone a try whether or not they are the right person for the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard many small business operators in Herbert say that they are putting off hiring new staff because they feared the person was not right for the job and they would be sued for unfair dismissal if they tried to replace that person. Small businesses certainly need the certainty that, if they take on a person who turns out to be unsatisfactory, they can do something to correct that situation without being sued in return. That proposition is eminently fair and sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr O'Donnell claims that hiring an inadequate person in the first place is bad management. Politely, that is hogwash. The Federated Clerks Union can call it bad management if they want, but I call it giving someone a fair go. How else are we going to get the large number of young, unemployed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians off the dole queue and into jobs unless we start giving them a fair go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment small business people in Townsville and Thuringowa are saying that they would like to give young Australians a fair go but, because of the situation with Labor's unfair dismissal laws, they simply cannot take the risk. Frivolous unfair dismissal claims are threatening the livelihood of small businesses. The cost to small businesses of defending unfair dismissal claims is considerable. It is considerable in dollars and it is considerable in terms of time that small business owners need to spend away from their business defending these claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this point, I would like to put on the record one of the most uninformed comments concerning small business and unfair dismissal laws. Again, it comes from the North Queensland spokesman for the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, Mr James O'Donnell. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To argue that small business could go out of business because of unfair dismissals is crazy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously, Mr O'Donnell has no concept of the burden Labor's unfair dismissal laws are placing on North Queensland small businesses. The Labor opposition, in opposing tooth and nail these necessary reforms, have shown that they have learnt nothing since March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope we can have a rational debate on this legislation. I hope that the government is successful in convincing the opposition how wrong they are. I certainly will be proudly voting for this piece of legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence by declaring my interest. I am a member, and very proudly so, of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. I was a representative of that organisation for some years. I say proudly so because it was my privilege to represent workers who were unfairly, unjustly or harshly terminated by unscrupulous employers, many of whom were small business operators who had unfairly terminated a worker's job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What needs to be remembered in this debate is the consequences for the worker on losing his or her job, the consequences for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7071"> family and the fact that workers suffer a great deal of hardship, not only financial hardship but also emotional hardship, and emotional distress when dealing with all sorts of terrible things that happen to families and workers who are unfairly dealt with. The greatest concern for all Australians under this government is their ability to find a job and, having found one, their ability to keep it. That is why we cannot feed on workers' insecurities by exempting small businesses from unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the rhetoric of organisations like the H.R. Nicholls Society, that lunar right organisation which has an anti&hyphen;worker agenda and which does not operate in the interests of any decent person in this country, the major concern of small business in this country is not industrial relations legislation. In fact, 97 per cent of small business say it is not really the priority. If small business say that it is not the priority, the question has to be asked: why does the government say that it is a priority for small business? It is a condescending attitude perpetrated by the government, or perhaps it is a duplicitous one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issues advocated by small business people in Australia are not unfair dismissal laws; they are things like lessee arrangements and franchisee rights. They are things that this government will not act on. They are things that small business people say they want action on but this government is too gutless to take on big business interests and actually sort out the problems that small business want sorted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate people who are lessees and franchisees are getting nailed to the wall. They are dealt with by very large businesses in a very unfair way. They are under a huge amount of pressure. That affects their capacity to employ people. That is what they want fixed up. When they come and see me and talk about the sorts of things they want this parliament to take up and resolve for them, they do not talk about unfair dismissal; they talk about the things that are affecting their commercial operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industrial relations laws of this country are not stopping small business from hiring workers; it is issues such as lessee rights, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> franchisee rights and commercial interest rates, which are still exorbitantly high. Industry policy and consumer confidence are things that small business wants fixed up. Industry policy has been the subject of a lot of debate in this chamber. Businesses want an industry policy from government. They want things like a steel plan and a car industry plan. They want industry policy, they want industry leadership and they want the government to take action on the issues which affect them, not the political agendas of the H.R. Nicholls Society, as articulated by that society's members in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Behind the message that small business is the engine room of jobs growth is the other message that somehow small businesses are to blame for the lack of performance in jobs growth. The Liberals are trying to get the rest of the country to excuse them in their lack of industry policy for not creating employment and for not giving people real jobs by blaming it on the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have already changed the industrial relations legislation. When they brought it in they heralded it with a lot of fanfare and said that they had fixed up all the problems, and wasn't it wonderful, and that, arising from the changes to the industrial relations legislation, employment would be stimulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of us on this side of the House believed&mdash;and certainly this was not my belief&mdash;that employment growth would arise from attacking workers' rights. That is what the facts bear out. Where is your employment growth? Come on, where is it? Where are all the jobs that came out of the last round of industrial relations changes? You attacked the workers last time. You would have liked to have continued but you had some difficulties in doing so. Nonetheless, you managed to attack workers' rights. Where is the employment growth? There has not been any. Employment growth does not arise from making everyone worried and concerned about their job security. In fact, the opposite scenario can be advocated: there is a lack of consumer confidence brought about by people having a fundamental concern about their security.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7072">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the last election one of the underlying issues in the electorate in my view was a concern over constant change and a sense of insecurity. When the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), talked about making people comfortable and relaxed, he tapped into that sentiment. People actually want to be more comfortable and confident in their futures. This legislation does not deliver that. This is not an insignificant measure on behalf of the government. This affects over two million workers&mdash;a lot of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are now saying that the legislation is not working and they like to give us a bit more of a dose. They want to blame it on the Labor government. The current legislation was brought down by the Liberal government, the coalition government. It was drafted by the then Minister for Industrial Relations, it got through the parliament and it was made into law. It was owned by the coalition. You made it, not the Labor Party. Now you say that it is not good enough. The question has to be asked about your confidence in your own competence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Minister for Industrial Relations at the time, there would not be so much as a ripple of change to the legislation&mdash;no third wave&mdash;yet there has been. But, like so much of the rhetoric coming from the coalition, it was essentially an empty promise. Now you are back here after another round of attack. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not going to leave employees exposed to unfair dismissal by capricious employers . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is precisely what this legislation does. By taking away unfair dismissal but leaving unlawful termination as a remedy, you essentially make it impossible for someone who has been unlawfully terminated to mount a successful case. The unscrupulous employer who wishes to terminate someone for an unjust, unreasonable reason&mdash;race, religion, gender, pregnancy, political orientation or that they choose to join a union&mdash;will carry out terminations on those bases. It would be nigh on impossible to exercise rights afforded on paper because the employer would never have to answer questions like, `Why did you sack the person?' The employer would be able to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say, `I didn't sack them unlawfully, I just sacked them unfairly, and the parliament says that is fine. The government has given me the green light to treat people unfairly. And, by the way, I am not going to put on extra people for having that extra right.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A month before the election, the Prime Minister told his adviser, John Laws, on radio that he would not have a law where an unreasonable employer could capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee. That is precisely what this legislation provides. It provides for employers to capriciously sack workers. On ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daybreak</EMPHASIS>, three days before the election, the then Minister for Industrial Relations&mdash;now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith)&mdash;said, `Our position is very clear: if you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.' This legislation takes away the right of appeal from someone who has been dealt with unfairly&mdash;not unlawfully; unfairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government made clear commitments to the electorate. It gained governance on the basis of commitments made to the workers of this country: that Australian workers would not be worse off under their regime and that workers who were unfairly dealt with at work would have a right of appeal. And that is what you are taking away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's unfair dismissal provisions applied to all employers irrespective of their size. The provisions did, however, exclude a number of classes of employees, including employees serving a probationary period where that was notified and reasonable. The idea of having a notified and reasonable probationary period accords with what small business need and want in order to make their hiring and firing decisions. There could be no impediment to small business hiring and firing workers when they were able to institute a fair and just probationary period with new workers. That was the regime under the previous legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intellectual argument to justify this attack on almost half of the country's workers is not available to you. You do not have the intellectual argument. There is plenty of rhetoric about small business not being able to hire people and being bound up in red tape 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7073"> and all the rest of it, but the fact is that, when you put in your last reforms, we did not see any employment growth. Employment growth will not come out of this legislation either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the ABS, the bill affects over two million workers. How does it affect them? We have talked a little about procedural fairness. The bill removes all semblance of procedural fairness for workers. The reason why procedural fairness is required is that workers who have had accusations made about them should have the opportunity of responding to them. It is a fairly commonly accepted and decent proposition, which is not unreasonable or outrageous, that if someone makes an accusation about you, you have the opportunity of responding to it before you lose your income. It does not mean much to members opposite, but for Australian workers&mdash;almost half of them&mdash;to be denied the opportunity of responding to allegations made about them over misunderstandings and so on that arise from time to time is outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill removes unfair dismissal provisions but it boasts that it still retains sanctions against unlawful dismissal. That is misleading. It is quite clear that this is code for allowing unscrupulous employers to dismiss workers unfairly. An example is where an employer wants to sack a worker on the basis of their union membership. This would be technically unlawful. However, it would be almost impossible for the worker to bring an action against the employer in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this is essentially a spiteful piece of legislation. The working class in this country kept the coalition out of government for 13 years, and now it is payback time. There is no reasonable explanation outside of that scenario. There is no intellectual, rational or logical support for this legislation. This legislation will not stimulate jobs. It will not stimulate employment opportunities for young people&mdash;the last legislation did not. This is simply going to pour petrol on the fire of uncertainty in the population. That is not a good thing for the people or for the nation as a whole.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I rise to speak to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  not just to represent a union but also to represent the total membership of my electorate, whether they are employers or employees. We often hear from the other side of the chamber about conflict of interest. Accusations of conflict of interest are made against this side of the House in relation to many bills discussed here. I suggest that being a financial member of a union might just rate as a conflict of interest when we are discussing a bill such as the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill. The members on the other side who are all members of unions&mdash;not just one, but the lot&mdash;certainly have a very major point to raise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I stand to speak to this bill to amend the Workplace Relations Act is quite simple: it is what the business community in my electorate has demanded. The business organisations I represent are pretty typical of others throughout the nation. My Brisbane electorate is diverse, with many well&hyphen;established suburbs and old, established businesses. There are large areas of new development, with modern shopping centres and small business operators who have joined in this residential growth area. My electorate also has a large area of residential acreage. Most of the people who have chosen this lifestyle have done so because they run a business from their small properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message I get from the full range of small business operators in my electorate is very loud and clear. They want changes to the Workplace Relations Act, changes that will give them the same rights as their employees, and that is a fair go. There is no chance that I am misreading this message. I have held public meetings, several of which were addressed by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who regularly visits my electorate. I have attended chamber of commerce meetings and numerous dinners, lunches and breakfasts with all manner of business organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have met and spoken with business people ranging from executives of the Chinese business community to the retailers of my local shopping centre. I can say without fear of contradiction that they want substantial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7074"> changes to the unfair dismissal provisions in particular. More than that, most want them eliminated all together. They are seen as a giant claw which is strangling small business and making it difficult, if not impossible, to employ staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What must be made clear is that this amendment, while giving some small business operators freedom from the unfair dismissal provisions, does not remove the workers' rights or diminish the workers' powers of legal action if they are treated unfairly by an employer. But it does allow small business operators to run their businesses without being blackmailed. Anyone who says that this has not been happening has not been out and about in the marketplace. Small business operators who need only one or two extra staff members cannot afford to employ a stranger while there is a threat of unaffordable litigation hanging over their heads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put it in a nutshell: too many business people are taken to the cleaners by unscrupulous employees who know full well that the business operator has not the funds nor the resources for a legal battle. The small business community in my electorate is hurting and hurting badly. That is a 13&hyphen;year legacy from the other side of this chamber. Business people have made it quite clear that they expected a change in the state of affairs with the change in government. The message I have been given is that, until we give employers some of the rights and freedoms enjoyed by their staff, hiring will continue to remain as difficult as firing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simplistic to say that there are two sides to every story. We all know there is. But here is one I have been able to observe from close quarters and know to be very true. The employer in question is a widow who has worked six days a week to maintain the business founded by her husband 20 years ago. Her fault as a businesswoman is that she is not ruthless enough. In fact, she is downright motherly. She raised seven children and has the ingrained habit of treating her staff as part of her extended family. She has assisted with loans, supplied company vehicles for private use, pays well over award wages and has always encouraged flexible hours to suit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the needs of her staff, particularly those with young children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two years ago, faced with increasing competition, rising property values and other commercial factors, she was forced to scale down the business by more than 50 per cent. Scaling down this company did not happen overnight. In fact, it took more than a year. The building had to be sold and smaller premises founded. During the many months the building was up for sale, the staff were well aware that five of the eight permanent positions would go in the change. It was clearly understood. Everyone had time off, if needed, when looking for other work. The day came and the business moved to smaller premises with the hope that the change would mean commercial survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this was stressful enough for the businesswoman in question, but nothing compared to what she was about to receive in perfectly legal harassment. The small businesswoman had underestimated the greed factor. In fact, she had not considered any of her staff could or would consider that they had been unfairly dismissed. The closing of the old business and the opening of the new but smaller venture had been a sad parting&mdash;the end of an era. There had been a closing down gathering, a farewell party, gifts and promises to keep in touch. In this case, one did so by suing for unfair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former employee, with legal advice, took advantage of every possible legal avenue established under the Workplace Relations Act and the unfair dismissal provisions. She demanded compensation for stress caused by the dismissal. The businesswoman, struggling to rebuild her business in a new location, had to hire lawyers for the case which dragged on for nine months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as she is concerned, she no longer believes in equal rights. She has seen first&hyphen;hand the abuse of legislation which was introduced to protect the honest worker being used to advantage by the dishonourable. The unfair dismissal provisions, which were designed to protect those who worked diligently but who were treated unfairly, can be used by the unethical in such a manner as to cripple a small business operator.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can turn to the Leader of the Opposition: I do not know, without checking with my staff, of particular requests to see people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question and for his obvious concern for his electorate. I know that he, as a new member here, would be doing particularly well in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware of the announcement made by DuPont yesterday afternoon. My immediate reaction was that it was due to the mismanagement of the economy in the Labor Party's day due to your tariff rules and your particular deal. To make sure I was right I sought advice from the department as to exactly what did happen. My department advises me that DuPont took over Fibremakers in June 1990. At that time the Labor government approved a one&hyphen;off taxable grant to DuPont of some $59 million. The grant represented the capitalisation of the company's future bounty reserves for the period to 30 June 1995. The bounty capitalisation agreement was clearly an important 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> factor in DuPont's decision to buy Fibremakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, the acting minister for industry&mdash;you know who, just back from France; you never know where he is and I have not heard much of him&mdash;when he came back said on a national ABC radio program on 11 August `Our industry policy failed.' And no wonder it did. On this day he said, in announcing this decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DuPont will make a considerable new investment yielding a much larger, more export orientated business which will operate in a zero&hyphen;tariff, zero&hyphen;bounty environment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You said that; they are your words. As part of the agreement, the company agreed to meet a number of commitments. While most of these have been honoured, some commitments entered into on a best endeavours basis were not&mdash;for example, to undertake capital investment of some $7 million by December 1996. In the event, expenditure did not reach that level. The agreement between the government and Fibremakers appears to have ended in 1996. However, in 1991 the Labor government announced that the yarn bounty would phase out in 1995 and would be replaced by a five per cent tariff. So not only did they get the benefit of the capitalisation of the bounty, the $59 million, at the time but later they picked up the five per cent tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise these questions because I noted that the chief executive of the company said that this was all because they were concerned about the outcome of the Productivity Commission and the report, and all these things. He has to understand that the report is not out yet; there is only an interim statement out. The government will respond to that report when it is out and, when they do, that is the government decision that we will stand by. In the meantime, they are acting under your rules&mdash;under Labor Party rules, no&hyphen;one else's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, when they are making these decisions around the place, they should be aware that at this particular moment there is no government decision and what they have done is purely a commercial outcome under your rules. If DuPont are serious, they ought to wait for the final result. At the same time, if they are serious they should

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The fact of the matter is that Labor's taxation system was characterised by high taxes on a narrow base with complexity because of a multitude of rates. Under Labor's sales tax system, sales tax rates can apply at 0, 12, 22, 26, 32 and 45 per cent&mdash;a multiple rate with complexity for business as business engages in classification to try to determine whether the goods will be taxed at 0, 12, 22, 26, 32 or 45 per cent. This is the system that the Labor Party says should not be improved on. This is the system which the Labor Party refuses to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not because they do not recognise the problems of the system. The inequities and complexities have been acknowledged by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. When asked at the National Press Club on 21 May 1997 whether the present indirect tax system is inequitable for low income earners, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition responded, `There is some inequity. I think that is fair to say, yes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a situation where you acknowledge the inequity of the system but vow not to do anything about it. They acknowledge the inequity of the system and vow not to do anything about it. When interviewed on 3AW on 13 May, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some problems in the tax system and I think we are all well aware of them, in particular the fact that the service part of the economy is not, I suppose, pulling its weight as the character of the economy changes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again: `We acknowledge the problem, we know the difficulty and we vow to do nothing about it.' This is cheapjack politics practised by the opposition in relation to a problem which they know needs fixing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we have any sensible idea of a tax reform proposal coming out of the Australian Labor Party? Apart from their vow not to do anything about tax reform, we have had one idea in relation to taxes. You know what it was: it is the old chestnut.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7078"> the age&hyphen;old one wanted by the Labor Party: death duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 17 August, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked what he would do about Commonwealth-state relations. And he is entitled to be taken at his word. There is a view getting around that you do not have to take any notice of the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. You do. He is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the spokesman on tax matters. We take him very seriously on this side of the House. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The truth of the matter, for those who get very excited about Commonwealth&hyphen;state tax imbalances, is that the states can redress the balance in a number of ways&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is what he said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">not only through service taxes but through the old chestnut of property and inheritance taxes, through additional surcharges of income tax, and, of course, through payroll tax, which they have got already&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and here it is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">so it is really up to them to bite the bullet on the old chestnut of property and inheritance taxes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He got up in the parliament and sought to explain this. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not say the states should impose death duties, services taxes, income tax surcharges or higher payroll taxes&mdash;just that they can do any of those things if they choose.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what he said&mdash;`if they choose'. What did he really say? `It is up to them to bite the bullet.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is becoming clear what the Labor Party's policy is. The Labor Party policy is this: `The sales tax system is a mess and we know it, but we will not do anything about it because we are going to try and play cheapjack politics in relation to this government's attempts to reform the tax system. But simultaneously with that we have a secret agenda.

Disgusting as this practice is, it is important as a nation that we do not lose sight of the fact that 30 per cent of the abuse is by strangers, while 70 per cent of the abuse is by people whom children know and trust&mdash;and this seems to me to be the ultimate betrayal of our nation's children.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. In fact, while going around his electorate the other day we went into a number of small businesses that were doing very well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would have to also say that there are still a lot of businesses out there doing things pretty tough. There are some businesses out there today who have done well merely to survive the recession in the early 1990s and interest rates of 24 per cent, 25 per cent and 26 per cent, which they had under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put in place a very supportive macro-economic climate for small business. Interest rates are down, unfair dismissals are down in the federal jurisdiction by 55 per cent and inflation is down. We are working to put some of those economic parameters in place. But we do, as I say, acknowledge that things are patchy for some. But, at the same time, I think we should also recognise this because it should give small business generally a sense of confidence about the possibilities in the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7083">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the survey, there are some positive signs in it: expectations for an improved economy in 12 months are firm nationally; 63 per cent expect an increase in sales over the next 12 months; and 62 per cent expect an increase in profitability. There are a number of so-called prime concerns defined by the survey for small business. They are mainly in the sales cash flow areas, although the biggest prime concern in that category was none&mdash;a view held by 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do note that the small business community is looking to the government to get on with the pace of reform. In respect of tax reform, small business thought the government should be addressing that issue&mdash;and we are. And it is the Labor Party that is implacably opposed to what the small business community knows from their own practical experience&mdash;that we need to get on with in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The index has some positives and some minuses in it. I acknowledge that. But I think it is wrong for the opposition to selectively focus on the negatives. When they were in office&mdash;someone got it out for me&mdash;no-one had a record like they did. So after a while they adopted the policy of shoot the messenger. The parliamentary secretary at the time said in the chamber less than two years ago about the Yellow Pages index:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . [it] is fatally flawed. It was targeted specifically with a political bias.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then he said&mdash;and mark these words because I have a feeling you will hear them again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence, we say on the record that this report has no integrity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here they are 18 months later quoting it at us. We do not need a survey; we are interested in what small business says. We are out and about talking to small business people. If you want a representative from the government in Lithgow, then I suggest people vote for one at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point I want to make is that we have to engender confidence out there amongst consumers. I think that is happening; I think it is slowly improving. Many small businesses that I speak to see that and see the prospects for that. That is reported in this particular survey.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party could do to boost small business is to support the government on a couple of key measures. They ought to be putting through the unfair dismissal provisions and they ought to be giving us a decent run in the Senate in respect of capital gains tax. Someone said to me the other day that that is a benefit you get only when you retire. But the truth of the matter is that successful small businesses are making gains to their business every day. Under Labor's policy, every day you have the capital gains tax sitting there to penalise them for their efforts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I do have information on margins relating to bank lending. The recent bulletin of the Reserve Bank of Australia comments on recent cuts in official interest rates and recent cuts in home mortgage lending. It notes, of course, that home mortgage lending in Australia now is the lowest it has been since the 1960s. When this government was elected, the standard variable mortgage was 10.5 per cent. Now you can get one for 6.5 per cent. That is a saving to the average Australian home buyer of nearly $4,000 a year, which is after&hyphen;tax money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of that has been a reduction in official interest rates, which have been cut five times during the period of this government's term. The Reserve Bank notes that, in addition, there have been competition induced cuts in mortgage lending&mdash;2.5 per cent in official rates but nearly four per cent in relation to the standard variable mortgage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reserve Bank notes in its bulletin that competition in the housing loan market in Australia has produced spreads against funding costs which are slim by historical standards and in line with those in other comparable countries. We have always had fat margins on the home lending rate in Australia. But, as a result of new entrants and new competition, those margins have been reduced to slim by historical standards and in line with those in other comparable countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been one of the great successes of new competition in the finance industry. It is hand in glove with measures to open up the cheques system to credit unions and building societies.

It is part of this government's responsible fiscal policy which has given the benefits in relation to low interest rates.</PARA>

Over the past few weeks letters have been sent to all Telstra customers, to the clients of brokers and to the bondholders of Telstra. In addition to that, there has been an extensive advertising campaign, in print and on television, inviting all Australians to reserve the public document. The advertisements on TV and in print invite the public to telephone the Telstra information centre on 1800 181818 and to reserve that public offer document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who do reserve the public offer document will be guaranteed an allocation of shares. This is the first time in a Commonwealth share offer that that guarantee has been extended. It is available to all Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague said in the other place earlier this week, the government's commitment before the election to the employees of Telstra has not only been honoured but been exceeded.

They will receive one free share for every four that they purchase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the public share offer is on track to occur this year. It is hoped that one&hyphen;third of the Telstra shares will be available later in the year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Groom for his question. The Australian government has taken immediate steps to engage the new Papua New Guinea government through my visit to Papua New Guinea on 24 and 25 August. This was the second visit I have made to Papua New Guinea this year and the third in my time as foreign minister. It was, of course, with the election 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7087"> of a new government in Papua New Guinea, timely to develop a close working relationship with that government. During my visit I had extensive discussions with the new Prime Minister, Mr Skate, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Haiveta, foreign minister Genia and a number of other senior ministers. We discussed a wide range of issues, including our development assistance program, the trade relationship between the two countries and the defence cooperation program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get to the specifics of the honourable member's question, needless to say there were extensive discussions about the tragic and long running conflict on Bougainville. Ever since this government has been in office we have been determined to make a contribution to try to resolve that problem&mdash;as, to be fair, I think the previous government did, as well. It is our judgment that the end of the Sandline crisis has presented an important window of opportunity to promote the peace process. As a first step in the process, the Australian government funded talks between the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, the Bougainville Interim Government and the Bougainville Transitional Government in Honiara some weeks ago. Subsequent to those talks, discussions were held amongst all the Bougainville parties in Burnham, New Zealand. The New Zealand foreign minister, Don McKinnon, and I have been working very closely together to ensure that both our countries are able to contribute constructively to the Bougainville peace process. The cooperation between Australia and New Zealand on this issue is a very important component of how we are taking the issue forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, both Australia and New Zealand believe that it is not possible for us to promote a blueprint for the resolution of the Bougainville problem. The solution to this problem has to be worked out by Papua New Guineans themselves, including Bougainvilleans. What we can do is facilitate the process, and both our countries in a very coordinated way are usefully doing that. The next round of talks between the Bougainville parties and officials from the Papua New Guinea government, which will take place next month, will be in New Zealand. We will, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of course, help with the transport arrangements for the delegates to those talks. There will be a subsequent round of talks, I hope, in October and again we will be involved in the transportation of delegates to those talks. The important point for the House to understand is that it is not going to be constructive for the Australian government, or for that matter the New Zealand government, or both of us, to try to impose a blueprint on Bougainvilleans and more broadly the people of Papua New Guinea. That will be rejected. It is important that we facilitate the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by saying that one of the truly most constructive things Australia can do is assist with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bougainville. The people of Bougainville need to understand that there is a peace dividend. If they choose the path of peace then their island will be assisted with reconstruction. The Australian government is going to provide over the next five years some $100 million to assist with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bougainville. I am very strongly of the view that that is a very valuable contribution Australia is making to the Bougainville peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is very familiar with this issue. He will know only too well that there have been moments when it has looked as though the Bougainville peace process was going to take off&mdash;in Cairns, in Arawa and on board the New Zealand warship the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canterbury</EMPHASIS>. Tragically these moments when it looked as though there was going to be a breakthrough foundered for one reason or another. There is no value in going back over the history of that. It is the Australian government's view that this now represents a real opportunity to take the peace process forward. We have been disappointed in the past. We can only hope that this time, on behalf of all the people of Bougainville and the countries of our region, this peace process can at last be truly successful.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Just to give an example, in 1995&hyphen;96 there were 657 arrests based on intercepted information and there were 596 convictions, and a large part of those arrests and convictions related to drug offences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interception through the use of telecommunications devices is very intrusive, and on both sides of the House there has been support in the past for these warrants being given out sparingly. It has been common that they should be given by federal judges, but things have changed a little. The issue of a warrant is not a judicial function. The High Court has pointed this out, and constitutionally the consent of the judges is required. The judges have&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MELHAM" NAMEID="4T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr Melham</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what they said in Grollo. Don't misrepresent Grollo. It was an overwhelming majority decision. That is why they upheld it. You know it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Banks would be wise to listen to this. All the federal judges have now said they will not issue warrants. They have said that for three reasons: firstly, it is not a judicial function; secondly, it imposes an additional workload that they are not able to cope with; and, thirdly and very importantly, they find themselves as respondents to judicial review applications in their own court. So the government has come up with an alternative proposal that senior legally qualified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be the ones to issue the warrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a perfectly reasonable proposal, and one would think that it could not reasonably be opposed. But, of course, it is opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party voted against the bill in the House and the shadow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7090"> Attorney&hyphen;General, Senator Bolkus, has indicated that the Labor Party will vote against the bill in the Senate. If that bill is not passed, there is a risk that the use of telecommunications interceptions and listening devices will no longer be available to law enforcement agencies. That would seriously cripple the fight against crime. The shadow Attorney&hyphen;General's solution is to appoint more judges&mdash;more of the people who have said they will not do the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow Attorney&hyphen;General asserts that the Labor Party is committed to law enforcement. Their actions speak otherwise. Their actions represent a cogent example of putting political point&hyphen;scoring above getting it right. The Leader of the Opposition would do well to note that the many Australians who share the government's deep concern over crime, and particularly drug trafficking, will remember the actions of the Labor Party if telecommunications interception is put at risk.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The United Kingdom and the United States are, as honourable members are aware, two of Australia's strongest and most important political and economic partners. Our relationships with both countries are founded in our shared histories and traditions, our common values and aspirations and the strong personal links between our societies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the principal messages of my visit was that my government intended to build on this shared history and shared values in looking ahead and creating modern and dynamic partnerships which meet Australia's contemporary needs and interests. The United States is the largest investor in Australia and the United Kingdom the second largest. The United Kingdom invests more in manufacturing in Australia than any other foreign investor, and so is a very important source of employment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a one&hyphen;way street either. Australia is rivalling France and Germany for third place amongst foreign investors in Britain. Australian investment in the United States is 40 per cent of the US's investment in Australia&mdash;a very large figure indeed when you consider the difference in the size of our economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have substantial trading relationships with both countries. Our alliance with the United States is vital to Australia's stability and the security of our region. We have close and valuable defence ties with the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">United Kingdom</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was therefore timely to visit the United Kingdom early in the life of the new government led by Mr Blair. He of course is no stranger to Australia, and I invited him to visit us again in his new capacity. It was also 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7091"> possible during my visit to pay a courtesy call on the Queen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I place on record how unapologetically proud I was to visit the Australian cricket team at the beginning of the second Test at Lords. I say without any apology or qualification that I think it is the solemn responsibility of any Australian Prime Minister overseas to give vocal, open and unreserved support to Australia's great national sporting teams. I think most Australians, whatever their political views, would strongly support that. In fact, our fortunes turned around after I arrived in the United Kingdom. I might say that I went to the eve of Test dinner in London and I was surrounded by all these gloating Englishmen in the wake of having won the one&hyphen;day series and the first Test. I was very pleased to see that magnificent performance by Glenn McGrath and, all the sort of carping nonsense back here notwithstanding, I think most Australians support that kind of approach by their Prime Minister, whether he is Bob Hawke or John Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a very valuable round of discussions with Mr Blair and leading members of his government, including the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Prescott, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Defence Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary. I was pleased to find that they share my conviction of the growing strength and relevance of the relationship into the 21st century between Australia and the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in fact struck by how much there is in common between my government and Mr Blair's on the challenges faced by our societies&mdash;especially the issues of unemployment and the role of welfare&mdash;and the need to address those challenges, not with ideological prescriptions but by looking for practical ways to achieve results. I was particularly interested to hear about the welfare to work proposals of the new government and Mr Blair's views on changing attitudes in modern societies towards welfare, and how they married with much of our thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both with the United Kingdom government and in my meetings with leaders of the United Kingdom business community, I was able to set out first&hyphen;hand the strength of the Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ian economy. The reality is that our economy over 1997 and 1998 is predicted by the OECD to grow more strongly than any of the G7 economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During a visit to the Hawk aircraft assembly line in Warton in the north of England, I announced the then imminent signature of the contract for the lead&hyphen;in fighter for the Royal Australian Air Force&mdash;a significant boost for the Newcastle area both in terms of the jobs and the leading edge technology it will bring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pointed out in my meetings that Australia's integration into the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region and the United Kingdom's with Europe were making our bilateral links more relevant and valuable&mdash;rather than the reverse, as some might think. No two countries in their respective regions have closer relationships or a better understanding of each other than Australia and the United Kingdom. The benefits are becoming more evident in the number of British companies locating their regional headquarters in Australia and using Australian skills and expertise to expand their business in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia and the United Kingdom hold different positions on climate change, which is not surprising given the differences in the structures of our economies. I made clear to the British Prime Minister and his government that Australia was prepared to play her part in tackling greenhouse gas emissions. But we will not be party to a legally binding uniform target which no&hyphen;one honestly expects will be achieved, which is discriminatory in its economic consequences and which does not make an effective contribution to improving the world's environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A continuing irritant in our bilateral relations is the UK government's refusal to index pensions for UK residents in Australia. Mr Blair and I agreed that as a first step officials would reach an understanding on the actual costs involved&mdash;lack of agreement on this has so far obstructed sensible discussion of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also took the opportunity when in London to maintain my contact with former prime ministers John Major and Margaret Thatcher, and to meet the new leader of the British Conservative Party, Mr William Hague.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7092">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my visit, I was also pleased to be able to help facilitate requests, particularly from Mr Ken Colbung, for the return of Yagan's skull to Australia and I hope that outstanding issues can be resolved soon.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">United States</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My visit to the United States was an opportunity to build on the success of President Clinton's visit to Australia last year. I met a wide range of key figures in his administration, Congress and the business community in New York. My meetings left me in no doubt about the strength of the US alliance with Australia and the value that Australia and the United States place on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our shared strategic and economic interests in the Asia Pacific region meant that the future of our region was an important focus of my discussions in Washington and New York. The other was my message that under my government's reform program the Australian economy was creating new opportunities for US businesses to use Australia as a base for operations in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasised the vital importance of continued US engagement in the region. The interests of Australia, the United States and the region are all served by the United States continuing to make a strong contribution to the stability and economic growth of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was reassured by my discussions with President Clinton and others in his administration of the continuing commitment of the United States to exercising its leadership, economic power and strategic influence to help ensure the region's stability and prosperity into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tribute to the role Australia plays in the region that President Clinton and members of his administration and Congress want to know what Australia thinks of developments in the region and to discuss ways in which we can extend our cooperation there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While sharing fundamental objectives, Australia's specific geography and interests means that she has a different perspective on the region from the United States&mdash;and that makes our views ever more useful.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a major speech to the Foreign Policy Association I set out Australia's views on the important changes taking place in the region and how we should respond to them. The opening up and modernising of economies and societies in the region are bringing immense benefits for the countries of the region and their peoples. It is in our interests to reinforce these trends and to encourage the integration of regional economies into the world economy rather than lecture them about their shortcomings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, it is in the interests of Australia, the United States and the region that we maintain broad and balanced relationships with Indonesia within which differences, for example on human rights, can be handled productively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Clinton administration agree on the importance of integrating China into the region. We agree also on the importance of APEC's role in sustaining the growth of regional economies by freeing up trade and investment. We are keen to see APEC's momentum maintained under the Canadian chairmanship at Vancouver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An active and credible ANZUS alliance is an important part of the contribution we both make to the region. I was pleased to highlight that with an invitation to the Seventh Fleet to visit Australia in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian and US positions on climate change are not the same&mdash;but we share a desire for a realistic and equitable outcome of the Kyoto meeting. President Clinton acknowledged the need for flexibility in order to achieve that and we agreed on the need to find a way of involving the developing countries effectively in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased indeed to hear Dr Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve system, comment on the strong position of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New York, as honourable members would know, is the place where perhaps the toughest bottom lines in the world are drawn about economic performance. So I was very pleased indeed as Australian Prime Minister to see when I visited Salomon Brothers' trading floor a graph which plotted the differential 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7093"> between Australian and United States treasury bonds. When my government came to office in March of 1996 the margin was about 250 points against Australia. On the day I visited the Salomon Brothers' trading floor, which was the famous floor on which Tom Wolfe's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bonfire of the Vanities</EMPHASIS> was modelled, the margin had dropped to only 60 points&mdash;from 250 in March of 1996.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hang on. Recently it has gone further. It has now dropped to 25 points, which is one tenth of the yield spread between United States and Australian treasury bonds. In other words, the hardest heads in the financial world have given a ringing endorsement to the financial policies of my government. It is a ringing endorsement of the extent to which in the past 17 months we have, despite the carping, negative obstructive criticism of the Australian Labor Party, been able to repair the fundamentals of the economy. That shrinkage means lower costs, higher living standards, more investment, more jobs and more opportunities for Australia. It is the bottom line of the hard-headed judgments of the rest of the world, and they are the sorts of experiences and achievements that really matter and make me immensely proud of what my government has achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear from the US administration and business their views on how the US economy's impressive rate of job creation has been achieved. While I heard a range of ideas, there was consensus on the importance of labour market flexibility. I came away convinced that sensible reforms of the kind we have undertaken&mdash;to achieve greater labour market flexibility, to remove the obstacles to job creation and to address welfare and taxation disincentives against work&mdash;are critical if we are to improve employment prospects in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Greenspan also stressed to me the role that the integration of new information technology into the economy has played in creating jobs in the United States. The government will be announcing steps in this area in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to extend my deep appreciation to my hosts in both the United 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kingdom and the United States for the warmth of their reception and their generous hospitality. I believe that my visit has helped focus the leadership of both countries on the benefits that our partnership can bring to all of us if firmly oriented towards the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This happens to be the least substantial report ever produced by a prime ministerial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7094"> visit to the United Kingdom and the United States in the history of this parliament. This is the first time ever that a report here has not gone the length of the normal speaking time on a motion before the House. Generally speaking, we have had a half&hyphen;hour performance on these sorts of issues. Instead, we have here a very small report, virtually none of which actually recounts and records activities undertaken. Instead, it is a report which is full of tendentious, self&hyphen;righteous and inaccurate opinion, as far as his own opinions of his government are concerned, with a vague attempt to try to put those opinions into the mouths of other people. But sometimes even the blatancy of that eludes him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the more honest report of this particular visit was produced by Lindsay Olney, an experienced Canberra writer. He produced his report of the Prime Minister's visit and it is headlined `Travelling PM on the last train to Klutzville'. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It brings to mind that plane crash in the Andes when the living survived by eating the frozen flesh of the dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The story didn't emerge for some time afterwards as the indescribable horror of the experience overtook the survivors and compelled them, slowly at first but then in an anguished torrent, to tell the world what they had endured.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then there was the issue of the Lord's Test, around which the entire trip was structured. It wasn't just a case of Howard grabbing the opportunity in London to see a bit of cricket, it was Howard deciding that he would see the cricket and that everything else&mdash;meetings with Tony Blair, for instance&mdash;would be fitted in around that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The travelling media could scarcely disregard this indulgence but were aggressively expected to do so; the effect on the PM&hyphen;press relations was lethal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will read one final quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The images linger still: Howard rained out of his long awaited day at the cricket, Howard tripping in the White House Rose Garden, Howard boring Shirley McLaine to sleep, Howard going inexpli 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cably to the baseball to meet an Australian relief pitcher for the Yankees who was four times his size and not even playing that day . . . so it went on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The simple fact of the matter is that this performance was a total disaster. It is not that we object to you going to the cricket, Prime Minister; we have no problems with you going to the cricket. The problem is sustaining an entire trip around that; a trip which, as a result of that, was completely ill&hyphen;timed and ill&hyphen;placed. The Prime Minister left Australia when parliament was sitting; he had a ministerial crisis on his hands, with Geoff Prosser's conflict of interest; and he had a visit to Newcastle pending to discuss the BHP plant closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problem was not so much what he neglected here; it was what he neglected at the other end. This is what he missed as a result of the timing that he managed to put in place for his visit: the Prime Minister did not attend the Hong Kong handover and the Prime Minister visited Britain at a time when the new British Prime Minister could see him only for the briefest of time, 45 minutes. But he managed to visit Baroness Thatcher, coincidentally at the same time as the Earth Summit was convened in New York. With the views that he had expressed on the question of greenhouse gas emissions and its impact on Australia, and given that he was in the northern hemisphere, one Concorde flight away from New York&mdash;eight hours away&mdash;this was a test of the sincerity of his beliefs and the extent to which this is an issue of significance to Australia. He was not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, what happened to the Prime Minister was that he went through the humiliation of receiving the British Foreign Secretary back in the United Kingdom after he had been there. In other words, the British Foreign Secretary straddled the Prime Minister's visit in the United Kingdom. And, just after the British Foreign Secretary had, to my mind, quite unjustifiably attacked the Australian government, the Prime Minister was in the humiliating position of giving him a cheerio as he came home.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he should have been doing over there was countermanding the arguments of the British Foreign Secretary, in the performance of his duties in that regard.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7095">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give succour to the workers of Newcastle and to try to establish some point to this particular visit of his, the Prime Minister announced a matter in relation to Newcastle, a British Aerospace investment that had been announced previously&mdash;seven months earlier. And to add insult to the injury of the workers in Newcastle, he tried to maintain that this was something new. They were grating their teeth, Prime Minister. We could hear them from here, even if you could not hear them in the UK where you were when you went through that particular exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it happens, I made much the same trip as the Prime Minister a little while later; not to the United States but I made it to the United Kingdom. I also went to Singapore and the Middle East after I had visited Newcastle on two or three occasions. The point of my visit was manyfold and many faceted but part of it was to sweep up; part of it was to clean up on the things that the Prime Minister had promised to do and did not do; and part of it was to actually sell a genuine impression of Australia's wares and correct any poor impressions that had been left by the Prime Minister in places as diverse as the Menzies Centre and the offices of the various British ministers that he had managed to see, with sections of the British media and, above all, with the British public generally when we got down to talking about some of the matters of concern to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised the greenhouse gas emissions issue with them and what I pointed out was that we did indeed have those difficulties that the Prime Minister had outlined but we had as a government when we were in office what we believed to be the correct strategy: to pursue a two&hyphen;handed policy; on the one hand make justified complaints about unfairness to Australia, on the other hand restore the programs that you cut that meant we as a nation were doing something about greenhouse gas emissions. They are out of your particular proposition. How can we have credibility internationally when we simply stand up and say, `There is not a problem here, we're doing nothing about it, please have mercy upon us'? It is not an intelligent tactical approach.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also took the opportunity both there and in Singapore to do what the Prime Minister said he would do; undo the damage that has been created by false impressions, in his mind, of the government responses to the agenda of the Hanson One Nation party. He said here he would do it; he did not do it there. I was obliged to do it there. In Singapore, in particular, I took the time to go through Australia's great record on race and our great record on engagement with the regions. The fact that when we have had errors in our stance, be it in relation to the White Australia policy, be it in relation to the Aboriginal people, it has been Australians who have identified that and Australians who have dealt with the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also pointed out to Singapore what Australia's contribution had been to the region since World War II&mdash;the enormous support given to the national aspirations of the Asian people by the post&hyphen;war government in 1945, the generous support given by Australian governments through things like the Colombo Plan, our decision in 1967 to give the Asian people a part of Australia's future by changing the White Australia policy and bringing them in, and emphasising to them the fact that historical injustices to the Aboriginal people from 1967 on were being addressed by this nation. There is a great defence that can be made of Australia in that region, but there was no defence made of Australia in that region by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence is necessary as businessman after businessman and journalist after journalist told me, not simply because of the widespread reportage of the One Nation Party's views, and it is widespread, but because of a firm belief&mdash;the views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), not withstanding; they are put in the category of, `They would say that, wouldn't they.'&mdash;that the Prime Minister has given credence to the views of the people in the One Nation Party. He had a unique opportunity in London to deal with that problem, to put some substance in this wretched, indulgent visit&mdash;and he chose not to do it. What an extraordinary thing, to go through the difficulty of announ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7096"> cing to the Liberal Party caucus that he would do it, then turn up in London with great fanfare and, having told the Australian journalists that he would do it, undoubtedly having had it raised with him from place to place as he went through, to choose not to do it in the end&mdash;an extraordinary decision in relation to that particular element of his visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also chose to sell other features of Australia's wares. But I tell you something that was most interesting to me in my lengthy conversations with a very large number of British cabinet ministers: the very great interest they expressed in the programs that we had put in place in the time that we were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no more inaccurate part of this tiny little report of the Prime Minister than his attempt to wrap himself in Tony Blair's welfare&hyphen;to&hyphen;work program. As they discussed the details of the implementation of our program with me, it was increasingly evident&mdash;as a new MP, Sir Lenox Hewitt's daughter, has revealed here in Australia&mdash;that it was modelled exactly, not marginally or tangentially, on the programs that we had put in place that were annihilated by the Liberal Party when they came into office. The difference was this: ours was welfare to work; yours is punishment for being out of work. There is a major material difference in the motivation that underpins those particular propositions. It is one thing when it is compulsion associated with punishment but it is another thing when it is compulsion related to reciprocal obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anything, I would have to say that there was one difference. Tony Blair's program was not quite as hard on those who did not take up the opportunity as ours was. He was a little bit more generous to the unemployed in the United Kingdom&mdash;or he is about to be a little bit more generous&mdash;than we were in terms of whether or not they would actually be pushed off the dole if they did not take up the opportunity. So it was a slightly softer version&mdash;and I am not going to exaggerate this&mdash;of the Working Nation program reciprocal obligation that we had put in place. So we can dismiss completely the Prime Minister's notion that, in any practical terms, there is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any sympathetic arrangement between the two of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Prime Minister would have noticed, I am sure, while he was away&mdash;which is part of the reason why he decided when he talked about the American trip that he would refer to what he sees as the contemporary state of the Australian economy&mdash;is that there is now not a single commentator left in this country who believes that his budget strategy was right. The final surrender came last Monday, when Alan Wood&mdash;and he was the last one&mdash;finally came out and said that you have over&hyphen;corrected. Any sense of depression in the community or any sense of a lack of confidence, frankly, Prime Minister, was not there when you came into office. It is there now, directly as a result of mistaken decisions by you in the way in which you have managed the economy. And there is not a single economic commentator left in this country who says anything different about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's visits must improve. And when the Prime Minister improves his visits, he must start to produce in this place reports of substance that give us a serious understanding of the direction of Australian foreign policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The campaign for a national drug summit has reached fever pitch over the last week&mdash;so much so that even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is beginning to show some interest in the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take a look at the answers given by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) when they were first asked if they would even consider convening such a summit. Their somewhat candid responses give you an indication of just how little they expected the public pressure&mdash;less than three months later&mdash;would have them now seriously considering convening such a meeting. `Unnecessary', they both said. `Wasteful of resources!' they exclaimed. The minister for health went even further, calling it `window dressing', `a cheap stunt', `a talkfest' that would mean `zilch'. I am sure they assumed they would hear no more of it, but then the ball began to roll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In close succession, you have had groups and individuals as diverse as the Directors of Public Prosecution in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, the Ministers for Police from all states and territories, the Australian Medical Association, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, the Salvation Army, the Premiers of New South Wales and Western Australia, and the list goes on and on&mdash;all calling for this Prime Minister to show some leadership and convene a national drugs summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The popular press have come on board as well, I am pleased to see: the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;newspapers that were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> both supportive of the ACT heroin trial&mdash;both gave their approval for the national summit. Also in Sydney, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a paper which, unlike the other two, had an almost violent objection to the trial&mdash;also threw its support behind a national summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In just the last week, the Premiers of New South Wales and Western Australia&mdash;perhaps two of the most ideologically opposed politicians you could hope to meet in this country&mdash;have made their strongest statements yet in favour of a summit. Let me refer to Premier Carr's comments first. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've had a debate in which people put forward different views about a heroin trial in the ACT&mdash;I want to go beyond that debate now and unite the community behind a program of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have got a meeting for Ministers of Police in November, so my proposal to the Prime Minister is that we make that a national summit on drugs.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And Premier Court, in Western Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that there is a need for us to tackle this as a national issue, and that requires coming together at the highest level. You can call it a drugs summit, you can call it what you like, but I think it's important that we do something together and at the highest possible level.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And yet the Prime Minister and the minister for health poured scorn on the same suggestion when it was put to them time and time again. That is, until last Monday's question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was on Monday, following the Leader of the Opposition's question regarding a national drug summit and the 54 people who have died in Perth this year from heroin overdoses that the Prime Minister changed his tune. He said, `Oh, I have an open mind on the subject of a national drug summit if there could be a public benefit in holding such a meeting.' Maybe he has been polling again. Those comments came less than three months after his initial comments that it was a talkfest and a waste of resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and this Labor opposition welcome the Prime Minister's dramatic change of heart. I would welcome a similar public change of heart in the Minister for Health and Family Services. But the Prime Minister's conversion is not yet complete&mdash;not by a long shot. Expressing an open mind, although a giant 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7098"> leap from what seemed a hopeless position just a few months ago, is quite different to offering one's full and unconditional support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Full and unconditional support for a national drug summit is what the majority of Australians with an interest in solving the heroin problem want to see. They want a summit with the leadership and the involvement of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services. It is our best chance of reinvigorating our fight against heroin while at the same time making sure the public are comfortable with and supportive of any changes that we put forward or decide upon. But, as I said, we have still a way to go before we get that `St Paul on the road to Damascus' conversion from this Prime Minister, especially judging by the attitude that he displayed in question time on Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's obvious discomfort at answering the Leader of the Opposition's question regarding the government's strategies on fighting heroin were palpable. It certainly lay at the heart of his unnecessary and baseless allegations that we on this side of the House are attempting to suggest that the country's heroin problem began on 2 March last year. Perhaps one of the following speakers on the government side can point out to me when any member of the opposition has actually made such an accusation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition has said is that the government's cutbacks in areas such as the Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs have further jeopardised the dire situation in which we currently find ourselves. What we have said is that the federal government cannot continue to spend less and less on anti&hyphen;drug measures while raking in more and more on Commonwealth excise and taxes on alcohol and tobacco. What we have said is that the Minister for Health and Family Services seems determined to defend and persevere with a national drug strategy that has quite obviously failed. What we have said is that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services have been too quick to dismiss the idea of a national drug summit when the positives of holding such a meeting should have been apparent to anyone, let alone our national leaders.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has the Howard government done? I would like to present some facts and I would like to ask them: how can you cut $37.6 million from the Australian Federal Police, resulting in a loss of roughly 130 officers, and not in some fashion be weakening the force's operations, particularly those aimed at combating the heroin trade? How can Australian Customs do its job properly when, for example, because of drastic budget cuts, there are insufficient staff to even monitor closed&hyphen;circuit television cameras at border control checkpoints, leaving videotapes to be viewed long after any heroin courier has skipped the country? How can this not be a weak link in our fight against the heroin trade?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, talking about requesting the help of the Australian armed forces in his state's war against drugs if he does not think that the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs lack the resources to do the job themselves? How, in this current climate, can we continue to stomach the discrepancy between spending only $33 million, or roughly $2 per head, on the national drug strategy&mdash;and remember, that is the national program which deals with all drugs, both legal and illegal&mdash;when government income from taxes on alcohol and tobacco has increased to over $4 billion, or roughly $200 per head, in this last budget alone? The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) knows this to be true because even he admitted that his government's efforts here are `tokenistic'. That is possibly why he has been gagged in this debate today. I say `gagged' because where is he?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there is the structure of the national drug strategy itself. Talk to the health authorities. Talk to the public servants in the state and federal health departments. Talk to the people who work with the addicts on the street, day in and day out, and they will tell you that the national drug strategy, while effective in parts, is a bureaucratic shambles that needs urgent and renovation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Health and Family Services: just take a look around. Take a look at my elec 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7099"> torate, for example, or the electorate of the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace). Our streets are awash with heroin. Have a chat with the member for Bradfield. He has been there; he has had a look. He might tell you what it is about. The national drug strategy has quite obviously failed to halt that tide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that the Minister for Health and Family Services is currently considering the review of the second five&hyphen;year period of the national drug strategy. My suggestion to him is that he resists the temptation to simply make cosmetic changes. He must resist that. New and dramatic steps need to be taken towards solving the problem. We need new approaches that have the public's confidence and support. That is where the national drug summit again comes in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, when giving its approval for such a move, began its editorial with the sarcastic comment: `When in doubt, have a summit.' I can appreciate the wariness of some people when you talk about a national drug summit. The last thing any of us want is another round of bureaucratic nonsense where the same old people swap the same old tired opinions about illegal drugs. That is one of the dangers of the Prime Minister's recently announced departmental task force. How many studies do we need to tell us that the system is broken and that it needs fixing? A national drug summit, if handled correctly, can offer so much more and, quite frankly, I am surprised that both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services still fail to see that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps, more importantly, a national drug summit offers us the opportunity of bringing politicians and non-politicians together to discuss new strategies and new approaches regarding the heroin problem, while keeping the public thoroughly up to date. As I have said previously, whatever its value or faults, if the failure of the ACT heroin trial has taught us anything, it is the crucial importance of maintaining public support for something as delicate and as significant as devising new and better strategies to combat heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A national summit offers a public, who are cynical and suspicious about politicians and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the decision making process, a transparent and engaging debate. It is about making sure that the public feel confident that not only are their leaders coming up with more effective ways of fighting heroin but that those new methods are in line with what they consider to be morally and socially acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is up to this Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services to set the parameters of the conference so that it does not turn into a talkfest. It is up to this Prime Minister to provide the summit with the same sort of ultimatum he delivered to the premiers at the gun law conference after the Port Arthur tragedy. It is up to this Prime Minister to say, `Don't come out unless you have some definite proposals to put forward.' So far the Prime Minister has proven very reluctant to do any such thing&mdash;and the question has to be asked why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not suggest a national drug summit will be simple. It does not suggest that it will deliver in our laps all the solutions to the heroin problem in a single week. Nor does it suggest that boosting funding to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs would miraculously dry up the country's heroin supplies overnight. But certainly they would all be steps in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, that is what the Australian people are now crying out for&mdash;direction, Prime Minister, direction. Following the Prime Minister's decision to pull the plug on the ACT heroin trial, Australians&mdash;whether or not they approved of the proposal&mdash;felt that the one fresh strategy which had seriously been put forward had disappeared without an equally serious alternative being offered to replace it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's departmental task force on drugs is certainly hardly an adequate replacement. Those uncharitable souls among us may accuse the Prime Minister of putting forward the task force as a stalling tactic, hoping that by November the whole heroin controversy, the whole matter of the national drug summit will have just blown away, been swept under the carpet. I can assure the Prime Minister, if that is what he is hoping for, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7100"> come November he is in for a rude awakening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's task force is just another committee immersed in bureaucracy. It will just file a report to the National Drug Strategy Committee, which will then file a report to the Prime Minister, who will then discuss the findings with cabinet, and so on, and so on, and so on. It is all red tape and files. Meanwhile, kids in my electorate and kids around Australia are dying, are continuing to buy heroin for less than a week's pocket money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not doubt the Prime Minister's concern over the hundreds of Australians who are dying heroin related deaths each year. But I am coming quickly to the conclusion that he has not cottoned on to the fact that we are facing a plague out there at this very moment. That is why I have invited him, over and over again to come to Cabramatta and Fairfield with me. But to no avail. It is when he makes such a visit that I am sure he will discard the whole notion of wasting time on task forces and the like, and then seriously consider the opposition's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No, the heroin problem did not begin on 2 March 1996. No, those of us in the Australian Labor Party do not claim to be the only members in this House concerned with the heroin plague which currently grips our nation. However, we do see measures which have been introduced by this government exacerbating the heroin problem. We do see a failure on behalf of this government's leadership to recognise that what Australia is facing at this moment is a national emergency, requiring rapid national action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see a Prime Minister unwilling to tackle what is an extremely difficult issue, requiring inventiveness and initiative, with anything other than stale strategies and platitudes. We need action, Prime Minister. The people of Australia are crying out for it. The people of Australia are demanding it. Prime Minister, get up and act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that the opposition either has been dozing or is caught in a time warp. Here is an issue of such complexity, an issue that simply will not be solved with a one-off you-beaut 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all-out drug summit later in the year, as proposed by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). That is a single solution, a feel good solution, one which gets bureaucrats and the non-government organisations out for a day or two. But then what happens? Nothing much at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a problem of enormous complexity, a problem that goes back decades. It is a problem that no other nation in the world has managed to tackle and achieve some major success with. Also, it is a problem that is not going to go away. We are going to tackle this problem in a way that reflects the complexity of the issues that are involved. These issues include health, law enforcement, demand and supply, education, treatment, substance substitution, taxation issues, youth and ethnic issues, regional priorities&mdash;and, of course, there is the debate about how best to spend the funding available to achieve the greatest effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, throughout the federal government sphere, unfortunately, by necessity, there has been a reduction in government spending. The opposition in particular should know why we have had to cut back. It is because of their absolute mismanagement of the economy over some 13 years. As a result of that mismanagement, tragically, we cannot, and we could not, simply add more dollars to every different government department's finances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to suggest that this government actually cut the Australian Federal Police budget by $37.6 million means either a deliberate intent to misinform or that the member does not have very good arithmetic. Let me give you the figures. In the Australian Federal Police budget, from 1996 to 1997, we have had a five per cent cut or reduction amounting to $8.583 million&mdash;a five per cent reduction. Now keep that figure in your head, the member for Prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996-97 the Australian Federal Police contributed savings equal to $6.191 million of the 1995-96 budget. That is a total cut of $14.77 million, not $37.6 million, as claimed by the member for Prospect. So I am just not sure what sort of creative accounting or arithmetic has gone on there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7101">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the actual numbers are irrelevant. The significant thing is that this government understands that the dollars that are to be spent on the drug problem have to be spent in areas that are going to make a difference. So the government has in fact commissioned a review of the financial practices of the Australian Federal Police, which will provide a solid foundation for future resource considerations and it will assist in overcoming the problems associated with their financial management problems experienced this financial year. We are going to the core of the problem to assist them to better spend the dollars they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General has consistently sought to encourage a more strategic and cooperative approach between the Australian Federal Police and its state and territory partners and also through the strategic alliance of the National Crime Authority. No one-off national drug summit will go near to addressing any of those sorts of issues, let me assure you. The effectiveness of the Australian law enforcement agencies is increasingly being enhanced by all agencies taking a cooperative approach and a more strategic focus in the use of law enforcement resources. We could talk about it for two days in Canberra, but that is no substitute for on the ground action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach&mdash;the approach we have adopted with the Australian Federal Police&mdash;and the very minor cuts that have been made to their budget in line, tragically, with cuts required of all government departments, has not affected their ability to track down and seize major heroin supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFP's funding has been sufficient for them to tackle significant drug trafficking syndicates. For example, in May this year a joint operation between the Australian Customs Service, New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police seized 78 kilograms of high-grade heroin. More recently, in Victoria a joint operation of the Australian Customs Service resulted in federal agencies seizing that state's largest haul of 32 kilograms of heroin, thereby dismantling another major criminal enterprise. So our Australian Federal Police are grateful for a change of government. They are grateful that we are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assisting them to spend their dollars in a way that will make them much more effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that the member for Prospect raised was that we have failed to provide adequate customs services. Along with her total miscalculation on the Australian Federal Police budget cuts we have to report that the customs resources specifically devoted to anti-drug efforts have not been reduced during the time of general budget expenditure reductions. Of course, those reductions by other government departments, as I said before, were forced on us by a profligate opposition. The opposition's efforts when they were in government meant that we had to face cutbacks in so many of our departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reductions in expenditure that the honourable member for Prospect referred to were part of the government's overall budget strategy and have not and will not affect the capacity of customs to do its job. I might add that in the 1996 budget the government has provided $26 million towards technology to aid particularly in drug detection and interception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1 July last year the customs coastwatch program has been able to significantly increase its surveillance capacity because of the attention our government has been able to give to them. Operations are now able to be conducted up to 300 nautical miles from the coast of Australia. Everyone knows Australia has an extraordinarily difficult task in coastline surveillance. We have a huge coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was up in the Torres Strait Islands just the other day and we were within a small tin boat's ride from the coast of Papua New Guinea. It was virtually impossible, with the resources that customs were offered in the years gone past, to do the job properly. But we are building their resources up. We are training them and they are now able to do the job better. When we spoke to the customs officials in the Torres Strait Island just weeks ago, they were expressing to us a great deal of gratitude for the fact that now they can be more effective with drug surveillance on our coastlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me repeat that the whole thrust of the matter of public importance before us today 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7102"> seems to be: `Why don't we have a drug summit later this year? That will solve our problems'. But how can someone who is serious about drugs for a moment consider that a one-off all&hyphen;day, perhaps a two- or three-day, affair will achieve anything substantial on an issue as complex as this. Instead, what we aim to do is to adopt a strategy that has the cooperation of states and agencies, all of whom have something to do with the ultimate defeat of this problem. Those agencies, of course, include: health, education, policing and family and community services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, too, that the very heart of the drug related problem is the fact that so many of our young people in this nation live in despair. They are in despair because they have had more than a decade of time when their ability to get jobs was declining. They have had more than a decade when the then government appeared to turn their backs, in particular, on regional Australia. Of course, the results of the last  election were that we are down to two Labor representatives of regional Australia. That is because regional people could not understand their neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people in my electorate are in a situation where drugs are often a solution to the fact that they are unable to get adequate education and cannot get access to jobs. They feel out of sight and out of mind because the previous government for years concentrated their efforts on regulating the job market so tightly, and they offered mickey mouse type training exercises to keep the unemployment statistics down but offered no long-term solution to their real needs. Is it any wonder then that the serious elicit drug problems in regional Australia are as significant as anywhere else in the metropolitan areas of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do we have after 13 years of Labor? Do we have the drug treatment infrastructures throughout Australia that you would expect from a government that cared? I am afraid not. In the electorate of Murray we do not even have the most basic provisions of psychiatric counselling and detoxification centres. There are no methadone programs and our young people have no basic information or education about the consequences of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drug use. There is nothing there. We have been trying now for 18 months to redress years of not addressing the need for this problem to be dealt with cooperatively across a number of departments, non-government sectors, the volunteer community and the parents and families who have children and adult members who have suffered the consequences of illicit drug dependence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about as a government is a national drug strategy. I do not think the member for Prospect has really concentrated her mind on this publication. It is here and we hope you will read it. We are also hoping that you will tune into the national drug task force that our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced on Monday. This national task force is going to be chaired by the Secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and it will include the heads of all relevant agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task force will look at the current efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, including domestic law enforcement and border control. It will look at the current efforts to reduce the demand for illicit drugs. It will include community education and community organisation support programs. It will concentrate on the harm minimisation approaches that we must adopt if ever we are going to get on top of this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national task force approach is one this nation needs. Already in my electorate it is regarded as a very sensible approach to a problem that is complex and cannot be dealt with by a three&hyphen;day or two&hyphen;day effort.</PARA>

Around 19,000 Australians die every year from smoking and smoke&hyphen;related illnesses, while the misuse of alcohol has been estimated to result in approximately 731,000 hospital bed days each year. We have committed programs to address these health issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made a very important and significant commitment to maintaining the national drug strategy which addresses all drug issues in a balanced fashion. We will ensure that the framework and the national support that has underpinned important supply control and demand reduction initiatives for illicit drugs will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national drug strategy has been highly successful in the past in forging relationships between the Commonwealth, states and territories and between health and law enforcement. But we have not had sufficient action on the ground. We must look to the further establishment of successful links with industry, the non&hyphen;government sector and the community. What we now need is action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy agreed that the national implications of the heroin trial in Canberra should be further explored rather than immediately endorsed, and further work was considered necessary to consider outstanding issues related to that trial. We are looking very seriously at the illicit drug use issue. Nothing is more important to a government which considers the future of its young Australians to be at the heart of all that we do. We know that, until we get our economy right, until we redress a lot of the problems of despair, and the problems of no hope for the future that some of our young people experience, we will not be able to get on top of the drug abuse that currently afflicts so many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have adopted measures which address our economic ills. We aim to help our families and our young people currently caught up 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in illicit drug abuse. I look forward to the deliberations of the Prime Minister's national illicit drug task force.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is quite correct in saying that the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) is a very nice lady. Notwithstanding that, we had to listen to all that claptrap that she came out with for 15 minutes, accusing us for getting our figures wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to inform the member for Murray that she got it wrong from the start. Neither the member for Prospect nor I suggest that a summit is going to solve the problem overnight. We are suggesting that a summit perhaps will bring new talk into the area and new methods. Anything could be discussed, including, as some people want, the legalising of marijuana and heroin. That is just a suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pleasure for me to follow the member for Prospect on this very important matter of public interest today. It is not insignificant that I should follow her on this side of the House. She and I share an area covering western Sydney that is quickly becoming known as the drug capital of Australia. Members of this House would have heard on numerous occasions already the member for Prospect and me explain the horrendous situation that exists in Cabramatta and the surrounding suburbs regarding the insidious trading of hard drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend today to canvass most of the material that I have already canvassed in this parliament. But in the process of condemning the government for their lack of action, I will refer to police efforts in Cabramatta if I have the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her speech the member for Prospect first condemned the lack of leadership shown by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country and the about&hyphen;face attitude and the lack of backbone shown by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I agreed with the member when she expressed regret at the attitude of members of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7104"> government when they say that members of the Labor Party are saying that this problem started on 2 March 1996. We are not saying anything of the kind. I have never suggested that, and to my mind the member for Prospect has never said it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that the government is deliberately creating the situation by having no figures. The member for Murray can come in here and can extrapolate what figures she likes from the budget papers, but we are assured that $37.6 million has been slashed from agencies which are responsible for policing our coastline and our airports to prevent the entry of hard drugs into this country. They cannot operate under those circumstances. One would be excused for forming the perception that they are in a league with the drug cartels. But, of course, I would not be so bold as to suggest that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not suggest that, because I am a gentleman. Even their own bureaucrats at the Senate estimates hearings are saying that we are losing the battle. You have to get with it and listen to what your own bureaucrats are saying. We are not the only ones saying it. The member for Prospect and I are well aware that the drug problem is not unique to our electorates. I know only too well that it is a national problem. That is why I am endeavouring today to not be too parochial, although on occasions it is very hard not to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a national problem, and that highlights the lack of leadership we have in this country today. We have a Prime Minister who adopts the ostrich line of sticking his head in the sand and pretending everything is all right, only lifting his head for the ultra right&hyphen;wing utterances of some members of the press and people involved in talkback radio in Sydney, advising him what to do on the drug issue&mdash;and, indeed, any issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He cannot complain when the perception appears throughout the country that he is a poll driven Prime Minister. I have no objection to him&mdash;or the Liberal Party for that matter&mdash;taking advice from those ultra right&hyphen;wing zealots on how to run Liberal branches in Sydney. They can give them all the advice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they want to&mdash;and they do, publicly&mdash;but I do object to them giving public advice to our Prime Minister, contributing their views and changing the attitude of listeners in the Sydney area to what is going on in this country. Maybe the Prime Minister should look at the pasts of some of these commentators and see what their interest in the subject is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the about&hyphen;face of our Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). He is a little beauty. He roly&hyphen;polies his way into parliament every day at question time. I sympathise with him: he was rolled. We know he was rolled, and I sympathise with him. That is the only thing I have in common with him. But he was rolled because of the Prime Minister's attitude on the poll driven exercise in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister for health has a whingeing and whining attitude. In reply to every question he gets, we have him whingeing about the Labor Party. That is all he can say. And we get this every day. He seems to think, `How dare you question my ability?' Just because he has a medical degree, he thinks that everybody else has no say whatsoever in the running of his portfolio. He thinks they should not have any say in it. I can assure the minister that nobody on this side of the House thinks he is a guru as far as his portfolio is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, take his recent remarks about nicotine killing hundreds of people every year. What a smart alec remark to make&mdash;to compare the deaths of people from nicotine to the deaths of people from heroin. I would like our little minister to come out to my area and visit some of the families where deaths have occurred from heroin. I would also like, respectfully, to remind the minister that nicotine and the addiction to it, obnoxious as the habit it creates may be&mdash;and nobody can think it is more obnoxious than an ex&hyphen;smoker&mdash;does not cause the same problems of family break&hyphen;up as heroin does. It is absolute stupidity to suggest that there is a correlation between the two drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a minister who would have had access to families, although I do not know when he last practised medicine. I would like him to come out to the area the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7105"> Prospect represents and to my area and visit some of the families&mdash;as we have had to&mdash;where the pain and suffering of heroin has had an effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the member for Prospect that, to bring new thinking into the drug situation in this country, the holding of a summit is absolutely essential. I will refer back to Cabramatta because I only have 10 minutes to try to get my point across. I congratulated the New South Wales police force on the introduction of plain clothes police to assist in the detection of drugs in the Cabramatta area, but you do not need to be a Rhodes scholar to work out that you cannot use plain clothes police all the time. They have a very short lifespan as a result of being recognised, so you have to keep moving them all the time. When seven or eight of them have operated for a weekend in a place like Cabramatta, making arrests and doing a very good job, that is the end of the day. It gets around all the pimps in the Cabramatta area and all the many drug addicts. They memorise the faces of all the plain clothes police. Bingo! They move down the road to the next suburb. So they have to wait. The introduction of plain clothes police is only a stopgap in the detection of the drug dealers, who are the people we are after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will wind up with the statement that I completely agree with the member for Prospect's matter of public importance that only a summit can work out which procedures should be put in place to solve this insidious practice which is affecting countless families. I disagree with the member for Murray, well meaning as she may well be. We have not said it is the answer, but unless we meet with all the national agencies of this country we will never know what other procedures we should be using. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I do not wish to indulge in pub talk or tabloid; I am not proud of them but I do not intend to ingratiate them. Nor should you have raised them if you were genuine about raising the subject. The coincidence is amazing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One person I would like to speak about later in this address is a member of the New South Wales parliament, Mr Bill Rixon, who has recently been over to Israel with a bipartisan committee&mdash;Liberal, National and ALP&mdash;from the New South Wales government. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7106"> are looking at other forms of trying to reduce heroin addiction. I would like to talk about Dr Ande Waismann's comments a little later too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I too have known people who have lost loved ones. A person I knew very well overdosed on heroin 15 years ago. Of course, we all have similar stories and we all have similar stories in our own constituencies. The community obviously was split on heroin trials. Carr, from your political persuasion, was against it; Kennett was for it. Even in the ACT Kate Carnell was obviously a great advocate of it, and she had legitimate reasons. But, even within her own party, the whip, Harold Hyde, was against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we are talking about drugs, not just heroin, and noting that we have to break down the argument into legal and illicit drugs. I note that the illicit drug industry is about a $2 billion industry in this country. The total cost of Australian drug usage, including alcohol and tobacco, is around $23 billion. As was recently pointed out by Brendan Nelson, who addressed the John Stuart Mill Society recently, the real culprit is heroin, which robs people of life at such a young age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was pointed out by the member for Murray, there are a number of law enforcement agencies attacking this problem. It is rather opportunistic, of course, that the ALP have chosen Customs and the AFP here today. In 1992 over $500 million was spent on drug enforcement. This included expenditure on the NCA, the state police, our courts and our prisons. It is much higher today. I do believe you are politicising this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFP, as I mentioned, is just one law enforcement agency. Much has been advocated today by the two opposition speakers about this figure of $37.6 million. Even the figure that Chris Eaton, the Secretary of the AFPA, quoted, which has been discredited, was $26 million. So it is substantially different even to your figure of $36 million. The fact is that the AFP has had a reduction of $7 million last year and $7 million this year, resulting in a five per cent reduction in its budget deficit. The AFP Commissioner, Mick Palmer, has said that a more strategic approach is needed to deploy resources and to set priorities. And enormous resources have been and should be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> poured into detection, particularly on our coastlines, and into offshore intelligence, whether it be in Burma or the Golden Triangle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one disputes that we have a problem with policing drugs. But the very fact that we have over 37,000 kilometres of coastline is challenging. Customs and all policing authorities should be congratulated on their efforts. Indeed, Coastwatch has over 800 fixed&hyphen;wing aircraft and a number of helicopters. Enormous resources are put in by the Royal Australian Navy, in both patrol boats and over 250 hours of Orion aircraft flying time. Matching this is our Customs fleet, which has six vessels. It is this government which is upgrading the fleet to include another eight Customs vessels, dovetailed with increased expenditure on technology of $26 million for closed&hyphen;circuit TVs at ports and increased dog detection teams. In the last two years there have been over 3,000 seizures through the use of dogs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting, though, is that part of the defence of the opposition, who have brought on this MPI, is the assertion that the AFP is doing a lesser job this year than it was under the previous ALP government. Let us look at some of these figures. With heroin in particular there were 47 seizures in 1995&hyphen;96 compared with 62 in 1996&hyphen;97, after of course we inherited the ALP budget deficit and a number of expenditure reductions across all portfolios. So there were more seizures. What is even more interesting is that, by weight, in the year of the dying days of the ALP government, 64.3 kilograms of heroin were detected compared with 174 in the last year, 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in this financial year, of which only two months have passed, over 81 kilograms have been detected and apprehended. So in two months of this financial year we have seized 30 per cent more heroin than two years ago. This highlights the myth the ALP is pushing. We have a lot further to go&mdash;no&hyphen;one is disputing that&mdash;but let us not discredit the AFP, which they so conveniently use here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key of course is intelligence. We cannot open every container or search every bag. Even if we did, our success rate may be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7107"> no higher. Indeed, 100 per cent checks tend to produce worse results than a targeted approach and the increasing sophistication of concealment methods frequently requires destructive examination of imported goods. We have good links with Customs services, with the AFP and with the NCA. Obviously our key, though, is to get into the poppy growing fields of Burma, the largest source of the heroin that is smuggled into our country. Even Chris Eaton, who I have no doubt would be a supporter of the Australian Labor Party, said that if Australia were serious about this national problem we would get into that area of Burma to solve the drug problem in our own back garden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about the national summit. There has been much emotion in the wake of the disbanding of the heroin trials&mdash;a matter conveniently raised here today by the opposition. To use the words of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 26 August: `When in doubt, hold a summit.' When the Australian Labor Party is in doubt, it holds a summit; it is a smokescreen. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summits give the impression that the politicians are doing something about an important social issue, while providing a way for that issue to be buried under . . . red tape and further reviews. There have been any number of examples of this in recent Australian political history, particularly under the former Federal Labor Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope the member for Prospect listens to that from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> . Mr Carr has been a proponent of the summit. By the same token, Jeff Kennett has obviously been against the summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A serious task force, made up of senior government officials, has been established to report back to the government, to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). No&hyphen;one is suggesting&mdash;and I am not suggesting to backbenchers on the other side&mdash;that holding the summit is the panacea. But at least it starts to put down some guidelines.</PARA>

As I understand it, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The finding of balance towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>  report is one of the matters that is being referred to the Main Committee by this motion. If indeed it is not, then my angst is even greater. But I understand that it is one of those committee reports that is being referred. I suggest to those who set the order of proceedings of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Main Committee that it be ensured that this report is debated tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do this because it is important that there is a full debate. If the government is asking that we bear with it because the three months has gone by but it wants to have full consultation, let us make sure that there is full consultation. As a member of the committee I am a bit disturbed that we have had the Property Council of Australia laying into us and saying that we have got it all wrong, we have had the Australian Retailers Association suggesting that we have got it wrong and we have the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the important recommendations of the report concerns a change to the Trade Practices Act which would prohibit unfair conduct. It has been indicated by some of the people who have been having these consultations with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) that both Minister Reith and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) are opposed to mending the Trade Practices Act. We need to have that full debate. I wish to illustrate the importance of having this debate by quoting the words of a member of the committee, somebody who made a very fine and important contribution because of her small business background, the federal member for Petrie (Mrs Gambaro). She is reported as saying in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS> of 6 August&mdash;and I see the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Mcdougall), who I think may have been at this meeting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations are very workable and the government must give small business a break.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I take it from what the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), is saying that there has been some discussion amongst the coalition parties about this. I just hope that we are able to get to that discussion instead of this committee report being on the bottom of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  up in the Main Committee. I note that it is the fifth report in this motion. I also understand that there is legislation to be discussed by the Main Committee when it starts at 10 o'clock tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am asking, as I have done in this place on a couple of other occasions, is that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7111"> we get to the debate. I am not even going to the fact that the honourable member for Wakefield when he was just the honourable member for Wakefield was part of an action that denied me my ability on the last day of session to debate this report. It is not about whether I get to debate it. I want the House, and especially the members of the committee who were involved in the inquiry and who have not had the opportunity to discuss the important recommendations, to get an opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the last day of the last session a number of small business people were in town and they were wanting to hear discussion on the committee's report. They recognised that there was a distraction going on because of the fate of the small business minister. That could have been solved by the events that happened two weeks subsequent happening earlier, but that is not the point. What we really want to get to is a full and frank discussion of the recommendations. As I read the picture, there are certain people on the front bench of the government who disagree with what the backbench is saying to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things about the committee's inquiry for me was that I learned a lot as a result of the experience of some of those opposite who were on the committee and who brought their experience to the committee and indicated after full discussion, after public hearings in most major centres, that there was a need to underpin the various codes of conduct that are in place at the moment by legislation. It was the only conclusion that the committee was able to come to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter is now yet again to be referred to the Main Committee, and I acknowledge that that is at least a positive step. It is better than it not being referred. But I hope that now that it is being referred it will eventually be debated. That will require that it does not become the fifth committee report on any agenda that is circulated for the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was on my feet and speaking to the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill prior to question time, I would like to conclude my remarks. I had just completed giving an example to the House of a business in my electorate that had suffered badly because of the problems of the unfair dismissal laws of the previous government. As a result, the mood in the marketplace is a very sour one. There is no longer a feeling of mutual trust between employer and employee. The previous government legislated that trust out of existence. There will always be inequities in the system. Protecting the worker must be paramount, but so too must the protection of the small business operator from a system currently stacked against them. There is no denying that the unfair dismissal provisions allow those who blatantly choose not to work to remain holding a paid position in the full and comfortable knowledge that they cannot be fired. Therefore, small business operators cannot take the risk of employing strangers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The businesswoman I have just spoken about has vowed never to employ permanent staff again and is considering closing down her business altogether. This is not the only horror story that I have on my files. There is one which involves theft and fraud of more than $200,000 worth of stock. The culprits, realising investigations were under way, took stress leave, forcing their employer to pay them while they laid low and covered their tracks. Again, the cost of continued investigation, legal action and the expectant unfair dismissal case forced the small business operator to simply drop the matter. The crooked employees resigned, taking every dollar of their entitlements without batting an eyelid. I have a community of small business operators who feel helpless and are looking to this government to give them the right and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7113"> freedom to run their businesses without the fear of being sued into bankruptcy. This amendment will give both workers and employers the chance to enjoy long-term job creation and security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we must do is protect the honest employer, the one who is now too frighted to employ a person who walks in off the street or comes in from the CES. These job seekers come loaded with such lethal legal baggage that no small business operator can afford to take them on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at this bill and what it offers to the business community, I can only presume that the opposition, assisted by the Democrats, is opposing it purely for political reasons. Are the opposition and the Democrats motivated by the desire to see high unemployment figures so they can tell the public that we are not doing our job? If they truly believed in giving small business the incentive to employ people, they would welcome this bill with open arms. The move by the ALP and the Democrats to block this amendment in the Senate is blatantly politically motivated and they should be totally ashamed of their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unions, of course, are against any change that might lessen their power over the thousands of workers who, whether they want to or not, are forced to abide by their rules. We have been going backwards in industrial relations for the past decade, but the union&hyphen;driven Labor Party cannot be seen to change its spots and endorse anything that would give employers the right to hire and fire. This attitude is not only outdated and outmoded, it is unfair to both the employers and the employees. The unions have never been big fans of the principles of freedom of choice and freedom of association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must remove the facility for those who have abused the system to the extent that the small business operators cannot afford to employ permanent staff. The message I am getting from my electorate is that this amendment is not enough. They want the entire unfair dismissal provision eliminated altogether. I do not believe that that is necessary. But there is no doubt in my mind that, without this change to give small business the free 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dom and confidence to employ new staff, we cannot expect to see an improvement in our unemployment figures. For that reason, I support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this legislation is to amend provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 relating to the exemption of businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provision of the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate I have heard so far in this House on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, some reference has been made to the fact that a number of ex&hyphen;union officials on this side of the House have been speaking on this piece of legislation. I have no problem at all in identifying myself as one of those ex&hyphen;union officials and I think the question may well have been asked if I was not speaking: why wasn't I speaking on this very important piece of legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that our friends on the other side of the House miss is that many of us are not only ex&hyphen;union officials but also ex&hyphen;union secretaries, and we had to run our union as a business. In my particular case, I was secretary of a branch of a union and had to run that branch at a profit. I had to report to a state executive which, you might say, was a board of directors. I had to employ staff. I had something like 12 or 13 clerical staff. I had the right to hire and fire. My branch of the union had an income of over $1 million a year. I think that, with that background, I have seen both sides of the story and am very well qualified to speak on this particular piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remarks relating to the unfair dismissal issue never cease to amaze me. Despite having a bill that was the subject of negotiations between the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, and the Democrats, the government persists in encouraging the fallacy that we, on this side of the House, are somehow to blame for its alleged failings. The previous speaker, the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall), was not talking about this piece of legislation&mdash;he was not justifying it at all&mdash;he was speaking about some views he had on the previous legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7114">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be a view, from the government side, that an employee who is unjustifiably sacked by a small business should be treated differently from a person sacked by a large employer. The issue is surely one of equity. How can we so differentiate between employees by the size of a business? Under the government's legislation, if they work for a company with 15 employees, they are not protected; if they work for a company with 16 employees, they are protected. How ridiculous can you get! Employers who run small businesses should not be in any way permitted to be in a position to treat Australian workers in any different way regardless of whom they work for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot allow a system to be legislated for that in any way permits some Australians to be treated less fairly, simply by virtue of the size of the particular company. Australia has been described by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) this week as a very egalitarian society. To suggest treating workers differently, based on the size of a company, would consign that egalitarian society to the scrap heap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that the government made significant changes to the Workplace Relations Act in December of last year. Some of the changes were as follows: the jurisdiction of the federal tribunal to hear unfair dismissal claims has been reduced; the definition of fairness has been changed; separate streams exist for handling unfair and unlawful dismissals; the power of the AIRC to award costs against employees has been dramatically increased and has been coupled with a compulsory conciliation stage; and a $50 filing fee has been introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new act confines the operation of the federal statute to a narrow field. Hence, some federal employees are not covered by a federal award, and the five remaining state systems are not subject to the overriding operation of the federal law as was previously the case. Regulations were made in December which impose additional restrictions on the classes of employees protected from unfair dismissals. We were unable to have those regulations disallowed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the additional exemptions are: the December registrations, it is claimed, revert to the pre&hyphen;November 1994 position and exclude all employees hired for a specific period; the new registrations deny casual employees protection until they have been engaged as such for a period of 12 months; the December registrations deem any period of probation up to three months to be reasonable; and the restriction of terminating employees defined as `temporarily absent' from work due to illness or injury is also eroded. Employees are now subject to lawful dismissal where they are absent from work for a continuous period of three months or for more than three months in a period of 12 months except where they are in receipt of paid sick leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We raise criticisms of these registrations on the basis that they not only detract from the rights of some workers but also do not fully conform with the terms of the relevant international treaty in that they make it simpler for employers to structure their employment relations so as to avoid their responsibilities under the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why would we be surprised at such an attitude encouraged by this government? The Prime Minister announced, in a statement on 24 March this year, new promises to make further amendments to cover employers with no more than 15 employees. The government tried to give effect to these statements by regulations, but I am pleased to say the Senate disallowed them. Hence, the bill is now proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many small businesses are sole traders or partnerships and are not presently subject to these laws. Why do they need the law if they are not affected? The answer is that it is just a smokescreen to pretend the government is doing something for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give credit to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> staff for their magnificent work in presenting to parliamentarians a continuance of their unbiased and professional critique of government legislation. On this occasion, I intend to quote at length from their comments in relation to arguments that I strongly support on the inequity of the proposals, these un 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7115"> necessary laws and our international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred to this issue earlier and I again note that the principal argument going to the fairness of the changes is that they leave significant sections of the work force without basic protections enjoyed by workers employed by medium to large businesses&mdash;including workers in compatible jobs. I agree with the claim that the proposed changes to the unfair dismissal laws will have only a marginal impact on the viability of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other issues&mdash;such as insufficient capital, poor management, general inexperience and predatory conduct by competitors&mdash;are arguably more pressing problems for small business; and none more so than the current flat economy. Size is not a universal proxy for profitability or capacity to pay. The bill says that, in every instance where the employer is a small business, the business is less well placed than the worker to carry the costs of a breakdown in the employment relationship. Only in some instances would this be true. With continuing high levels of unemployment, the removal of access to unfair dismissal remedies further enhances the already considerable bargaining power of employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now briefly address the issue of the necessity or otherwise of this legislation. I certainly believe that it is very arguable that the changes already enacted by the present government&mdash;and even the previous government&mdash;have sufficiently redressed any imbalance that may have existed in the legislation against employers. Spurious actions are now less of a problem for all businesses, as there has been a marked decline in the number of claims in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the cause of the shift may be argued, what seems clear is that the new laws have had a not insignificant impact on the number of allegations of unfair treatment being made against employers in the federal arena. I believe it is fair to argue that changes to the general law have not only reduced levels of litigation but also lowered the risk to employers of being subject to an adverse finding. These proposed changes are therefore unnecessary. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of protection for Australian workers always seems to raise the blood pressure of government members, for some reason. I recall many government speakers in the workplace relations legislation debate placing what I considered to be undue emphasis on the difficulties that unfair dismissal legislation was causing small business. In my view, if employees and employers are prepared to work through their respective organisations&mdash;such as the employer organisations and trade unions&mdash;in most cases a reasonable outcome is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears to me that when either party seeks legal representation a short&hyphen;cut financial solution is sometimes reached. Rather than arguing the merits of the case, as if the worker was unjustly treated, reinstatement should apply rather than a financial penalty on the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a previous speech on the workplace reform legislation, I quoted an example where an employer informed me&mdash;and I speak to a number of small to medium size employers in my electorate&mdash;that one of his workers who was not a member of a trade union had legal representation in an unfair dismissal claim. The worker received a settlement of $1,600. The worker's legal representative asked the employer to make out two cheques: one for $1,000 for the solicitor&mdash;the legal representative&mdash;and $600 for the worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point again that for any legislation to work successfully it is very important that the parties involved are represented by their appropriate organisations who have more than just a financial commitment to a fair solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House make no apology for arguing that working people should have job security, and this is where we differ from the people on the other side, who do not want working people to have job security. Without legislative protection, the workplace is not a level playing field&mdash;and I have been involved in this industry for over 20 years as a union official&mdash;and with employers exercising their master/servant relationship you have an unequal power structure in the workplace. I believe working people who have given good and loyal service to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7116"> their employer should not have to work under a cloud of dismissal that could be caused by a sudden disagreement, a personal dislike or by a small business operator&mdash;who may not be the man on the spot&mdash;accepting the word of a factory foreman or manager.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently a constituent came into my office who had been dismissed from a small panel beating workshop. This worker was so well entrenched in the company that I actually thought he was the owner. After working at this company for several years, this person had a couple of days off sick. When he returned to work he was dismissed. When this worker inquired as to why he was being dismissed the employer said, `There are a couple of reasons I can give but the easiest one for me is to simply say there was insufficient work,' even though that worker had been working considerable overtime prior to his dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This worker made a claim for unfair dismissal. It was only settled yesterday in the court, so I am not talking about something that happened two or three years or two or three months ago. That worker was quite prepared to settle for his award entitlement. He was given a week's pay when he left the company. The settlement in the commission yesterday awarded him another two weeks pay, which was only his award entitlement. That is not an employee who was taking the employer to the cleaners, as has happened in some of the cases opposite. We need to look at both sides of the story here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that the unfair dismissal legislation is having the desired effect; it is working. The figures supplied by the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business comparing the period January to July 1996 with January to July 1997 show a national decline of about 20 per cent in the number of unfair, unlawful dismissal applications being lodged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with an area that is frequently misunderstood and is frequently maligned by critics with little knowledge, and that relates to obligations under the international conventions that we have been party to and have endorsed over the years. The ILO has been a very special organisation throughout the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Western world in that many of its conventions have been conveyed to many countries for endorsement, bringing a much better legal status for many workers. Many workers would still be languishing under appalling conditions, particularly women, but for the persuasive conventions which have been endorsed and through which improvement has begun. That is also true in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is open to question whether the broad exclusion contemplated by the bill extends beyond `limited categories of employed persons in respect of which special problems of a substantive nature exist'. At face value, all persons employed by small business are simply not a very limited or specialised class of employee. The present proposal to exempt all small businesses in relation to new staff arguably punches too big a hole in article 2(1) of convention No. 158 of the ILO, which evinces the intention that the convention `applies to all branches of economic activity and to all employed persons'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I express my serious concern that the government is taking such steps as will demean us in the eyes of the rest of the world by creating a clear defining line between employees of certain levels of an employer. This is quite unfair and unnecessary, and it will serve as a blight on our nation for many years to come if agreed to by this Australian parliament. There is certainly a view amongst legal experts such as the leading commentator on industrial law, Breen Creighton, who has noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that Australia submitted its first report on Convention No. 158 in September 1995, this means that it would not now be permissible in terms of the Convention to adopt regulations under section 170CC(1)(d) or (e) to exclude categories of workers (for example those whose employers employed fewer than five employees)&mdash;even though it would have been quite in order to do so before the first report was submitted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These words are not ours but clearly they underpin the serious concerns raised by those on this side of the House throughout the debate. I join with other Labor members in opposing this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, expressions of support for small business, backed up by policy muscle and action shown by the Howard government to date, extend far beyond this single bill, which is back before us courtesy of our Labor, Democrat and Green friends in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people showed their support for the lot of small business, for the vast majority of the 900,000 businesses in this country where some 680,000 firms alone have five employees or less, by moving a motion of disallowance to this regulation in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 back on 26 June. They showed total scant regard for a sensible, practical and commonsense policy reform to offer short&hyphen;term legitimate relief of unfair dismissal provisions for the vast majority of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it ironic when elected representatives in this place go out and hit the hustings, speaking on the radio circuit, talking to local newspaper journalists and mixing with the community in speaking out about the great pity and also great support they have for small business. How tough but admirable small business proprietors have to be in this day and age, they say. The unbridled respect they show for small business in their travels oozes out to anybody who cares to listen. Whether it is the long working days, councils wanting to put up another shopping centre nearby, the excess burdens of red tape and administrative costs which mean more and more paperwork, the need for reliable staff or a feeling that bureaucracy has gone mad and is stifling enterprise, these Labor and minor party members provide slick words, reassurance and a commitment they will do what they can to make things better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business people and the community have come to hear it all and lately I have heard it all as well. But Labor, Democrat and Green parliamentarians in particular really 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must consider their choice of words far more carefully when it comes down to this bill. Indeed, if they thought about the wastage of time and money in the running of another enterprise&mdash;that being Enterprise Australia&mdash;presumably from up here on Capital Hill, then this practical and sensible amendment bill should have become law long ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As identified in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>, the official report to the small business deregulation task force back on 24 March this year, the current federal government set about acting on the lion's share of recommendations put to it by the task force chair, Charlie Bell, and his committee. And it has done so. The Howard government does have more time for business. It is endeavouring to deliver policies that give more time, and save money and heartache where it can, for small business owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal coalition government has more time for businesses because it is attempting to address the issues that are important to small business. Surveys undertaken by the Bell task force, preceding the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), showed that half of the small business operators surveyed said that a significant reduction in compliance cost would allow them more time to run their business. A further 25 per cent saw reducing paperwork and meeting the demands placed on small business by government and bureaucratic authorities as a real means of increasing profitability to boost economic growth and create local jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that providing a window of regulatory relief from unfair dismissal law provisions for small business and the necessary paperwork attached to them more than fits both criteria. During the very successful visit to the Hunter of the then Minister for Industrial Relations, now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), back on 30 July, the biggest cheer he received when addressing the Newcastle Regional Chamber of Commerce small business lunch was in response to the determination he exhibited to drive this amendment through the parliament. The bill makes good common 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7118"> sense, and both the small business community and the general public know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is also a further part of the underlying philosophy of what this government wants to do for small business&mdash;that is, simply to give it a fair go. The measures in this bill, emanating directly from the original Bell report, allow small businesses with 15 or fewer employees to be exempt from the unfair dismissals provision in respect of new employees, until they have been continuously employed&mdash;whether full time, part time or on a regular or casual basis&mdash;for a 12-month period. That seems pretty fair to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the protection for new employees continues, in that this bill will not affect employees' rights to take action for unfair termination of employment on grounds of discrimination&mdash;for example, because of pregnancy, age, or dismissal without minimum notice. Nor will this bill affect the rights of apprentices as they are now. If we want to restore full confidence in our economy, if we want our employees to feel confident, we need our employers to feel confident that they have control over their own affairs, without living with the constant threat of being taken to the cleaners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is the engine room for further job creation in this country, and it is the backbone of economic growth. Small business is also the engine room of jobs growth in the Hunter. According to the Hunter Valley Research Foundation, the current number of retail shopfront establishments in our region runs well in excess of 5,000 and follows on the back of over 1,000 manufacturing operations. More commonly pronounced national statistics identify that, in the decade to 1994-95, small business accounted for 1.1 million of the 1.2 million net jobs created over that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislative measure can only seek to enhance the prospects of small business in employing more full-time staff, more part-time staff and more casual employees, in a climate in the Hunter where consumer confidence is growing, interest rates are falling to a level previously enjoyed when Neil Armstrong made one small step for mankind onto 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the moon, and red tape in business is being lifted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Figures released in July by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that employment growth in the Hunter&mdash;ignoring the gloom and doom merchants like the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), alias the grim reaper, and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) who constantly claims that the skies are falling in on our local employment&mdash;identified that job creation in the Hunter region is three times&mdash;yes, three times&mdash;the national average. The local job participation rate is also up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any kick-start the government can give to release further the regulatory burdens on small business to put people into work can surely only embrace those figures. A government prepared to offer some spine of solid, lasting support would only be too willing to adopt such a proposal&mdash;and we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why isn't the ethos of `a fair go for small business' something that the members of the Labor Party and the Democrats in this place are happy to spruik outside in the community&mdash;like the Democrat Party's small business spokesperson, Senator Andrew Murray, and Labor's equivalent, the member for Cunningham, Steve Martin, who were thumping the pulpit recently at an organised public meeting back on 5 August by the Hunter based small business people in Newcastle to debate the report into fair trading? Senator Murray and the member for Cunningham spoke with great verve and passion on this chilly evening in the Newcastle Town Hall to over 300 small business people. Watching them on the stage with my own eyes, they stated how they would fight for small business and drag the government towards fully endorsing the bipartisan findings of the fair trading inquiry&mdash;an inquiry, may I add, that this government actually created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray and the member for Cunningham rightly want the retail fish and chip outlet, the clothes shop in a shopping centre, and the fruitier next door to a supermarket to get a fair go over fair trading law&mdash;but, it seems, nowhere else. So you can imagine how I was floored when I heard on the radio Senator Murray foreshadowing that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7119"> he was going to block the unfair dismissal bill, just as he supported the disallowance of the regulation in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet there they stood on the stage like B1 and B2, complimenting each other on how they were the crusaders of small business. The people there might have been mistaken for thinking of them as belonging to the same party. But, given that Labor no longer rent the Democrats by the hour and just bulk-bill them for the time there, you could be forgiven for that mistake. But when they finally peel off those skins and all is revealed, you will find that they are very slippery to pin down for support. Those fighting words of Labor and the Democrats do not carry through to providing some valid relief for unfair dismissal provisions for these very same businesses and support them actually employing people&mdash;and that is the point I want to ram home hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first came to this parliament in April last year and in the early months following, the brevity and impact of what Laurie Brereton's legacy&mdash;that draconian unfair dismissal legislation&mdash;had done to so many unwitting small business people had become somewhat legendary. A number of tragic cases came to the attention of my office. One involved a hard working young Woodville couple in my electorate who had just purchased a produce delivery business. Employing on a trial period a male employee&mdash;the son of the former owner&mdash;a drop-off in business and its failure to live up to the price of the goodwill paid for it required the couple to review the employment status of that worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a bid to count the pennies in the business and keep it afloat, unfortunately, they had to reduce the status of this employee to that of casual. With the employee put onto part&hyphen;time status after a period of three months and two weeks, the employee subsequently left a short time later. The significant point here is the three months and the two weeks: it was over and above Laurie's provision in the law. Without getting into the nitty-gritty of the legalist to's and fro's of what was a complicated case, an unfair dismissal claim, ultimately a substantial out of court settlement was paid in favour of the employee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, in illustrating part of the letter written by the employee's solicitor to the small business proprietor's own legal representative, I think it reinforces the point more than ever that small business needs a fair go and a break from short-term unfair dismissal provisions. The letter states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We are concerned that either your client does not understand or did not properly explain to them the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Confusion! They did not understand&mdash;but the law will punish all the same. I am sure that this was the same sad message conveyed to so many small business people around the country in the last few years that makes the impost of unfair dismissal provisions on small business in need of an urgent reprieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases I believe the small business man or woman was totally correct in their actions. It is their business, it is their money, it is their livelihoods that are on the line, yet the law still took them to the cleaners. Surely the laws which govern our land at the end of the day are there to help the people, not to hinder them. The same should go for the laws which govern business. This business faced the full brunt of Laurie Brereton's out of kilter and job damaging unfair dismissal legislation&mdash;Laurie's legacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the case had its complexities, and there is no denial of some breach of the law in the case, the question I ask is: what is wrong with a business legally trying to make a dollar? In desperate circumstances clear-cut business decisions were needed to keep that business alive and keep food on the table at home and keep the house payments going. Small business people should be allowed to make these decisions without a quirk in the law punishing them twice for their troubles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With some policy nips and tucks, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has returned the balance between employer and employee with our remodelled unfair dismissal provisions. The second extension of that process is to get that unnecessary burden off the backs of small business. As a former&mdash;and I like to think moderately successful&mdash;small businessman myself, let me tell you that the present package of reforms and initiatives to try to make 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7120"> the lot of a small business owner a little easier is head and shoulders above anything the former Labor government sought to put together for small and medium sized enterprises in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot afford to, and will not, rest on our laurels. Those policy nips and tucks in getting the macro&hyphen; and micro&hyphen;economic mix increasingly right must continue. When I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in debating taxation reform last night on the ABC radio <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program say that the Labor Party is the party that is really supporting small business, I suggest he grab a panadol, have a good lie down and think about the consequences of that statement. Kim Beazley, actions speak louder than words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor Party and Democrats are fair dinkum in supporting Australian businesses&mdash;all businesses&mdash;they will support this bill. If the Labor Party and the Democrats are fair dinkum in supporting employment for all Australians, they will support this bill. If the Labor Party and the Democrats care about Australia and all Australians, they will support this bill because it addresses the problems that affect all Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I want to clear up any confusion that may be in the minds of listeners of the previous speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), and indeed various speakers on the other side about what the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is actually doing. This bill is not amending Laurie Brereton's or the Labor government's unfair dismissal laws; it is amending this government's law and stripping away a right which this government said last year they were entitled to but has since changed its mind about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is stripping away a right for people who are employed in small business, if dismissed in a harsh, unjust or unreasonable way, to seek redress: a fundamental right which this government last year and before the last election said they should have but has now changed its mind and said they should not have. Why has it changed its mind? Because it is desperate to create jobs. It will do almost 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> anything to create employment, even to the point of destroying the fundamental rights of people, but it is not succeeding in doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is fundamentally flawed. It is flawed because this government assume that, by taking these sorts of measures, they will be able to create employment. There is no evidence of that whatever. They also assume that the previous government's legislation in relation to unfair dismissals destroyed jobs. We heard reference after reference in this debate and from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time on numerous occasions about Labor's job destroying  unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the mythology of this government. The facts say the opposite. The facts say that, when the Labor government's legislation was in place, there was very strong employment growth. Since this legislation has been taken away, we have not seen such strong employment growth. I am not saying that these are the only issues related to employment, but this government is saying that this is necessary to create employment. There is absolutely no factual basis for that whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what happened under Labor's period in office with the unfair dismissals law. It came into effect at the end of March 1994. From then until February 1996, a period of 23 months, what happened to employment with this job destroying unfair dismissals law? We had growth in employment of half a million&mdash;just over 500,000. So much for the job destroying law. There were 500,000 additional jobs created while this legislation was in place. Certainly it was not perfect and certainly we made some adjustments to it, some of which came into effect at the end of our period in office. But it was not job destroying. There is no evidence to show that it was job destroying. It did not stop half a million additional people getting jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, in the period after we left office, for the rest of 1996, when this legislation remained in effect&mdash;although there was legislation around from May of last year to amend it, it did not come into effect until the end of December&mdash;there continued to be some employment growth under the Liberal govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7121"> ment. In the 2&frac34; years that this Labor legislation was in place, we had growth in employment of 568,000 jobs. In the period since this legislation was chucked out and the new legislation was brought in on the basis that it would create employment, how many jobs have been created? Seventeen thousand jobs have been created in the seven months from December to July. Under the previous legislation, we were creating 17,000 jobs a month. We have had 17,000 in seven months with this legislation in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this is not the only factor in determining employment growth. But, on the basis of that evidence, one certainly cannot say that the previous legislation was job destroying, and one certainly cannot say that the current legislation, through the Workplace Relations Bill, and the unfair dismissal changes have been job creating in the way they were claimed they would be. There simply is no evidence to show that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the facts, which no-one on the government side wants to do, you will see the opposite to what the government believes to be the fact, that is, there was no job destroying legislation. The legislation gave rights&mdash;and certainly it may have been overdone in the first place. The evidence does not say it destroyed employment. We had half a million additional jobs, 17,000 a month on average. This government would give its right arm to create 17,000 a month at the present time. It simply cannot do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From that employment evidence, it is quite clear that the basis of this legislation is false. The basis of this legislation is that you have to take away the rights of workers in relation to unfair dismissal to create employment. The past shows that that is not so. Of course, this government refuse to acknowledge that. I can understand that they do not want to look back or acknowledge anything that was done under the previous government. But they are basing legislation on that assumption. They are stripping away the rights of people on that assumption. They have no right to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw attention to the fact that, in the first seven months of the Labor government's supposedly job destroying legislation, we created 186,500 additional jobs. In the first 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seven months of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill and the changes to the unfair dismissal laws, we have had 17,000 additional jobs. What a comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such startling differentials make it absolutely clear that there is no evidence whatever that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were job destroying or even that they inhibited the growth of employment. Certainly, they did not prevent very strong employment growth. There is no evidence whatever that the government's new and greatly restricted unfair dismissal regime has provided any boost to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of this, one might ask: why, then, do government members so fervently believe that the bill now before the House will lead to strong employment growth? The answer is that it is just ideology, just a belief, just something that they think must be right: if you take away some kind of employment right for workers that small business or business generally has found a bit objectionable, then that will create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is much more complex than that. You have to do a hell of a lot of things to create employment. Certainly, this government is not doing them. This kind of measure, rather than creating employment, is just making our society less fair and less equitable by taking away fundamental rights from workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason we can be utterly sceptical about claims that this legislation will be a key to employment growth is that many small businesses are already completely exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. This government's Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, which came into effect at the end of last year and which changed the unfair dismissal laws, excluded lots of people in small business. They already are excluded.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That definition of groups excludes various small business people. Obviously it excludes the employees of sole traders and of partnerships. A myriad of small businesses outside Victoria and the territories are not covered because they are not corporations, or they may be corporations but they are not constitutional corporations. So there are lots of small businesses which already are not covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is just sweeping up the rest of them, making sure that those who were covered initially are now no longer covered. Many of them, probably the majority, have been excluded already by the legislation which was brought in earlier this year. So we are here just tidying up, making sure that no small business need be worried about unfair dismissal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this already large exemption of small business, there is no evidence that it has led to increased employment. In fact, employment growth has been pathetic since this exemption was made, as I have already shown. Furthermore, there is no evidence, apart from anecdotal evidence, that these laws were especially burdensome for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chief Justice Wilcox of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia noted in his annual report for 1995-96 that small business employers were underrepresented in unfair dismissal cases that came before the court. In talking about an independent survey of the court's unlawful termination litigants, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no indication that the jurisdiction attracts particular classes of employees beyond their representation in the community. Respondents also are a cross-section of Australian employers, except that small business seems to be under&hyphen;represented. Although ABS statistics show that 91.7% of employers have fewer than 20 employees, the survey showed that only 33% of respondents were in this category. It is interesting to speculate why this is so. Perhaps communication is better in small enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, what he is saying is that small business is underrepresented in the cases before the court for unfair dismissal and that, therefore, things must be working better in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small business than in business generally. What this bill is about is exempting small business because there is supposed to be a special problem there. Mr Justice Wilcox is saying the opposite is true. He is saying that there is less of a problem with small business than with big business, in terms of the cases that come before the court. This government is addressing a problem at the wrong end, if there is a problem at all. Certainly, the government's actions do not fit with the words of Justice Wilcox.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report Chief Justice Wilcox also noted that by October 1995&mdash;that is, before the latest changes by the Labor government to the unfair dismissals law came into effect&mdash;the number of cases that came before the court was just under two per cent of all involuntary terminations in the Australian work force. So, as he said, a tiny proportion of all the people who were sacked pursued litigation against their employer and took a case to court. So much for this being an overwhelming problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In targeting an exemption for all small business, the government have claimed also that this is in accord with ILO convention No. 158, the termination of employment convention, which they say allows exclusions of this type, even though the convention states, in article 2, paragraph 1:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Convention applies to all branches of economic activity and to all employed persons.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the international convention on which the unfair dismissals law is based&mdash;and which we ratified&mdash;says that this should be applying to all branches of the economy and to all employed persons. It does go on to allow for some exemptions. Countries can have exemptions for some categories, such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . limited categories of employed persons in respect of which special problems of a substantial nature arise in the light of the particular conditions of employment of the workers concerned or the size or nature of the undertaking that employs them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is those words which the government has seized on, to say, `We can use that exemption in the convention to put through this&mdash;based on the convention. We will be hunky&hyphen;dory, in line with the convention.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7123">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the convention goes on to require that a country, in its first report on the convention to the ILO, shall set out any exemptions and the reasons for them and also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . shall state in subsequent reports the position of its law and practice regarding the categories excluded, and the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the Convention in respect of such categories.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So what it seems to me to be saying is that you must, in the first place, report on who you have excluded and why, and then in subsequent reports you must say how those exemptions are going and what effect is being given to the convention in respect of those categories. In other words, the impetus seems to be for going back towards the full coverage, which is the objective of the convention. But what this government is doing is going the other way. It is not paring back on the exemptions; it is going to more exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is also important is that these words have been interpreted by the committee of experts of the ILO to mean that, after you have put in your first report, there is then no right under the convention to have any further exclusions. As the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) said in his address a little while ago, the first report was put in by Australia in September 1995. According to the committee of experts, after you have put in your first report, that is it. You have no further right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me read from the ILO publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protection against unjustified dismissal</EMPHASIS>, a 1995 report by the committee of experts. In paragraph 74, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 2(6) allows governments to take account of future developments towards a reduction of the exclusions referred to in the first report, but it does not allow them subsequently to introduce new exceptions that were not in force at the time of the first report. In addition to affording the appropriate flexibility, the purpose of exception clauses in ILO Conventions is for member States to endeavour to gradually achieve broader application&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in other words, to pare back on the exemptions, not to expand them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, this government is going against this convention. What it is doing is a defiance and a breach of the convention. The committee of experts has said that it is not within the terms of the convention to do exactly what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this government is doing. In terms of this convention, you have no right to further extend exemptions after the first report. What you did with the Workplace Relations Act at the end of last year&mdash;narrowing the coverage on unfair dismissals and excluding lots of people&mdash;was in total defiance and breach of the ILO convention, as is what you are doing now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the situation this government is in. It is acting in a way which is totally contrary to its international obligations, and it is doing so on the totally false premise that, by doing this and taking this harsh action against the workers of this country, it will create employment. It will totally fail in that regard, as it has totally failed so far during its period of office.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I often get the impression that this building is actually the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> , and we are in here shuffling the deckchairs. I recall that, when I first came to this parliament, mine was the most marginal seat in Australia and the party to which I then belonged put on marginal members meetings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He put up a white board and went through a particular example&mdash;I cannot remember exactly what it was now. He put it on the board and said, `Because of this, et cetera,' and I marvelled at the intellect of this man, at how lucid he was and how clearly he could see the problem. When he got to the bottom, however, he said, `And because of this . . . ', and he drew completely the wrong conclusion&mdash;a conclusion which could not be sustained in any way from his very lucid argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that if members of parliament today were to sit back and listen to what they say&mdash;including the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis)&mdash;they would find within what they say the germ of the truth of this matter. The government and the opposition know that this is not about creating jobs. This is about placating the small business sector. That is important.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7124">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The small business sector is very important to Australia. But this legislation is not necessarily important, although I support it wholeheartedly. I would go further, however, and make 100 people the minimum and not 15. From my experience of small businesses, overwhelmingly they do not put people on in order to sack them. They do not employ people in order to rip them off. If that is the case in some circumstances, it is much more important that an overall increase in employment opportunities is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business believes that this legislation does impede it. I know small businesses which are outside the scope of this legislation but which fervently believe that they are affected by it. I know doctors who are putting staff on on a casual basis for fear of permanent employment. That is what has been engendered. So there is a use in this business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody here seriously believes that the government is responsible for the near record levels of low inflation that we have. The record low inflation in this country is because nothing is happening in the economy. In short, the economy is stuffed. That is the truth of the matter and that is why inflation is low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the government's industrial relations legislation the only thing of any value is the protection for small business, although that protection is largely, as I have said, emotional. The rest of it is a hark back to where the minister comes from&mdash;the 1950s. It is quite clear that there is no merit in it, but if the Labor Party is foolish enough to oppose it in the Senate and it becomes an item for a double dissolution, then all I can say is `Heaven help the Labor Party'&mdash;that is, of course, if the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), as the leader of that urban centralist coalition that occupies the other side of the House, has the nerve for it, which I very much doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is this: if you are going to protect the interests of workers&mdash;and I am all for that&mdash;you do that by creating jobs in the economy. There are lots of things that can be done to create jobs&mdash;is that my mobile phone ringing?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of employment there are lots of things the government could do to engender employment. A lot of those jobs that the member for Gellibrand talked about are, in fact, part&hyphen;time jobs and jobs in the tourist industry. A lot of them are jobs in the quasi&hyphen;government area. So I think the figures are being fudged anyway. But it would certainly assist small business enormously if governments were committed to paying their bills in 30 days. It would also assist small business, particularly in regional and rural areas, if governments were prepared to buy locally on occasions. But governments will not do this; they will not undertake these very sensible things. If governments would see that major government entities like the armed forces purchased Australia, then there would be many more jobs in the community. There are so many things that we could do to create jobs and this is what will give workers protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have a situation where a worker has job opportunities, it is much harder to erode worker conditions. When you have high levels of unemployment there is nothing the unions can do in the long run to stop the erosion of wages and conditions. That is exactly what the opposition in many cases wants. They want this continual erosion. They think that this is somehow good for the economy when it is quite clear that it is not. I have said in this parliament many times that the only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7125"> future I want for my kids and for everyone else's kids is a high standard of living. This requires high wages, high levels of education and high levels of training. We are going backwards in all those areas. I live in fear that I am going to hand my kids a worse country than the one I inherited from my parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to accept the emotional context of these things. Small business has this perception. In many cases they are  right. In my own electorate I know of cases where a small business has been taken to the cleaners by workers with a little experience. Whole businesses have been threatened, in some cases ruined. Small business is giving up because of this unfair dismissal legislation. It is not good enough to say, as the member for Gellibrand said, that it is only two per cent. That two per cent is often very critical. While small business believes that it is being impeded, you have to take cognisance of that because small business is the only opportunity we are going to see for growth in the economy. We will not see it just with this legislation. I can assure you of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) mentioned the government's fair trading inquiry. I think the report was very good. It dealt basically with only the retail trade sector and that was a little narrow. The good work of that committee will come to nought because it will put the government, if it implements it, in conflict with big business and, from my experience, big business wins. The member for Gellibrand is absolutely right when he says that you are not going to see massive growth in employment by passing this legislation. That does not, however, mean that it should not be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While you have governments that cling&mdash;both parties in this House are the same&mdash;to this discredited policy of rational economics, which is neither rational nor economic (it is political ideology), you are going to see a continual erosion of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Farmers Federation has just put out a circular. The National Farmers Federation is a joke. It certainly does not represent the interests of the rural sector, and the rural sector is recognising in droves that this is the case. I think the citrus growers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have made a decision to pull out. They have every justification for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Blight, the head of the National Farmers Federation, said recently that it was a disgrace that workers in the car industry were subsidised $20,000 each. If that was true, so what? If those people were on the dole they would not have to have many kids before the taxpayer was subsidising them that much on the dole. It is far better to have the import replacement manufacturing that went with it. But, of course, it was not true. That took only the people employed directly in the car industry, not all the people who contribute to it. It is quite clear that it is the erosion of the manufacturing industry that has done enormous damage to this country. Until that is recognised, and it does not appear to be recognised by either party&mdash;certainly there was no greater architect of the demise of the manufacturing industry than Paul Keating&mdash;we are not going to get anywhere in terms of creating employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is needed is some confidence in the community, and that will do more to stop inflation than this god we have created of low inflation. That will do more to stop that. Once you get some confidence back in there, see if the Treasurer (Mr Costello) can come in here and gloat over low inflation numbers. I can tell this House and the nation now that the reason we have this low inflation is that there is simply nothing happening out there in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many areas where we could be generating jobs. It makes me laugh that in the Mortimer report they go to great pains to say, `We are not picking winners.' The Prime Minister says, `We are not picking winners, but we have got to support the information superhighway.' It is quite clear that this government is not going to spend on the information superhighway the money that Malaysia is spending. We have no special expertise, no special advantage, there in any case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ignore all the things where we do have a special advantage. The government talks about putting $100 million into a nonsense railway in the Northern Territory, which has not got a hope in hell of ever being viable, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7126"> when Tasmania is dying on its feet. That is an indictment of the mentality of government&mdash;that Tasmania, which represents a far greater proportion of people than the Northern Territory, is dying on its feet while they are going to waste $100 million on a railway. Let us see a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis before that money is spent. But that money has not been put in to build a railway; it has been put in to pork&hyphen;barrel the Northern Territory and South Australia governments. That is one of the great tragedies of Australia and we have seen that recurring from both sides of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are looking at industries, you have to look where we have a natural advantage or where we have a strategic need. I put to this House that an area where a clear natural advantage exists is in chemical production from natural gas, of which we have an abundance. We should be supporting by every means possible the establishment of industries off the North West Shelf to utilise our natural gas. That support should be by capital grants from the government&mdash;not by dodgy taxation agreements&mdash;open and visible to the public. Governments would say, `We are putting this money into establishing this industry because, once this industry is established, it will be there for the life of the technology, usually about 30 years.' If we cannot make ourselves central to the world in terms of producing over that 30 years, we probably do not deserve to maintain the industry, but I am sure that, given the past record of the initiative of Australian people, we would be able to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the small business sector, what are we going to do about it? This legislation is clearly not going to do anything. Is the government going to do anything about paying its bills on time? Is the government going to do anything about demanding the purchase of Australian material? I can tell the government this: in any economy, whether it was Joe Stalin's Russia or Ronald Reagan's America&mdash;two economies very similar in many ways&mdash;the government was the biggest single customer. It always is. Yet we see this opportunity being squandered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for a lot of the purchasing that is done and where foreign items are concerned, if the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government were to say to the people&mdash;often at a very low level of the bureaucracy&mdash;who do the purchasing, `Look, we are not saying you have got to buy the Australian product but you have got to put in writing why you did not buy it,' you would find a whole lot more Australian products would be bought. If they were not, we would have a reason; we might be able to go back to have a look at why they were not bought. Often it is not a matter of price. Often the stuff is actually cheaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in this parliament when we allowed the army to buy Unimogs when the Australian truck was actually cheaper&mdash;it was either 50 per cent or two&hyphen;thirds of the price. We bought them because we allowed the army to go travelling around the world. I was in France some few months later, and I said to the French, `Are you going to buy the Unimog? It is made by your neighbours across the road.' This French colonel looked at me as though I was mad and said, `Monsieur, we make very fine French trucks. Why would we buy a foreign truck?' He is absolutely right. Only the governments of Australia do these crazy things. We see it happening right now in the purchase of army recovery vehicles. They have given the order to Mercedes when they could have bought the Australian vehicle. I can tell the minister now that the Australian vehicle is a damn sight better vehicle. It will certainly be cheaper on its through&hyphen;life costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No other country in the world does this sort of thing, yet you have the Labor and the Liberal parties posturing about support for business. The truth is that, until we have some courage and until there is a determination in this House that we are going to have a manufacturing industry and that we are going to create jobs for workers, conditions for workers will continue to be eroded and there will be nothing that the unions can do about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on unions, the unions have got to bear their fair share of the blame for the fiasco in which we see ourselves because I was in the Labor caucus all those days and the left wing of the Labor Party did nothing. When Keating got up and talked about the future being in the service sector, there was not a murmur of dissent from them. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7127"> went along with this nonsense. The service sector, of course, is about 85 per cent tourism&mdash;low&hyphen;paid jobs, part&hyphen;time jobs and jobs for women and kids, not jobs for blue&hyphen;collar workers. So what have we done as a government? We have disenfranchised the blue&hyphen;collar worker&mdash;he is out of work, his wife is working part time, and his kids are running feral. Does anyone count the cost of that? Do these economic rationalists, who have inhabited both the Liberal and the Labor parties, count the cost of that? No, of course they do not. The truth is that they might have the economic qualifications but you certainly would not let them do a week's shopping for you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the speakers who have made contributions to this debate. The parliament has had a good opportunity to canvass all the issues relating to the government's proposal to exclude certain businesses, namely, small businesses defined as 15 employees or fewer, from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We proposed that because we think that it is a fair measure to provide some encouragement to the small business community to give people jobs. This is an important area that provides so much potential for small business to create jobs into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take the 10 years to 1994&hyphen;95, of the 1.2 million jobs created small businesses created 1.1 million of them, so the small business community has a track record of creating jobs and, in many cases, in difficult economic circumstances. It has still been able to provide the opportunities that otherwise would not have been provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the unfair dismissal laws were brought in by the previous government, they relied on the international treaty 158 on which to base the federal law. As time showed, that law in fact acted as a disincentive to job creation. Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, said a couple of years ago that too often small businesses were discouraged from giving somebody a job because they thought that the system was not fair to them. We as a government have attempted to bal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance the interests of both employers and employees. We want a system that is genuinely fair to both sides and that does not act as a disincentive, which the old scheme did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made a series of reforms which came into operation on 1 January this year. We introduced a filing fee of $50. I tell you, the filing fee of $50 has quite an impact on people's behaviour. We introduced a new regime where the commission could award costs against an employee who lodged a frivolous claim. The other day the commission actually awarded costs against an employee in favour of an employer. I tell you what, that is news to a lot of employers, and is perhaps evidence that the system is starting to get some balance back into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also required the commission, under the law that came into effect on 1 January, to take into account the circumstances of small business. We think that is fair, because you can treat these matters as just a sort of charter of rights for employees, but if you do so to the exclusion of the employers they are going to say to themselves, `Well, if I have got a choice between putting on a new machine or giving someone a job, I think I will go for the machine every time because, if I have got problems with it, it will not slug me with an unfair dismissal application.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made all those changes and there has been a significant drop in the number of unfair dismissal claims in the federal jurisdiction; in fact, something of the order of 55 per cent. It is true that some people have now made applications in the state schemes that they otherwise would not have, but that actually was part of the design. The reason we designed it that way was that the state schemes have not been the problem that the federal scheme established by the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) under the Labor administration has been. Overall, there has been a 20 per cent drop or thereabouts in the number of unfair dismissal applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the scheme has been realigned, it is much more reasonable, it is much fairer and it is providing a better deal for small business. But we want it to go further. In fact, in the negotiations for the Workplace Relations Act we proposed going further. Quite frankly, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7128"> Senator Kernot and I could not agree, so I said, `Well, if we cannot agree, we do not have to have the fight now. We can have this fight in the matter of a regulation when we come to implement the act.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not what they say, and I do not intend to breach the nature of the negotiations that we had with them, but I can tell you it is an absolute fact&mdash;I hope I am not pushed further on it&mdash;that we said, `Well, we will have this argument later.' We put up basically a compromise proposal, which was for a 12&hyphen;month exclusion period, basically an extended probation period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lo and behold, when the matter got into the Senate, the Labor Party and the Democrats joined together to defeat that regulation. So we said, `If you are going to defeat what is a pretty sensible regulation, that leaves us no choice but to present a bill. And, if we are going to have to present a bill and if that bill might potentially one day be a trigger for a double dissolution election, we might as well have the best possible policy for the small business community that we can get.' We therefore had drafted this bill which we now have before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested to hear the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) support this bill. What he said was absolute commonsense: you have got to have a system which gives some real encouragement to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it a reasonable thing to do by the standard or practice of others? Absolutely it is. At the international level, this is par for the course. We are not proposing anything especially difficult, especially odd, different, bizarre or otherwise compared with what happens at the international level. I will take some examples from Europe. In Austria, termination of employment legislation does not apply to employees in a business of less than five permanent employees. If it is good enough for the Austrians to have an exemption, why isn't it for us? In France, the amount of damages which can be awarded for unfair dismissal is lower for small businesses with less than 11 employees. So they have got a special deal for small business. In Germany, they have a situation where unfair dismissal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> laws do not apply to firms employing less than 10 employees. Does anybody say that the Germans are somehow exploiting their employees? No, they don't. What we are simply proposing here is standard practice at the international level&mdash;and provided for, I might say, within the ILO convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Gellibrand is here and he made some claims about whether or not this was consistent with our international obligations. Let me respond to those in a minute. But, just before doing so, I point out that the fact is that if you look at the convention it says that you are entitled to so draft legislation as to allow for exclusions of this type. Article 2 of the ILO's Termination of Employment Convention 1982 plainly allows exclusion of employees where special problems of a serious nature arise because of the size of the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition say, however, that such an exclusion can only be done if it is done at the outset and acknowledged in Australia's first report to the ILO about its implementation of the convention. I am aware that the ILO's committee of experts has attributed this effect to a paragraph of the convention which requires successive reports to address any developments in the exclusion set out in the first report. But there is nothing in the debates or preparatory papers for this convention to support such an interpretation, which would frustrate the whole provision to deal with new problems as they arise. As a matter of commonsense, it clearly cannot be the interpretation which you put upon it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition should acknowledge that they too expanded the exclusions under their laws as the effect of their laws became clearer. You say that we are in breach, and the example you give is an example you yourselves followed when you were in office. The fact is that it ill behoves the opposition to say that all exclusions should have been in place within the first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition when in government ratified the convention in great haste before an election. They ratified the convention at a time when Australian law and practice did not meet the required standard, which is in breach of the normal approach to ratification of ILO 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7129"> conventions. They brought in their unfair dismissal laws little realising the impact that they would have, and small business is still trying to recover from the impact of the Brereton unfair dismissal laws because the previous government did not realise how much exclusions like the government's small business exclusion were in fact needed. That is the fact of it. This has been the greatest fiasco of industrial relations law in living memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And now, as we try to fix the thing up to try and provide some balance in the system for the interests of both employers and employees, and for the interests of the unemployed, you are attempting to prevent us from introducing a solution when you were in fact the cause of the problem in the first place. It is quite incredible. I call on every small business person in the country to write to the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), with a copy to the member for Gellibrand, and just say that it is time that the Labor Party supported a fair deal for the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if employees are just being abandoned, which is the presentation that we had from the shadow minister in his speech at the second reading stage. Employees will still be protected under the Workplace Relations Act from day one. That is the law. Section 170CK will still protect employees against dismissal because of any discriminatory reason, including age, sex, pregnancy and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sections 170MU and 170WE will prohibit dismissal of an employee because the employee engages in protected industrial action, is seeking a certified agreement or AWA or is engaged in industrial action. Section 298K, in the freedom of association part of the act, prohibits dismissal which involves victimisation or is otherwise contrary to freedom of association. They are available to people from the day that they are employed. So it is quite wrong for you to suggest that people are&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us see you publicly acknowledge it in a much more forceful way than you have bothered so far to do. We know the Labor Party. Its substitute for good policy is a good scare campaign. It is the same with workplace relations, tax reform, tariffs and all the other things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 170CM prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age, or pay in lieu except in cases of serious misconduct. The exemption in respect of this bill also does not affect the rights of apprentices in small businesses, who have a particular need for protection. The exemption, as I said earlier, applies only to businesses employing 15 or fewer employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were not facts readily admitted by many of the speakers on the other side. They are not readily admitted because as people understand what the government is proposing I think most people concede that it is fair and reasonable, consistent with good international practice and would provide a real boost to the small business community. It is a sad reflection on the Labor opposition that, when it comes to the small business community, so often it opposes sensible measures to provide them with a break. On the capital gains tax, in regard to the rollover relief for small businesses where they are selling one business and going into another business, you tried to pare back the value of that benefit. We need the small business community. We need them to be able to thrive and prosper. You should not have a policy which is aimed at cutting back benefits to the small business community at every opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then there was the fiasco that you gave us this week. The capital gains tax rollover relief went through the Senate in June and came into operation on 15 July. We followed it up with further legislation to provide capital gains tax rollover relief for those people in small business and retiring with the transfer of those funds into superannuation funds. You 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7130"> gave us a different set of formula for calculating those who would qualify than we had for the rollover relief, which means that from opposition you are loading up the small business community with red tape. It is unbelievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 13 years no-one gave the small business community more red tape than the Labor Party. Even in opposition you are still doing it. We are trying to remove red tape, we are trying to remove unfair tax liabilities on the small business community, we are trying to put a bit of incentive back into the system, and from your political graveyard in opposition we get this flicker of muscular response from you in the Senate which imposes yet another burden on the small business community by requiring small business to calculate the value of their personal assets. So they have to get the valuers in on the family car and all their personal assets or whatever it might be simply to give you an opportunity to squeeze back a reasonable benefit which the government is attempting to provide in its reforms to the capital gains tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So by all measures this is a very fair and reasonable measure to the benefit of the small business community. We tried to get it in last year. We were unable to do so. We tried to get a compromise through the Senate by way of regulation. That was knocked back. We now introduce this bill. The Labor Party must be severely embarrassed by having the member for Kalgoorlie, a former Labor member, standing up and saying that it is about time that the small business community got some reasonable benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the shadow minister for small business, did say something about this bill or the regulation before it was knocked off in the Senate to the effect that it would not be good politics for the Labor Party to oppose this. He was quite right to give you that warning. It is a pity you did not take that warning because this sends a very clear message about your attitude to the small business community. You are not prepared to lift a finger for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to you in all fairness and without too much political rhetoric that I honestly cannot understand why you are so opposed to this. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> really can't. If vulnerable people were so dreadfully exposed, if it were such a bad deal for them, maybe I could understand what you are on about. But, given the other protections available to people and given that it falls within the bounds of conventional practice within the international community, then I for the life of me cannot understand why you cannot provide this benefit to the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You need to at least recognise that you wrought a hell of a lot of damage on the small business community with the unfair dismissal law. You set up a culture where employees took the view that, regardless of what the circumstances were when they got the sack, they were entitled to go down and write a letter of demand to their employer, and they would reckon that they would in most cases get $5,000 or $6,000 regardless of the circumstances because the employer would turn up to the local solicitor and the local solicitor would say: `The average costs are $8,000. They have got you over a barrel. You could go before the commission but, given some of the decisions coming out of the process, the chances are that you are going to go down. You would be better, therefore, just to settle.' It was really a form of blackmail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message under the Brereton unfair dismissal scheme to small business was: `Do not employ somebody because, if you do, you could be badly treated, unfairly treated, and just to add insult to injury you will have to spend a couple of days down there in the commission or tribunal fighting for the survival of your business and have to close the doors of your business while you do so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very fair, reasonable and balanced measure. Sure, it provides some greater benefit to the small business community&mdash;we think it should do so&mdash;but it does so in a way which is also fair to employees. For that reason, I commend the bill to the House. I am disappointed at the partisan political approach taken by the opposition to it. I think they will rue the day politically, but I look forward to the bill's passage through the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise one particular matter concerning the clauses of this workplace relations legislation and some comments made in support of the legislation by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), comments which made an interpretation of the legislation that I think is incorrect. I want to seek some clarification from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) about that and then, if that is incorrect, seek his rationale for the relevant provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern relates to the fact that the bill makes explicit exclusion, from the exclusion, of apprentices. I welcome that. If there is going to be a provision, better that it excludes apprentices than not; though I wish it did not exist at all. It is not that I query that; I just want to raise two things about it. If I heard the member for Murray correctly, she said that apprentices could be excluded because the existing provisions in the legislation did not apply to them because they were employed under a fixed term of employment. While, technically, I could imagine that might be an interpretation you could make, the case law, as I understand it, does not confirm that; and I think that is not correct.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7132">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like the minister to consider is: if that is not the correct explanation of the exclusion&mdash;and I assume it is not&mdash;what is the rationale for distinguishing between apprentices, trainees and other young people who might all be employed by the same employer on the same day and be subject to the same dismissal processes and, yet, one has protection and the other two do not because of their different categories of employment? Their age may be identical, their period of employment may be identical, their relationship to the employer may be identical, their behaviour and the employer's response may be identical, but one young person would have a right of appeal by virtue of their status as an apprentice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We welcome their having that right of appeal. We think they should have that right of appeal. The assurance that the minister gave before the election, that you would have a right of appeal if you were unfairly dismissed, should be implemented for all employees, not just for apprentices in these circumstances. What is the rationale for that distinction? Why is it that there is one group of young Australians to whom these provisions will continue to apply and, yet, will not apply to all those others? I would very much appreciate the minister's explanation of that. On the face of it, it seems like an anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Murray was quite ingenious in thinking of that explanation, but I do not think she is correct, if my understanding of the law&mdash;not this particular act, but the law as it relates to apprentices and that subclause of the act concerning fixed terms which was in the previous legislation as well&mdash;is correct. If that is not the explanation, why has that distinction been made between apprentices and other young people? It seems to me, on the face of it, simply to be acknowledging our argument that people should have a right to appeal against harsh, unreasonable and unjust dismissals but recognising it only with regard to one particular and small subgroup of young Australians rather than all Australians who ought to have the same benefits. I would be very interested in the minister's response to the member for Murray's ingenious interpretation of the provision and, if she is not correct, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his rationale for what is otherwise an irrational and unreasonable distinction.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am expertly advised that the interpretation of the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), with all due respect to her, would not be fully supported by the legal advice that I have available to me. The reason I say that is that there is a diversity of contractual arrangements that apprentices around Australia enter into, and you need to look at the specificity of each and every one of those arrangements to see the worth of her comment.

Apprentices take on apprenticeships with the purpose of acquiring certain skills over a period of time, and to have that arrangement upset midway by the actions of the employers we do not think is reasonable. Therefore, we thought the exclusion was a fair thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this discussion on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , it is very easy to use the umbrella term `small business' without recognising that 48 per cent of small businesses do not employ anybody. They are not employers. I hear it used again and again, and the great misconception under which the government deludes itself is that the obstacle 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7133"> to employment growth in this country is the existence of fair and reasonable employee protection law; law that is there to ensure that employees&mdash;many of whom are young, inexperienced and utterly incapable of standing up for themselves and putting a case to their employer&mdash;are not harshly treated, unfairly dismissed or lose the protection they have should the passage of this bill proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the number of small businesses, we see that there were some 785,800 small businesses on the register at the end of 1994&hyphen;95, of which 427,600 did not employ anybody. They are not employers. A further 315,300 employed between one and nine employees and 37,700 employed between 10 and 19 people. In the manufacturing sector&mdash;where any business employing fewer than 100 people is classed as small business&mdash;there were 5,200 small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at those figures, you need to first look at the analysis of small business and the trades and what businesses those people are in. It is fascinating to look at the areas of retail and accommodation. In retail, there were 134,700 businesses at the end of 1994&hyphen;95 and in accommodation, cafes and restaurants there were 25,400. If you relate that back and say, `Where are the problems in small business?', small business's biggest problem is a flattened economy&mdash;a lack of growth. They want demand; that is where the jobs are going to come from. And they are seeing tens of thousands of federal employees being sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great problem for small business is a total lack of security. There is a massive feeling of insecurity right across small business, and that is why they want to see a fair go and they want to see the fair trading report recommendations implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the composition of small business and relate that back to where the problems are, you see that in the year 1996&hyphen;97 there were 504,567 award inquiries. That is 2,018 award inquiries&mdash;people ringing up and seeking information about their award entitlements&mdash;every working day of the year. That number is a 64 per cent increase on the previous year, and all of the year 1996&hyphen;97 was within the span of this government. Since 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this government came to office, there has been a 64 per cent increase in the number of inquiries made by people about their award entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at award breaches, you see the industries in which these award breaches are occurring. In New South Wales, 19.6 per cent were in the motor vehicle industry and 10.6 per cent were in hospitality. The top of the hit parade in Queensland were the same two industries, the top of the hit parade in the Northern Territory was the retail industry and the top of the hit parade in Tasmania were the hospitality industry and the motor vehicle industry. In Victoria and South Australia it is again the motor vehicle industry. So the breaches are being detected in the same areas where the mass of complaints are occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes a complete mockery of what the government is talking about and trying to pursue in this legislation. They labour under the myth that people in small business are not employing more people because of the existence of this employee protection legislation. If we look at the rate of unfair dismissal applications, in the first five months of 1997 they were down by an average of 122&mdash;less than half what they were in the comparable period of the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the problem. The problem is lack of demand, lack of confidence and policies from this government that are utterly depressing business and undermining confidence. The legislation that exists is there to protect employees from harsh, unfair and unjust treatment. That is why the mass of small business out there that employs people is not concerned with this legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no way in which the government can rationalise its attitude on this question. This is appalling policy. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said that we can argue on the logic of this question. We are not arguing on the logic of whether or not apprentices should be excluded from the provisions of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . What we are concerned about is the morality of this legislation. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7134">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is recognition in this government's own legislation that some people can be dismissed as a result of harsh, unreasonable or unjust arrangements. As far as small business is concerned, they say that if you are an apprentice, you will be protected against harsh, unreasonable or unjust dismissal. They recognise that it exists and yet they say: `It applies to all other employees.' But to those of small business, they say, `Not to you.' Let us make no mistake about it. That is what they are saying to all of those people who become employed in small business, which is defined as any business with fewer than 15 employees, and there are probably about a million of them in Australia. The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) indicates that there are about two million employees in businesses in Australia which employ 15 or fewer employees. So we are not talking about something which is peripheral; we are talking about the biggest single complement of businesses that operate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the government recognises that there can be harsh, unreasonable and unjust circumstances surrounding the dismissal of employees. But if you are in small business: stiff luck&mdash;unless you are an apprentice. Of course, we endorse the exclusion of apprentices. We would endorse even more fulsomely the exclusion of all employees in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why the government would have adopted this measure simply defies imagination. There has not been one person on the government side, including the minister himself, who has set out to justify this particular provision, because it cannot be justified. I heard the debate through. Members on the government side got up and criticised the unfair dismissal arrangements which we had. People got up and criticised the general arrangements that might be in place for employees to appeal against the circumstances in which they were dismissed. But not one person made out a case for why employees in small business should not be afforded this protection. There is a discriminating immorality involved in these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They cannot justify the removal of protection of employees who are dismissed in a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> harsh, unreasonable or unjust way. But they have said this will encourage employment in small business. When the employee number in a small business is approaching 15, after which they will no longer be covered by this amended provision, the question is whether or not those small businesses will continue to employee additional employees. The answer, quite clearly, is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has also been made that the number of unfair dismissal appeals has fallen dramatically. So, in terms of the incidence of these appeals, this amendment is not necessary. In terms of the morality of this situation, this amendment is not necessary. People employed by small businesses are just as entitled to the protection of the law, to the protection of their dignity, to the security of their employment and to protection against harsh, unreasonable and unjust dismissal as any other employee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think everyone realises that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and many members on the other side are engaging in absolute obfuscation in trying to suggest that, by removing the right to protection against harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal, workers in small businesses with fewer than 15 employees will be adequately covered. We all know that the situations in which they will be covered are extremely limited, related to areas like discrimination and notice, and that in many situations related to harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal they will have no protection at all. That is the reality; the minister knows it. Let us stop mucking around and pretending that there is no change in their situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the minister's comments go about standard practice at the international level, I do not think it is standard practice at the international level to have exemptions of the degree of fewer than 15 employees. There are a number of countries, as he said, which have some exemptions. The ones for which details are available to me include Germany, Austria and the Republic of Korea, which has exemptions for fewer than four employees, and Sri Lanka. The only one that I could find that had anything like the proposal that is here in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7135"> legislation of fewer than 15 employees was Sri Lanka.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REITH" NAMEID="WI4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So now we are to have Sri Lankan labour standards. That is what you are giving us: the same rights and the same coverage in relation to small business as they have in Sri Lanka. What is your next burst? Are you going to give us a Sri Lankan 48&hyphen;hour week or two weeks annual leave like in Sri Lanka or the Sri Lankan $60 a month minimum wage?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you go down the deregulation path and you are unsuccessful, and you believe you must do more deregulation and you are unsuccessful, and you must do more, you simply unwind all of the protections that have been built up for Australian workers over the years and the decades. That is the path this government is on. You start to take us back to the kinds of minimal protections that exist in many of our Asian neighbour countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also says that his actions are consistent with our international obligations. As I said in my speech at the second reading stage&mdash;and I do not have time to repeat the details here&mdash;that is simply not true. He said it at the Press Club; he has been saying it all over the place. It is not true. The committee of experts, whom he dismisses as a bunch of nincompoops who do not know what they are talking about, presumably do know a little about this subject. They are the international experts on the convention. They did a report on the protection against unjustified dismissal in 1995. What they said in that report was, in paragraph 73:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A member State which ratifies the Convention has to list in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">first report</EMPHASIS>  (to the ILO) submitted after ratification the categories of workers which may have been excluded in pursuance of paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 2 . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the area on which this government is relying for support for this legislation: the exemption given in paragraph 5 for size of undertaking. The report goes on to say, in paragraph 74:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 2(6) allows governments to take account of future developments towards a reduction of the exclusions referred to in the first report, but it does 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not allow them subsequently to introduce new exceptions that were not in force at the time of the first report.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It could not be clearer. They are saying absolutely that once you have the first report&mdash;and that was given in September of 1995&mdash;there is no entitlement to bring in extra exclusions. But that is what this government is doing with this legislation. It is totally against the international convention. In fact, so was the Workplace Relations Act which came in at the end of last year. The exclusions that are in that are against the convention as well. You have no entitlement under the convention to do either. You must know that. Your department must know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are trying to bluff the people of Australia. You do not give a damn about the international conventions or the ILO. You just want to trample over all of that to satisfy your small business clientele. You tell the people of Australia that this is all about creating employment. It will do nothing for employment. What it will do is cause great concern and hardship to a lot of employees of small businesses in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we are having a half&hyphen;hour debate, I thought I might respond to some of these rather more extreme things that the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has been saying. The only government, to my knowledge, that has been close to being in breach of the ILO in recent years was the government of which you were a member.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You wonder about the 15 employees. You say, `Show me on the industrial landscape where somebody has set a limit of 15 or defined a cut-off point at 15.' You have found yourself in Sri Lanka with the example you have. You do not have to take yet another trip. You do not have to go to Bordeaux, Sri Lanka or anywhere. You have only to look through the decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission here in Australia to find some authority for the setting of 15 as the definition of small business. That is what we did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not arbitrarily say that 15 is a number that we just happen to like. We said, `Well, what independent authority would give us a steer on what would be a fair figure for setting this limit?' So we went to the reports and decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;and I presume you are great supporters of the Industrial Relations Commission; you are always telling us about it&mdash;and in the TCR case they set that figure. You cannot just have some criticism of it on the basis that it has no sort of independent authority to it. It is not the same matter, but it was about redundancy protection for employees. The commission said 15, so we said 15. That is pretty reasonable. That is what we have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other points. I made a note about discriminating immorality. But the discrimination seems to me to be discrimination against the small business community, which we are simply trying to put right. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do so in the interests, sure, of small business&mdash;we make no apology for being supporters of small business&mdash;but we want to do so in a way which is fair also to employees and to people who are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are choices. The member for Gellibrand says, `Oh, the government should not say that they are not making any changes.' Of course we are making a change. We are providing an exemption. That means that some people would not have access to the remedy that they have today. I say that to you; of course that is true. But we say that that is a fair balance to be made in the interests of employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor was in office the level of unemployment in Australia averaged 8.7 per cent. That is what it is today, and you say it is a crisis. We say, `Well, if it is a crisis, we think it certainly is important that something be done about it.' There are a whole series of measures to be done about it. The shame of it is that you say it is a problem, but then you oppose every sensible measure to fix it. So, when it comes to discriminating immorality, that is what we inherited from you. That is why we think this is a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, this is about new employees, federal and state. I do not know where you get your two million figure from. It is in respect of new employees. So your scare campaign against people who have a job today is nothing else but a scare campaign.</PARA></SPEECH>

As to the answer to your rather pathetic question, the numbers may be different for a disallowance motion as compared to a bill. So why did we reintroduce the bill? The reason is simple: we think this is a good measure. You knocked off what was basically from my point of view a compromise. We put that up because I honestly thought that you would support it or maybe the Democrats would support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were not involved in the negotiations, but my assessment was that, if we put up a regulation with a 12-month probation period, we would have a reasonably good chance of getting it through. A 12-month probation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7138"> period is not an unreasonable proposition. One of the improvements of the legislation is that we set three months as a probation period. If you take somebody on and you say, `This is subject to probation during your first three months,' then you are excluded or exempted from the unfair dismissal law. That is better than the old system because it was not clear what the probation period would be under the old system. So we have improved that and made it more practical for business. In the regulation that we introduced, basically we went for a compromise. The amazing thing was that you knocked off the compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is still our view that there should be an exemption for small business. Obviously when you knocked off the disallowance, we would produce the bill. It was just the timing of when the speech was given to what happened in the Senate that affected whether or not I used those words. Apparently the thing was lodged and something happened in the Senate or the timing changed in the House of Representatives and we changed it before I actually gave the speech. That is why I have told you that it is not actually right.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and many of his colleagues spoke in the second reading debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill about the importance of this as a measure to generate jobs and to encourage people to employ more unemployed Australians.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7139"> ed it several times, then you say it more loudly. But it does not change the fact that there is no evidence that anybody can find in the requests that I have made which suggests that small business has employed more people in 1997 than it did, for example, in 1995. For all the sound and fury about the previous laws, and without commenting, for the purpose of this discussion, on the merits, we did have a great deal of debate about unfair dismissal. A lot of people were concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether they were good or bad, it does not matter; I am saying that there was widespread concern and a lot of debate when the debate was at its height. I am not discussing the merits of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1997 we are operating with a set of laws which this minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have said has swept away the previous problem. They said that they have been consigned to history and that we now have a new fair go all round system. You would have believed that there was a suppressed enthusiasm to employ just waiting to burst forth as soon as the unfair dismissal laws were removed. Yet the evidence is to the contrary. For example, the evidence is that employment growth in 1997 has been less than employment growth in the preceding years, particularly in that most controversial of years&mdash;1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assertion is made with consistency&mdash;you would have to give it that as a virtue&mdash;but without evidence. I hate to be boringly empirical, but from time to time I like to ask what are the facts. I understand it is a very unusual question to ask in this place, and I do not wish to create an unfortunate precedent. It must be a flaw in my upbringing, but I have a consistent desire to do this. And the facts do not substantiate the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This piece of legislation is not about creating jobs. It is about creating an excuse for not creating jobs. The question the member for Banks (Mr Melham) raised&mdash;irrespective of whose version of the speech was properly distributed&mdash;was true about the arithmetic of the Senate. It is quite clear that the minister knows this legislation is not going to pass in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Senate. It is not illegal to raise legislation that has to be passed in the Senate. But it is known that this is not going to become the law. Therefore, what we are going to have is an attempt to create a smokescreen to say, `We would have solved the problem of unemployment if only we could have got rid of this unfair dismissal law as applies to small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair to say that any fair&hyphen;minded member of this House, or any fair&hyphen;minded member of the community, would say that it is appropriate to have a fair go all round in an employment relationship. I want to quote from subsection 170CA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the manner of deciding on and working out such remedies, are intended to ensure that, in the consideration of an application in respect of a termination of employment, a "fair go all round" is accorded to both the employer and employee concerned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is only appropriate. The bill itself refers to the famous case of Lotty and Holloway, which has become well known in unfair dismissal cases. It seems to me that you would remove the concept of a fair go all round only in very exceptional circumstances. It is a fundamental right that, before anyone receives a penalty or is disadvantaged, they should be given the right to present their case in their own defence. By removing the concept of a fair go all round, the employer will not be required to give reasons, nor will he be required to hear the worker in their own defence. As I have said, you would remove that fundamental right only in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only circumstance which the government has referred to as justifying removing that fundamental right is the phenomenon of `unfair dismissal anxiety' existing on the part of some employers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, certainly. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the minister: why are the subsection 170CC provisions inadequate to overcome this unfair dismissal anxiety? The minister has referred to the probationary period. One alternative for a small business proprietor who has this unfair dismissal anxiety is to put someone on on a casual basis. The other option, which is very simple and which any half&hyphen;decent lawyer would do, is to say, `We will put the person on for a 12&hyphen;month fixed&hyphen;term period.' Those safeguards already are there to dispel this unfair dismissal anxiety. So, having quelled the reason for anxiety, there is absolutely no need to take away this fundamental human right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue which is a real problem is that, in taking away this fundamental human right to a fair go all round, the remaining provisions of the act&mdash;which are not intended to be removed&mdash;are made unworkable. Those are the unlawful termination provisions. Those provisions apply if, for instance, someone has been sacked because they are of a particular racial background or because they have a disadvantage or for those sorts of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will those provisions be enforceable on the part of a worker, if the employer does not have to give the worker any reason for dismissing him? If the worker suspects he is being sacked unlawfully, all the employer has to say in a case is, `I did not sack you unlawfully; I sacked you unfairly. And, because I sacked you unfairly and you are in your first 12 months, you do not have a remedy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That necessarily has to be the case if the employer is not required to give reasons for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dismissal nor to give the worker an opportunity to have an input into the reasons why he is being dismissed. It has to be the case that the workers are effectively going to be shut out of not only the unfair dismissal remedy but also the unlawful dismissal remedy, merely because of the fact that the employer is not going to be required to give reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things have not been thought through, and nor has the fact that, as in the old days of the Ranger uranium mine line of cases, that complicated situation still prevails where unionists have remedies but non&hyphen;unionists do not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member said that people's concerns could be allayed by putting people on fixed term contracts. That is true. In some cases, employers will do that. But it will not suit employers in every case to have such arrangements&mdash;for commercial reasons or because of their workload arrangements or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also said that you could put people on as casuals. That is true as well. That has happened. There has been a lot of employment characterised as casual employment. In fact we have seen a great growth in casual employment, and the reason people have been put on as casuals&mdash;as opposed to being employed on a permanent part&hyphen;time basis&mdash;is that permanent part&hyphen;timers have access to the unfair dismissal laws and casuals do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some people, it suits them to be employed on a casual basis. I am neutral: if you want to be a casual and it suits you, that is fine and, if you want to be a permanent part&hyphen;time employee, that is fine as well. It is a matter of your choice. But the problem we have had is that a lot of businesses have forced people into casual employment, only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7141"> offered casual employment, because they were absolutely frightened out of their wits about the prospect of an unreasonable unfair dismissal claim being lodged against them. I will tell you who has suffered as a result of that: mainly women who wanted less than full&hyphen;time employment so that they could balance their work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a classic thing for you to say, `You can fix this problem by hiring people as casuals.' That denies a huge number of people in the work force the opportunity to have permanent part&hyphen;time work. And permanent part&hyphen;time work is important because that way you can have regular hours. If you have to pick up the kids from school, it is no good being a casual worker, because you do not know whether you are going to be working or not. The chances are you might be required to work. I thank you for saying this, because it exposes exactly what has been the problem. You have forced a whole lot of people out of the option of permanent part&hyphen;time work, which gives them regularity and the chance to better balance their work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You people have been saying, `We should have a system where people can better balance their work and family responsibilities', but condemned out of your own mouth is your own cure&mdash;forcing people to be casual&mdash;to the problem you created. That cure is very unfair mainly to women at the moment but in future it is also going to be very unfair to men. They are going to have more responsibilities for looking after families and are going to want to work less than full&hyphen;time. They should have those opportunities available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about part&hyphen;time work is that it allows you to get pro rata conditions. People with work and family responsibilities might want annual leave and whatever carer's leave is available on a pro rata basis, because they need to look after their dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you say totally highlights what you did in government: that is, by the inadequacies and total unfairness of your unfair dismissal law, you forced a lot of people into casual employment. That denied them a solution to one of the great social needs of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our time&mdash;the possibility of being able to work less than full&hyphen;time and being able to better balance their work and family responsibilities. You condemn yourself out of your very own mouth. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

Sir William made a very important contribution about the importance of seeing the opposition to racism in a broader context of civil liberties in Australia. We were addressed by a former member of this House, the former Attorney&hyphen;General Michael Lavarch, and by a number of distinguished representatives from community groups and the media. Lobbyists gave advice. The representatives attending that forum then divided into a series of workshops and developed important strategies and proposals that will be considered by their various organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the privilege of making the closing remarks at the forum. I want to refer to one particular aspect that is of great importance to the people of the ACT&mdash;I referred to it in my concluding remarks&mdash;because, ironically, we are facing the potential that the ACT elections in February next year will be the first electoral test for the Pauline Hanson One Nation Party. They have said that they will run candidates in this election. It may, therefore, be the first time they are put to the test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This forum was addressed by the Chief Minister, Kate Carnell, and was attended by the new Leader of the Opposition, Wayne Berry, and people from the Greens Party and from all the other organisations that I am aware of that are likely to be contesting, and represented in, the ACT assembly. Recognising that, I put to that forum and I want to put to this House, and through it the people of Canberra, that this would be an excellent first time, first example, for everybody contesting this election to say, `We recommend that you put the One Nation Party last.' Everybody should do it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I often speak in this House about Townsville city. But it should not be forgotten that Townsville is in fact a twin city: there are two city councils in Townsville. The one that I do not often speak about is Thuringowa City Council, and I would like to speak about Thuringowa tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thuringowa was created as a local authority back in October 1879, at a time when the north was being opened up by pastoralists and miners. Ports were needed to service this growing interest in the north and in 1864 the small port settlement of Townsville was established at the mouth of the Ross River. The area immediately surrounding Townsville began attracting graziers and farmers with an eye to the future potential of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1879 the Queensland government passed an `Act to provide for a local government outside the boundaries of municipalities', and on 2 October of that year the Thuringowa divisional board was created. The first board members were elected at a public meeting in January 1880, and nine members were presented with the task of catering to the needs of a sparse and widespread population occupying 7,612 square kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thuringowa, despite being seen by some as merely a rural authority, was prominent in the establishment of a railway link to the gold mining centre of Charters Towers and also played a key role in the construction of a railway line to the sugar town of Ayr. Thuringowa, incidentally, also had the first airport for Townsville. Thuringowa is also the source of water for the adjacent city of Townsville, and in 1897 the Thuringowa water board was established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five years later in 1902 Thuringowa became a shire and remained so until 1 January 1986, when it was raised to city status. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> push for city status began in 1985, when Thuringowa was in the throes of a major building boom, and the population more than doubled over a five&hyphen;year period. The council of the day believed much could be achieved in its dealings with government departments and private enterprise if it could speak with the authority of a city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1986 Thuringowa has undergone a major transformation, more than doubling in population in 10 years, and attracting a wide cross&hyphen;section of business and industry. l believe Thuringowa's growth since 1986 would be the envy of many more established cities. For instance, since 1986 the Thuringowa City Council has dealt with more than 31,000 building applications, including 8,262 for homes and 325 commercial applications, with a total value of nearly a billion dollars. It is worthy of notice that a significant number of homes built in recent years have been for the benefit of defence personnel posted north to serve in Australia's largest army barracks, 3rd Brigade's at Lavarack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The undoubted jewel in the industrial-commercial crown of the city is its enterprise centre. That centre was officially opened in late 1995 and yet now, only 20 months later, the council has added a second stage and has called tenders for the construction of a third stage. The enterprise centre was established to give small businesses&mdash;those in homes and backyards&mdash;an opportunity to embrace better business practices with the assistance of experienced centre managers, and to expand their operations to a stage where they can ultimately relocate to premises of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thuringowa today has an estimated population of 47,000, of which more than 9,000 attend the city's 23 preschools, primary and secondary schools. Thuringowa is also home to the giant Queensland nickel refinery, which in the past financial year treated 3.2 million wet tonnes of ore to produce 25,180 tonnes of nickel and 1,482 tonnes of cobalt. Australian Granites, yet another success story in Thuringowa, mines granites in western Queensland and cuts and polishes granites in a multimillion dollar factory, for a widening domestic market and a growing overseas market, especially in South-East Asia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7144">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These major enterprises play their part in the economy of this country because they contribute significantly to this country's exports and, of equal importance, they generate long&hyphen;term employment. Speaking of employment, it is of interest to know that, according to the 21 July edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Queensland</EMPHASIS>, anyone who is keen to set up in business and wants to know where people have the highest disposable income in Queensland should note that Thuringowa is second on the list behind Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of followers of rugby league, Thuringowa also lays claim to being the home of the North Queensland Cowboys. Stockland Stadium, the Cowboys' home ground, can seat 31,000 fans and is suitable for a variety of other sporting uses. Thuringowa is not just about bricks and mortar and progress; the city prides itself on being a city of families. Certainly the Thuringowa City Council is closely attuned to the needs and concerns of residents. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7144"><TITLE>Nursing Homes and Hostels</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The owners and operators of private nursing homes and hostels for the aged frequently have to put up with a great deal of nonsense in their dealings with standards monitoring team personnel. It seems that sometimes, but nevertheless all too often, individuals from the teams have to justify the time spent looking into the operations of a nursing home or hostel by finding fault where none really exists. We have become almost inured to Australian Taxation Office audit inspectors behaving in this way, but the thinking seems to have permeated at least some of those in the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take one case related to me recently. A new patient was admitted to a private nursing home and, on admission from a general hospital, was found to have scabies. We can only guess why her condition was not picked up and treatment for the condition commenced while she was still in hospital. As it turned out, the admitting nurse did not know about the scabies, and it was discovered immediately as a consequence of the home's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> routine procedures when any new resident is committed to its care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After discussion with the new resident, treatment for scabies was administered, as might reasonably have been expected&mdash;a matter of course, we might think. But it is not. There is no way that trained nursing staff can just go ahead and treat a case of highly infectious scabies before it spreads to other residents or staff. There are bureaucratic procedures that must be observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this comes to light as a result of a standards monitoring team having been told that the case of scabies had been found in the nursing home concerned. An anonymous tip-off, no less, had brought it to the department's attention. Telephone contact with the nursing home ensued and a visit by an inspector arranged. Part of the interview by the inspector with the senior nursing sister in the presence of the proprietor was concerned with the infected resident's right to freely choose treatment for the disease&mdash;`Was the resident cum patient consulted?' Yes, apparently she was.  Sister told the inspector that, after discussion, the patient was&mdash;in the vernacular&mdash;`talked into it'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the antennae of the inspector activated automatically. To be talked into something must have involved denial of the resident's right to freely choose to have or not have treatment. On it being explained that, in every day conversation, `to be talked into' something more often than not means to be persuaded by sweet reason to accept good advice, the inspector was still relatively unmoved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember that this episode did not arise because of any complaint before or after treatment by the resident or her family. There had been a tip-off to the department by a person or persons unknown to the nursing home management. The potential for idle mischief&hyphen;making should be apparent. But more important is that the nursing home nevertheless received a black mark on its record, plus all the time&hyphen; and cost-consuming inconvenience, because of some bureaucratically perceived violation of an infected person's right to choose not to be treated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7145">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems the rights of other residents and staff to remain uninfected were of only secondary importance. Least important from this example is a need for commonsense. Let it also be understood that, only a couple of months earlier, the nursing home had been audited by a standards monitoring team and been scored 31 out of a possible 31 for its entire operations&mdash;a rare mark indeed.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7145"><TITLE>Paedophiles</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It pleases me to be able to speak tonight about a matter which is very close to my heart. For many years now I have been campaigning for tougher penalties to be imposed on paedophiles. The damage that these criminals do to young children cannot be overestimated. I have seen and heard of many terrible stories about children who are left scarred for life as a result of being preyed upon by a paedophile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government recognises the importance of this issue and has announced that it will step up the fight against paedophilia through a new national strategy. On behalf of my constituents of Makin, I wish to thank the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) for her announcement of the soon to be established National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse. The minister has shown great understanding of this issue in making such an announcement. I have long argued for the establishment of a national approach to combat paedophilia, and I am pleased that this will finally come about, thanks to Minister Moylan and the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a sure sign that this government is to get tough on paedophiles, the minister has already announced that the federal government will be closing any loopholes through which paedophiles may escape or continue to prey upon children. The government will introduce legislation to ensure that a protective order issued in one state will have effect in other states. This will provide greater safety for a child should he or she be moved to another state. A register of convicted paedophiles will also be established to assist police and the community in the fight against this horrendous crime.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding that the first task of the National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse will be to examine the recommendations of the Wood report into paedophilia in New South Wales. Justice James Wood has recently released this report after extensive investigation of the issue during Australia's first royal commission into paedophilia. The report highlights the need for national action, as does the recently released report by the Queensland Commissioner for Children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wood report identified the actions of paedophile groups that abused children and used the Internet to communicate. The community has a right to expect action to be taken to stop the insidious actions of paedophile networks, and this government is committed to providing that action, in conjunction with the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One recommendation in the Wood report that does concern me is in relation to the lowering of the age of consent for homosexual sex. If adopted, this would allow homosexual sex with young people as young as 16 years of age. This raises the question as to whether a paedophile could claim consenting homosexual sex with a 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old and use the defence that he or she thought the young person was really 16 years of age. I am deeply concerned by this recommendation and call for its outright rejection by all members of this House and the general public. I believe that it is wrong to be recommending a reduction in the age of consent for homosexual sex, which would provide an avenue for paedophiles to avoid justice, in a report which is highlighting the tragedy suffered by the victims of paedophiles and their families. Our aim must be directed towards the identification and prosecution of paedophiles, not providing them with potential avenues for avoiding justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a society, we cannot continue to turn the other cheek and ignore this national problem. It requires, and as from today it will receive, national attention. I commend the announcement by the Minister for Family Services and look forward to the prosecution and conviction of child sexual abusers. Our community will be safer when the paedophiles have

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to draw the federal parliament's attention to the fine work of a local group in my electorate of Isaacs. The persons I speak of are both past and present members of the committee and staff of the Lyrebird Community Centre who have assisted in creating community infrastructure where it never existed before. This tireless and unpaid work is unrecognised by many others in the local community, and tonight I wish to redress that by offering thanks for their fine efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Lyrebird Community Centre had its beginnings in 1989. The budget of the centre at that time was a paltry $7,000. Today the income for the centre is over $240,000, funding being split between state and local governments and cost recovery activities undertaken by the centre. To date the centre has not secured any federal funding, although I expect this to change in the future, and indeed hope it will change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centre's main focus for the provision of services is the Carrum Downs area. Like other outer regions, Carrum Downs began life as a rural hamlet. Since 1978 the population has grown substantially but, sadly, many government provided services have been one step behind. The absence of government was in many ways the germinating seed for these local activists to get together and start this centre. Today the activities provided by this centre mirror those of the TAFE sector and many provided by local, state and federal governments in other parts of the metropolitan area, although of course at a very reduced cost to the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My recent discussions with coordinators Cathie Valentine and Marie Blakey and key committee of management member Peter Hart left me with feelings of both joy and disappointment. The happy feelings related to the extensive range of services provided, which include literacy classes for migrants, moderately costed child care, immunisation for children, cancer support groups and extremely popular computer study courses. Presently the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> centre is discussing with the Salvation Army the introduction of counselling services for youths to be run by the army inside the centre's premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centre enjoys patronage of 2,000 persons per week, which highlights the demand for its services. As well, this patronage reflects the careful way in which each new service is assessed to ensure that it suits the demographics of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned moments ago, I had some sad feelings as I left this centre recently. The centre has a severe capital and recurrent funding shortage which limits its ability to expand service provision. The main hall it operates from is very small, accommodating some 80 persons. This means that changeovers from one activity to another during the day curtail the time the centre is actually delivering services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Numerous approaches for further funding to local and state governments have borne no fruit. The inappropriately named Victorian Government Community Development Fund is awash with money but very little appears to be directed to such worthwhile community facilities as the Lyrebird Community Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More disturbing than the paucity of capital being made available for local infrastructure is the growing trend for federal and state governments to completely abandon some areas of social service. Recently the centre has begun to receive people who have been referred from local DES offices. It has reached the stage whereby some people are so desperate they are asking for food vouchers, something the centre has never experienced previously, and something I expect to continue, sadly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to thank the 70 volunteers who so generously give their time, past and present members of subcommittees, the full-time staff, Cathie Vallentine and Marie Blakey, and the following members of the Committee of Management: Fiona Dannock, Debbie Wothius, Dena Bradley, Swee Dahni, Sue Evans, Peter Hart, Bronwyn Longhouse, Di Oliver, Pete Stuart Jones, Keri Thiele and Dave Withers. The centre revolves around these people. The people of Carrum Downs owe them a debt. On behalf of those

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am, as honourable members know, keenly interested in the health of Australian people in all its aspects. This being so, I wish to advise the House that Hearing Awareness Week takes place this week, that is, between 24 and 30 August. I would like to mention a few activities that are taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When investigating the scale of deafness and hearing impairment which besets this country I was surprised at how many Australians are affected. The Deafness Forum, the peak body on deafness in Australia, advises that between one million and three million Australians have an acquired hearing impairment. That is 10 per cent of the population. In addition, approximately 150,000 people are born deaf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the deafness acquired by people is regarded as having been preventable. This is not good news, but statistics for indigenous communities are far worse. In this section of our population, 60 per cent suffer from hearing loss and associated problems. Indigenous communities lack awareness about hearing problems. At any given time up to 80 per cent of children in indigenous communities in the Gulf, the Cape York Peninsula and Torres Strait island communities are afflicted by chronic ear infections, perforated ear drums and discharging ears. The Menzies School of Health has advised the North Australia Aboriginal Legal Service that it should work on the basis that every client has a hearing loss unless otherwise informed. Also, two out of every 1,000 babies are born deaf due to their mothers being infected with rubella, or German measles. There are between 15,000 and 20,000 deaf people in Australia who use the Australian Sign Language as their primary method of communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mission of the Deafness Forum is to improve the quality of life of Australians who are deaf or who have a hearing impairment or a chronic disorder of the ear. Hearing Awareness Week provides an opportunity to raise community awareness of hearing impairment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and ways of protecting people's hearing. To make the country more aware of the problems of the deaf, the Deafness Forum has organised and will be coordinating Hearing Awareness Week, and this year the theme will be `Immunisation to protect hearing'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the aim is to increase community awareness of the implications of hearing impairment as a result of rubella. Immunisation against rubella can not only prevent a mild childhood disease but also prevent serious abnormalities in babies born to mothers who contract the disease within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. These babies are at risk of being born deaf, blind, with heart defects or even with intellectual disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hearing Awareness Week also provides an opportunity for the 10 per cent of Australians who have a hearing impairment to share their experience and knowledge and help create a greater understanding of their needs and aspirations. Some of the activities for this year by member organisations of the Deafness Forum are: information stalls at local shopping centres, distribution of information about hearing impairment, communication options, techniques as well as information on available support networks, displays of helpful hearing devices, the provision of information on hearing assessment, the conducting of free hearing tests and of lip reading competitions. As you can see, Mr Speaker, there is a lot of activity and assistance being provided for deaf people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is funding aid to the deaf substantially and will outlay a total of $87.5 million this financial year. Of this sum, $67.8 million will be allocated to private sector agencies or to the government run Australian Hearing Service so that patients can purchase hearing services, be these hearing implements or medical treatments. Funds are provided for services carried out directly by the Australian Hearing Service on children and other groups with special needs. This includes funds for services such as replacing speech processor units for children who have cochlear implants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deafness, be it total or partial, is a very debilitating complaint. It cuts off those afflicted from proper communication with fellow human beings. It creates tremendous loneli 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7148"> ness. Not only does it take away a dimension of culture such as music and drama, theatre and comedy; it also robs a person of warning sounds that might signal danger&mdash;sounds, for instance, that give away a running tap, a machine left running or a vehicle approaching, a fire alarm and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the efforts of the Deafness Forum, the Australian Hearing Service and the supporting agencies for the work they are doing for the deaf. I also suggest that members who are interested in this affliction on society take a little time out to associate themselves with Hearing Awareness Week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill adjusts for cost supplementation a range of grants payable under schedule 2 of the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act. It also removes the requirement that at least 10 per cent of students at an educational institution be indigenous for the institution to then be eligible for per capita payments under supplementary recurrent assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supplementary assistance is part of the Commonwealth's indigenous education strategic initiatives program. This has become output rather than input focused, a direction set by the previous government when it announced additional funding for this and other indigenous education programs in response to the 1994 review of Aboriginal education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That announcement by the Labor government in September 1995 also flagged the change to per capita recurrent funding, which was put in place last year. In doing so, however, the coalition government restricted access to such funding by requiring non&hyphen;government schools, preschools and vocational education institutions to have indigenous students make up at least 10 per cent of their total enrolments and also to have a minimum number of indigenous students enrolled. For schools and vocational education institutions, the minimum requirement is 20 indigenous students. For preschools, it is five students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech on last year's bill, which introduced the recurrent arrangements, Dr Kemp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The per capita element of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program will provide an entitlement&hyphen;based, equitable recurrent funding arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet this program has not operated with any great degree of equity. This bill, by removing the 10 per cent requirement, goes some way towards making supplementary recurrent assistance more equitable, but it will not be truly equitable until it does not discriminate between one indigenous student and another. With a year 12 retention rate of 33 per cent and three times the rate of primary school literacy problems as other students, indigenous children face massive problems. Yet under the government's proposal, some 1,100 indigenous students will still be denied access to recurrent assistance under this program. There are children in non&hyphen;systemic schools with fewer than 20 indigenous students enrolled, and these are the students who will be missing out, according to the provisions of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What reason does the government advance for such arbitrary discrimination? They claim administrative difficulties. We are told that in order for the funds to reach these children, some 260 additional agreements would need to be negotiated between the government and the education providers. We are also told that a critical mass of indigenous students is needed for the funds to be effective. Yet the guidelines show that these funds can be spent on any activity aimed at helping indigenous students meet agreed educational targets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7152">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every non&hyphen;systemic school in receipt of Commonwealth funding is required to sign an agreement. Surely, it would not be too difficult to add to that standard agreement, a section which deals with indigenous students and access to supplementary recurrent assistance funding. If the agreements are in place, surely it is not too hard to add a provision that provides access to this program's recurrent funding for the additional 1,100 indigenous students. There can be no sound reason for denying those 1,100 access to this program, when all other indigenous students, in all other parts of the education sector, are eligible for funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely, DEETYA could work with any schools having difficulties using the funds effectively, or put such schools in touch with others which have developed appropriate programs. I find it frustrating, when we are talking about the supreme and extreme educational disadvantage that indigenous Australians face through the school sector, that a so&hyphen;called administrative obstacle has been found for denying access to important program funding for 1,100 Aboriginal students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I intend to move an amendment which will remove the minimum enrolment requirements, along with the 10 per cent rule. This is the only way to avoid anomalies in the distribution and use of these funds and to ensure an equitable treatment under this program for all indigenous students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take this opportunity to say that the government's commitment to improved educational outcomes for indigenous young people looks rather shaky in light of the recent cuts to Abstudy that were announced in the budget just past. Some $38.7 million has been cut away from a program which costs around only $123 million annually to run. I have received correspondence from the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee, the Uniting Church and academics all expressing their outrage and concern at the government's attack on Abstudy and the reduced access to education for indigenous students which is likely to result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Abstudy cuts can be arbitrarily imposed without parliamentary scrutiny. That is what the government is doing. The bill before the House, however, can be changed to produce greater equity and fairness in the management of this program, ensuring that every single indigenous student in Australia is eligible for its funding and benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to support the amendment that I will be moving in the committee stage. I notice that a range of government members have gathered&mdash;two, in particular. They are the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) who would have a substantial number of the 1,100 students excluded under this particular bill before the Main Committee. If they are serious about supporting fair and even access for all Aboriginal students to this program, including all the Aboriginal schools and students in their electorates, they will support the Labor Party amendment. They will support the amendment which basically says, `Indigenous students, as a group, should not be discriminated against.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should not be one set of rules for those who are being made eligible under this bill and another for those 1,100 other students who would be excluded solely because of an alleged administrative obstacle. I maintain it is an obstacle that can be cleared. There is no sound reason why DEETYA cannot provide access to this program to every single indigenous student throughout the schooling sector in Australia. This is a program that should not be available just for some Aboriginal students. It is a program which should be available for all. I urge the government, in addressing the second reading and, ultimately, my amendment, to support the Labor Party in that regard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak in support of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R248">Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . The Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 was aimed at redressing a real difficulty that many educators of indigenous Australians have due to language and cultural barriers. One such educator in my electorate has informed me that, when many of the Torres Strait Islander students start at his college, they test three to four years behind their peers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this goal in mind of getting indigenous Australians off to an equal start in life, the federal government introduced changes to the act in 1997 to improve ways in which funds were to be directed to institutions where they have maximum impact on improving educational outcomes for indigenous students. This involved setting up a minimum percentage of indigenous enrolments at 10 per cent of the school's total, plus setting a minimum number of 20 indigenous students, or five indigenous pre&hyphen;schoolers, enrolled in a school for it to be eligible for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two measures were to ensure that schools with significant indigenous enrolments would be assisted as it is these schools that are likely to focus on their indigenous students through special programs. It became clear, however, that one of these changes&mdash;the setting of a 10 per cent minimum indigenous representation&mdash;in some cases is severely disadvantaging some of the very students whom the government is striving to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 10 per cent requirement has the unforeseen and undesired effect of denying supplementary financial assistance from the Commonwealth to educational institutions with significant indigenous enrolments. The non&hyphen;government school census showed that, out of a total of 10,853 indigenous students enrolled in non&hyphen;government schools, 1,428&mdash;or 13 per cent&mdash;of those students attend non&hyphen;systemic schools in which the indigenous enrolments are less than 10 per cent of the total enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience has shown that the 10 per cent requirement has excluded some of the very deserving institutions from receiving supplementary funding with respect to their indigenous students. A number of schools in my electorate of Leichhardt were adversely affected by the indigenous education strategic initiative program's 10 per cent requirement. While the number of students and educational workers is not numerically great, the impact of those affected would be profound, especially at St Augustine's College and St Monica's College in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">St Augustine's perhaps gives the best example of the need for this amendment bill. So I will focus my remarks on this institution. For 25 years, St Augustine's College in Cairns has actively encouraged indigenous students to enrol and has become Queensland's largest non&hyphen;government provider of education of boys coming from Torres Strait Island communities. In 1997, nearly 10 per cent of all indigenous male students in the non&hyphen;government sector in Queensland attended St Augustine's College.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During these two decades of service to the far northern indigenous community, the college has recorded some notable achievements, especially among Torres Strait Islander students who form the vast majority of their indigenous enrolment. The following are all firsts, certainly state wide and probably nationally for St Augustine's. They had the first Torres Strait Islander in Australia to obtain a medical degree; the first Torres Strait Islander to obtain a commercial pilot's licence; the first Torres Strait Islander to obtain a diplomatic posting overseas; the first Torres Strait Islander to study architecture; and the first Torres Strait Islander to become a national athletics champion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7154">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are certainly great achievements because of the way in which they are able to deal with the special needs of these students. While many of these firsts are impressive, far more so are the many hundreds of past indigenous students who have become teachers, psychologists, social workers, artists, tradespersons, community leaders and other productive members of our society. All of these have come from St Augustine's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, St Augustine's College enrolled between 70 and 85 indigenous students, thus easily meeting the minimum 20 indigenous student enrolment criteria. Because it is such a large school, the percentage of indigenous representation falls below 10 per cent of the college's students. This injustice and inequity, which this amendment will resolve, is highlighted by the fact that another school less than an hour's drive from St Augustine's College with an enrolment of 30 could receive indigenous education strategic initiatives program funding when St Augustine's, with twice the enrolment, is ineligible for any assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since writing to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) on behalf of St Monica's and St Augustine's on 17 February this year, I have been greatly pleased with the degree of consultation that has occurred leading up to this practical amendment. This amendment bill will remove the requirement for at least 10 per cent of enrolled students to be indigenous before a non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic preschool, school or vocational education and training institution can be funded under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program. This will enable institutions where there are significant numbers of indigenous students but where these students represent less than 10 per cent of their total enrolments to qualify for funding under the act, as is the case with St Augustine's in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the requirement of the act that a school must have a set number of indigenous students&mdash;five for preschools and 20 for other institutions&mdash;by retaining these minimum thresholds, the government avoids the situation where its money is spread too far and where a great number of schools receive a very small amount which has no real benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having analysed the implications of removing the minimum enrolment requirement against the cost&hyphen;effectiveness of delivery, the argument against removing the minimum enrolment requirement remained strong. Thus, the amendment leaves in place the requirement for there to be a minimum of 20 students in a non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic vocational education and training institution and for there to be a minimum of five students in a non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic preschool. These limits will avoid the administrative expenses of providing small amounts of money to small numbers of scattered students. It will also provide a situation where there will be little or no benefit for individual students from the provision of small grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take note of what the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said with regard to his intention for the amendment. Initially, I was very much of the same view and argued quite strongly about that. I spoke to a lot of the schools in my area about the possibility of reducing those numbers. While there are some schools with one or two students, they had problems with the small amount of money that we are talking about here on an individual basis. It was impossible for them to set up any specific program that would give a maximum benefit to the students. At least with that limit of 20, there is sufficient funding to get an indigenous specific program in place and to get a very positive outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite happy to talk to you further on that. It was something that I felt was appropriate at the time. But after speaking with the schools, the educators and some of the indigenous communities themselves, they felt that it was probably better that they ensure that the kids 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7155"> go to a school where there is that minimum of 20 children so that they have that greater involvement rather than having one or two children in a school where they are not going to get any benefit from these indigenous specific programs. I am certainly happy to talk to you about that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment will permit the adjustment of grants under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program in line with cost increases for the period up to 30 June 2000. The appropriations for these years are in subsections 13B(4), (5), (6) and (7) of the principal act. Inclusion of a cost supplementation provision in the principal act will bring the program into line with other educational programs. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

They do have some of the difficulties with educational provisions in the electorate. This amendment will also help to address some of those difficulties with one school in particular in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, sections 10D, 10E and 10F of the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act require that at least 10 per cent of the enrolled students be indigenous&mdash;referred to, of course, as the 10 per cent requirement&mdash;before a non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic, pre&hyphen;school, school or non&hyphen;government vocational education and training institution can be funded under the indigenous education strategic initiative program. This program is designed to deliver funding to assist in ensuring the quality of access to educational services and achieving equity of educational participation and enabling equitable and appropriate education outcomes for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 10 per cent requirement, as you have heard from the member for Leichhardt, has become a problem with some educational institutions with substantial indigenous enrolments. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7156"> Some of these schools are ineligible for funding assistance because, whilst they may have large numbers of indigenous students, these students make up less than 10 per cent of that institutions' total enrolment, and the institution is not eligible for that assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum to this bill provides an accurate example of how a non&hyphen;systemic school with 70 indigenous enrolments cannot attract that supplementary recurrent funding because its total enrolment is more than 700 and, therefore, it fails the 10 per cent requirement. This is an example of a government that is trying to put forward legislation that works. When there are difficulties in legislation, we recognise those difficulties, and this amendment is going to address some of those difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, however, does not amend the requirements for there to be a minimum of five indigenous students in a non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic pre&hyphen;school, 20 indigenous students in a non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic school and 20 indigenous students in a non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic VET institution. We heard earlier from the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that he intends to move an amendment which will remove this requirement, and we heard from the member for Leichhardt that he feels this amendment is not necessary. I am sure that there will be further discussions about the likelihood of this amendment being put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These regulations more than adequately avoid the administrative costs that would be involved in providing a small amount of money for one or two students in these schools if these regulations were removed. As well, they would avoid the situation where individual students gain no real benefit from a relatively small grant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have to set the levels at some level. If we set it at 10, would you say that nine was inadequate? If we set it at 20, would you say that 19 was inadequate? There has to be a level of commonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not seem to have any concept about wasting money. What is the point in spending more money on administrative costs to deliver a few dollars to an individual student when the money is not sufficient to put in place a useful, purposeful scheme? So you are going to waste taxpayers' money and government money on administration without providing any real service to the people who need it. I am sure there will be more discussions about the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These important features will, and must, remain in place. If this is done, the minimum 10 per cent requirement is simply not necessary, and that is why the government is moving to remove this 10 per cent requirement. Schedule 1 of this bill will repeal this restrictive and unnecessary regulation. The benefits of these amendments are obvious. They will allow for non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic schools, such as the one to which I have already referred with its 70 indigenous pupils, to qualify for funding assistance where they previously were ineligible because of the 10 per cent requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding recipients will still be required to enter into the funding arrangements with the Commonwealth. There are no additional administrative costs to the Commonwealth, or to the state or territory governments. I think that is an important fact to note. The bill will provide for more effective and fairer funding assistance than that provided under the existing act without negative impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of this bill provides for the adjustment of grants under the indigenous education strategic initiative program in line with the cost increases for the period to 30 June 2000. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7157"> financial impact of this bill is to provide a small increase in the amounts appropriated for the years up to 2000. Commonwealth grants for school programs to the states and territories which are in excess of $14 billion over the period 1997&hyphen;2000 are already subject to cost supplementation. The indigenous education strategic initiative program is not currently supplemented in the same way. The new provisions will maintain the real value of the program until 30 June 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, this bill will amend the existing legislation to provide more effective funding solutions to non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic educational institutions, benefiting both indigenous students and the institutions themselves. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly this morning in support of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r248">Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill</XREF>  as introduced and to support the comments made by my colleagues the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd). The background of the amendment relates to amending the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. In May 1996, I spoke in this chamber in support of the legislation as introduced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), through our Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). We must remember that at that time the government had inherited a very large deficit&mdash;a $10 billion deficit. My comment at the time of rising to support that legislation was that it would certainly benefit the people and indigenous students of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is further good news for the Northern Territory. It is further good news for northern Australia, and it is good news for especially St Phillip's College in central Australia, which will be able to take on an additional 35 indigenous students in the education system. This amendment to the original legislation will provide funding for indigenous students who were previously excluded from funding sources. I am very pleased that Senator Amanda Vanstone has taken up the challenge to provide additional funding for those disadvantaged students. It is very important. The government really must take stock of the documentation that is available in regard to numeracy and literacy in remote parts of Australia. Without a reasonable education, there is certainly no future for any of those children in the remote parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May 1996 I made mention of the fact that the government would have to take a serious look at the problem because after 13 years of Labor government we were far worse off than we had ever been. It is important that the government has taken up the challenge. It has amended the original bill debated in May last year. It is providing additional resources for those students in northern Australia. Importantly, it generally will be accepted by small non&hyphen;government schools in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) commented about the minimum requirement of 20 students, but the proposal to lift the 10 per cent requirement will allow a substantial number of students enrolled in preschools, schools and VET institutions to benefit from the indigenous education strategic initiative program, known as IESIP. As mentioned by the member for Leichhardt and the member for Robertson, the remaining number of students is very small and it would be hard to justify the administrative cost of delivering grants to education providers for those smaller numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept what the honourable member for Werriwa said, but at least this is a start. We have come a long way since March 1996 in terms of providing educational facilities and resources 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7158"> to the remote parts of Australia, especially in the Northern Territory. I commend the bill to honourable members and have no hesitation in supporting it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am pleased to be here to comment on the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r248">Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill</XREF>  and to sum up on behalf of the government. As speakers have made clear, this bill has essentially two purposes. The first is to remove the requirement that a non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic school must have 10 per cent of its students as indigenous before it is eligible for funding under this scheme. The second is to provide for supplementary funding in line with increases in the educational price index. It is envisaged that, over the next four years, over $5 million could be provided in addition to the already allocated funding to indigenous education in this way. I think we would all agree that the objectives of the bill are benign and to be applauded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has raised the very interesting proposition that in fact there should be no restrictions on the number of indigenous students at any non&hyphen;government, non&hyphen;systemic school for money to be paid. I have to say that it is an interesting suggestion and on leaving this place, I will ask the department to look into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that at this point in time, it is administratively very difficult and the reason for that is that the program in question is very much a performance based program. It is unlike most other programs in the department in that it is very heavily monitored. I am advised that indigenous education supplementary assistance program agreements require rigorous monitoring to show progress against performance targets. Every school that receives funding under this program is required to establish a performance baseline and it is visited at least twice a year by departmental officers in conjunction with Aboriginal consultants to ensure that those performance targets are being met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that general Commonwealth agreements do not contain these outcome-focussed approaches. Previously under the former government, systemic schools were given a lump sum and they could choose to provide funds to non&hyphen;systemic schools and I am pleased to point out to this chamber that they can still do this. They can still do this under these new legislative proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each recipient of funds must have an indigenous education agreement. These require monitoring to ensure targets are met. The administrative costs of supporting these extra 260&hyphen;odd agreements is, as I said, unsustainable, as I am advised at the present point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa has made some interesting comments in his contribution to this bill. I am very happy to ask the department to look again at this issue to explore the possibility of extending these schemes and I will do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would point out in conclusion that my understanding is that under this scheme as it operated under the former government, direct grants to non&hyphen;systemic, non&hyphen;government schools were not possible at all and so these government amendments are in fact an extension of the scheme. They are a step in the right direction; they are a step in the direction that the member for Werriwa is seeking so I hope, on that basis, he will support the bill. I hope on the basis that we will have a look at the proposal that he is putting up that the opposition will support the bill.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Just to pick up the points made by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), I do concede that this bill represents progress. It represents progress to do away with the 10 per cent rule. What I am suggesting is that further progress can be achieved by doing away with the 20&hyphen;student rule. To pick up further the points made by the members for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) and Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), we need to understand, as a parliament, the anomalies that arise from the 20&hyphen;student rule. It now means that a school with 21 indigenous students will be eligible for funding, but a like school with 19 indigenous students will not be eligible for funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely, there cannot be too much difference in running a successful program between a school with 21 students and one with 19. There cannot be a substantial difference in the management and effectiveness of the program on that scale of student numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I acknowledge the point made by the member for Warringah that systemic schools with students less than 20 could still possibly be eligible under the legal advice that has been received by the department for this program funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That again raises a further anomaly. Why should a systemic school with 15 indigenous students be eligible for funding, but a non&hyphen;systemic school in exactly the same circumstances, facing exactly the same schooling needs, not be eligible for program funding? There are anomalies in this that inevitably arise from bureaucrats and politicians in Canberra setting a cut&hyphen;in and a cut&hyphen;out point, an arbitrary number that is determined in the national capital for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7160"> the sorts of judgments and programs that will be run in every single remote school around Australia with a certain number of indigenous students. This is the inevitable problem of cut&hyphen;in and cut&hyphen;out points being determined in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is wrong with making every single school eligible for this program? Then leave it to the school teachers and administration to work out whether or not they want to take up that eligibility; whether or not they want to apply for this particular source of funding. If it is true, as the members for Robertson and Leichhardt have suggested, that it is just not practical for a school with one or two indigenous students to use this funding effectively, let that be the judgment of the school. Let the school decide that, because of those impracticalities, they do not want to take up the funding for one or two students. But for goodness sake, let the school with 18 or 19 students, where something can be gained, make that judgment for themselves and apply for the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Robertson was saying we are talking about a few dollars. I do not think he could possibly have understood the size of the program. We are talking about funds of up to $3,300 at a remote senior secondary school. That, in anyone's language and understanding of the schooling process, is a substantial amount of money. Particularly when you are talking about remote schooling, $3,300 can make a substantial difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a substantial program. We are talking about anomalies that have been raised in the system. As for this suggestion of the cost of administration, what is this thing in the bureaucracy that always leads us back to a cost argument? How difficult can it be to notify every single school around Australia that there is a program for schools with indigenous students and, if those schools wish and they deem it practical, they can apply for the funding? They can apply for the funding and then Canberra further down the track can call for a report on the output&hyphen;based performance measures and deem whether or not the funding is to be continued. What is this thing that hypnotises parliamentary secretaries and other members of the government based on the judgment of the bureaucracy about cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How hard can it be to send a letter to every school to let them know that the program exists; to allow the school to make the judgment as to whether or not in practical terms they wish to apply for funding; to then allow the school to run the program, seek a report about the performance and then decide whether or not the program should continue at that school? That, to me, does not seem to be an overly complex process of public administration. It seems to me to adopt a principle that it is better to have devolution, and better to have the  people running schools make the judgment about what is best for the school, instead of having this arbitrary cut&hyphen;in and cut&hyphen;out point determined by bureaucrats in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever we might say across the chamber&mdash;Labor versus Liberal&mdash;I can tell the honourable members opposite one thing. I am a devolver first and foremost. The centralisation of government in a post&hyphen;industrial society has become problematic. Complex equality and complex needs can only be met through devolution of power and judgment to those people who, in good faith, are trying to provide a service for indigenous Australian students.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated before, I think that there is something in what the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) says. I take his point that, under this legislative process, a school with 21 students is eligible for funding and a school with 19 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7161"> students, under the proposal as it stands, is not eligible for funding, which, on the face of it, does appear to have something undesirable about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple truth is that we always have to draw lines and sometimes those lines are somewhat arbitrary. If you earn less than $5,000, you do not pay tax. If you earn more than $5,000&mdash;or whatever it is&mdash;you do start paying tax. If you earn more than $35,000 a year more or less, you lose or start to lose Austudy. We have built into our systems of government and administration all sorts of cut&hyphen;off points. It is life! It is life and it is very difficult to get away from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa himself has, I believe, suggested that we should not fund new schools if they do not have more than 50 students. So the member for Werriwa obviously concedes that there are very important circumstances in which we are entitled to make judgments about the viability of programs and institutions. While I accept the, if you like, emotional force of the argument that he has put to us today, I think, when subjected to rigorous scrutiny, the argument looks much less persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing to remember about assistance under this program is that we are not just writing out a cheque and posting it off to the school and forgetting about it. This is a program which is designed to ensure much better monitoring of performance on the ground. This is a program with performance incentives and performance monitoring built in, at every step of the way. It is not just a matter of posting a cheque and forgetting about it or of slipping a cheque under the door and forgetting about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are sending people out to all of these schools to ensure that the Commonwealth money, the taxpayers' money, is actually getting the best possible outcome for the people who need it most&mdash;namely, the indigenous students of Australia. It is not just a bucketful of money to be distributed in the same way that the old age pension or block grants to the states, or something like that, is distributed. It is performance oriented and precisely targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to take the member for Werriwa's suggestion to its logical conclusion and have no restrictions whatsoever, we would have every school with any indigenous student applying for this money. As the member for Werriwa has pointed out, there are large amounts of money involved, ranging from $300 to $3,300 for individual students. The problem, if we were to go too far down this track, is that the money would essentially become just another cheque in the mail, and that is not the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had too much of the cheque&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;mail approach in the dealings of the Commonwealth government with our Aboriginal Australians. We need to get away from that. We need to get much more focused on ensuring that the Commonwealth's funding does have a beneficial outcome. That is why it is important to have some limitations on how this money is going to be distributed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all that, I do think there is something in what the member for Werriwa says. As I have indicated before, I will happily take it up with the department to see whether it might not be possible to be a little bit more extensive than we are at the moment. As I said, I think what we are doing is reasonable. I think the member himself has conceded that it is an important step in the right direction. For that reason, I trust that, once we have debated these amendments, which is important, the bill can then pass through this committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the question of who knows best, I think we need to trust our teachers and our school administrators. The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) was saying that we need to get away from the approach where you put the cheque 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7162"> in the mail. What is the alternative to the approach of funding schools and allowing teachers and school administrators to get on with the job? The approach that he is advocating is the one that has failed indigenous Australians for decades, where the non&hyphen;indigenous bureaucrat jumps out of the helicopter to visit the remote school, clipboard in hand, with a checklist of what he or she thinks needs to be done, without regard to the unique circumstances of that school. I find it one of the most unusual things, in my time as shadow minister for education, visiting universities with layers of administration, listening to parliamentary secretaries saying that we cannot trust teachers and school administrators to run their schools effectively without some non&hyphen;indigenous bureaucrat popping out of the helicopter from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely educators in Australia need to be regarded as some of our best educated people, most articulate, most self&hyphen;confident, most able to get on with the job; most able to get on with the job if they have the trust of government and if they have the trust of public policy. I could not think of a group of Australians who need less checking, less supervision, less monitoring through the process of delivering a vital, social and public good than our educators at universities, at remote schools&mdash;right across the education sector. Surely, if government cannot trust educators to get on with the job of effective education in Australia, our whole system of government is broken. That, to me, is the lasting symptom of what we are doing whenever we devise a new cut&hyphen;in or cut&hyphen;out point. We are basically admitting that the processes of governance have broken down to the point that these judgments can only be made in a centralised fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Warringah mentioned the question of the establishment of new schools. I think it is commonsense that in establishing new schools there is an element of planning required. The anomalies that have arisen in Victoria where a government school with 50 students closes one week and the next week, a non&hyphen;government school with 20 students opens up on exactly the same site with exactly the same buildings, do indicate that at least in the establishment of new schools, we need an element of planning. But beyond the establishment of schools, once they are up and running, surely we can then trust our educators to get on with the job. That seems to be a suitable division of responsibility, if you like, in the running of public administration, and I am advocating that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government trusts the teachers. I personally have an enormous respect for teachers. Apart from the Maker and my parents, my Jesuitical teachers are responsible for whatever I am. So, I have enormous respect for school teachers. A teacher is a combination of psychologist, sports master, academic and, at times, parole officer and parent. It is a remarkable combination of qualities that good teachers have and we in Australia are lucky that we have so many good teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the earnests of our trust for the teaching profession is the fact that we are prepared to allow new schools to flourish in this country. I think that it would be easier to take the member for Werriwa as seriously as he wants us to take him&mdash;and I do take him seriously&mdash;if at the same time he was prepared to say that the ALP would not be arbitrary and set this figure of 50 enrolments when it comes to new schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get to the specifics: if we are to go all the way down the path that the member for Werriwa is suggesting, this particular program would simply become extra block funding for Aboriginal students. It would lose its unique quality. The unique quality, the special value&hyphen;adding quality of this program, is that it involves intensive performance monitoring. To have that intensive program monitoring, we have got to have regular visitations from the department with Aboriginal consultants to ensure that the indigenous students at that particular school are getting the improved performance and improved educational outcomes that the taxpayer is entitled to expect for the investment of the dollar. If we were to go down the path advocated by the member for Werriwa inevitably that would be lost. It would be impossible to put that kind of monitoring into schools if they only have one, two or three Aboriginal students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that to have a proper indigenous educational program in a school there has to be a certain number of indigenous students. Without that basic number of indigenous students there cannot really be an indigenous&hyphen;specific program, so you will lose the ability to actually target your program specifically to the disadvantages that indigenous students face. It is important to retain some kind of core requirement for providing money to schools under this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as I have said several times now, there is something in what the member for Werriwa says, and I will ask the department to look at it. He was understandably somewhat sceptical about parliamentary secretaries saying that they will look into things. I know we all get the reputation of being mirrors around here, Mr Deputy Speaker, because we are always looking into things. He suggested that people have been doing it since Adam was a boy. Yes, perhaps we have, but yet look at all of the marvellous improvements that the world has experienced

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this legislation which does several things. Firstly, it increases the size of the board of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority from three to four. The opposition is quite comfortable with that proposition, which incidentally is in line with our acceptance of the increase in the size of the CASA board, for which legislation finally went through the parliament not so long ago. The bill also clarifies the matter of the appointment of departmental officials to the board, making it an option&mdash;but not necessarily mandatory&mdash;for the minister to appoint a departmental official to the board of AMSA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and most importantly, the bill provides for the merger of the two search and rescue authorities that currently operate within Australia&mdash;AMSA and Airservices Australia. This merger was announced some time ago by the minister. The opposition at the time indicated agreement in principle with the proposition, although there are some queries&mdash;I will get to them shortly&mdash;with respect to some of the things that have gone on in the search and rescue area in recent times. But certainly the logic of a single search and rescue organisation is one that the opposition agrees with. Hopefully, the merger will proceed in as worthwhile a way as possible, with the general efficiency and efficacy of search and rescue operations in Australia enhanced as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the bill amends the Civil Aviation Act in order to ensure that CASA retains full responsibility for the monitoring and setting of safety standards with respect to particular aspects of search and rescue operations. Again, the opposition has no concerns about that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a few brief observations with respect to search and rescue generally. As I indicated in my introductory comments, the opposition has some concerns about recent activities within the search and rescue area that are worth mentioning in the context of this bill, even though, as I have indicated, we support the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first relates to an incident in December 1995 when a vessel with the name of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Baron</EMPHASIS> sank off the west coast of Tasmania and one fisherman, Mr Mark Whelan, actually died as a result. There was a search and rescue operation undertaken that involved both Airservices Australia and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The death of Mr Whelan was the subject of a coronial inquiry which reported, from memory, in November of last year or thereabouts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7165">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was alleged by persons unknown within Airservices that original minutes of the meeting which I think was on 22 December between Airservices and AMSA, and which had been approved by AMSA, were then changed in order to soften implicit criticism of AMSA's role in the search and rescue effort with respect to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Baron</EMPHASIS> that ultimately failed to save the life of Mark Whelan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue, in the view of the opposition, remains unresolved. The coroner chose not to directly deal with the matter. It certainly does place some question mark over the operations between the two organisations. It does, of course, indicate that the existence of two separate search and rescue organisations may in fact be seen as a possible cause of this friction or this difficulty. Certainly, if there has been a change in the minutes which is not justified, in order to soften criticism in one of the organisations, that is something that the opposition does have some concern about. As I have indicated, that matter in my view still retains a question mark over it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the best of my knowledge the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has not followed through the issue to an outright conclusion. I am not sure who will close the debate, whether it will be the minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), but I would be interested to hear an update. If the minister's adviser can take that on board, I would be interested to hear whether the minister has taken any further action or reached any conclusive outcome on that question. I do not want to make too much of the issue, but it is of some concern and it is worth pointing to in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue which has had a far greater public airing in the search and rescue area is the incredible fiasco surrounding the purchase of the PADS equipment which had some significant debate in the parliament earlier this year. I will not labour too much over the detail of that fiasco but it is worth recalling some of the basic detail. Mr Laurence Gruzman, from Search and Rescue Pty Ltd, came and visited the minister early in his term of office&mdash;I think it was in April last year&mdash;and demonstrated his search and rescue equipment&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOLLIS" NAMEID="DH4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VU5">Mr Griffin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It worked, unfortunately. They found him.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The minister was saved, no doubt, from the gigantic waves in the foyer of Parliament House and rescued, and he lived to fight another day. That led the minister to believe that the relevant search and rescue organisations, particularly Airservices, needed to have another look at the PADS system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a subsequent program on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> and I think <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> ought to take stock of their style of journalism because that was a very good example of how grossly biased journalism can actually lead to bad public outcomes. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program portrayed a bureaucratic organisation for no good reason trying to stop this entrepreneurial Australian with his brilliant new innovation from being able to put that to the use of the nation in rescuing people stranded at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the program did not mention was that the previous testing of PADS by the RAAF and, indeed, by AMSA had found that even though it was substantially more accurate than the conventional means of dropping life rafts and associated equipment to people stranded at sea, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7166"> it was not safe for those people dropping it&mdash;remembering that this occurs from planes flying as low as 100 feet above what is likely to be fairly turbulent seas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very, very biased report in that program and it contributed to the climate of opinion that the minister was swept along with. He then gave the go&hyphen;ahead to his hand&hyphen;picked appointee, the Chairman of Airservices, Mr John Forsyth, to get moving and give PADS a go. What then happened was that at his very first board meeting, without the matter being on the agenda, the chairman of Airservices obtained approval for up to $1 million to be spent acquiring the PADS equipment, subject to a fly&hyphen;off test between the PADS equipment and the conventional equipment, which subsequently proceeded and which found that PADS was more accurate. The safety concerns that had previously been found did not surface in this particular fly&hyphen;off or were not noticed or not recorded. In any event, Airservices went ahead with the purchase of 104 PADS units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, Airservices went to a training contract with Navair, with a Mr Frank Young, who had been chairman of the evaluation panel in the fly&hyphen;off, to train the Airservices personnel in the use of PADS, but without any tender process and with a figure of $4,000 a week involved in the contract. There were numerous rather murky things associated with this whole deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November last year, during the course of training, it was discovered again that for several reasons PADS was unsafe for those using it and therefore training was suspended. Since that time, Airservices have been working away with varying degrees of cooperation from the proponent of PADS, Mr Gruzman, trying to fix the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that in Senate estimates the other day it was indicated that the total cost to the taxpayer, or to the aviation industry through aviation levies which is probably more accurate, of this fiasco is now approaching $1.7 million, and that does not include an estimate for executive time spent in dealing with the issue. That figure includes the purchase of the units themselves, the cost of training, the cost of evaluations, the cost of warehousing and various other things that are occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the questions that does not appear to have been addressed is: if the units are finally fixed and they are finally made safe and capable of being used, who ultimately is going to bear the cost of fixing the product? In normal circumstances it would be the supplier, the manufacturer. If you are provided with a defective product then normally you have legal rights to ensure that the manufacturer or the supplier bears the cost of fixing these defects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far it does not appear that Airservices have managed to persuade Mr Gruzman that should occur in this case. Clearly, from any rational public policy position, that is precisely what should occur. Legally, Mr Gruzman should be obliged to ensure that the product which he has provided is serviceable or useable for the purpose for which it was presented. It is an old legal concept, a standard legal concept, which still prevails to the best of my knowledge, and it is certainly pertinent in this particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, it is really a cautionary tale for young ministers as to how not to get carried away by exaggerated media hype that presents one side of the story. It is a tale of how not to get carried away by a phobia about pointy headed bureaucrats and Labor Party stooges and the like who are the people who are out to get you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A minister should assess issues rationally, look back at the history and say, `If the RAAF has tested this thing and has found it to be unsafe, that at least suggests that I had better have a closer look at it before I get too carried away with it. If AMSA has tested it under a former 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7167"> Labor minister and said, "No, don't touch it, it is unsafe for those people using it", then, yes, maybe I had better have another close look at it.' Rather that than say to the chairman of Airservices, `Beauty, let's get in a plane. Let's get the flying cap on and get out there and get the enemy and do some double backflips and loop the loops', which is essentially the approach the minister has taken in this and in a variety of other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hopefully, he will learn from this fiasco. When he has got some excitable individuals promoting all sorts of interesting things and telling him about the great glories of free enterprise and how the bureaucrats are blocking them and there are all sorts of wonderful opportunities here and it is all a Labor plot, hopefully he will be a little bit more sceptical in the future. Hopefully, he will look closely at what has been going on and what the situation actually is and form a calm judgment about what is in the interests of the Australian aviation industry or the Australian taxpayer and the Australian public in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, and with those reservations on matters related to the conduct of search and rescue issues by the current minister, in the view of the opposition the bill itself is unexceptional. We would hope that the merger can be completed with the minimum disruption. Mergers of this nature are always problematic for a lot of legitimate reasons, but hopefully this merger can be completed without serious disruption to the very important task of pursuing the search and rescue protection for Australians and ensuring that, for those people who are lost at sea, there is every possibility that they will be saved and looked after and in the quickest possible time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R281">Transport Legislation Amendment (Search and Rescue Service) Bill 1997</XREF> is sensible legislation that has allowed the civil maritime and aviation search and rescue coordination functions to be brought together into one national centre. In fact, I attended the opening of the new facility in Canberra recently. The facility, called AusSAR, the Australian Search and Rescue Organisation, was opened by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). At the opening, the attitude of staff to their coming together into one operation was very positive. The fact that they could talk with the people&mdash;with whom they were used to talking on phones, via faxes, and those sorts of things&mdash;within the one operation was a great step forward as far as they were concerned. It makes a lot of sense to bring together the two arms of our rescue coordination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having 47 million square kilometres to look after&mdash;about one&hyphen;ninth of the earth's surface&mdash;is a huge responsibility for Australia. Most of that area is ocean. So search and rescue in the ocean will undoubtedly normally involve both sea and air functions. Bringing these together is going to make life a lot easier for people coordinating future search and rescue operations. Good coordination in any rescue operation is absolutely paramount. If the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, trouble will ultimately eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although AusSAR did not have direct involvement in the recent Thredbo tragedy, the rescue operation that took place was an excellent example of the good coordination I just spoke of. Honourable members will remember that I spoke in the House earlier this week about the Thredbo tragedy. I would like to take the opportunity, in speaking to this legislation, to expand on some of those things in relation to the actual rescue operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said on Monday, there were many rescue services involved in this operation&mdash;ambulance services, state emergency services, police, fire brigade, bushfire brigade, plus many more. With so many different services involved, and members of those organisations coming 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7168"> from all over New South Wales and the ACT, as well as other states, it was crucial that the coordination be finetuned, and it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made the comment on Monday that watching them work was inspiring, and I did not say that lightly. The excellent coordination was enhanced by the fact that the rescue workers worked in teams made up of people from each of the main rescue services. Instead of having ambulance people working in one place and emergency service people working in another place, there was a multiservice, multiskilled team working together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the services had been training along these lines for some time and the Thredbo tragedy was one of the first situations where this technique could be put in place. It proved to be very successful. Once again, I highlight the contribution made by the police commander in charge of the overall coordination, Charlie Sanderson. It worked quite superbly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other aspects of the rescue that I also want to highlight&mdash;firstly, the quality and competency of the personnel involved and, secondly, the technical aspects. I will deal first with the personnel. I spent a fair bit of time just getting around the site talking to the various people&mdash;the ambulance people, the police people, the SES people&mdash;and the quality of their work, their experience, the way in which they really put their minds to the job was excellent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we can be very proud of the competency of those people when you consider the harsh conditions that they were actually working in. Probably most members saw plenty of the footage on TV, but it is almost impossible to describe to you just how difficult it was on that site. It seems, in Australia, whether we are talking about search and rescue in the oceans of the Antarctic or a rescue like this, we really can come against some extraordinary circumstances and some extraordinary sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the Thredbo site was one of those&mdash;the steepness of it, the fragility of it. As one of the rescue workers described to me very early on, it was like working on an unset jelly which was at an angle of something like about 60 degrees&mdash;and almost 90 degrees vertical in parts. When you think of trying to move your way around that sort of site with enormous slabs of concrete in a virtual card&hyphen;deck pattern down that slope, you can get some sort of feel for how difficult it was. If you then throw into that equation, particularly at night, temperatures of minus nine and minus 10, you can appreciate the difficulties of working in those conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the people worked long hours, depending on the role that they were playing in the particular rescue. It may have been only a couple of hours. In certain cases, you just could not have somebody in a position like that for more than a couple of hours at a time. Other people were there for eight, 10 or 12 hours at a time. It was quite amazing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could use one individual as an example of the competency and confidence that was there, it would be an ambulance worker, Paul Featherstone, whose name many would have seen mentioned. He was the ambulance man that was down under the site with Stuart Diver for about 12 hours straight. I met him on the Sunday after they had gotten Stuart Diver out and I did not realise that he was the person who had been down there. My wife and I were talking to him for some time. He was very mild&hyphen;mannered and just oozed confidence and competence. It was quite extraordinary. I would not have thought he was the person who had been there because it was the Sunday morning after, and, after what he had been through the day before, I would have thought that he would be taking a couple of days rest but he was back there on the site. It was not until the next day&mdash;on the Monday&mdash;when I picked up one of the newspapers, which carried a photo of him and mentioned that he was the person, that I realised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7169"> that he was there. But that is the quality of people we had in that rescue that Australia should be very proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect I want to raise is the technology involved. We had all sorts of monitoring equipment such as listening devices and heat&hyphen;sensing equipment. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who might be following me, comes from a mining area on the south coast. I think there were people probably from his electorate as well&mdash;experts in mining operations&mdash;down there giving advice. That technical aspect was very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent a bit of time with some old colleagues of mine, surveyors who were on the site, watching what they were doing as far as monitoring the site. There were surveyors who came from private firms in Cooma and the coast as well as from Canberra, plus government surveyors, working around the clock, continually watching for any slight movement in any part of the site. If that had occurred, they could have pulled people off because we always had the propensity to lose even more people. The last thing we wanted was rescue workers being among the victims. The use of that technology was quite incredible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other technology aspects that proved to be very successful was the use of helium filled balloons. These were suspended over the site with halogen lights inside. As soon as it started to get dark, these came on and gave the most superb lighting over the site. It was almost like daylight&mdash;very few shadows are created by these lights. Once again, it was technology developed in Australia and probably used for the first time in that type of operation. For future search and rescue it will be a valuable resource.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the chair would be reasonably lenient in this regard. I used the example of a search and rescue that required ultimate coordination to be successful.

Your timing is fine, Mr Deputy Speaker; I was concluding my remarks on that example. Members on the other side are nodding; I thank them for their indulgence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I used the Thredbo tragedy to describe Australia's high level of expertise and management in search and rescue and in our responsibilities for our region. We have further enhanced that through the creation of AusSAR. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) mentioned the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Baron</EMPHASIS> incident. Certainly, that was one of the impetuses for bringing this legislation together. We have had some great successes in search and rescue and not too many failures. Aspects emerging from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Baron</EMPHASIS> coronial inquiry certainly accelerated our move to bring these two operations together. AusSAR, to be managed by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, will provide an excellent service to our region. We can feel secure in the knowledge that, if any more Raphael Dinellis, Thierry Dubois or Tony Bullimores of the world get into difficulties in our region, a very professional, coordinated operation will be on the job immediately.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R281">Transport Legislation Amendment (Search and Rescue Service) Bill 1997</XREF>  which is before the main committee. As the shadow minister for transport has already indicated, the opposition supports the establishment of a single national search and rescue 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7170"> organisation. There are few issues in Australia which generate as much interest and emotion as the search and rescue of people who find themselves in distress at sea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people will remember the miraculous rescue of the British lone sailor Tony Bullimore from his overturned yacht in Antarctic waters. Many people will also recall the rescue of a French woman in similar circumstances some years ago. Most of these rescues cause an enormous amount of controversy, mainly over the huge cost which is involved. But just as we would expect other nations to come to the aid of Australian nationals in distress&mdash;and, indeed, under international maritime law it is required&mdash;it is also an obligation that we carry to come to the aid of others who find themselves in distress within our area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one criticism that I agree with in regard to organisation of around&hyphen;the&hyphen;world yacht races, it is that, instead of having people sail so close to the South Pole, they should sail closer to the Australian coastline. After all, it is Australia that is in the end responsible for the rescue should anything unfortunate come about. More can be done by locals themselves to ensure their safety at sea by making sure that their craft is fully equipped with radio, flares and life jackets. Despite the requirements of this today, many people go out to sea without this important equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important that people understand and respect the elements. I am particularly aware of this, as my electorate has a large coastline, and many people travel to my electorate from western suburbs of Sydney at weekends and holiday periods to put to sea. When they leave western Sydney the weather could be fine, but in a matter of a few hours of travelling time, the seas off Shellharbour and Port Kembla can be whipped up and dangerous. All too often, because these people have travelled so far, they are determined to put to sea, often with disastrous and tragic consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well remember a few years back it happened that during a search and rescue operation it took several days to locate the boat. They were searching for it off Nowra when, in fact, the boat was found off Newcastle. My information is that after the people in that boat hit the first line of breakers, most of them were dead. The boat was overcrowded and should never have been put to sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has accepted responsibility for search and rescue for an area of 47 million square kilometres. This represents approximately 11 per cent of the earth's surface. On anyone's reckoning this is a huge expanse for any search and rescue organisation to monitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until 1 July 1997, the coordination of civil maritime search and rescue services was undertaken by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. AMSA was obliged to perform this function in a manner consistent with Australia's international convention obligations under the Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (1974) and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (1979).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until the same time, the coordination of civil aviation search and rescue services was undertaken by Airservices Australia. AA had obligations to perform this function consistent with obligations under the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. AMSA performed its coordinating functions from Canberra, while AA operated its functions from Melbourne and Brisbane. A series of amendments to existing legislation in the maritime and aviation areas has already been made to merge civil aviation and maritime search and rescue into one organisation, now to be known as AusSAR within AMSA. This bill puts the merged arrangements operating since June onto a clear legislative footing. The creation of a single search and rescue organisation is a logical and sensible step.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7171">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) announced this in a media release on 15 January 1997. This announcement followed recommendations of a review conducted by an independent consultant into the effectiveness of the government's search and rescue arrangements. Like another consultant's report highlighted last week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, and further revelations in the Senate estimates committee&mdash;which is a covert attack plan by the Howard government to seek to smash the Maritime Union of Australia by provoking a confrontation on the waterfront&mdash;this consultant's report recommending this merger remains publicly unavailable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister appears to have a great fondness for consultants' reports. Nearly $90,000 was spent on the government's covert attack plan to smash the MUA, with a further $600,000 to be spent on BCIL Economics Pty Ltd this financial year. But he has much less fondness for making the reports publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, Australia has a very good and honourable record in its search and rescue capabilities and functions. But recent fiascos in the acquisition of the PADS system has left the record somewhat tarnished, and the shadow minister highlighted the fiasco concerning the PADS. It is interesting that although over $1 million has been spent, this equipment is still in warehouses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there was the botched handling of the search and rescue operation undertaken by AMSA and AA involving the yacht the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Baron</EMPHASIS>. This bill in many respects is a result of that fiasco. It is interesting to highlight some aspects of that. On 1 December 1995, Mark Whelan and Stephen Gill left Macquarie Harbour, Tasmania on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Baron</EMPHASIS>. This was a fishing vessel with Mr Whelan as the vessel's skipper. Mr Gill owned the vessel but took directions from the skipper. Later that night the vessel began taking on water and both Mr Whelan and Mr Gill abandoned the vessel. One of the men was able to make it to shore, the other died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This incident has been the subject of numerous commentaries, an investigation and an inquiry. It has also been the subject of intense Senate estimates committee questioning, especially on 10 and 12 June. An executive officer of AMSA, Mr McGrath, told the Senate estimates committee on 12 June that the reality was that the coordination arrangements were inadequate at the time. There was no appropriate mechanism for determining which authority had responsibility. There were problems in the coordination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would appreciate, I am sure, for my sins I read through the Senate estimates committee transcripts concerning these hearings and what became very clear was the utter confusion over which organisation was responsible first for search and rescue for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Baron</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parliamentary Senate colleagues Senator Collins and Senator O'Brien directed some excellent questions to AMSA officials. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records that AMSA was passing the buck to AA, while AA was passing the buck to AMSA. Nobody puts the infuriating nature of this entire buck&hyphen;passing into a better context than Senator Collins, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airservices said, `It is not our responsibility; it is AMSA's.' Then when you talk to AMSA, AMSA say, `It is not our responsibility; it is Airservices.' Then you get down to splitting hairs about what time of the day it became AMSA's responsibility and so on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">During the Senate estimate's committee hearing on 12 June, Mr McGrath, executive officer of AMSA, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I can say is that, as of 1 July when we take the total responsibility, if we do it again&mdash;

<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Baron</EMPHASIS>  incident&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">you can kick us harder.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Hopefully, with the passing of this legislation, which, as I have said, the opposition supports, the search and rescue service will operate more effectively, there will be no more room for buck&hyphen;passing in the future and no option to avoid responsibility. After all, at the end of the day, there are peoples' lives who depend on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been very fortunate in Australia not to have a major maritime disaster in our waters. The numerous bulk carriers that went down off the Western Australian coast a couple of years ago&mdash;six in a period of 18 months&mdash;slid silently to the bottom of the ocean, taking their crews, often from the Third World, with them. We have had no disasters such as they have occasionally had in Europe with the cross&hyphen;Channel ferries. I well recall the disaster of the ferry going, from memory, from Latvia to Sweden, which went down off the coast of Finland either last year or the year before. Thankfully, we have had none of these disasters in Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We maybe do not have the same standard of ferries. Apart from the ferry to Tasmania, we do not have a great ferry traffic in Australia. With this government's policy of opening up the Australian coastline to the rust buckets of the world, there is the increasing likelihood of that occurring in Australia. Now that the Australian coastline and the lives of the seafarers are at risk it is very important that we have this coordinating service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following on from the speech of the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn) and linking it to the context of coordination in rescue services, as he so amply did, I would just like to take a minute or so to mention the Thredbo coordination effort in search and rescue. The member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro has rightly highlighted the Thredbo tragedy and paid tribute to the work and coordination of the rescue services, which we have all admired. I am very pleased that teams from the Illawarra, both the electorates of Cunningham and Throsby, participated in this work, especially the rescue teams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro mentioned, it was the mine rescue teams from my electorate and the electorate of my colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) that did such an excellent job in that very difficult and delicate situation. Like the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro, I pay tribute to the work that was done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose we learn something from every tragedy. I think we did learn something&mdash;of course, nothing good can come from a tragedy&mdash;about some of this work that has been carried out. Hopefully, it will never happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we said before, the opposition supports this important legislation now before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R281">Transport Legislation Amendment (Search and Rescue Service) Bill 1997</XREF>  being debated here today is about two decades late. That we have managed to pull off some notable search and rescue ventures has been due to the tenacity and the dedication of professionals in the field rather than by good management. This is not to deride the teamwork that has been carried out in Australia by our air and seaborne search and rescue operators; quite the contrary. They do a remarkable job considering the lack of communication between the two separate organisations which make up our national search and rescue unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also had the bizarre situation where our search and rescue operations are split into three different headquarters in three different states. This bill enables the government to finally 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7173"> create one national search and rescue body, one organisation that can harness the facilities and expertise which are now shared between Airservices Australia and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. It will also improve the degree of communication between each of these organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A classic example of the lack of coordination and the difficulty under which our men and women in the field have had to work is the fact that our aircraft and our ships at sea do not use the same radio frequency. A classic example of this was in January 1995 when the world watched with bated breath as we searched for lone French sailor Isabelle Autissier. With her yacht dismasted, she was drifting in rough seas between Australia and the Antarctic. To make it even more difficult, the battery on her emergency locating beacon went flat. Miss Autissier was the only woman in that round the world race and that attracted further attention. A Royal Australian Air Force Orion circled above her but could not communicate directly with the ships that were in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That high profile, internationally publicised search and rescue revealed to the world the ridiculous lack of coordination between our air and sea rescue teams. Fortunately, it was successful, but at great cost and risk to those men and women who were out there braving horrendous conditions. The amalgamation of Airservices, run from Melbourne and Brisbane, with the Maritime Safety Authority, run from Canberra, will improve the degree of communication, speed up rescue response times and save more lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That our national search and rescue system has been severely hampered by lack of communication has not gone unnoticed by organisations such as Sydney's Cruising Yacht Club. As organiser of the internationally acclaimed blue water classic the Sydney to Hobart yacht race, the club chose to establish its own search and rescue system. They simply installed marine frequency radios in all the helicopters covering the race. As a result, the race organisation has established the best safety net possible and yachts at sea are covered at all times by some form of communication watch. The lack of radio communication is just one classic example of how fragmented our national search and rescue system has been. Often it has been the case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing because they belong to different bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my lifetime I have seen aircraft control at major airports go from red and green flares&mdash;quite literally a puff of smoke&mdash;to navigation systems which can guide a pilot from London onto the ground and right to the gate at the Sydney airport. Modern electronic and satellite communication systems quite literally mean that there is no hiding place left in the world. Such a device led the efficient Maritime Safety Authority rescue operators to yachtsman Tony Bullimore eating chocolate bars as he crouched in the dark in his upturned yacht in the Southern Ocean. But radios, mobile telephones, satellite homing devices, lights, whistles and bells are of little value if no&hyphen;one can hear them. The situation becomes more tragic when, even if these devices do send out an SOS, there is an argument over which organisation has the job of mounting the rescue operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to go into a litany of mismanaged search and rescue operations, as too many people have suffered and still suffer because we failed. Suffice to say, there have been some publicly applauded successes but there have been some disastrous and unnecessary failures. Search and rescue cannot be a hit and miss operation, but a coordinated, well&hyphen;oiled organisation with strong leadership. And it is not a field for well&hyphen;meaning amateurs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7174">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the field for aviators, seamen and women, navigators and qualified search and rescue professionals. It also involves men and women with electronic communication skills. This is very much a hands&hyphen;on profession, and there is no time for status seekers. Yet both within parliament and the public arena, we have seen years of brawling within our air and sea rescue organisations. We have a situation where the paper shufflers well outnumber the men and women in the field. We have had a situation where those in command of the technical and extremely complex process of ensuring civil aviation safety had never worked in the industry nor, in fact, been involved in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this legislation will resolve many of the problems which have bedevilled both organisations in the past. The skills and knowledge of Airservices Australia and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, combined to form one single organisation, will create a more efficient structure. Ultimately, speed and efficiency are what count in saving lives. For that reason, I give this bill my full support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to see this legislation before the committee. One should not underestimate the difficulties in amalgamating two organisations that have come together to form AusSAR. It is something that could have happened many years ago but for some of the professional rivalries that existed between the air service sectors and the marine coordination sector. The one thing that must not happen is that those differences that do exist to some extent at the moment not be overcome. They can be overcome. They must be overcome in the interests of marine and aviation search and rescue. The really important people are the people for whom we search and the people who depend upon this unit to provide that search and rescue service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks through the Australian Maritime Safety Authority annual report for last year at the area that has been covered by Australia, we are responsible under international conventions for 1/9th of the world's surface. That stretches from a point in the north&hyphen;west right out towards Cocos Islands&mdash;we have carried out rescues beyond Cocos Islands of yachtspersons&mdash;and in the north&hyphen;east out beyond Fiji, and in the south&hyphen;east to a point which, when I look at the map, I cannot even determine a landmass to identify it with because it is so far. The area is 47,000 square kilometres. With a nation like Australia and the resources we have, we have an enormous task in global terms. The rest of the world depends upon us to come to their rescue in the time of crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that the satellite systems, Cospas&hyphen;Sarsat, are in place and in operation, the area that the satellite passes is the range of Australia just west of Albany to some distance east of Wellington, New Zealand. There is a one&hyphen;hour catchment period. In other words, if an EPIRB or an emergency position indicating radio beacon or an emergency location transmitter on an aircraft is triggered, it will be a maximum of one hour before that signal is picked up by a passing satellite. As you go further out, east or west, in all directions from the compass, the time limits go out from one hour to two hours. If it is triggered in Fiji and it is picked up here, it could be up to a maximum of two hours&mdash;it does not have to, it will depend on where the satellite is in its transit around the globe&mdash;before that signal would be picked up by the passing satellite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area goes out at the furthest point, as I mentioned, to beyond the Cocos Islands or to the far south&hyphen;east of Australia where the maximum period before the signal would be picked up by the passing satellites would be six hours. On the map shown in the Australian Maritime Safety Authority report, the area is broken up into sections of one hour, two hours, four hours 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7175"> and six hours. So that is the enormous task that we, as a relatively small nation, have in carrying out aviation and marine search and rescue activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to understand that there is a clear division of responsibilities. Media make great moment of crisis, of sensationalism, and of search and rescue particularly. There is an expectation, built up because of the success of Australian search and rescue services over the years, that if you are missing, you must be found; not that if you are missing, you may be found. The expectation that has built up in the minds of many people, certainly in the minds of many of the media, is that if somebody is missing, they must be found, otherwise the service is deficient. It does not necessarily follow that if you are missing, you are going to be found. Australia, through its professionalism and the range of assets and equipment available, will do its absolute best to ensure that you are found and successfully rescued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the key to all of this, the starting point, is the preparedness of the persons themselves. If people go down to the sea in small boats that are overloaded, underfuelled and not carrying radios, not having submitted a plan or told somebody where they are going and when they expect to return and not having checked on the weather conditions to ensure that the journey they want to undertake can be undertaken safely in those weather conditions, then they are going to have a problem and their loved ones will have a problem. When they go missing it will not be the fault of the searchers or the rescuers, it will be the fault of a lack of preparedness. Preparedness on the part of the voyager is priority one. Then we come in with the professionalism of Australia's services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to remember always, in all of the sensationalism that attaches to some of these magnificent rescues and searches, that the searchers and rescuers put their own lives on the line almost all of the time. Their lives are at risk. In the search to locate the missing person, we have to bear in mind the dangers that are imposed upon the people carrying out the actual search and later the rescue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also remember that the area of jurisdiction is very clear. Territorial seas and inland waters are the responsibility of the state authority. Beyond the territorial sea limit, it is the responsibility of the federal government. We pick up that responsibility as a nation through the international maritime conventions to which we subscribe. I referred to that earlier. If we look at what is shore based, in respect of hikers, land vehicles, all pleasure craft and fishing vessels at sea, responsibility begins with the police. At any point in an area of state jurisdiction, the state authority can turn to the federal authority&mdash;now AusSAR&mdash;and ask them to accept responsibility for the further conduct of the search and of the rescue. That happens quite frequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of defence aircraft, it is the responsibility of the RAAF. In respect of vessels other than those for which police and defence forces are responsible, it is the responsibility of AMSA. In respect of Royal Australian Navy ships and submarines and all Australian Defence Force shipborne naval aircraft, it is the responsibility, in the primary instance, of the Royal Australian Navy. But there is a tremendous amount of teamwork that goes on across those agencies. The system could not function without that teamwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention the magnificent rescues of the French and British yachtsmen in January this year, 2,600 nautical miles south&hyphen;west of Western Australia, at the absolute limit of our capacity in terms of the equipment that was available, and in weather conditions that were extreme and that we rarely ever see close to our coastline. I want to pay tribute to everyone 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7176"> that was associated with the rescue of those round the world yacht race crew members. They were the Britisher Tony Bullimore and the Frenchmen Raphael Dinelli and Terry Dubois.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the pleasure a couple of years ago in Newcastle of meeting the French yachtswoman that we rescued in 1994. That was a successful search and rescue and it was pilloried in some quarters because of the expense. But people who make those kinds of comments, particularly journalists, have very short memories. We are party to international conventions, we accept those responsibilities, and we expect, as Australians, that other parties to those international conventions will similarly come to the assistance of Australians when they are in distress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call to mind the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rockin' Robin</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the yacht off the north&hyphen;east of Australia in which four Australians perished. Those people came from just south of Newcastle, south of Lake Macquarie. There was a great deal of publicity about it and a great deal of criticism about weather conditions and what kinds of rafts could have been dropped, but it does not help anybody to rake over those memories other than to express our deepest sympathy for the families of the four persons who were lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was conveniently forgotten was that, at that time, the French navy sent a frigate from Noumea right out almost to the boundary of their area of responsibility. There were French aircraft involved in the search for and location of those people. Where the tragedy occurred was in the weather conditions and in the dropping of equipment to those people. It is a two&hyphen;way process. It is all very well to make comments about what Australia expends. I would ask people who make those comments to think about the ignominy and the abuse that would have been heaped upon Australia internationally had we followed the advice of some people back in January who said, `Bad luck, it is a private yacht race. They are on their Pat Malone. We are not going to spend taxpayers' dollars in doing anything about their rescue.' That did not happen. What happened is that young Australians from the Marine Rescue Coordination Centre&mdash;as it was known then and now AusSAR&mdash;the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force achieved a level of performance which is unsurpassed in rescue and search at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their performance demonstrated to the rest of the world in a way that it could not otherwise be demonstrated that Australian trained aviators and Australian trained mariners are of world class&mdash;we are absolutely world class. That is why they are in demand as airline pilots around the world; that is why our officers are in demand on ships around the world. If it is a difficult task you call for an Australian; if it is a complex task you call for an Australian. In those rescues we proved not only our support for those conventions that we subscribe to but we showed the rest of the world just how well Australians are able to perform as individuals&mdash;their professionalism, their competence&mdash;and how well we are able to perform as a team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world watched almost in awe as the Australian teamwork of our defence personnel and Marine Rescue Coordination Centre civil personnel carried out those magnificent rescues at the cutting edge of technology and at the extreme geographical limits of Australia's rescue capacity. Their professionalism illustrated Australia's competence in marine and aviation search and rescue skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, not every search results in locating the missing person and not every rescue attempt is successful. The prime factor is the preparedness of those who want to go to sea or those who fly. It was very clear in this case that the preparedness of the yachtspeople themselves was a major factor in their survival. Had they not had the gear that they were wearing and had they not had the radio and equipment to help locate them, then they would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7177"> have simply been casualties. That is often overlooked by what I refer to as vested interests and often by some individuals in the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me contrast the other side of it for you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If one of those RAAF Neptune aircraft had gone in with its crew of 10, then the much lauded success in rescuing Tony Bullimore&mdash;to which I have been referring in the last instance&mdash;would have become blazing headlines. It would have been referred to as an unmitigated disaster and unmitigated incompetence in even attempting the rescue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this area of search and rescue, looking at the annual report of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, I note that, whilst the growing usage of distress beacons shows an improvement in the success rate in search and rescue techniques, there has also been an increase in false distress alerts or in undetermined causes of beacon alerts. In fact, in 1995&hyphen;96, 96.4 per cent of distress alerts were undetermined or false. In some cases, particularly on small boats, the EPIRBs go off by somebody bumping them or flicking them on to see whether they work. That triggers off the whole process in Canberra and sets in operation the AusSAR centre. An enormous expense is generated because of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995&hyphen;96, there were some 6,608 search and rescue incidents, of which 79 led to search activity. That was an increase of 21.5 per cent over 1994&hyphen;95. They resulted in the rescue of 108 people, and that was a decrease of 25 per cent on the previous year. The best year would be when no search was necessary. That would mean proper preparedness: if people took proper account of weather and maintained proper communication, they would not have the unfortunate problem of finding themselves in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking through the search and rescue performance statistics, we can see the changes that have taken place in performance and effectiveness. Looking at the dollar amounts, the number of persons rescued and the effectiveness of the rescue in a reporting period, in 1991&hyphen;92, the amount is $119 rising, in 1996&hyphen;97, to $138. If we look under EPIRB usage, the total number of searches resulting from EPIRB alerts fell from 70 per cent to 66 per cent between 1991&hyphen;92 and 1996&hyphen;97. The total number of searches resolved was 97.65 per cent. Switching to the next column, the total search duration cost for aircraft under EPIRBs is $350.72. This is analysed in all those documents in the performance figures of the organisation and the effectiveness of the search. As I said, the best search is when no search is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that this legislation is before us. I am pleased that the two organisations have been brought together. In the past, the aviation rescue coordination centres in Brisbane and Melbourne have always been involved. The actual coordination of all the elements was done by what was then the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, but now AusSAR. They determine the search area. They work out the grid. They take account of sea currents, weather conditions and times&mdash;all of the factors involved. If members have not had a chance, they ought to look at that centre and its databases in operation. They are absolutely world class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They take account of all that information. They determine the grid areas to be searched. They then use it to task the aviation rescue coordination centres to arrange the aircraft. It is passed over to the aviation rescue coordination centre. They task the aircraft, be they civil or defence, on the grids and the frequency to be searched. In this operation, all the officers are together in one room&mdash;some people are at one end; some are at the other end. This will produce a much better quality search and rescue service for people who need help in times of crisis. It is going to save money but, most importantly, we will have a better service.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7178">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supplementing that is a network of civil search and rescue units. There are in excess of 30 of those; I have one in my own electorate, Aeropelican at Belmont. At each of those units there are civilians trained in aerial search and rescue and drops, and stores of equipment are maintained there. There are rafts and beacons, all the equipment that is necessary. All that equipment is located at the airport. The people are trained regularly and they attend refresher courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a crisis occurs, when now AusSAR calls on a search to be carried out, at those 30&hyphen;plus centres around Australia the stocks of equipment are ready, there are people with the right skills ready to participate in the search, and all that will now be controlled out of one room. It makes good sense. It is going to be a more efficient service, but most of all it is going to improve further the capacity of the centre to carry out a successful search and rescue operation. To those who depend upon this service, they will know that these searchers can give their very best and take the greatest risks that are reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, at the end of the day the most important factor is the preparedness of the person who goes to sea or hops on an aircraft that may or may not be airworthy, or that may or may not have sufficient fuel on board. Those people who generate the problem in the first instance, those people who effectively are putting their lives and the lives of their passengers at risk, should spare a thought for the dangers that are then created for the searchers and the rescuers. I am pleased to support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an enormous area that we have responsibility for. As the previous speaker indicated, the actions of the search and rescue authorities in Australia have shown the world that we are one of the best nations in the world as far as search and rescue are concerned, with our pilots and our navigators at sea, particularly when you look at the enormous expanse of the Southern Ocean between Australia and Antarctica that we have to look after.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill emanates from a review that was initiated by this government last year to look at the costs and benefits that might arise from a rationalisation of the Commonwealth's civil maritime and aviation search and rescue functions into one national coordination centre. The current coordination functions are split between state and territory police services, industry and volunteers. Someone earlier on indicated that that worked very well in the recent disaster in Thredbo as far as the coordination of emergency services went in that specific location and that sort of emergency, but search and rescue at sea, and particularly in the region that is being covered, requires better coordination than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendation from the review of the previous arrangements was that a single coordination centre for search and rescue be established and managed by AMSA. That is what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7179"> this bill is all about. It is good to see that it is getting support from the opposition, which is one of the positive elements of proceedings in this parliament that we see more often than a lot of people out there in the real world realise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment costs for AusSAR are interesting in that budget funding of $16.6 million is provided to AMSA in 1997&hyphen;98, the majority of which is for the costs of civil search and rescue capability. AMSA's costs of establishing AusSAR would be estimated at between $4 million to $5 million, so it has been budgeted for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are clearly defined benefits which will accrue from the amalgamation of these services. It will facilitate the development of a national strategic overview of civil search and rescue. It will facilitate consistency in operational procedures, integration of program priorities and investment decisions, common standards of practice and training, and national&hyphen;international consultative processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great deal of research has gone on prior to the drafting of this bill to establish this new service. I know that the previous speaker alluded to the rescue that took place in the Southern Ocean of the yachtsmen involved in that round the world race. There was a great deal of public comment across Australia as to what Australia's responsibilities are, what they should be and should we be spending a lot of taxpayers' dollars with regard to search and rescue involving foreign nationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that, as a nation, we are signatories to a number of international conventions that require our involvement in these operations. Certainly, the responsibility fell on Australia at the time to conduct the search and rescue operation for those people. I am sure they appreciated it. I think I saw in the media recently that the Englishman, Tony Bullimore, is back at sea in another single&hyphen;handed race at the moment. As the previous speaker did indicate, those people in that race certainly took all precautions as far as the seaworthiness of their craft and the safety equipment that they had on board were concerned, because those precautions kept them alive until the Australian search and rescue organisations could complete the task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are bound under international conventions and have an obligation to provide search and rescue services for seafarers in an area that covers about 11 per cent of the world's surface. I suppose that is just a result of where we are located in the Southern Hemisphere, as a very large island continent in the Southern Ocean. As I mentioned, it is interesting that we are responsible for maintaining search and rescue operations over 11 per cent of the world's surface.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also made mention of the responsibility of surveillance authorities and what should be done to ensure that ships and ocean&hyphen;going vessels are seaworthy and that aircraft are airworthy. It is interesting to note what the government is doing with regard to substandard shipping. It has been the government's policy to ensure that the highest standards of safety are maintained in shipping in Australian ports and waters. To reduce the use of substandard shipping in Australian waters, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority undertakes rigorous port state control inspections of foreign ships visiting Australian ports. AMSA's inspection rates have steadily increased. In 1996 nearly 60 per cent of eligible ships&mdash;that is, those not inspected by AMSA during the previous six months, or three months for passenger ships&mdash;were inspected compared with 55 per cent in 1995. Port state control is proving to be an effective means of combating the use of substandard shipping. In 1996, the average detention rate of vessels fell to 8.5 per cent from 9.6 per cent in 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In line with the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report to increase the effectiveness of port state control, AMSA publishes a monthly report showing details of ships detained, including information on the ship's owner, manager and charterer. It is important to note, and it has been noted by a number of contributors to this debate, that it is incumbent not only upon the operators of these vessels but also the surveillance authority&mdash;I am sure that it will be in the future an increasing effort by government&mdash;to maintain a decent standard not only of Australian shipping but also shipping that enters Australian ports. Ultimately, if we do not, it is going to impact on those search and rescue facilities that we are debating today about providing under this new act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I just want to add my support to the bill. It is a move forward. We are going to be engaging new technology as far as the contractual arrangements that are in place for using facilities with Telstra in the future. I think that it is a positive move and one that is an indication to our international neighbours that we are very committed to moving forward and providing a very good service as far as civil search and rescue operations are concerned in that 11 per cent of the world's surface that we have responsibility for.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is a pretty short bill by our standards. It is only 10 pages long and it is uncontroversial. It is legislation which the Labor Party opposition will be supporting because it tightens up some aspects of Medicare to do with pathology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will do a number of things. Firstly, it will allow backdated accreditation approvals for pathology operators, thereby avoiding problems with Medicare benefits eligibility due to administrative delays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it will increase the penalty for pathology collection centres that do not display the accreditation notice. Thirdly, it will tighten the requirements in relation to pathologists renting space from referring doctors to reduce the possibility of kickbacks. Fourthly, it will allow the Health Insurance Commission to impose penalties for minor infringements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill builds on last year's reform package in which the government and the Australian pathology profession struck a deal to control costs. Last year's deal itself built on the former Labor government's initiatives to control pathology expenditure, and that deal has our support. The fact that another agreement has been reached and another deal done to ensure that inappropriate practices are stamped out, also has the support of the opposition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7181">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways, this bill highlights the difference though between constructive reforms to Medicare, which I am delighted to see in this bill, and the sort of negative attacks on Medicare which unfortunately have been made far more common under this government. We have seen a freeze on Medicare rebates in 1996; a 10 per cent cut for certain high cost procedures, including eye and knee surgery; a 10 per cent cut to families who need to use IVF services, and a 50 per cent cut to certain psychiatry rebates. We have seen the closure of 43 Medicare offices throughout the country, making it harder for people to claim their Medicare rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we saw the government seeking a massive $700 million cutback in last year's budget and an effort to introduce a system of therapeutic group premiums in a manner that bypassed the parliament by way of regulation which was not disallowable in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is also pleased to see that the measures that are contained in the bill have been agreed with the pathology profession. Unfortunately, this is also in contrast with most of the negotiations conducted by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who seems to have a singular talent for failed negotiations&mdash;with the medical profession, his state counterparts, and even his cabinet colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a point I make lightly. Health policy is always a complex and difficult area. There are always at least three sides to most arguments in health. Sid Sax aptly described the health policy world a few years ago as a strife of interests. Therefore it is doubly important that a health minister be open and consultative, and have the personal skills to negotiate, because that is the only way that progress can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government seeks to rule by decree, and their petulance at having to consult is plain for everyone to see. If this is to be a government that contributes anything positive in health, if we are to see any constructive gains, the government and the minister must learn to work with other interests in our society and with the other stakeholders in health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Madam Deputy Speaker, the opposition is prepared to support these amendments, which are uncontroversial. We will seek to ensure that the public interest is protected in services provided by pathologists in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R275">Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  has been prompted by the successful negotiation of a three&hyphen;year agreement between the Commonwealth government and the pathology industry. The essence of the agreement, which commenced on 1 July 1996, is to cap expenditure for pathology on the Medicare benefits scheme and keep it to predetermined amounts over the 1996&hyphen;97 and 1998&hyphen;99 periods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cap for expenditure was set at six per cent; and last year, for the first time, pathology was able to keep Medicare benefits growth below six per cent. As a consequence, pathology providers were able to gain another six per cent rise in Medicare benefits. The industry has become self&hyphen;regulatory, and because of the agreement the government now knows what growth will be. Growth in costs in 1996&hyphen;97 was significantly lower than under the previous government. The industry is using innovative solutions which introduce new procedures, and they in turn save on costs. The savings thus made will release funds for other programs, such as our immunisation and mental health programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The profession is also working with the Health Insurance Commission to look at ways to target inappropriate practices. The bill seeks to strengthen the power of the Health Insurance Commission to enforce the provisions of the act relating to pathology. It strengthens a provision relating to the licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres to ensure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7182"> that a notice establishing that the centre is licensed is clearly visible, thus deterring the operation of unlicensed centres. Licensed centres now have to display their licence number, so pathology laboratory providers know that their competitors are operating licensed premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Giving the Commonwealth, through the Health Insurance Commission, the power to prescribe penalties for minor pathology offences in regulations will assist enforcement of regulations. The Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners thinks that is a great idea. At present, the Health Insurance Commission has to go through the court system under criminal law, and it is almost impossible to collect evidence suitable for a criminal court. Infringements will now be dealt with as civil actions, and the Health Insurance Commission will be able to impose penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pathology industry in Australia on the whole is very well regarded throughout the world. We have a national accreditation scheme, a good level of quality and very uniform standards across the nation. Because of these high standards it is necessary to make sure that the few people who do not comply with the regulations are brought to accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also seeks to strengthen the provisions of the act to clearly prevent an approved pathology practitioner entering into arrangements whereby inducements or kickbacks are provided to a medical practitioner or entrepreneur. It removes any ambiguity in a current provision relating to the occupation by a pathology company of premises owned by a medical practitioner or entrepreneur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of an arrangement which the bill seeks to deter is one where an approved pathology practitioner enters into an arrangement with a medical practitioner or entrepreneur for the use or occupation of premises, but merely oversees the use of premises through agents or employees and provides kickbacks to the medical practitioner or entrepreneur by way of rent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the exercise is not to make it harder for patients to access a collection centre. In many ways this will provide more service centres, better services and reduced costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to allow for the payment of Medicare benefits in some circumstances for services provided by a pathology provider who is out of date was agreed upon by the Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners. Pathology has very regulated laboratories and the laboratories have to register every 12 months. Sometimes the paperwork does not reach its destination in the right time frame. This will also protect against the Health Insurance Commission and the health department which may on occasions miss processing an application. This amendment allows for these possibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laboratories will have up to one month to gain application approval. However, the minister must be satisfied that it is in the public interest to backdate that approval. For example, bills from one pathology laboratory were signed off by a resident pathologist. However, it was realised that he, being new to the position, had not yet been recognised by the Health Insurance Commission. This could have had a dramatic effect on the pathology company, who would not have been eligible for Medicare benefits, and for the patients, who would not have received their rebate. The problem was quickly rectified, however. But, under this amendment, these hiccups can be dealt with comfortably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners is very supportive of the amendment. It has been discussed at length by the Pathology Consultative Committee. Many challenges within the industry are being identified and the cooperative efforts of the concerned committees are shown in this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this bill, we address a number of challenges which the Medicare and health systems have faced in Australia for some time. The challenges include issues such as medical fraud and overservicing and questions of how we contain the costs of the Medicare system and, indeed, the health bill of the nation as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are issues that are very serious. They have been around for many years. They require us to think about ways and means in which we as a nation can bring the health bill under control but provide the services which the people of the nation need for good health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to begin with the premise that good health is a fundamental right that people have in a democratic and civilised society. We also need to accept the fact that in Australia we have finally come to a bipartisan position that we believe in universal health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given those two principles&mdash;the right to basic health and a belief in universal health care&mdash;we then have to look at ways and means of delivering that universal health care while containing the costs to a reasonable level. That is not easy. In a whole range of areas, we have had problems. This bill deals with some of the most complex issues that we have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, on the one hand you want to be able to provide the services to everyone who needs them. On the other hand, you have the problem of the pressure for overservicing and even for fraudulent practice. Some people feel that the medical professions should not only be a guarantee of a good living, but should be a guarantee of an exorbitant living. In that situation you can easily get to the point where services are very costly. There is overservicing and there can be a situation of connivance and collusion between certain practitioners and the providers of subsidiary services, such as pathology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that we have this bill. In general, we support the thrust of the bill. But I want to make the observation that these matters are not going to be dealt with just simply by legislation, just simply by saying, `Here are some rules, here are some regulations. We are going to give the HIC significantly increased powers,' as this bill does, `to be able to check things, to be able to ban certain activities, to be able to put into place measures to deal with excesses on the part of providers of pathology services.' All of those things are there, and they are welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do not believe that we will really get to the heart of the problem until we start to focus again the attention of the nation on what the real meaning of medical practice is and what the real meaning of the provision of these services is. These services are there for those people who need them. They are not there for people to exploit them to make money unnecessarily. Unfortunately, there are people in the community who keep doing this with the medical profession and with these subsidiary services, and we do need to deal with that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was first elected to parliament years ago&mdash;sometimes too many years ago&mdash;I recall that I was on the Public Accounts Committee. Its major inquiry at that time was an inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing&mdash;a massive inquiry, a huge issue and big reports. Finally the government did something about it&mdash;this was in the last term of the Fraser government&mdash;and when we came into government later we also took it up and we put into place a number of measures. But it appears that the more measures you put into place, the more you find that, a bit like the taxation system, there are ways and means of getting around the measures. For example, this bill refers to certain activities by some pathologists where there is a form of kick&hyphen;backs to practitioners by having shared offices or other shared facilities and privileges, therefore getting around what might be called the `blunt' bribe but actually having an indirect impact in terms of an incentive for particular services to be proceeded with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7184">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said there needs to be a change in our culture. There are certain elements that are required for that. The first is that we need a lot more public appreciation of the great work which the bulk of medical practitioners do, especially those involved in very difficult work in the hospitals, public and  private, where a lot of hard decisions have to be made about operations and about the right way to go ahead in a difficult case. I do not think we sufficiently appreciate the dilemmas which doctors have and the hard decisions that they have to make, especially in these situations. So it is very important that the public starts to appreciate medical practitioners more than we have in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a time when to be a doctor was probably the highest occupation in the land. That is no longer the case. That is partly to do with some of these bad doctors, but it is also partly to do with a general cynicism in the society about public service, about service to the community, where the only sign of status and respect in the community increasingly becomes how many dollars you have rather than what contribution you are making to the community. If the medical profession falls for that situation, where individual doctors and specialists seek to gain status not on the basis of their contribution to the community, but on the basis of their income and of keeping up with the Joneses on very high incomes, then we are going to get into an incredible problem in this country in terms of medical practice and the costs of health. So the government and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who I know is always well&hyphen;meaning, should be looking at a program of greater recognition of the good work of doctors and specialists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to those carrying out the specialised services, I noticed that there has been some problem about those who are licensed and those who are not licensed. Perhaps the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) can explain it to me. I do not understand why unlicensed people should be in this area at all. Why don't we have a more competitive system of licensing and have everybody licensed? If you are not licensed, you just do not do it. I would like to know what the answer is to that question from the minister and perhaps it could be taken on board to do something about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even with the licensed and approved pathology authorities, we obviously need a situation in which we control the cost of this. Of course, there are difficult questions. You cannot say to a doctor, `Only these tests are necessary and those ones are not.' But there is no doubt that there has been some conniving in this area, where people have had unnecessary tests and where, unfortunately, in some cases, individual doctors have received inducements and incentives to have those tests. I believe we have to do something more to tackle that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not to say that I do not agree with the provisions of the bill. I think the bill goes some way towards achieving that. But, as I said, you do not just tackle it by law enforcement. You also tackle it by creating a different atmosphere and a different spirit in terms of the socio&hyphen;cultural rewards for people in the medical professions, including pathologists, in relation to what they are doing. If the community can get a greater cognisance of that and if the government can encourage that, then I think we will have less propensity for these actions to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe I am being a bit idealistic here, but I do think that we can try and encourage in our society, not only in this area of medicine but in other areas, a greater sense of community and public contribution. We need society to recognise that a lot more than they have done to this point.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7185">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the bill. I hope that the measures will deter those who are determined to proceed in ways which are against the law or the spirit of the law. Hopefully, this occasion will provide for us the opportunity to encourage those who are acting in a positive way so that others may join them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I speak specifically to the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997, I would like to pick up on a couple of the remarks that were made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I was very pleased to hear him quite rightly speak of the very good and very capable work done by the vast majority of medical practitioners. Within any group of individuals within society, whether it be medical practitioners or members of parliament, there will be a section who will bring only shame to themselves and the profession within which they work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also spoke about the regard in which doctors had previously been held and asked why it had declined. It is certainly one of the questions that I have grappled with myself in recent years. I feel that obviously our society has changed in many enormous ways. Many Australians&mdash;and I would suggest many who support the views of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), for example&mdash;do not quite understand these changes. They are grieving about changes that they have seen in their country and their world. They are also angry about quite a few of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it be people in science, in higher education, in medicine, the law or other professions, we all stand accused of changes that have been brought upon society over which many people feel they have no control. Of course, George Bernard Shaw in the 19th century was bemoaning the medical profession. I do not think a lot has changed in that regard, but many Australians assign blame to professional, scientific, engineering and other people for the kinds of things that they have seen happen in their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not always agree with the member for Calwell but he was quite right when he said that what we really need to be doing is rediscovering a sense of community, whether it is the medical profession or anything else. In fact, in terms of addressing the phenomenon of the member for Oxley and her supporters, I feel it is important to remind ourselves that what we need most in this age of economic and technological uncertainty is the resource of our personal relationships; what we need most is to build a sense of community; what we need most is one another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the behaviour which this bill seeks to address is but a symptom of a society that is failing. Historically, if you look at societies that get into trouble they are ones that develop a preoccupation with death, whether it is in the form of suicide&mdash;Australia, of course, has the highest youth suicide rate in the OECD&mdash;or death in the form of euthanasia. We have gambling elevated to the status of religion in some parts of Australia. We also are a country that is dividing along racial lines. We have a preponderance of drug use which has reached epidemic proportions. We are not alone in this regard. But, historically, societies like that are the ones that get into trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that has upset me in the last decade&mdash;and my foray into medical politics was initiated by the former member for Canning, Mr George Gear, who sought to build a career for himself in the denigration of my profession&mdash;is that when people seek to denigrate or bring down to the lowest common denominator institutions or things in which we really ought to have some confidence or to tear apart our mesh of values, it is actually the people who most benefit from them who suffer most. I really question whether we are a better society 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7186"> today because people have a lower regard for God, king and country, professions, doctors and all the rest of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997  gives effect to a number of government initiatives which relate to Medicare benefits for pathology services. It will allow the Governor&hyphen;General in Council to make regulations to give the Health Insurance Commission the power to impose penalties for less serious infringements that relate to pathology. What we are really looking at is a series of infringement notices or penalty notices, a bit like traffic infringement notices, or expiation notices, for example, in the ACT for cannabis users, and so on. Where an approved pathology service has failed to inform the public that a pathology laboratory is no longer approved and that services it is providing are not attracting a Medicare benefit, under these provisions it will be possible for the commission to simply issue a fine to that pathology provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell asked a question in passing about licensing centres, asking himself why there would be people who are out there providing services who are unlicensed. Why do people do anything that contravenes the law? Why do they speed in cars? Why do they drink and drive? Why do they not wear seatbelts? In fact it was the previous government, to its credit, that through negotiations with the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, the AMA and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia developed a licensing system to control the number of outlets to which patients could go to have their blood and other samples taken. The reason for doing that was that we had had a profligate expansion of the number of places to which people could go and get pathology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You often find in medicine&mdash;and pathology is certainly no exception to this&mdash;that demand is often determined by supply. The more doctors you can provide in a particular area or the more pathology services you can provide, the more the number of services will be demanded and will be consumed. So that was a genuine attempt to try and limit the number of outlets that were providing pathology services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also intended to improve the quality of some of these outlets and also to have some regard to geographic distribution and the convenience of patients. However, we ended up having, at one stage, more pathology collection centres than we had Chinese restaurants in some parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill makes an amendment also to the licensing scheme for the collection of pathology specimens and it introduces a requirement that the owner of a licensed collection centre needs, all the time, to display a sign which is visible, is factual, from the outside of the building to let the public know that this centre is licensed, because if you go to an unlicensed centre and you have a specimen taken, those services will not attract a Medicare benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill increases the maximum penalty for infringement from $100 to $1,000. The intention is to provide a deterrent to the operation of unlicensed collection centres and protect consumer interests. I became aware of a case recently involving a Sydney pathology company that had had a licensed collection centre which had then become delicensed. Patients had continued to attend this particular centre, had had their specimens taken and then, much to their horror they discovered that there was no Medicare benefit being paid for the services that they had consumed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the act restricts pathology providers from going into arrangements for the occupation of premises with medical practitioners or entrepreneurs, except for the establishment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7187"> of a licensed collection centre. The aim of this is to prevent arrangements that really stop inducements to medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my previous life I certainly became aware of instances where general practitioners, for example, would be referring all of their pathology to a certain pathology provider. They would then, for some inexplicable reason, switch to another pathology provider and the amount of pathology that they were providing increased fivefold. However, once they had received a visit from the Health Insurance Commission they then, for some equally inexplicable reason, would reduce their pathology ordering by fivefold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, there have been arrangements, and I believe to this day there continue to be arrangements, where certain pathology providers have paid a very, very generous rent for what is basically a broom cupboard, or in some cases the bottom draw of a desk. The general practitioner, usually a GP, has a very powerful financial incentive to ensure that the patients are ordered pathology only from this particular pathology provider, and indeed a lot of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), and I did not hear previous speakers on the other side but I can imagine what they said, was also focussing quite rightly on the volume of services that are being ordered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agreed with the former member for Blaxland, Mr Keating, even less than I have agreed with the member for Calwell, but when he was the Treasurer in 1990, Mr Keating, in announcing the pharmaceutical benefits copayment&mdash;a foreign concept for the Australian Labor Party but it involved people actually paying something for a service that they received&mdash;in defending this measure, said that anything that is free leads to overuse. I have found, whether it has been in pathology or whether it has been in other areas of medical practice, that it is very unusual for a person to have services provided to them which are not necessary if they are paying something for that service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government, like the previous government, remains tethered to and very committed to the current Medicare arrangements, but as Australians who like to rise above ideological posturing we need to accept that if you give Australians a credit card, if you encourage them to go and use it and the government will underwrite it, we should not then be surprised when we then find that the suppliers of services, at least some of them, feel that they can abuse the privilege that has been given to them.</PARA>

This is the other thing that has not been focused upon enough in recent years, it is not just the providers of services, it is also consumers. There are some people who have a great capacity and great enthusiasm for visiting doctors and consuming as many services as they possibly can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment at least, most are having services provided in an environment where they have a credit card fully underwritten by the government that they can use as often as they like, whenever they like. Unfortunately, in the health care system, consumers are not always in a position to make an informed decision about whether they need the service. I am a medical practitioner myself, but if a neurosurgeon tells me I need something done in my brain stem, I am hardly in a position to say that I do not need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also seeks to streamline administration of approvals for approved pathology practitioners and approved pathology authorities. This amendment is really going to allow the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7188"> backdating of approvals in limited circumstances to make sure that Medicare benefits are not being disrupted when it is not really warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had instances where some pathology providers have got their paperwork in a week or two weeks beyond the due date and then both they and the patients who received the services suffered because the Medicare benefits had not been made payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The application must be no more than a month late. It must serve the public interest and late application must be for trivial inadvertence or something that is beyond the control of the pathology practice. Obviously, the government is not trying to encourage laziness in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that we are introducing in the bill are important also to the maintenance of the pathology agreement that was introduced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget and which limits pathology expenditure under Medicare to predetermined levels. The arrangements that were made last year in relation to the pathology agreement are really unprecedented in the history of relations between the medical profession and the Commonwealth government. This 1996&hyphen;97 budget measure heralded a new era, not only for pathology, but perhaps also for other sections of the medical profession. To a limited extent, in last year's budget, radiology providers also entered into such arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in the history of the Medicare benefits schedule, a negotiation was concluded with the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia and the Commonwealth to cap, or limit, the total expenditure for pathology to predetermined amounts for a three&hyphen;year period. If expenditure, over the three years, is below the six per cent agreed annual growth in outlays, then there is an increase in the Medicare benefits schedule fee for pathology the following year and if expenditure is above the six per cent growth, then there is going to be a commensurate reduction the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think great credit should be given to the maturity of the pathology providers and that section of the profession for entering into such an arrangement. I well recall in 1993 suggesting to general practitioners with then $2.2 billion in Medicare outlays in general practice that we ought to be doing something like that there. All I can say is I had to start sleeping on my side with the one or two knives I had in between my shoulder blades. I take my hat off to the pathologists for concluding these sorts of negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that we are introducing in the  Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997  really supplement or help to maintain the integrity and the importance of those arrangements which all of us want to see succeed. If that pathology deal does not succeed then we are all in trouble, as government, as pathology providers, as taxpayers and indeed as patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also tries to eliminate inappropriate practices within sections of the industry which have the potential to undermine, as I say, not only that landmark agreement, but confidence in the discipline of pathology generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to the remarks of the member for Calwell, it has annoyed me over the years that people have usually been quite happy to pay the surgeon's fee, a little less happy to pay the anaesthetist's fee&mdash;even though there is no greater faith you can have in somebody than to have a general anaesthetic&mdash;but they always whinge about paying the pathologist's bill. They always whinge about it. It is not until you have someone misdiagnose your pap smear or until you have somebody tell you that your wife's breast lump is nothing to worry about and it turns out three months later to be a missed malignancy thanks to poor histology that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7189"> you realise the value of a pathology service and a pathology service provided well. This bill will play a role in helping to maintain confidence in the discipline of pathology itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I would like to pay tribute to the Australian Association of Pathology Practices for the support that they have given to the bill. I know they have played a role in putting the bill together. They also make the point that one of the stupid aspects of the current legislation is that the Health Insurance Commission only has the power to go into licensed collection centres. It does not have the power to go into unlicensed collection centres. It is a bit like saying to the police, `You can raid a licensed brothel, but you can't raid one which is not.' I realise that is probably an unfortunate analogy, but it is the kind of stupidity with which we have been trying to deal. The commission has got, as I say, no power to enter unlicensed premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The display of a licence number or advice concerning a licence on the outside of the premises would at least let the commission know what sort of collection facility they are dealing with. The pathology providers themselves are only too happy to do anything they can to try to deal with those within their discipline who are bringing a bad name to the profession and the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its recent report on medifraud and inappropriate practice, the Australian National Audit Office noted attempts by some pathologists and a few radiologists to enter into kickback arrangements and indicated its concern that unnecessary services may be ordered by GPs in return for benefits from service providers or pathologists. This bill is much more likely to ensure that, where premises are occupied by an approved pathology provider, the provider must personally use them to render those professional services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, it will never be possible to devise a system which will not be the subject of exploitation by some providers or indeed some consumers. The medical profession, by definition, is a group of people who are reasonably intelligent and hardworking. Unfortunately, if they go off the rails and decide to misdirect their energies, they can be extremely good at getting around any kind of system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point&mdash;and I realise that I am lengthening my period of service on the backbench every time I speak&mdash;that, eventually Australia will have to reach the point where we realise that we are running a system which lends itself to abuse. No matter how hard we try to improve the legislation&mdash;and this legislation will be an improvement&mdash;the system will continue to be open to abuse by all kinds of people. Perhaps, in a decade or so from now, people will look back on what I and others have said in this regard and say, `Just maybe they were right'.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r275">Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill</XREF>  is about improving the efficiency of Medicare by bettering the contributions to health care by Australian pathology services. As the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) has mentioned, it is the product of negotiations between the coalition, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset and in his regrettable absence, I wish to congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on the consultative approach he has seemingly adopted in putting together this bill. The coalition went to the last election with a promise of being more inclusive, open and consultative than the then government. And yet, as I will make clear, during the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 debate, the alarm bells have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7190"> ringing amongst professional and industry groups about the government's apparent disregard for independent, expert opinion on policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to note that such a criticism does not appear to be justified in this instance. I have had feedback on this legislation from three pathology practices which operate in my electorate. Each of them indicated their general agreement with the changes proposed in this bill and have noted the importance of the two national pathology organisations being involved in the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the intended consequences of the bill is a bolstering of the powers of the authority of the Health Insurance Commission, the HIC, in its battle against overservicing. The Health Insurance Commission's 1995&hyphen;96 annual report makes it clear that one of its key functions is to detect, investigate and prevent inappropriate practice by service providers. This includes the services provided by pathologists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has expressed concern at the unlawful or unethical arrangements between some medical practitioners and pathologists that encourage the commission of pathology services where they are not really required. It has good reason to be concerned, Mr Deputy Speaker, because the practice of overservicing could become a major problem for the Medicare scheme. The government is anticipating that the measures contained in this legislation will cap the growth outlays on pathology services at six per cent a year, coincidentally the same as the provisional tax uplift factor&mdash;just an unhappy coincidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it gives no indication of the potential savings in its financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum, except to say that the bill will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reduce the level of inappropriate pathology activity that imposes costs on the government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, produced a report into inappropriate medical practice in 1996&hyphen;97. It noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An organisation should have an estimate of at least the order of magnitude of the leakage of funds it manages, in order to decide whether its response is proportionate to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Official figures show that the HIC had recovered&mdash;or was in the process of recovering&mdash;more than $1 million of Medicare benefits which had been paid incorrectly to service providers and patients in the year 1995&hyphen;96. However, this figure severely under&hyphen;represents the true cost to revenue of Medicare fraud in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996&hyphen;97 Auditor General's report on the Health Insurance Commission revealed that an estimated $135 million was lost in sham claims by medical practitioners and Medicare card holders in the year 1994&hyphen;95. Even more alarming than this figure was the comment by the ANAO that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small sample used to derive these estimates means that it is possible that the leakage could be up to three times higher than estimated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On that supposition from the ANAO, it is possible that Medicare fraud could have amounted to more than $400 million in one year. It is little wonder that our public health system promises to fall apart at the seams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While these figures are only estimates, the ANAO report stated that the Health Insurance Commission had agreed to consider releasing a report into Medicare fraud in this year of 1997. That will allow it to draw on three years of data and offer a more accurate assessment of this risk. The audit office supported such a move, saying that:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7191">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The knowledge of the magnitude or value of leakage is important both for management purposes and for accountability.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to note that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Publication of these estimates will assist the commission in its education role, and encourage greater attention amongst all stakeholders, to the importance of antifraud action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Two parties were identified as being the `primary beneficiaries' of appropriate medical practice. They include health consumers `who then receive the most suitable medical treatment', and the government, `if savings can be identified from inappropriately high levels of service'. To my knowledge, the Health Insurance Commission has yet to produce any such document. I wonder whether the Minister for Health and Family Services, had he been here seeing his legislation through the parliament, could advise us of any state of play on this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be acknowledged that it is difficult to quantify overservicing in pathology services in the figures I have mentioned. However, it is clear that the government must take decisive action if it is to combat Medicare fraud of any persuasion. As I mentioned, the government aims to cap growth in outlays on pathology at six per cent per annum. Anecdotal evidence from the United States of America suggests that the concept of capping may actually exacerbate the problem of ballooning costs in the health industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the October&hyphen;November 1996 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Healthcover</EMPHASIS>, it was noted that volume performance standards&mdash;that is, where a target rate is set for a year and future annual updates are measured against this figure&mdash;have increased the cost to the American equivalent of Medicare. That journal noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is that a single crude target does not have very strong incentives for individual physicians to change their behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, it may have some perverse incentives, because they say, `Well, the volume is going up by all those other guys and if I am going to maintain my income, I am going to have to increase my volume, because I know the next year it is going to be offset'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am interested to learn whether this concern was noted by the Minister for Health and Family Services when the decision to cap pathology costs was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not, nor does it pretend to be, the answer to all of Medicare's ills. It is just one part of what must be a comprehensive overhaul of our public health system if we are to avoid its total, or something approaching total, collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the year ending June 1996 a staggering 196 million Medicare services, including those for pathology services, were processed by the Health Insurance Commission&mdash;196 million in a year. The most recent census figures put Australia's resident population at approximately 18.3 million. A quick crunching of figures indicates that this equates to the provision of around nine medical services to every Australian man, woman and child in a year. That is getting well on the way to one visit to a medical practitioner a month, statistically. Of course, the reality is that most people do not visit a medical practitioner anywhere near this often. On the flip side, there are those who visit their GP and other practitioners more often than they go to their hairdresser or barber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I noted in a previous debate, the recent Productivity Commission report into private health insurance asserted that the demand side of the Medicare equation was in dire need of modification. These figures certainly give added weight to any such claim. The report stated very clearly that a lacklustre attitude towards our universal health care system now pervades 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7192"> the Australian community. As a general rule, we simply do not appreciate the true cost of the services made available to us through the so&hyphen;called `free' Medicare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most medical professionals do not condone overservicing, of course. Indeed, the 1996&hyphen;97 Auditor&hyphen;General's performance audit of the Health Insurance Commission found that most fraud detected by the HIC came from `complaints by the public or by members of the medical and pharmaceutical professions' who refused to condone what they saw as improper behaviour. Those pathologists who do practice ethically should not be concerned with the government's move to ensure that a notice identifying them as licensed pathologists is to remain visible on their premises. The Australian National Audit Office identified prevention of inappropriate practice as a key role of the HIC. By ensuring that licences identifying registered pathology centres are more visible, the Health Insurance Commission should become more pro&hyphen;active in preventing overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a buyer beware market, new subsection 23DNK(1) of the act will offer a greater level of protection to the consumer. Patients can still opt to have tests done at non&hyphen;licensed pathology centres, but they will not be eligible for a Medicare rebate on those services. That is entirely reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current penalty for non&hyphen;compliance by a pathology centre is a mere $100 fine. This amendment seeks to increase the penalty to $1,000. In the scheme of things, this figure represents a mild penalty, considering that an individual's health may be put at risk if tests are conducted in an environment that fails to meet good Australian pathology standards. However, a $1,000 fine will certainly be a greater deterrent to opportunistic practitioners than the current $100.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 13 of the bill amends section 133 of the principal act and will allow the HIC to prescribe certain penalties for minor offences. As with the changes to licensing, that will not detrimentally affect reputable pathologists. Rather, the government claims it will allow for more rapid and less expensive disciplining of minor pathology violations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence suggests that speedy action on the part of the HIC can lead to a reduction in inappropriate practice. For example, the Health Insurance Commission recently produced a report that suggested that where they had acted to caution practitioners suspected of inappropriate practice, they made savings of $40,000 of Medicare expenditure per intervention in the first year of counselling. The HIC extrapolated this figure to calculate that they may currently be achieving `savings of up to $19 million per year through counselling, through reduced expenditure which would have otherwise occurred.' If that figure is accurate, it represents&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, if that figure is accurate, it represents a very significant saving to revenue indeed. Information like that should be made available to the general medical community, if it is not already, to further encourage appropriate practices. But I understand that that does not occur. The Auditor&hyphen;General's report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The annual report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the Health Insurance Commission's annual report&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7193">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not contain any indication of the magnitude of leakage through fraud or the magnitude of inappropriate practice and the savings achieved through counselling.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was further noted that the 1995&hyphen;96 portfolio budget statement for Human Services and Health contained scant information on the cost to the community of inappropriate practice. This is also the case with the two subsequent budgets that were handed down by the present government. Surely if this information is at hand, it should be published widely to communicate the very real, and maybe ever growing, problems that plague Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is right to tighten up the provisions relating to `act of grace' payments where pathology organisations fail to have their licence renewed. The explanatory memorandum notes that there may be occasions where pathology centres fail to submit the necessary application and fee for the renewal of their licence because of circumstances beyond their control. This may be the case, but in the interests of maintaining uniform standards in pathology services this should be the exception and not the norm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as every other business is required to meet compliance cost obligations or face the consequences, so too should those in the field of pathology. Pathologists are aware of the onus to renew their licence on an annual basis and should therefore include a little forward planning in their calendars to prepare for that eventuality. Further, the Health Insurance Commission already alerts applicants whose licences are about to expire that they need to renew them immediately. The amendments in this bill will still allow for act of grace payments to be made to pathologists in certain circumstances, but it will now be the responsibility of the minister to authorise such payments. It is to be hoped that this will see a reduction in the costly and burdensome process involved with the backdating of Medicare benefits to the service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, this bill also contains a provision that will protect the rights of pathologists who are not granted act of grace payments by the minister. Item 11 in the bill stipulates that any person who unsuccessfully appeals to the minister for a review of a decision to not backdate an approval may put their case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that this bill be passed in order to maintain the integrity of our Medicare system. As I have outlined in earlier debates, overservicing is not common to the majority of medical practitioners. Only a fraction of professionals have come under the scrutiny of the Professional Service Review Scheme in the past. One would hope that by upping the penalties this figure will decline even further and any future growth will be headed off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also crucial that the Health Insurance Commission utilises the additional powers it will gain once this legislation is proclaimed. Professional bodies, including the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and the Royal College of Pathologists, reportedly share concern that the professional review division of the HIC is not as active in pursuing Medicare fraud as it should be. It is incumbent on the Health Insurance Commission to allay these fears by actively and indiscriminately identifying offenders.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr Costello</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On 22 April 1997, United Energy announced the introduction of its United Energy Surge Plan, which aims to provide residential consumers with `no&hyphen;cost' protection against damage caused by power surges. Two other Victorian electricity distribution companies offer `no cost' surge cover for residential customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACCC has informed me that United Energy's announcement followed discussions the Commission held with the Electricity Supply Association of Australia, several Victorian electricity distribution companies, the Victorian Regulator&hyphen;General and the Electricity Industry Ombudsman on the question of who bears liability for damage caused by poor quality of supply of electricity. Poor quality supply includes power surges and `brownouts'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACCC initiated these discussions following its investigations into a number of Victorian electricity distribution companies' offers of insurance products to consumers. These products were expressed to cover damage caused by poor quality supply of electricity where it was not the fault of the electricity company itself. The ACCC was concerned that information provided to consumers should not lead to any misunderstandings by them as to the full extent of their statutory rights under the Trade Practices Act. (See below.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The ACCC has informed me that at no time did it express a view that United Energy was in breach of the Trade Practices Act. Rather the Commission expressed the view that, while it does not object to the provision of insurance schemes or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7202"> related products in themselves, it has concerns that the information provided by electricity companies about such products should not lead to misunderstandings by consumers, either by express or implied representation, as to the full extent of their statutory rights under Part V Division 2 of the Act. In the Commission's view, these rights include an entitlement by consumers to be compensated for damage caused by unmerchantable quality electricity irrespective of whether the supplier is negligent or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence, the ACCC informed the electricity distribution companies that they might have to fully refund fees paid by consumers for protection plans which did no more than offer consumers what was already a statutory right. United Energy advised the ACCC that it would fully refund payments made by its customers for the previous PowerGuard Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The ACCC has written to electricity companies and regulators across Australia concerning the promotion of insurance schemes and the implied rights of consumers under Part V Division 2 of the Trade Practices Act. Such insurance schemes must be conveyed as additional to, and not in place of, all other statutory rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The ACCC is an independent statutory authority with responsibility, among other things, for administering the Trade Practices Act. The Government supports the efforts of the Commission in seeking to ensure that market conduct across the economy is consistent with the provisions of the Act and that consumers are safeguarded in their dealings with producers and sellers. The Government is also mindful that protection of the rights of consumers needs to be balanced against the costs this may impose on producers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) &amp; (b) Data from Airservices Australia on movements at Essendon Airport have been provided on a regular basis. This data shows that for the year 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7205"> to date aircraft movements at Essendon Airport have increased. The total movements for the year 1995&hyphen;96 was 61,030. Between 1 July 1996 to 30 April 1997 there have been 57,634 movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) In January 1997, media speculation about a large increase in the number of movements at Essendon Airport caused the Department of Transport and Regional Development to seek a complete analysis of monthly movement data at the airport for the 1995 and 1996 calender years. The analysis revealed that while there was an increase in movements at Essendon Airport, these increases could not be considered as substantial as reported in the media. The monthly statistics for 1 January to 30 May 1997 show that movements are continuing to increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FAC advised that this increase can be attributed to growth across all users of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Investigations into the claims made in previous questions concerning an increase in the numbers of "touch and go" movements revealed that separate statistics for "touch and go" movements are not kept by Airservices Australia. However, Airservices Australia estimates that there are on average about 10 "touch and go" movements per week including circuit operations and aircraft transiting Essendon from another airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Following the successful sale of long term leases for the operation of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth Airports, the Government announced that it is offering a further 15 Federal airports for simultaneous trade sale. Essendon Airport is one of the airports that will be offered for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expressions of interest in the 15 airports are expected to be sought around September/October 1997, following completion of Commonwealth due diligence and other sales preparatory work. Disposal of all 15 airports is expected to be completed by 30 June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A full evaluation of these and other issues will be conducted as part of the Government Sales Team's due diligence process which will precede the formal tender process for Essendon Airport. In light of these findings, appropriate decisions in relation to the issues will be taken at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government is committed to the sale of all Phase 2 airports. Decisions on the future ownership of Essendon Airport will be made in the context of a full evaluation of indicative and binding bids received from potential bidders.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals approved the registration of bifenthrin, after seeking the advice of Environment Australia in the usual way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Pesticides must satisfy rigorous environmental safety requirements before they can be registered in Australia. Bifenthrin was tested to determine its stability in water, stability to light, persistence and mobility in soils, rate of degradation in the field, and potential to bioaccumulate in fish. Toxicity tests were conducted on birds, fish, water fleas, shrimp, shellfish, bees, beetles, mites, rodents, rabbits and dogs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Users of pesticides must not exceed stipulated label rates and must observe all label precautions. These are legal requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a) The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy advises that such limits exist in the USA, where approvals exist for many uses, but that bifenthrin is not registered for use in The Netherlands and no corresponding Dutch limits have been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Bifenthrin is very highly toxic to aquatic life, but toxic effects are moderated by its tendency to associate tightly with sediment rather than remain in water. Bifenthrin may be lethal to sensitive

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) As I stated in my response to Question No. 1820, the Victorian Government has decided against relocating the Coode Island chemical storage facility to Point Lillias. Consequently there are now only two proposed facilities that are in the vicinity of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) Ramsar site (i.e. Point Wilson, and the proposed CSR dump). The Western Treatment Plant, managed by Melbourne Water, discharges waste under strict environmental licence conditions. The Victorian Environment Protection Authority has advised that discharge of toxic waste is not permitted under any circumstances and that wastewater plumes will be closely monitored for environmental impact, including any impact on the nearby Ramsar site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. It is proposed that the CSR dump will be located approximately 600 metres from, and outside the Ramsar site boundary, 3.5 kilometres from a site identified as a significant component of the East Asian&mdash;Australasian Shorebird Flyway. That site is contained within the Port Phillip Bay Ramsar site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In general, the management of Ramsar sites is the responsibility of State and Territory Governments, and at this stage, I do not consider it appropriate to intervene. The CSR dump proposal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7212"> is currently undergoing review through the Victorian Environmental Effects Statement (EES) process. The Commonwealth Environment Portfolio will review this document and advise me accordingly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Costing of Year 2000 activities is complex and most overseas governments are having difficulty accurately costing this project on a whole of government basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question to the former Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7216"> Small Business and Consumer Affairs is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware of the winding up of Sydney Appliance Centre Pty Ltd (trading as the `Sydney Appliance Centre'). I am advised that the Australian Securities Commission was notified on 25 June 1997 of the resolution to voluntarily wind up the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The appointed liquidator, Jirsch Sutherland &amp; Co, estimates there may be around 310 consumers affected by the company's insolvency, mostly in New South Wales and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task of winding up a company is generally a complicated and prolonged affair. The liquidator advises that it is too early at this stage to ascertain exactly how many consumers will be affected, and  the extent of any losses incurred. I am also advised that a number of the major trade suppliers have contacted customers to make alternative arrangements for the supply of goods for which pre&hyphen;payments have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the winding up process, the assets of the company will be realised, the creditors paid, any surplus distributed among shareholders, and the company dissolved. If there are insufficient funds to pay out all creditors, the liquidator will pay the creditors in order of priority as established by the Corporations Law. Unfortunately, many of the creditors involved will be ordinary unsecured creditors, and may therefore need to wait until preferred debts are paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) The Government is not in a position to intervene on behalf of consumers, as this is a matter for the liquidator at this stage. If contraventions of any laws are identified by the liquidator, these will be addressed in the liquidator's report to the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can reassure all consumers that the liquidation of a company is a strictly controlled process in which the interests of all creditors will be protected in accordance with the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (b) (i) The Government is committed to ensuring that consumers have the information they need to participate effectively in the marketplace. In line with the Government's pre&hyphen;election commitment, the Government recently approved a three year program to address the consumer education needs of rural and remote Australians; those with limited English; and Australians on low incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (b) (ii) The Government's role in consumer education, like that of the States and Territories, is broad in nature. I am unaware of education material which specifically addresses the issue of pre&hyphen;payments to a company that is subsequently wound up. However, in light of the winding up of this company, guidance on this matter will be included
