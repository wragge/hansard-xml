<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill is one of very substantial importance for rural Australia. The bill establishes the new farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment for farm families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill introduces an important element of the government's integrated rural policy, Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia, which will help to build a competitive, sustainable and profitable rural sector. The measures introduced in this bill will ensure that farm families experiencing financial hardship have equitable access to welfare support. The rural sector accounts for a major share of Australia's exports and provides the basis for much of the nation's value adding food and fibre processing industries. Its economic health and profitability is vital to the future prosperity of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rural sector has faced unprecedented challenges in recent years. While the top 20 per cent of farm businesses are performing well, data collected by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics show the sector, as a whole, has endured a long period of negative profitability. Severe drought, low commodity prices and cost pressures, particularly in the farm finance market, have created a very difficult operating environment for farm businesses.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My intention is not to talk down the sector and paint too gloomy a picture; it is simply to acknowledge that the circumstances our farmers have, and in many cases continue to endure, are very difficult. Their resilience in the face of adversity is, indeed, admirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, however, another side to the coin, for while there are challenges to be overcome, there is no poverty of opportunity for our farmers. They are efficient, competitive producers of high quality, clean food and fibre. They are ideally positioned to capture the significant opportunities presented by the rapid growth of Asian food markets and international trade reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has already been done by the government to position rural Australia to succeed in the years ahead. Our preparedness to rein in government expenditure and put the Commonwealth budget on track for surplus, together with the broader micro&hyphen;economic reforms in areas such as the labour market, is very good news for agriculture. The maintenance of low inflation and continuing reductions in real interest rates have allowed real progress to be made in reducing business input costs, and provided a boost to Australia's international competitiveness through the resulting decline in the value of the Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While much has been done to get the big picture right, there is still more the government can do to help secure the foundations of Australian agriculture. This bill is about investing substantial resources where it matters, just as the government has done through the natural resource trust and in areas such as quarantine and meat inspection reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia is a comprehensive package with four key objectives; firstly, to help farm businesses profit from change; secondly, to provide positive incentives for ongoing farm adjustment; thirdly, to encourage social and economic development in rural areas; and, fourthly, and very importantly, to ensure the farm sector has access to an adequate welfare safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia is the direct result of many government initiated reviews of rural policy which have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9024"> conducted over the past 18 months. These reviews have drawn on the expertise and experiences of many involved in the rural industry. Extensive consultation with state and territory governments, farmer groups and the public has contributed significantly in shaping the measures introduced today. The initiatives in this bill, the farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment, have received widespread and generous endorsement from key farming bodies such as the National Farmers Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, the interrelationship between rural welfare and business policy objectives has not been fully appreciated. In a sense, the integration of family life and welfare with the management of the farm business has been taken for granted. This interrelationship needs to be recognised in addressing the welfare needs of farming families. It is imperative that we do, if we are to ensure the current transition in outlook from the family farm to the family farm business runs to a successful conclusion. This means also that welfare measures need to be distinct from measures targeted at improving the profitability of farming businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been carefully designed to meet the coalition's longstanding commitment to address these important welfare issues while at the same time taking account of the uniqueness of family farm business structures and the vulnerability of farming families to natural events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as importantly, the measures contained in this bill offer carefully targeted assistance to those who wish to adjust out of farming. Additionally, it provides income support for those farm families who find themselves suffering financial hardship as a result of exceptional circumstances which are beyond their capacity to manage. The new farm family restart scheme is the government's key program for delivering income support to the farm sector. It also provides adjustment assistance to farmers who wish to leave the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments offer an innovative approach to assisting farm families. This legislation provides farmers with the opportunity to give serious consideration to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> future of the farm and family without having to rush decisions. It recognises that it takes time to come to grips with the possibility of a future that does not entail farm ownership. It allows them to keep working the farm while they review their situation. It relieves the tremendous pressure than can arise from literally not being able to put food on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm family restart scheme will provide a decision support system for farmers considering exiting the industry as well as those who need the breathing space to refocus their farm enterprises. This scheme provides access to professional advice for farmers to help them assess the future viability of their business. The farm family restart scheme will begin on 1 December 1997. I will now provide the House with details of the features of the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Income support will be provided to low income farmers who cannot borrow further against their assets. This support will be equivalent to the newstart allowance, plus partner allowance where appropriate. Very importantly, and I know this is of great interest to the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy over there&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, so he could put that gloating dial in front of a whole lot more people. Very importantly, under this arrangement, there is no requirement for the farm family to put the farm on the market or undergo an activity test as would be the case if they were seeking support through the social security system. This support will be available to eligible farmers for up to one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recipients will face an obligation to obtain professional advice on the future viability of the farm business as well as ongoing professional advice to assist the family focus on either re&hyphen;building the business where this is possible or leaving the industry. The government will provide financial support to the farm family to access this professional advice, which may include career counselling.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9025">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A re&hyphen;establishment grant of up to $45,000 will be available to eligible farmers. This grant will provide positive incentives for farmers to leave farming before their assets are severely depleted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I emphasise that eligible farmers will be able to apply for the re&hyphen;establishment grant only during the first two years of the operation of the farm family restart scheme. To receive the grant, those who apply and meet the eligibility criteria will need to sell their farm within 12 months of ceasing income support or from the date of their application if income support is not sought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The re&hyphen;establishment grant will be subject to a more generous assets test than past re&hyphen;establishment grants, but any income support provided under the farm family restart scheme will be deducted from the grant. The new assets test will allow farmers to have up to $90,000 in assets to qualify for the maximum grant. The grant will phase down by $2 for every $3 in assets above this threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers who have accessed the scheme for less than six months and withdraw will be eligible to apply to rejoin the scheme to complete the 12 months. Farmers who withdraw from the scheme after six months will not be able to rejoin. Support paid under this scheme will be provided as a grant&mdash;not as a loan scheme, which was proven ineffective under the former government's farm household support scheme. It resulted in low income farmers incurring debts to the government which they simply did not have the capacity to repay. This government has, in fact, decided to wipe the slate clean in regard to the household support scheme in days gone by and write off those debts. Those who have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> repaid&mdash;there are only a few of them&mdash;will receive a reimbursement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Farm Household Support Act 1992 is also being amended to introduce the exceptional circumstances relief payment. The exceptional circumstances relief payment will be an income support payment available to farmers in areas declared to be in exceptional circumstances. Its rate of payment will also be equivalent to the newstart allowance, plus partner allowance where appropriate. It will be subject to the same income and off&hyphen;farm assets tests that apply to drought relief payment to ensure it is targeted to farm families who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of the exceptional circumstance. The exceptional circumstances relief payment will be equivalent to, and replace, the current drought relief payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exceptional circumstances relief payment gives recognition to the fact that there are exceptional circumstances which are beyond the scope of normal farm risk management strategies. It will be available to farmers suffering financial hardship as a result of rare and severe events including, but not restricted to, extreme drought. It will allow farming families to focus on the task of managing their businesses in circumstances which are challenging enough without the added burden of worrying about how they will meet their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day living costs. The duration of this payment will be determined on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis according to the nature of the declared exceptional circumstance. A 12&hyphen;month recovery period will continue to apply for exceptional drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers currently in drought exceptional circumstance areas and receiving the drought relief payment will progressively move to the exceptional circumstances relief payment. As their drought exceptional circumstances certificates expire, they will be issued with exceptional circumstances certificates. Farmers completing their recovery period for the drought relief payment or reaching the end of exceptional circumstances relief payment support will be eligible to apply for the farm family restart scheme if they wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will honour its commitments under the rural adjustment scheme. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9026"> Farmers will still be able to apply for re&hyphen;establishment assistance under the rural adjustment scheme until 30 November 1997. This will provide a smooth transition to the new farm family restart scheme when it commences on 1 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is an essential element in the government's rural policy platform. It is closely linked to other measures in the Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia package which will help to maximise the sector's contribution to the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of the nation, especially rural and regional communities. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just finish my remarks by quoting some material from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Herald</EMPHASIS>  which sums up very accurately the problems that have been created for Australian families by this Howard government's cuts to child care. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Back in April, the child-care centre had broken the bad news to the parents. The fees would increase steeply as a result of the Federal Government's decision to withdraw . . . subsidies from community child-care centres.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The fees for this family for two children had gone up to $267 a week on 1 July this year. The implication for this family was that the mother decided it was no longer worth her while to work. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kellie earned $345 net as an accounts clerk . . . It was a job she loved for the usual reasons&mdash;social, financial and self-esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I didn't want to leave but I couldn't afford to work," says Kellie. "Basically, after expenses, I would be working for $20 a week."</PARA>

In fact, they have to be kept quiet during the day because Kellie's husband is a shift worker.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) is demon 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9027"> strating with the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R276">Child Care Payments Bill</XREF>  that Labor has now stooped to the SSS approach to policy development. That is the `shower singing syndrome'&mdash;that type where only the person making the noise thinks it sounds okay. That is the approach that Labor is now taking to policy development in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was nothing constructive offered by the member for Jagajaga, just the SSS approach&mdash;the shower singing syndrome&mdash;as a substitute for policy development. The rest of the world hears what is being said and thinks, `Gee, that's not that flash,' but it sounds good to the person making the noise. So I would encourage those opposite to think a little more positively and creatively about the issues facing the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Child Care Payments Bill  is part of the government's overall program to enhance family life. Contrary to what the member for Jagajaga is suggesting, this government is about making choices available for families, choices that support the decisions families make about how they wish to manage their own affairs and to raise their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A weekend or two ago, I noted the front page headline in Sydney's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> suggesting that `good times are here again'. That headline might have been related to the rising number of imports of champagne, but there are, indeed, good times here again. The one area where I think people understand the constructive and positive work the government is doing is the child-care area. The people that I speak to in my community understand that, with a $10&half; billion deficit left to this government by the former Labor government, some tough decisions had to be made, difficult decisions, but decisions driven by trying to refine the policies and the programs that this nation offers to its people in a way that they can continue to be afforded for the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about things disappearing but, if you cannot afford them, that is when they become a tenuous and very vulnerable part of your life. When Labor looked at the Australian electorate before the election and said that we were on track for a surplus, we were not. We ended up having an enormous deficit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the budget, which this government has had to address. So when you start hearing those opposite talking about cuts in expenditure, bear in mind these are cuts from forward estimates that were phoney figures because in the last year of the Labor government they missed them by $10&half; billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you start looking forward into the estimates for future years, how can you say there have been cuts? Labor tries to make its forward estimates sound credible when there is this enormous gaping Beazley black hole in the figures for the base year. These things seem to be overlooked by those opposite, but this government has had to deal with that problem and provide a child-care system that supports choices families make. That is what this  Child Care Payments Bill  is about. It is good policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a good policy because the government is making sensible decisions that bring about a fairer, more focused child-care assistance arrangement where the community's values are more in line with government policy, where the programs that we are offering recognise the real circumstances of people. They can be delivered in the longer term because the nation can afford them. The policies are sound and they are affordable. They do not need to be whisked away from the Australian taxpayer and the Australian community because they are not affordable; these are affordable, forward looking policy reforms that are incorporated in this  Child Care Payments Bill .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Protecting that safety net is also a very important part of our lives, and this government is taking this very seriously. It has done that by making sure that the assistance that is available goes to the people who need the support, that the taxpayer funds that are made available are targeted to those people whose circumstances and needs warrant it. Most people welcome that. That is a renewal of policy. That is an understanding that largess is not a substitute for good policy. Labor, in its child-care arrangements, said, `Build more child-care centres. Build them anywhere you like. Become property developers. Have a block of land that looks like it might support a child-care facility, that the local planning 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9028"> arrangements will give you that permit. Go and build it and then try to fill it up with people, regardless of whether the child-care centre is actually required.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just building child-care centres, looking to all of the taxpayers and saying, `We've got to keep all of these things filled up, so anyone who wants to front up and have some child care, just come on down. The taxpayers will fund that,' is not the way to run good policy. So the government said, `Child care is very important to Australian families. How can we best deliver it? How can we make sure it keeps pace with the needs of the Australian community?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recognised that in some areas of the community there are too many child&hyphen;care places available for the level of demand, and in other areas there are not enough. In the community that I represent, we had too many child-care centres. There was an oversupply of places. All of the child&hyphen;care centres were finding it difficult to stay financially viable because there were just too many places. If I am not mistaken, in the area that I represent and in the area the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) represents at least two child-care centres have had planning permits issued&mdash;so they can build more centres&mdash;when we have an oversupply as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said, `Let's plan the provision of these places so they are available when they are needed.' That is why this bill incorporates 7,000 new places for each of the next two years across the nation, but not 7,000 places that will just be dropped somewhere that suits the property developer. No, that is silly. That undermines the system entirely. It makes all centres vulnerable. This is a program that is supported by a national planning system, where funding is prioritised to areas where it is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have growth in the participation rate and the labour market or if we have growing communities or changing demographics within the communities, we now have the planning instruments to direct those child-care places to where they are needed. That strikes me as frightfully sensible and, again, it is good policy. It is making sure that those services are available to those who need them 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and that the community's needs for child-care places are matched by their availability. It is not just `let it rip', because `let it rip' is no good for anybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the government is convinced the community supports the targeting of assistance, in this bill there are arrangements to make sure that non-work related care is provided for. If people are not looking for work, in training or at education but they need some help with their child&hyphen;care arrangements, that is provided for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite cry crocodile tears&mdash;crocodile tears you do not see when they are in the shower singing to themselves about their own policies&mdash;about how horrible this government has been. Yet we have said that, for those non-work related places, 20 hours a week are available, and that has been provided for in this package. Those opposite wanted to make it eight. The average amount used across the nation is 14 or 15 hours a week. So clearly those people who needed that type of care would have missed out under Labor, but this government said, `If people have engagements, if they require some respite support or if they need to carry out other matters in their lives, some assistance is available, but it is capped at 20 hours a week.' Those opposite wanted to make it eight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is very important to mention is that this government recognises that some families have particular needs. Sadly, throughout our nation, there are children in family circumstances where the kids are at risk of abuse or neglect, of basically not getting the care they require. Most states operate child protection systems. When things get really rotten, someone from the state comes and makes arrangements for the proper care of that child. What has developed in this country is that the child&hyphen;care system has been used as a bit of a stopgap measure, where those kids who are at risk of abuse or neglect or have special needs could be placed in child care. These are some of the challenges this nation is facing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, while the family was going through some traumas, often the best care, the best feed, the best attention and the best support for the child's development was actually in a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9029"> child-care centre. We have recognised that as well in this bill and have said that, for those children who are at risk of abuse or neglect or who have some particular needs, that 20&hyphen;hour limit can be put to one side. This is about the kids. This is about supporting the kids' needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only negative reaction I have had about that 20&hyphen;hour cap is from people who think it is too much. People have rung my office and said, `I work. I'm out most of the week trying to earn a living and you're making child-care support available for people who aren't out working&mdash;and 20 hours a week of it. That's too much.' When you explain to them that most people do not use that amount, that their needs fluctuate or that the people who require that support are in difficult circumstances, that is fine. That is generally accepted. But let us understand that, in the broader community, there is some view that 20 hours is actually too much, that the government has overdelivered, that it is providing too much assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you go further into looking at this package, you see that it deals with special needs kids. Innovation and responsive care in child care is a hallmark of the coalition government's approach. For instance, Play Works, Noah's Ark Family Resource and Toy Library for Children with Special Needs are receiving over $900,000 for the three years to April 2000 to provide children's services resource development officers in the Frankston, Mornington, Bayside and Stonnington municipalities. Their aim is to increase access for all children's services offered to children with disabilities and children from non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Centres are taking up that support so that all families, even those that have children with additional needs, can be accommodated within this system&mdash;so support is there and the child-care system is responsive to their needs. That is in this package as well. When you hear people saying that it is the end of the world as we know it, just think about the extra assistance being made available to those families who, because of their circumstances, were not able to access those services and programs that other people were able to.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far, 73 child-care services have received consultancy information and advice to support the inclusion of children with additional needs in that service area. There are already 19 children with disabilities and two children from non-English speaking backgrounds being supported after the program has been in operation for three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I travel around the child-care centres in the electorate of Dunkley, I am refreshed by the positiveness of their approach. You have heard those opposite talking about how the community sector just cannot cope with being put on the same level and treated in the same manner as those child&hyphen;care facilities in the private sector. I have spent a bit of time in my life working in the public sector, and I must say that nobody in the public sector pulls their pants on any differently to those in the private sector. This condescending approach that you hear from those opposite&mdash;that somehow people in the public sector are less able to deliver quality and affordable care and are less able to be competitive with those in the private sector&mdash;needs to be rejected outright as an insult and a misrepresentation of the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mandy Gatliff from the Frankston City Council was kind enough to make some time available. We toured all of the community facilities of the City of Frankston, and I was very impressed. They are offering first&hyphen;class services to the citizens of the electorate that I represent&mdash;and they don't pull their pants on any differently. They are proud of their capacity to provide quality, affordable, first&hyphen;class care to the families of Dunkley. So when you start hearing that the world is coming to an end because people are on equal footing, think twice because that is just condescending nonsense from those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has a real commitment to child care. Not only are we spending an estimated $742 million this year on child&hyphen;care assistance to allow fees to be reduced for parents and guardians who have their children cared for in long day care, family day care, occasional care, and in some educational facilities, but also this amount is up by six per cent on last year's figure. That represents a real growth of four times that of the level of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9030"> price rises. And we are being told we are having a cut. Just remember that when those opposite talk about cuts, they are comparing the figures with their phoney, fudged forward estimates figures which are so much a hallmark of their SSS approach to policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this bill to the House. I would encourage those opposite to do away with their SSS approach to policy development&mdash;their shower singing syndrome&mdash;where the noises they make sound great only to those making the noises, but to the rest of us those noises sound like utter nonsense. They should put that to one side and get on with some constructive effort in this area. The families in this nation could benefit from those opposite taking a more constructive and positive approach.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and to oppose the provisions of the child&hyphen;care payments legislation. Twenty&hyphen;five years or so ago when my children were born, I was a tradesman and my wife was a schoolteacher. In those days if you were on a tradesman's salary, you and your spouse could make a choice about whether your spouse stayed home&mdash;in these more modern times, whether you stayed home&mdash;and cared for your children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A person living in Sydney in those days could buy a house for about 1&half; years of that person's salary. Indeed, the house that my wife and I bought a few years before Mark was born cost me $10,300 and my salary as a telephone technician was $8,500 per annum. The same house now costs about $200,000 and a telephone technician's salary is about $35,000. That represents a quantum leap in the cost of housing in the largest city in this country. The situation in Melbourne is not all that different; Canberra is getting to be very expensive; and Brisbane is catching up with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The choices that people had when I was a new parent are very different from the choices that my children will face and the choices that some of their friends who are already married and have children are facing in Sydney today. That is caused by changing economic times 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a whole range of things. But for the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) and the government to come in here and say that the government wants to give people choices by reducing the amount of child&hyphen;care assistance that parents will have is just a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has changed from when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) grew up in Earlwood in my electorate to the situation in Earlwood now is the economy of this country. Tradesmen do not have the choice they used to have because the changes that have taken place in this country mean that, if parents want to give their children a roof over their heads, both parents have to work. That is the simple fact of the matter. That might be unpalatable to some people; I think it is unfortunate. But that is the reality of life. What we as a government tried to do was to find ways to assist people who had children to work, where both parents wanted to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not only about economics but also about a quantum change in the views that women have on their roles in life, and quite rightly so, and the supportive role that men have in this regard. This is also a factor of the vast problem with marriage breakdown in this country where about one in three marriages now break up. In the main, women are the custodial parents and they have to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much as the coalition would like to tell us that there is a whole army of women out there living on the supporting parents benefit, that is not true. You exist on that; you do not live on that. If the greatest asset that this country has is our children, then what we should be doing is trying to ensure that, in their formative years, kids get the best chance that they can get in life. With both the societal and economic changes that have taken place in this country, that means that a child's parent or parents are likely to be working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, we have got away from one of those other problems of the 1950s&mdash;the problem of the latchkey children&mdash;because child care is a way of helping to provide care in a safe and caring environment for preschool children and for schoolchildren whose parents have jobs which mean that the children need care before and after school hours.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9031">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government does not like that because it does not fit into the entrepreneurial view that people such as the member for Dunkley and the Prime Minister have that, somehow or other, we can flip back to the 1950s. It is all right, I suppose, that the Prime Minister's wife does not work, and those opposite would like to see that everybody else's wife did not work. They are doing all right with unemployment in trying to make sure that women lose jobs. If I were living in a taxpayer&hyphen;provided house at Kirribilli on the harbour front in Sydney, that would be a very nice situation. But the view from Kirribilli is very different from the view from Campsie and Lakemba in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What people should make no bones about is that these bills represent a further reduction and further step in the government's policy of doing away with child care, if they can. It is not about being positive and creative, as the member for Dunkley tried to say it was, and it is certainly not about giving people positive choices. These bills do in fact give low income parents choices: whether one of the members of the family works or does not or whether the kids go to a child&hyphen;care centre or not. The choice those low income earners in my electorate have is to not be able to send their children to child care because they cannot afford to send their kids to child-care centres any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can try to disguise its intentions by saying it is committed to helping working parents secure quality child care and that the bills represent a major step forward for the provision of child-care services, and that is what the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said in her second reading speech. But no-one should be fooled. You only have to look at the dollar terms. Less Commonwealth money is going to be spent on child care in 1997-98. Therefore, there has to be a reduction somewhere in what is being offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have known since the 1996-97 budget what the government had in mind. These pieces of legislation are putting the finishing touches to what the government started then. What was that? Last year, the government cut $500 million from child care. This year, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government will be cutting a further $321 million. The government claim to have as their objective `assistance for families with dependent children to participate in the work force and in the general community through supporting access to affordable quality child care'. Over two years, they have whacked $800 million out of the system. I hope they never try to hurt us. If that is how they are helping low income families, young families with children in child care, young families battling to buy a home and young families battling to give their kids some future security&mdash;by taking $800 million out of the system&mdash;let us pray they never turn on them. If they nick $800 million to help, my goodness, you would not want to try to hinder them. You certainly would not do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a joke, albeit a bad one, if it did not adversely affect so many people. Most importantly, the people that this affects are working women in lower income families. The middle class and the upper middle class probably still have a choice as to whether one or other of the spouses works when the children are growing up. But for working&hyphen;class families and low income families there is no choice at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claim they have carried out extensive research and consultations with the child-care industry and with community organisations and families and, as a result, will be introducing a new national planning system. That sounds pretty good, but they say that this assessment of needs is due to be undertaken this month. They have a big planning process and they are going to do it this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That all sounds very fine until you realise that future decisions on how to slice the ever diminishing child-care cake will be based on this assessment and some will miss out. For example, new places established in areas other than those identified as a result of those processes will not attract assistance in 1998 and 1999. So, we will have a planning process. The trouble is that not everyone is going to be in the process. What we have now is vast uncertainty in this whole area. Once 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9032"> again, the people who will probably miss out will be those low income working&hyphen;class families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people who are finding it very difficult to find a job if one of the family is out of work, this is yet another uncertainty put into their lives. It is another impediment to them achieving what used to be the great Australian dream of buying your own home&mdash;a dream that, in the 1970s, I could achieve as a tradesman; a dream that, in the inner city of Sydney now, where I grew up, is getting harder and harder for a tradesman. Certainly a tradesman who is a telephone technician in 1997, who is married and wants a family would not be able to make that choice of having his children stay at home when he has a mortgage of over $150,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that the government needs to stop prevaricating about and the point that people like the member for Dunkley should stop trying to spread disinformation about is that, if less money is going to be expended on child care, fewer people are going to be able to benefit or the same number of people are going to receive a lower level of assistance. I do not know how the government has organised the loaves and fishes trick of the 1990s, but if you take $800 million out and you have the same or more people in the system, then they are all going to get less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the government has a plan to drive people out. The government wants to do the same thing with child care that it has done with unemployment. What is happening with unemployment now is that people are just not participating any more. They are opting out. They have tried to get a job and they cannot get one so they are giving up. You will have the same thing in child care. People who cannot afford to go to the child-care centres now will drop out. They will have a choice forced upon them, not a choice that they would prefer to make themselves, because many people are very close to or past the point where they can afford to keep their children in child-care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a lot of knowledge about child care in my electorate, and I can tell you that I have been to meetings in Hurstville, Earlwood and Campsie at which there were 400 or 500 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people. These were not the people that the government would say were rent&hyphen;a&hyphen;crowd. These are ordinary mothers and fathers who are concerned about the future for their kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One woman who came into my office had had a terrible experience. She and her husband had had three children in child-care centres. This woman had been happily working in a financial institution. She was not a person who went to meetings; she was not a whinger&mdash;as the government would say the other people were. Thinking that they should try the changes that the government was making, she rang the numbers the government said to ring to see whether the new system could help them continue on the way they were. She was told by the government department that she would have to pay over $300 a week for child care&mdash;and she was a clerk in a financial institution. She talked it over with her husband and, like the instance mentioned by the member for Jagajaga that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I think that was about a family at Mount Pritchard&mdash;they decided that the only sensible thing for her to do was to resign from her job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, she discovered that the advice she was given by the department over the phone was wrong and that she would have been entitled to some assistance. By then, it was too late and she had left her job. She and her husband were out on a limb. The government had given her the wrong advice. She had left her job and was in strife. They followed the revised advice that we got the government to put them on to, and they pursued some other options for assistance which they have been told they would qualify for. They completed forms. They produced documentation. They filled in more forms and produced more documents. And she still got nothing, and she is most unsatisfied. She has lost her job and she has been given the bureaucratic run&hyphen;around. And that is what the government says is positive and creative? That is what the government says is a choice? It is a choice of madness&mdash;that's what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of what happens to child&hyphen;care services occurred in the City of Canterbury in my electorate. It is characterised by a high proportion&mdash;about one&hyphen;third&mdash;of families 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9033"> on low incomes of below $30,000 a year. In the council's long day care centres, 66 per cent of the children receive child&hyphen;care assistance. Already, withdrawal of the operational subsidy has disadvantaged lower income families in those centres. It has restricted their choices of quality child care and has forced some of them to leave work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subsidies mean a lot to the people in those council run centres. Where the council has had to increase its fees, families have had to withdraw their children&mdash;nine children were removed from one centre alone&mdash;or cut back the number of hours their children attend, which obviously cuts back the amount of work they can do. Many have complained and protested. I know that, because they turn up in my office to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not happening just in my electorate. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services recently conducted a nationwide survey to collect data from long day care centres and the users of those centres to analyse the impact of the government's changes to the economy of child care. The survey of 1,084 child&hyphen;care centres showed that fee increases, brought on by the government's funding cuts, are forcing many women to withdraw from the work force or cut back from full-time to part-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fees in community owned centres have increased by up to $18 per child place per week. In four states the weekly fee for one child in full-time care is $170 or more. More than four families in each centre have reduced hours or left the centre because of rising costs. More than 25 per cent of centres have reduced staff in an attempt to keep fees down. Seventy three per cent of parents exiting care cited increasing fees as the reason. Sixty&hyphen;seven per cent of families leaving centres are now using informal care. Seventy-four per cent of parents report that fees are due to increase again before the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout Australia families are being affected, as the cost of care is being pushed beyond the reach of ordinary working families. To remain affordable, centres are being forced to reduce costs and, as a consequence, the quality of care is going down, if the centres are to be affordable for their clients.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many families need to leave the children in care if the parents are to continue in the work force. They can barely afford it now, but they know that these costs are going to go up and up. As I said earlier, the only creative choice that the government is giving a lot of working&hyphen;class families in Australia is to return to the latchkey child problem. I do not think that anyone would like to see that, particularly nowadays when life for young children in the large cities of our country is becoming a bit unsafe. You are not quite sure where you would like to have your children cared for any more. The advantage, particularly of community based child&hyphen;care centres, was that the parents could have a level of confidence in the care that their children were getting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this bill is very flawed. It is a disgraceful thing to say that it provides families with choice. It might provide middle&hyphen;class and wealthy families with choice but, for working&hyphen;class families, the choice is Buckley's. That is not good enough. It is not good enough for the parents of Australia, but it certainly is not good enough for the children of Australia. The government should really reconsider any further cuts they are going to make into this area of care. The amount of $800 million over two years is certainly enough. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Child care is a very important issue for many Forde residents and a matter in which I take a great deal of care and interest. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), in this House on Monday, said that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> she deplored the government's lack of consultation with the child&hyphen;care industry. I found this quite strange because I know we have a very hardworking minister here, in the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who has consulted a lot with electorates all over Australia, and I was pleased to have the Minister for Family Services visit my electorate last month to speak directly with the child&hyphen;care providers and their families. Such is the approach of our government and our ministers that they are keen to meet directly with local residents in order to keep in touch with Australians, their wants and their needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in sharp contrast to the approach taken by the previous government. It is a refreshing change that the people in Forde have welcomed and appreciated. It is true to say that there have been a number of changes in the child&hyphen;care industry since we came into government, and it is also true to say that these changes were necessary because the Labor government left the sector in a complete mess. The cost of child care to the public purse had absolutely skyrocketed and child&hyphen;care centres were a growth industry with centres springing up overnight with very little planning and restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did hear the member for Jagajaga also say that when they came into government there was a 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding of child&hyphen;care places. If this were true, then all I can say to the member for Jagajaga is that her party did not have a plan nor a consideration for families really needing child care. In my electorate we have child&hyphen;care centres closing up at the moment. They were allowed to grow all over the place and most of them were only half full, and there are not enough children in my electorate to fill these places. I feel very sorry for these small businesses, but it was through lack of planning from the Labor Party that they are in that position at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also an increasing public concern about the uncontrolled growth in the industry and the quality of care offered, and whether the care is really being targeted to those families who really need it. Since coming to office we have worked to address those concerns in a fair and equitable way. As the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9035"> minister said in a recent speech to the National Conference of Supplementary Children's Service Workers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overarching vision of our child care reform is to provide equitable, affordable, flexible and high quality child care, and to ensure that the growth in the child care sector is sustainable. Children are Australia's future&mdash;ensuring the best possible care for children is a national priority.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not surprisingly, though, Labor's contribution to the debate has been yet another scare campaign. There has been so much misinformation and so many downright lies spread about our child&hyphen;care initiatives, causing concern for many families. Contrary to what Labor has claimed, we are not slashing, we are not denying families who genuinely need care and we do not have a philosophical bent against child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is here to stay, and there is no doubt about that. We, as a government, believe that families should have access to a full range of options when it comes to making decisions about the care of their children. That means not only the various choices for professional care but also being able to make the choices for one parent to care for their children full time if that is their preference. Our family tax package, introduced on 1 January this year, makes that option financially feasible. Our approach is about genuine choice. It appears that is something that the Labor Party just cannot comprehend. For years they pushed their own social and political agenda on the Australian people&mdash;and let me remind them that that was comprehensively rejected in the March election last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Child Care Payments Bill that we are discussing help create greater flexibility with regard to families of children with disabilities. These families will be exempt from the 20&hyphen;hour per child per week child&hyphen;care assistance for non&hyphen;working related care. As someone who has worked closely with disabled people and their families for 15 years before entering parliament, I have some understanding of the demands they face. As I said in my maiden speech, I have a great deal of admiration for any parent and family who cares for disabled children. It is a tough job and the pressures are many and varied. It is absolutely crucial that all govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments provide as many support services as possible, and these services were terribly neglected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, access to child care for both the disabled child and any siblings is extremely important. This amendment recognises this special need and is indicative of the government's approach. In general terms, I believe the 20&hyphen;hour limit for non&hyphen;work related care is extremely fair. I believe it reflects community sentiment that child care should, at least in some sense, be targeted to those who need it the most. There seems to have been an attempt in recent times to tell parents that institutionalised care is best for their child and that their child should be in care, regardless of their capacity to care for them full time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is entirely appropriate that we put a limit on access to subsidised care for those children whose parents are not working, except in special circumstances. It sends a message that care by a parent in the home is not second to institutional care, and that it should be encouraged for those who are able to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that 20 hours is a fair limit. We should all remember, especially as those opposite bleat about cutbacks, that the Labor government actually planned a 12&hyphen;hour limit. Yes, that is right, a 12&hyphen;hour limit with no similar exceptions for families with children with disabilities. On this issue, as on many others, Labor has a huge credibility problem when they criticise the important and fair measures we have taken as a government. They created the problems, and all they can do is criticise the solutions. There is no contribution except criticism&mdash;that is all we hear. That should be the Labor Party's motto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important amendment in this bill effectively allows a 28&hyphen;day grace period for retrospective claims for child&hyphen;care assistance or the child&hyphen;care rebate in respect of children who have not been immunised. This time will allow parents to either commence a catch&hyphen;up program, provide evidence of medical contraindication or declare a conscientious objection&mdash;once again, a fair measure to provide greater flexibility and ensure that families are not disadvantaged.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9036">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to tie child&hyphen;care assistance to immunisation is one that I believe has been warmly welcomed in the community. because the community recognises what the previous government did not: that our current immunisation levels are just not good enough. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for his absolute commitment to raising immunisation levels in order to protect our children. He has a dogged determination to tackle a problem that for too long has been left in the too&hyphen;hard basket, and he has the support of both sides of this House in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to support him in that by promoting immunisation with Forde families through a special newsletter which contains an immunisation schedule and record. It is my way, as a local MP, of helping local families and making them aware of the importance of immunisation. My second youngest daughter was unfortunate to contract whooping cough as a very  small baby before she was able to be immunised against it. It was absolutely heartbreaking for the whole family to watch her suffering and struggling for breath. She was lucky enough to make a full recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past year alone many Australian babies have not been so lucky. The importance of ensuring that children in formal child care have been immunised cannot be overstated, not only for the child's sake but especially for the younger siblings who may not even be old enough to be immunised. I am proud to be part of a government that places such emphasis on the welfare of our children and the needs of Australian families. Amendments such as these reflect our practical and fair approach to ensuring a better, more flexible and safer child&hyphen;care system for all families.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) to the Child Care Payments Bill. In doing so, I say to the previous speaker, the member for Forde (Mrs Elson), that the endeavours of the Labor Party over the 13 years to March last year were clearly to create a question of choice in the ability of families to access child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this legislation is that it is about rolling back the question of choice. I refer not just to the growth in places over that 13 years but, more importantly, to the creation of options and genuine choice in the availability of a range of children's services. Initially, obviously, support from the Labor Party went to the community based sector. But, clearly, in the 1990s not only did we build on our success in the community based sector and in supporting family day care but we extended fee relief to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference between the Labor Party and the current government is that, in creating those options, that choice for families, we also sought to focus on the all&hyphen;important issue of quality. It is for that very reason that, in extending fee relief to the private sector, we sought to develop a system of accreditation. That accreditation was clearly about ensuring that, in return for fee relief to the private sector, private sector operators who sought to avail themselves of assistance fronted up to the need for quality services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, I very much support the condemnation of the Howard government expressed in the second reading amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga. I do so because I believe that the intent of this bill and of the decisions of the Howard government through their budget processes is to cut child care by a massive $820 million in their first two budgets. In essence, this will lead to less affordable, lower quality child care and the closure of services. This will include services in my electorate of Batman in the northern suburbs of Melbourne and, unfortunately, services in many communities which have a non&hyphen;English speaking background. There are more than 30 child&hyphen;care centres around Australia with specific services targeted at ethnic communities. In my part of Melbourne there are Lebanese, Indo&hyphen;Chinese, Italian, Greek and Turkish centres which will be badly hurt by these cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues in this debate have therefore sought to highlight the various negative features of these bills and the basis for the concerns outlined in the opposition's second reading amendment. These concerns include, firstly, the way they limit the level of assist 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9037"> ance and the number of child-care places; secondly, the way they increase fees; and, thirdly, the way the changes are being pushed through without proper consultation, provision of information or scope for child&hyphen;care centres to adjust to these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for employment and training, I particularly want to highlight the fact that, amongst other things, child care is an employment issue. If you want to talk about opportunity and choice, if you want to talk about the ability of families to participate in the labour market, then you have also got to face up to the fact that those things are intimately related to the available choices with respect to access to child care. I therefore want to highlight the fact that these bills go against the needs of employees who have children, against the needs of families and against the need to provide genuine choice for all&mdash;whether male or female&mdash;to participate in the labour market on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills, I suggest, will force some people to stop working. They will impose limits on work related child care and will push many working parents to take their children out of quality care by abolishing the operational subsidy for outside school hours care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and I know, child care is an employment issue, for several reasons. The availability of child care crucially affects the ability of women to participate in the work force. It was estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in a recent survey that more than 300,000 people, nearly all of them women, do not participate in the work force because of a lack of adequate child care. I suggest to the House today that this is a startlingly high number&mdash;300,000 people, the clear majority of whom are women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also clear&hyphen;cut evidence that the cuts by the Howard government, with which these bills are associated, are driving this number up. The Labor Party, as an integral part of its employment platform and policy, is going to give special attention to the particular issues affecting the capacity of women to participate in the work force, just as it did in government. This includes ensur 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing the availability of affordable child care on a needs basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian child care survey, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in February, came up with some other startling findings&mdash;and these might be news to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) responsible for this bill. For instance, fewer than seven per cent of Australia's families receive help from the employer with child&hyphen;care arrangements. We often hear speeches in this House about the need to ensure that flexibility exists in the workplace. I suggest to you that access to child care is intimately related to productivity and flexibility in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also noted that less than four per cent of families are actually offered work based child&hyphen;care facilities. That is despite the fact that in the last decade there has been an incredible growth in women's participation in the work force. Clearly, the previous government did its job to try to ensure that assistance was available, for example, through growth in community based child care, growth in family day care and by the extension of fee relief to the private sector on the basis of the need to provide quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point the finger today not just at the government but also at Australian employers. If you want morale amongst your work force, a happy work force, a work force that is prepared to front up to its responsibilities aimed at changing work practices and improving productivity, then you also have to accept your responsibility to ensure that adequate child care is offered on a work basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Institute of Family Studies has also pointed out that there is far too little provision by companies of flexible work practices which employees with dependent children actually need. So it is not just the view of the Labor opposition; it is also the view of other reputable groups in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost no mothers with dependent children are entitled to a nine&hyphen;day fortnight to relieve the burden of cramming things into the weekend. Far fewer are entitled to a rostered day off than other colleagues, according to the Institute of Family Studies. Also, more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9038"> mothers than other women in the work force have work hours varying from week to week, resulting in a lack of security and stability in working parents' lives. This, I suggest, makes child&hyphen;care arrangements very difficult. Sara Charlesworth from Latrobe University pointed out that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Making it to the child care centre by 6.00 pm is a cause of enormous stress for many parents of pre school children.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as is finding family or friends to help out at short or no notice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She also suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also difficult for workers who work changing shifts or have to suddenly work additional hours to organise child care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is for those reasons that we have moved the second reading amendment today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's Workplace Relations Act was paraded as enabling employers and employees to reach more flexible arrangements to their mutual benefit. The evidence to date suggests that it has had an alternative impact on the needs of working parents and employers. The reality is that it is handing employers more power to impose conditions on workers, which goes against the kind of flexibility which they actually need. The end result of the change to the Workplace Relations Act has been more power and pressure from the employers but no proper consideration of the needs of workers and their families. The end result of that is more stress on Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's industrial relations policies are also making it even less likely that in the future employers will meet their social responsibility to provide child care, family friendly working arrangements and other things such as training. Those issues have virtually disappeared from the agenda; it is now about cutting wages, taking security out of people's lives and putting pressure on families. That is the Howard government's industrial relations agenda, which the cuts and changes to child care that we are debating today have added to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, the former Labor government was working with employers and unions, workers and their families to promote child 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> care as a central part of work and family initiatives and workplace reform. They are integral. You could not have workplace reform, you could not have changes in work practices, you could not have flexibility in working hours unless you also debated in those enterprise arrangements the question of access to child care. Therefore, we were promoting the development of services to meet the real needs of families to enable them to balance the responsibilities of home and work. You cannot detach home from work if you want to ensure that there is productivity growth and attachment by workers to their employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the House today that the Howard government is reversing this progress. I also suggest that only the Labor Party is committed to restoring a real role for the Industrial Relations Commission. This is essential to ensure that more employers make child&hyphen;care facilities and family friendly hours of work available to workers and to those who want to be workers, who want to participate in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that with respect to work force participation in the last 12 months it actually decreased by one per cent. I suppose from the government's point of view they applaud that because, whilst unemployment now standards at 8.7 per cent and we have lost 60,000 full&hyphen;time jobs in the last 12 months, if it had not been for the fall in the participation rate then unemployment today would be over 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the government's point of view, the fact that people are giving up the desire to work because they feel there is a sense of hopelessness in the jobs market in some way is making it look as though they are making more progress than they are, even though they are going backwards at the moment on the jobs front. I suggest to the House that access to child care is intimately related to that fall in the participation rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is an employment issue, and it is about time that the Howard government faced up to that fact. Caring for children impacts greatly on the work of most Australians. It impacts on families, it impacts on communities and it impacts on employers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9039">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A survey of 30,000 employees, carried out by the Work and Child Care Advisory Service, has found that nearly 70 per cent of parents arrived late or left work early, more than half took time off when their child was sick, and nearly half experienced stress and anxiety. On average, 2.9 full days were lost and another 2.9 days significantly interrupted because of difficulties with the care of children under school age&mdash;telling facts that this government has to face up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all the more reason why employers should do more to help workers with children. It is about ensuring that they produce the goods at a workplace level and that they are able to compete both domestically and internationally. To achieve that you also have to face up to the needs of your workers and their families. That is all the more reason why the availability of work related child care should be expanded, not limited as these bills will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another sense in which child care is an employment issue is that many workers are directly employed by child&hyphen;care centres. They, like so many other Australians, are losing their jobs under the Howard government's cut and slash policies. That is important. In my own electorate, for example, at the moment over 300 people are employed in the community based child&hyphen;care centres. It is also interesting to note that in the last decade employment in the child&hyphen;care industry has grown elevenfold. It has been one of the areas of growth in employment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will impact not only on the needs of workers in general but also on a growth sector for employment and jobs in Australia. Those workers, like so many other Australians, are losing their jobs under the Howard government's cut and slash policies. Many jobs are being lost in local child&hyphen;care centres, such as those in my electorate in the city of Darebin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming majority of child&hyphen;care centre use in the city is work related. The effect on the local economy and community from the loss of child&hyphen;care workers' jobs, when the economy and community are already suffering from the closure of government offices, is multiplied many times over. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Austudy offices, CES offices, Department of Social Security offices, Tax offices, Family Law Court offices and now child&hyphen;care centres are suffering, with a consequent loss of jobs as a result of cuts in government services by the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, those cuts impact on local economies. They impact in the city of Darebin in my electorate, where there is unacceptably high unemployment. It might not be an issue for this government, but it is an issue for local families, and it is an issue for the quality and decency of the Australian way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, there is now a real threat to the future working lives of many of the women in child&hyphen;care centres around Australia because it is an industry predominantly dominated by women in respect of jobs and employment opportunities. We are working closely with the centres in the Darebin area in my electorate, for example, to creatively face this crisis in an attempt to protect those jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, the Darebin area centres serve more than 4,000 local families&mdash;a quite significant number&mdash;most of whom will find their ability to take part in the excellent local Darebin services limited if they are further cut back. Parents will not feel comfortable going off to work if they feel that the local children's services are not up to scratch. That goes to the issue of accreditation and quality that was pursued by the previous government. Initially, it was opposed by the current government, but it eventually embraced it in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the north&hyphen;eastern region of Melbourne, we already have unemployment running at 9.2 per cent. That is way above the average for Victoria and way above the national average of 8.7 per cent. For more people to drop out of the work force due to needless and short&hyphen;sighted cuts to child care will only deplete our economy and community. It will needlessly deprive it of skills and will deprive the women employed in the centres and those who rely on their service from developing and expressing their talents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is about workers' ability to participate in the workplace. It is also about employment. That is why I specifically refer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9040"> to my electorate. In the Darebin area, my local government area, there are 32 child&hyphen;care related centres. Eighteen are private long day care, three are council child&hyphen;care centres, seven are preschool council centres, and 15 are community preschool centres. Those centres are not an insignificant employer, directly employing 300 staff, with an estimated turnover, on an annual basis, of $17 million. That is quite a sizeable section of the Australian community; a growth area of employment; a growth area for necessary jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the second reading amendment to the House. It is about time that the Howard government faced up to the fact that its slash and burn policies are impacting on local communities; they are impacting on jobs; and they are impacting on the ability of workers to participate in the community and in the workplace on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's bill is to be condemned for what it is: a short&hyphen;sighted approach aimed at cutting services without any consideration for the needs of Australia at large or of the question of decency and our commitment to creating opportunities for all to participate in the workplace, irrespective of whether they are male or female, irrespective of whether or not they are a family member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga's second reading amendment is correct. This government stands condemned for cutting decent services and undermining the capacity of women to participate in the workplace on an equal footing. I commend the second reading amendment to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R276">Child Care Payments Bill 1997</XREF>  marks a considerable change in the provision of child&hyphen;care services in Australia. In a speech last week, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said that she was committed to ensuring greater flexibility, better planning, quicker and more relevant information and improved access to services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill goes a long way to delivering on that commitment. Growth in and the availability of child&hyphen;care places is important. It is important to Australia as a whole and to individual parents and families. There will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continued strong growth in the number of child&hyphen;care places in Australia, amounting to about 83,000 new places over four years: about 44,000 new private centre places and 39,000 new community based places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This growth needs to be controlled and planned. Control and planning are important elements, yet they have been missing in relation to the child-care industry in the past. Planning under the previous government saw an oversupply of child-care facilities develop in some areas, while other areas virtually went without.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing the National Conference of the Australian Early Childhood Association, the minister identified the provision of care for parents who are working, studying, training or looking for work as a priority of this government. Clearly these are the areas which need attention. The open slather approach of the former Labor government did not always target the provision of services towards these areas. The lack of forward planning for the provision of child-care services has created problems for the community and the industry, which is why many operators in Townsville and throughout Australia have welcomed the restriction to the provision of only an extra 7,000 national private long day care places in 1998 and 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High need areas will be targeted based on extensive advice and consideration from planning committees. That is in stark contrast to the hit&hyphen;and&hyphen;miss approach which was adopted in the past. That is why the introduction of the 20-hour limit a week for non-work related child care has also been broadly welcomed by the industry and the community. The decision is entirely consistent with the government's targeted approach to child-care assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 20-hour limit is fair, it is equitable and it ensures that assistance is targeted towards those who need it the most: parents who are working, studying, training or seeking work. Exemptions will apply for families in crisis, for children at risk of abuse or neglect and for some situations where one or both parents are disabled. The 20-hour non&hyphen;work related limit is an important reform because it is also a step away from the unplanned open slather 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9041"> approach to child-care assistance that has developed over the last decade. At the same time, it recognises that parents who choose to stay at home and care for their children do need some time to themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure I am not the only member who has heard of instances where non-working parents put their child or children into day care hour upon hour, day in, day out, while the parent goes out by himself or herself. Non-work related care accounts for 21 per cent of child-care assistance outlays in the 1996-97 budget, and it was forecast to increase by some 23 per cent by the year 2000 and 2001 without any changes. Child care should be there for those working or studying parents who need it most, not for those who simply find it a convenient break from their kids. This is not what child care is for, and the minister should be congratulated for both recognising and doing something to change this. It is a long overdue reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tying of child-care payments to immunisation records is also a significant and vital step forward, and the minister should be congratulated for her contribution in this regard. In terms of promoting and advancing public health policies in Australia, the Howard government's approach to our appalling levels of childhood immunisation has been proactive, innovative and long overdue. The coalition government has embarked on a concerted effort to change this, and part of that effort is to tie child-care payments to the appropriate immunisation of our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that the vast majority of parents support immunisation and vaccination programs, many parents fail to make sure their kids complete a full program. There are different reasons for this. One certain but regrettable factor is that many parents simply forget. While I do not condone this, I do understand it. Parents have to deal with an enormous number of different things on a daily basis. If a child is healthy, often concerns about the potential to contract a communicable disease such as whooping cough, measles or rubella are far from the parents' thoughts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where we as a community and as a government need to be vigilant and continu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ously push the message that it is very important to fully complete a child's immunisation program. I am confident that tying immunisation to child-care payments will be a successful tool in stimulating parental vigilance in relation to childhood immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month I reported to the House that the early indications were that the immunisation awareness campaign was having a very positive impact in Townsville and Thuringowa. I am delighted now to report to the House that Townsville topped the state, recording the highest number of vaccinations administered as part of the first of the national immunisation days. There has also been an increase in the number of children presenting at the weekly immunisation clinics in both Townsville and Thuringowa. This is a tremendous result, and I am proud to acknowledge and commend the commitment and the hard work many health care workers throughout Townsville and Thuringowa have put in to achieve this initial outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also pleased to see the commitment the minister and the government have applied to the provision of outside school hours care. Reforms which improve equity and affordability for low and middle income families using outside school hours care services, with an estimated 70,000 families to benefit from improved child-care assistance, are certainly welcome. Higher rates of child-care assistance will be provided for families using outside school hours care services, and eligibility will be extended to the same income cut-off as family day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outside school hours care plays an important role in the provision of child-care services in Townsville and Thuringowa. There was a lot of concern expressed by the operators and parents prior to the last budget, but these reforms have generally been welcomed and accepted. Progress towards a simpler system of child-care assistance and child-care rebate payments is important and represents another difference between the coalition and the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having talked widely with constituents in Townsville and Thuringowa, I found a high level of public confusion about the current child-care payments system, which the former 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9042"> government has presided over. A lot of people do not know the difference between child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. Some do not even know the child-care rebate exists. A simpler system of child-care payments needs to be adopted, and I am pleased to see the minister and the government moving towards this in making child-care assistance and the rebate payable through the one Commonwealth service delivery agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been much said lately about the cost of child care in Australia, that it is pricing families out of accessing appropriate care. I would like to bring to the attention of this parliament a different perspective in this debate and relate a letter to the editor which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> earlier this week. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much media attention has been given to the cost of regulated child care services (for example, day care centres) since the government has restructured (some say reduced) the assistance available for families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For between $150 and $170 you can send your child to a quality&hyphen;accredited centre. For an average of 50 hours . . . this calculates (at the higher end of the scale) to $3.40 per hour.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The writer continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Society still holds the view that day care facilities are just for nurturing when the mother (predominantly) is not available. But early childhood facilities are much more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They offer a planned approach to children's development and education, on an individual basis, conducted by professional trained staff, using the most current information and facilities. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this in mind, society in general needs to look closely at our reluctance to pay appropriate child care costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The writer concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child care costs are not too high . . . in fact they are undervalued. How can anybody argue that paying less than $4 an hour for cultivating the next generation is too expensive?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very good point. Amongst some of the headlines I have seen over recent weeks there has been one saying that, in some instances, early child care can cost as much as, if not more than, primary school fees. The articles accompanying the headlines have contained the quotes of outraged parents and the equally outraged member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not heard one member of the opposition argue in this debate that accredited child&hyphen;care centres are anything less than the quality education and development centres that we expect them to be. Could it possibly be that members opposite still hold the view that day care facilities are just for nurturing when mum or dad is not available? As the writer of the letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> points out, why is there a reluctance to pay for the quality services our children receive in their early years when we willingly pay the same, if not more, for quality and service when our kids enter primary school?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very valid point. Are our children any more or any less valuable? Are our children any more or any less deserving? Does age make a difference to the price we pay for our children? If it does, then why? Why do we complain about paying similar levels for child care as we do for primary school age children's school fees when, quite often, there is only a one&hyphen; or two&hyphen;year age difference and the level and amount of attention or care that is required is the same?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter mentions backyard child care and points to price comparisons. There is not a lot of difference. How many members who are parents here would expect to be able to get a baby&hyphen;sitter for less than $5 or $6 an hour? I want the opposition to think about these questions and relate the answers back to the whole child&hyphen;care debate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9043">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Griffith (Mr McDougall) mentioned in his speech a parent who complained to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> that the 20&hyphen;hour week, non&hyphen;work related limit on child care would cut into her recreational or leisure time. As a parent myself I really wonder about that. I wonder how that parent views her child&hyphen;care centre and staff. Does that parent view the staff as glorified baby&hyphen;sitters, or does that parent recognise that they are professionals working to help develop our children's social and intellectual skills?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the beginning, the government is committed to ensuring greater flexibility, better planning, quicker and more relevant information and improved access to child&hyphen;care services. Importantly, we need to provide appropriate care for those parents who need it the most&mdash;for working parents, for parents who are studying or training, or who are looking for work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the father of two very young children, my wife and I know how hard it is to balance our work and family commitments. Like thousands of other parents, particularly in places like Cranbourne, I understand the need for the maintenance of a proper child&hyphen;care system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this is not an understanding shared by those on the opposite site side of the House. Under the guise of more efficiently allocating financial resources, this government is engaged in what can best be described as a deceitful attempt to gut child&hyphen;care payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last two budgets, the razor gang has shaved over $800 million from child care, a cut of so much money out of the child&hyphen;care budget it could lead to fee increases of up to $40 per week. To a very much out&hyphen;of&hyphen;touch government in Canberra perhaps this does not seem like much money but, believe me, to many of the families that will be harshly affected this is a significant rise in the cost of bringing up their children. It is an unnecessary cost and one the parents of Australia, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly the parents of Cranbourne, could well do without.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flaws and dangers of this piece of legislation are, indeed, gaping, and many of them will have a profound impact on the people of Isaacs, the people I represent. There are a number of aspects of the  Child Care Payments Bill 1997  which I find particularly worrying. The bill limits to some 20 hours the amount of child&hyphen;care assistance per child that parents can receive each week if they are not working, studying or training. If they are involved in any of those activities then they are limited to 50 hours a week of child&hyphen;care payments. After the 20&hyphen; or 50&hyphen;hour limit has been exceeded, depending on parents' circumstances, they have got to pay their own way. The government washes its hands after that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government is serious about fair and compassionate child&hyphen;care provision in Australia, it must not cap the number of hours for which parents can gain assistance each week. As all parents know, you cannot cap the amount of time and care a child needs. Why is this government so insensitive as to think that, after a certain number of hours each week, parents no longer need support in the care that they administer to their children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this most drastic measure is indeed clear. Many women will be forced out of the work force or into part&hyphen;time employment against their will. Such outcomes fly in the face of the interests not only of the people of Cranbourne and the women concerned but also, just as importantly, of family units and their children. Some families may be forced into the equally unpalatable situation of assigning their children to inferior, perhaps best described as backyard, child care. One study reveals that 67 per cent of parents who are taking their children out of formal child care are putting their children into informal child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those opposite were fair dinkum about child&hyphen;care payments, they would not impose such punitive controls just so that they can save a quick buck. New private sector places in long day care have been limited to 7,000 in 1998&hyphen;99. That means that only a further 7,000 child&hyphen;care places will receive federal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9044"> government assistance in each of the next two years. No matter what the demand for child care in the community, no matter how much of it is needed by Australian families, the government is limiting the amount of support it provides to a meagre 7,000 new places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government intends to save an estimated $212 million in its next four years from this measure. But just remember that, to this government, the dollar sign is all. This cost cutting has nothing whatsoever to do with the efficient allocation of resources. Rather, it is all about taking money out of the social wage upon which so many Australians heavily rely. Given the way that demand for child care has exploded over the last 20 years, it is incomprehensible that this government should be so pusillanimous and so miserly. It is clear that it is motivated by its bizarre, philosophical fixation with cutting back the role of state in society, regardless of the cost to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit to the House&mdash;as I have before&mdash;that, while many on the government benches wax lyrical about their commitment to the individual, a great many individuals will be hurt by these changes. Of course, the government does understand this; it just does not care. This is yet another example of the ideological bankruptcy that, in our view, pervades the ruling parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also produces provisions for the minister to allocate these 7,000 private sector child-care places to particular regions. Yet the criteria on which these judgments will be based has not even been specified. Given the way child-care services have been butchered to date by government, it is with a sense of great foreboding that I await this announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, if the criteria stand up to scrutiny, then why doesn't the government come clean and tell us what it is now? How will the minister ensure that no parents in Isaacs will be worse off after these changes? I cannot believe that the cloak and dagger policy being pursued by the coalition is going to ensure that the people of Isaacs get the best possible child care&mdash;the sort of child care they deserve. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The virtual discretion that the minister has in allocating new funding is indicative of the wider lack of information about guidelines and regulations that we are not aware of. If this parliament is to go down the path of making further changes to the provision of child care, then at least the industry and parents should be provided with some certainty as to exactly how this piece of legislation is going to work in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many families in Isaacs are still reeling from the last round of cuts that the Howard government administered to child care. In the suburb of Mordialloc, in the heart of Isaacs, the Ashmore Avenue Child Care Centre&mdash;about which I have spoken before in this place&mdash;will be shutting its doors this month because of government cutbacks, because of a $23,000 cut to its operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these new changes the people of the bayside area of Isaacs will be further disadvantaged in the child-care services available to them. Needless to say, this issue has caused much angst in many local communities across Australia, none more than in my electorate of Isaacs. Parents are concerned that there are even further and nastier cuts to come. Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the Ashmore Avenue Child Care Centre closure is that this is likely to be very much only the thin end of this wedge. If parliament does see fit to pass this legislation, then we will bear witness to the unedifying spectacle of even more closures of centres in even more areas. This is something that the families of Isaacs&mdash;let alone any other electorate in the country&mdash;can afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the City of Frankston was forced to increase the fees of council-run child-care centres by six per cent in response to the federal government's spending cuts. Councillor Mark Conroy said about the action, `It's a bitter pill to swallow, there is no other course of action . . . it's a brutal cut by the government.' That flies in the face of comments made in this place this morning by the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) when he said that his constituents understand the need for these child-care cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To add to this, a study released recently by the National Association of Community Based 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9045"> Children's Services has found that more than 4,000 families have withdrawn their children from long day care or have reduced their patronage in the past three months, forcing many women to withdraw from the work force or cut back on full- or part-time work. The sad thing is that, with the changes in this bill, these sorts of problems are only going to prevail and are only going to get much worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last time that I addressed this chamber on child care I referred to a visit by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to Cranbourne, a suburb of Melbourne and the location of my electorate office, during the last federal election campaign in order to launch the coalition's policy on child care. It is more than a little ironic that halfway into its term of government the coalition has forgotten child care and forgotten places like Cranbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cranbourne lies in the city of Casey, a municipality with more residents aged between nought and four than any municipality in the country. The only council sponsored child&hyphen;care centre has been put at risk because, as with the Ashmore Avenue Child Care Centre, the government proposes to cut its funding. The families of Cranbourne needed certainty from this legislation&mdash;certainty that the child&hyphen;care provision would not be threatened any further. Instead, services have been placed in even greater jeopardy. I can assure the government that the people of Isaacs are feeling neither relaxed nor comfortable with this government's assaults on the child&hyphen;care system. Given the aforementioned cuts, this legislation further condemns families to insufficient child care. My office has already received complaints about what a disastrous impact this piece of legislation will have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another source of genuine concern for my constituents is that the lodging of claims must be made within 13 weeks of the child&hyphen;care sessions that have been completed. Given that some families are struggling to keep pace with living expenses from one day to the next, it concerns me that this limit has been imposed. A longer duration of time for retrospective claims should have been allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Casey council, to which I have just referred, covers a large section of my elector 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ate of Isaacs and has the largest family day care centre scheme in Australia. Casey council represents people who are about as `middle Australia' as you can get. These people are hurting. The local mayor, Wayne Smith, has estimated that recent changes to child care by the federal government may have made the local scheme $30 a week per child worse off. In a young and rapidly growing area like Casey, these cuts simply cannot be afforded and will not be tolerated by constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arrogant in the extreme in the way that it has kept consultation with the child&hyphen;care industry to a bare minimum is this government. An unnecessarily high&hyphen;handed approach has been taken with this bill as it has with many other bills. In Cranbourne, Frankston and the bayside suburbs of Melbourne, the further restrictions now being placed on child care will add to the already substantial hardships of bringing up a family. It becomes very clear from reviewing these changes that taking so much money out of child care will result not only in a more expensive service for parents but also in a generally lower quality of service provision. We are heading towards a situation where, because many parents will no longer be able to afford child care, there could be a fall in the demand for places. If this happens, the likely outcome is that there will be job losses in this industry. This in turn would lead to a lower standard of care provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An issue like child care is much more complex than just dollars and cents. This point is something that the Howard government fails to appreciate, and the costs will be felt not just now but on a continuing basis in the years to come. The environment in which we bring up our children has a major impact on the adults that they become and the society which is formed around them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, it comes down to the fact that no matter how much you try to play with these figures, no matter how much you fiddle with them, no matter how much you try to justify these changes, you cannot get away from the fact that, when you rip millions of dollars out of the system, you are going to hurt the battlers, the people Mr Howard claimed for a fleeting moment as his own. If 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9046"> the debate has revealed anything, it is that the coalition government, as I say, does not care about the battlers. On an issue of such fundamental importance to families as child&hyphen;care funding, the government has, again, failed miserably to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the previous 13 years before the election of the Howard government, the previous Labor administration had taken great pride in its record of building up a child&hyphen;care system which, by and large, was the envy of the rest of the world. It is galling for those of us on this side of the House to see the attack which is now taking place on such an important component of the rights of families, women and children as child care is. Child care is a crucially important component of the day-to-day lives of these people, the people whom I represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the space of just two short years, the new government has gone a fair way in dismantling the achievements of what was a first&hyphen;class child&hyphen;care system. I urge the House to put a stop to the destruction of affordable child care in Australia. In concluding, I certainly commend the amendment proposed by the shadow minister to the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our response as a nation to issues of native title, Aboriginal reconciliation and Aboriginal living standards is fundamental to our future as a nation. This government's response to these issues is wrong on all counts. The response which we are seeing today in this legislation and elsewhere is discriminatory and unfair; it is unworkable and will ultimately be very expensive for this nation, as the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission that this government attempted to suppress indicates; and it is severely damaging to our international standing, which is particularly fragile at the moment because of a number of matters associated with the One Nation party and the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been prepared to take the low moral ground consistently on Aboriginal issues, exemplified no better than by his extraordinary hectoring speech at the Aboriginal reconciliation convention in Melbourne. He has persistently chased the redneck vote. He has persistently sought to play to a deep-seated hostility to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal people which exists in many parts of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, sadly, an ugly thread of contempt and disdain for Aboriginal people in many parts of the Australian community and in parts of the Australian character. There is also a huge strand of guilt in the Australian community with respect to the treatment that Aboriginal people have suffered over the two centuries of European settlement. But this guilt is not just the guilt of those who are aware and conscious of the outrages that have been perpetrated on Aboriginal people and those who seek to do something about it, those who seek to rectify the wrong that has occurred; more importantly, this guilt is the guilt of the people with the same strand of character that regards Aboriginal people with contempt and disdain. Think about it for a minute. What are the usual characteristics of guilt? What are the normal features when one feels guilty about something? They are silence, they are denial, they are the projection of one's guilt onto the victim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the real guilt that matters on Aboriginal issues in Australia is not the guilt of the so-called chattering classes&mdash;much maligned by older, male, right wing newspaper commentators&mdash;it is the guilt of those people who do disdain Aboriginal people, who do regard them with contempt and who do vociferously oppose any attempt to provide Aboriginal people with some degree of justice in our society. As Tacitus said, `It is human nature to hate the one whom we have hurt,' and as Milton said, `They who have put out the people's eyes reproach them for their blindness.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true to say that contemporary Australians did not massacre Aboriginal people, did not poison waterholes and did not commit some of the more outrageous things that Aboriginal people have suffered throughout our history&mdash;although some things are still relatively contemporary. For example, the kidnapping of Aboriginal children because they were Aboriginal and the attempt to forcefully assimilate them into white culture certainly is something for which contemporary generations bear a heavy responsibility.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9048">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true to say that most individuals in our society do not have a direct complicity in the outrages that have been perpetrated on Aboriginal people. However, they, we, all of non-Aboriginal Australia, continue to benefit from the fact that those outrages occurred. Therefore, we have a responsibility, in whatever way we can, to set right the things that have been done. Much of it cannot be corrected. Much of it is now irrevocable. But, to the extent that we as a nation can remedy the wrongs that have been done and can provide some degree of justice to Aboriginal people, we have an obligation to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also in the Australian character and in many parts of the Australian community a deep-seated fear associated with attitudes on Aboriginal issues. That fear has its origins in our own moral vulnerability&mdash;a fear ultimately that Asian people will do to us what we did to Aboriginal people. We, in some deep, subconscious way, fear that the dispossession that we wrought upon Aboriginal people may sometime happen to us. So you get the conjunction of these two issues leading to a dark strand of racism in the Australian community which has, as its recent evocation, as its recent manifestation, the One Nation party and the outrageous excrescences of the member for Oxley, which we had to suffer again in this place yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been extremely fortunate as a nation in the past 20 or 30 years that we have not suffered the international ostracism that South Africa suffered as a result of its apartheid regime. Make no mistake about it, in many parts of Australia in that period there were manifestations of apartheid very, very similar to what occurred in South Africa and what is only now being eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley talks about the need for equal treatment for all Australians&mdash;everybody should be treated equal. Perhaps we should ask her for her view on the blind pension. Should blind Australians receive equal treatment to other Australians? In other words, should their blindness be ignored? Perhaps we should ask her for her attitude on disability services. Should those Australians and the particular problems they have be ignored by government and the rest of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community on this spurious ground of equality? Her idea is based on a total refusal to accept that people are different and that there are different needs and different obligations on the community to deal with those needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to have been part of a government that saw, firstly, in the Redfern speech in 1992 the first formal acknowledgment by an Australian Prime Minister of past wrongs with respect to Aboriginal people; secondly, the Mabo native title legislation; thirdly, the establishment of the Aboriginal land fund; fourthly, increased funding for Aboriginal health; fifthly, the initiation of the inquiry into the stolen generation; and, sixthly, the Aboriginal reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are the last major British colony to properly address the land entitlements of indigenous peoples. These issues have been dealt with in varying degrees in places like Canada, New Zealand and the United States. We must move beyond the bigoted, narrow&hyphen;minded, insular perspective which permeates this legislation and, indeed, the attitude of this government. We must move beyond the inflammatory rhetoric designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator, to the worst, deepest fears and insecurities and nastiness that does exist in parts of our community and that is characteristic of the meanness and petty&hyphen;mindedness of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservatives&mdash;the great upholders of the rule of law, the great upholders of the principles of private property, the great upholders of the common law and great British traditions like the monarchy&mdash;attack the High Court and say that the High Court, in its Mabo decision, in its Wik decision, is making law. When the Nabalco decision, which determined the doctrine of terra nullius, was handed down by the Northern Territory Supreme Court 26 years ago, I do not recall any conservatives attacking the court for making law. When the court forms one doctrine of law that suits the conservative view, then that is okay, but when it reverses that position and finds that there is native title, then it is making law. The conservatives cannot accept the umpire's decision. In spite of their posturing as the upholders of democratic institutions and the rule of law, they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9049"> will attack the High Court when it makes a decision that they do not like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to balance this debate by looking not only at questions of native title but also at questions of pastoralists' title. The debate has been a little bit unbalanced and there has been very limited scrutiny of precisely who the people are who hold title that is so important to protect from native title, what their rights and entitlements are and how they have been treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This originated with squatters in the 19th century and the proliferation of the pastoral industry and was then challenged by the gold rush and assisted immigration boom that occurred with very large numbers of people looking for agricultural land. We saw the selection acts in 1861 in New South Wales and Victoria. In New South Wales the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1861 provided that selectors could select between 40 and 320 acres anywhere in the state on crown land for &pound;1 an acre. The Crown Lands Occupation Act of the same year provided that pastoral leases could last for a maximum of only five years. Rents were doubled on pastoral leases and there were some provisions made for lessees to have first choice on land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These selection acts led to entrenched battles between squatters and selectors throughout many parts of Australia. Very creative tactics were adopted by many squatters, using dummies to purchase selections and peacocking to pick out the eyes of particular areas that would therefore render it pointless to purchase the land. Because of the support from the banks and the privileges of prior possession, it was a battle that the squatters ultimately won, particularly in areas like southern New South Wales, with its rich agricultural and pastoral land. In most instances selectors were left with fairly marginal land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These developments led to an enormous and very successful pastoral industry, which was critical to the economic development of Australia in the 19th century and this century. These developments also ensured that the degree of public scrutiny of these arrangements remained fairly minimal, as has been the case with many other industries&mdash;both 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public and private&mdash;throughout this century. But things have changed for many of these industries. For example, public utilities and arrangements with respect to Australian shipping and the waterfront are now under intense scrutiny. It is timely that the pastoral industry and its land management, its land stewardship and the arrangements under which it holds that land title should also be scrutinised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to consider some of the data&mdash;what there is of it, because there is not much. It is not easy to get a full, true picture of who holds this land in leasehold, under what arrangements it is held and what rents are paid, because those things vary enormously from state to state. The data is sketchy. Forty&hyphen;two per cent of the Australian land mass is covered by some form of pastoral related lease. As an example, the 1995&hyphen;96 annual report of the Queensland Department of Natural Resources indicated that there were 37,910 leases covering 133 million hectares, earning a total of $45.6 million rent in that year for the state. That works out at about 33c per hectare for that financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would commend to honourable members a very good survey in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Farm Journal</EMPHASIS> of November last year of who actually owns these pastoral leases. A large proportion of them are owned by very large companies and involve millions of hectares. There are obviously many small holders as well, but it is a very complicated mix.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia, rental on pastoral leases is based on three per cent of the unimproved value of the land, and in the Northern Territory it is based on one per cent of the unimproved value of the land. I suggest that that compares rather favourably with, for example, the normal base of rents for commercial premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to note that the degree of pastoral activity associated with a pastoral lease can vary significantly. In the case of the Wik decision, for example, the Holroyd River lease concerned an area which had roughly 100 head of cattle, no fencing, no house and no resident staff. It therefore had a very limited degree of occupation and activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation put forward to the House by this government involves a significant up

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us hear what Mr Rick Farley, the former head of the National Farmers Federation, had to say. Then I will quote Mr John Anderson, the deputy leader of Mr Katter's own party, although he does not support him. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  on 10 May this year, Mr Farley said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In effect, what the pastoralists have done is use native title as an excuse to run an argument which is likely to improve their rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the Australian on 17 May this year, the Deputy Leader of the National Party and Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan will actually constitute an upgrading of many leaseholders' rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That, I say to the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), was said by your deputy leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition objects to many aspects of this bill. We object to the substantial de facto extinguishment of native title; to the restrictions on the right to negotiate; to the excessive statutory authorisation requirements with respect to non&hyphen;pastoral activities; to the sunset clause, which is likely to lead to significant ambit claims; to the power of ministerial intervention prior to the negotiation process commencing; to the unduly broad definition of primary production activities which are not covered by the right to negotiate; and, obviously, to the inevitable unconstitutionality of the legislation, because it is purported to be based on section 51(xxvi) of the constitution, the so&hyphen;called race power, which clearly only provides a base for Commonwealth legislation to advantage a particular race&mdash;not, as is the case with this legislation, to disadvantage a race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this legislation is vindictive, discriminatory and unfair. It treats Aboriginal people as second&hyphen;class citizens. It gives an additional benefit to an industry which has already enjoyed substantial support from government when it has been the major 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contributor to Australia's international export earnings and great wealth. It provides an unworkable framework through which these issues, far from being resolved, will be exacerbated and will lead to constitutional challenges. It will lead potentially to requirements of compensation payments under section 51(xxix) of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and perhaps most significantly, this legislation shames Australia in front of the world. That may not mean very much to the Prime Minister, who still thinks he is living in the 1950s. But in a shrinking world what we do on these issues matters a lot more now than it used to. We can no longer get away with doing what we did in the past. What we do on these issues has an enormous impact on how we relate to the rest of the world, our standing with other countries in not only our region but also the rest of the world and how we manage to relate to them economically, culturally and socially. Ultimately, if this legislation proceeds, along with the pusillanimous response to the activities of the member for Oxley, Australia's international reputation will be irrevocably damaged.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment Bill. Like the previous speaker, I would make some general remarks. These general remarks centre around two countries&mdash;the United States and the former USSR. The vast bulk of the continental land mass of the United States was taken up under the Lincoln Homestead Act, which gave everybody a mile by a mile on three criteria: occupation, cultivation and production. All of us have seen the western movies where they race out on horses and put their peg in the ground; that was taking up land under the Lincoln Homestead Act. The land laws in Queensland are very similar to the Lincoln Homestead Act. The vast bulk of the pastoral leases are very similar, although much larger in area, but I regret to say that our land is nowhere near as good as the land that was taken up in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The year that the Lincoln Homestead Act went through the Congress in the Senate in the United States was the same year in which Karl Marx's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Das Kapital</EMPHASIS> was published in Great Britain. Put in train was a very interest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9051"> ing social experiment in government ownership and collective ownership of the land whereby nobody specifically owned the land but whereby there was some general ownership concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we went into the middle of the 20th century with these two great experiments in place. At the time, the United States had to pay huge amounts of money to their primary producers not to produce food&mdash;because not only were they feeding themselves but they also had the agricultural production to feed about a fifth of the entire human race. So a fifth of the entire population of the human race could be fed by the American agricultural juggernaut. To this very day it is almost impossible for other countries, without subsidies, to compete against the United States in agriculture. That attests to the enormous success story of the concept of private ownership&mdash;the farmer on his own block of land working his own piece of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Russia they had imported food and basic food such as wheat for almost all of the latter part of this century. Agriculturally, it is the basket case of the planet. In fact, the communist regime fell over and people were going hungry simply because it was not possible for that country to feed itself any longer. Yet Russia has something like three times the amount of arable land and for longer&mdash;you have winter and difficult periods&mdash;than the United States. With its land mass and its climate, it should be able to produce three times the amount of production that the United States produces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said those things, I was at Doomadgee two or three years ago where I listened to Norm Johnson, whom many people would describe as a black activist. He most certainly holds very extreme views and puts them very forcefully. He said to the people of Doomadgee, `You do not own your land. Who the hell told you that you own your land? Four years ago the government took this land off you and they appoint the trustees who now own the Doomadgee land mass.' That was true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to say, `If you cannot mortgage that land and borrow from the bank on the basis of that land, if you cannot sell that land 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and if you cannot leave it to your kids when you die, then you do not own that land.' I do not know whether Norm had been reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazine of about three weeks before that in which there was a lead article on Russia which said that, for the first time in human history, Russians could actually own their land, they could mortgage it, they could sell it to their kids and they could bequeath it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), I spend a large proportion of my time with people of Aboriginal descent. In my home town maybe half of the population is of part&hyphen;Aboriginal descent. In the environment in which I live, many of the station properties are owned by people who are of part&hyphen;Aboriginal descent. One of those families from Mount Isa was here yesterday. The brother of the lady who was here owns one of the biggest engineering works in Queensland, employing 200 men in Mount Isa. We are very proud of the achievements of our first Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wherever I go these days, the black people of Australia, the first Australians, are becoming more and more aware of the fact that they cannot do anything with their land because they cannot raise any money on the basis of it; they cannot mortgage it. As a former long&hyphen;serving Aboriginal affairs minister, let me tell you that it would be a very brave minister who would put money into an `Aboriginal' commercial project, because many ministers have come to very great grief because of the failure of those projects. Those projects did not fail because of any inherent disabilities with respect to people of Aboriginal descent. As I have indicated to you, many of the most successful stations in the Gulf Country have been owned and run for many generations by people of Aboriginal descent. One of the most successful engineering works in Queensland is run by people of Aboriginal descent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me emphasise that I do not believe remotely that there are difficulties of that nature. The debilitating factor that they have is that they simply cannot get any capital to put into these projects. The capital is parcelled out by politicians through ATSIC. I am not blaming these people. We have put the laws in place that force them to hand out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9052"> money to the most silly and frivolous activities when they know that that is not going to deliver to their people any economic advancement. The machinery that these people need in order to move forward&mdash;not only in a commercial but in a cultural and social sense&mdash;is that principle of private ownership and owner occupation of their own land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that I am a repository of truth or knowledge. When I was appointed minister I thought that the best thing to do was to go to each of the 30 communities in Queensland, to sit down and to listen to them. That is what we did.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 3,000 people attended those meetings. We counted the number of people that attended from each of those communities. There are some 30,000 people in the communities&mdash;the kids, naturally, were at school. So if you take out the kids, we probably had about half of the adult population attending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We put a very simple proposition to them. We said, `The six million acres of the reserves in Queensland at the present moment are effectively owned by the government. As minister, I appoint the trustees who are the legal owners&mdash;not the beneficial owners but the legal owners&mdash;of this land. As a government we do not want to continue to own this land; we believe that you should own this land. But we have to know who specifically will own this land. We have three choices, as we see it: firstly, a land council can own this land, so all of Cape York Peninsula would be owned by a land council; secondly, the local shire council&mdash;because we are about to set up local councils and self&hyphen;management&mdash;here at Pormpuraaw can own this land; or you, the individual, your family, can own this land. Which of these three land ownership methods do you want to choose?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise that those questions and the meetings were tape&hyphen;recorded in each community by us and by the Aboriginal activists at the time. I wanted to indicate clearly that we were not attempting in any way to influence the judgment of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a lot of fight and argumentation, and eventually a vote was taken. With the exception of three votes&mdash;one, ironically enough, from Mer Island, which was the place 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from which the Mabo decision came, and two other votes from a white fellow and his wife from Townsville&mdash;there was not one single, solitary vote cast for land council ownership or for shire council ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people acted with wisdom, because we had a transition period where the land went into the hands of the councils but the councils were bound to procedures to devolve that land to private ownership. Someone had to decide who parcelled out the land to whom in each of those communities. We left that up to the council and to what outsiders, the trendy do-gooders, would call tribal elders but what we in Queensland call justices of the peace&mdash;our local older people who are very highly respected in their community, who have been appointed justices of the peace over the years, the same as in the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the procedure. But when the land went to the councils, one council, I remember vividly, in the first fortnight had started to kick out all of their political opponents. I did not attend the Fred Chaney function&mdash;I think Fred Chaney and I would agree on very little&mdash;but I was very interested to read his speech. In the first sentence of it, he said, `The reason I joined the Liberal Party was because I believed profoundly that the basic building block of personal security, protection and freedom is private ownership of that space upon which you live.' I believe profoundly that that one thing we do agree on, what Chaney said there, is true&mdash;that the great bulwark of protection for every single right and freedom that you enjoy is that concept of private ownership; that that is your space and people cannot intrude into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to wax too lyrical here, but I cannot help but refer to the works of Robert Ardrey. One of the Oxford dons that reviewed his book said, `I truly believe that this is the most important work since <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Das Kapital</EMPHASIS>.' I profoundly believe that that Oxford don was correct. Robert Ardrey's book title, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Territorial Imperative</EMPHASIS>, is now a phrase that is part of the English language. He wrote magnificent works that indicated so clearly the absolute necessity for that concept of private ownership of space.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9053">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I became minister I read the very detailed federal government reports&mdash;and for once they were excellent reports, I thought&mdash;on Mornington Island and Aurukun. They were the first two communities in Australia in which Russell Hinze, the minister in Queensland, and the Queensland government had decided to launch an experimental policy. But really it was Russell Hinze, who had cut cane for many years with people of Aboriginal descent and had a very great affection for those people, who wanted to give them self&hyphen;management; and he introduced local government into those two areas. The reports said, `The people here do not see themselves as having any power at all. They see the power in these communities to be exercised by two groups of people: the white public servants who have come in, and the white managers who are managing all of the commercial operations in the two communities.' They did not see themselves as empowered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just cite two examples of private ownership. One is Eddie Holroyd at Pormpuraaw, and the other is the neighbouring community of Aurukun. When the church left, Aurukun started with 12,500 head of cattle on the books. As a government, we had only ever managed to muster 360 head on Pormpuraaw, so I will pay the Presbyterian Church a compliment: they were a lot better cattle managers than the Queensland government. We switched to private ownership on Pormpuraaw under the legislation that I was responsible for carrying through the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aurukun was left under the federal government legislation, which was collective ownership. Within 4&half; years there was not a single solitary beast left on Aurukun. I vividly remember Danny Boenda, the chairman there, crying on the telephone, as far as I could make out, and trying desperately to get me to intervene to save the last of their cattle, because under the TB eradication campaign the easy way out was just to shoot the cattle&mdash;go bang, bang and put $80 in your pocket&mdash;so they took the easy way out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Pormpuraaw, because they believed that their future and the future of their kids depended on those cattle, they mustered, tested, mustered, tested, and mustered, tested. In the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heat and the conditions up there it was a Herculean achievement. But after 4&half; years, it was the same as in the USSR and Russia&mdash;Aurukun had no cattle, whereas Pormpuraaw, which had started with 360 head, had 6,000 head of cattle. I do not think I need to say any more, do I?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other case was in the Torres Strait Islands. George Raptis, the big fishing magnate in Australia, was kind enough to ring me. He said, `Under your new changes, Mr Katter, I am very pleased to tell you that your little charges on Badu Island have grossed $3.2 million this year.' The syndicate of Richard Bowie and Crossfield Armat's son, Jacky Armat, and Joe Nona, once they were able to get private ownership whereby they could place their factory and get operating, borrowed the money themselves to put 120 dinghies out on the water. There were about six dinghies working before that. They were able in their second or third year of operations to gross $3.2 million&mdash;just on one tiny island in the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the great vista of opportunity and success and excitement that we can provide for the black people of Australia&mdash;for the first Australians. Are we doing it? No, I am sorry to say that we are not doing it; we are moving into some sort of mishmash arrangement which will give no definitive title to anybody. In fact, far from delivering to the people of Aboriginal descent in Australia that clear&hyphen;cut private ownership&mdash;freehold title of land&mdash;what we are doing here today is taking it away from 40 per cent of the surface area of New South Wales and from 52 per cent of the surface area of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where we once owned a pastoral lease&mdash;now let me turn to the `white side' of this argument, if I can use that expression&mdash;people say, `You never owned it; you only ever had the right to depasture stock up on it.' A public servant once said that to me and I said, `Do not ever say that in the country where I come from, my friend, or you will be leaving without a face looking the same as it does at the present moment.' The market price for a freehold block of country was exactly the same as the market price for a pastoral lease. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9054"> The Institute of Valuers for Queensland and for Australia have said that publicly on a number of occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We costed how much it would cost to freehold the two pastoral holdings that we had and the total cost of freeholding for 1,000 kilometres of country that we owned at the time was a meagre $46,000, which we could pay over 30 years, which was about the same as the rent we were paying. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might say to me, `Why did you not freehold? Why did no&hyphen;one in Queensland freehold? Why was it that 52 per cent of the surface of Queensland was never freeholded?' Because we could not see a single solitary reason to freehold. It was an extra couple of thousand dollars a year and I could see no reason to give the government a couple of thousand dollars a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally: the law of trespass. I can remember a station property where four generations of my family had been shooting and it had changed hands from local ownership to big corporate ownership. The manager came out and told me that I could not shoot ducks there. I told him that my family had been shooting ducks there for four generations and that I thought he should leave&mdash;except I may have used some stronger language than that&mdash;and that I was not going to leave. Anyway, he came back with a few of the ringers from the station and I realised that the law of trespass was most certainly in operation and I had to leave. Clearly, the law of trespass operated. Clearly, we had exclusive tenure on those properties. But now we have been reduced from the same ownership arrangement that made the United States and us such a great success story in agriculture to a form of tenure whereby we do not own our land; we simply have the right to depasture stock on it or to carry out some farming operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was devastated yesterday to find out that the procedures that will overcome the right to negotiate for the mining companies will not be put into place in New South Wales, nor in Western Australia because the ALP controls the upper house there, and that even if they are put forward in Queensland&mdash;the other big mining state&mdash;there will be grave difficulties

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of my proudest moments on becoming a member of parliament in 1993 was standing on the floor of this parliament and raising my hand in favour of the native title legislation. I pay tribute here today to the efforts and political skill of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. He used the power and prestige of his office to skilfully negotiate agreement on the bill between stakeholders who began the process of negotiation not really believing that the bill was negotiable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend also the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) for the way he brought his formidable intellectual and political skills to negotiating the original legislation's passage through a Senate where the government of the day had no majority. It was an historical process of negotiation on an issue of fundamental significance to our history, to our future and to the ongoing process of reconciliation with our Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political history of this nation will record that it was Labor in government that succeeded in negotiating a native title bill that devised a decent and practical response to Mabo. My enduring and disappointing recollection of that period is of a coalition that failed in its duty to this parliament and to this nation by its refusal to accept the basic tenets of the High Court's Mabo decision and obstructed and opposed the government of the day in achieving the best possible solution for the competing stakeholders at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and other senior members of the coalition who showed an appalling lack of leadership at the time on native title. It is the same members now in government who are displaying the same lack of leadership in bringing into this House a desperately flawed piece of legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9055">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is indicative of the importance and significance we on this side of the House place on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  and this particular issue that no fewer than 13 shadow ministers are listed to speak on the bill. The government has left carriage of the bill to the hapless Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and a gaggle of political geese who have displayed little understanding of the bill's complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House have never claimed that the Native Title Bill 1993 was the last legislative word on this momentous matter. We realised that there would be a necessity to amend the legislation as new case law emerged and in response to the practical experience emanating from the operations of the Native Title Tribunal. We acknowledge that the time is right for amendment&mdash;we have accepted this point&mdash;but not in the way that is proposed by the government; not in a way that downgrades the rights of indigenous Australians, not in a way that delivers a constitutionally suspect bill, and certainly not in a way that delivers uncertainty to farmers and miners and undermines the great social justice pillar on which this legislation was originally constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill could have been an instrument of reconciliation. In its present form it will become an instrument of division and despair for our Aboriginal communities. The missing ingredients in this bill are vision, leadership and political skill&mdash;regrettably, qualities our current Prime Minister just does not possess or else we would not be in the position we are now in of debating a bill which will shame us all in this parliament and will shame future generations of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the time each member has to debate this bill has been a little truncated, I do not propose to cover in detail all elements of this flawed bill. But there is one central matter on which all the critics, including the Australian Law Reform Commission, agree. This bill will not deliver certainty to stakeholders such as miners and farmers. The bill simply does not acknowledge the reality of native title, and many of its provisions diminish the situation of our Aboriginal community. Because of the constitutional uncertainty it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will generate, this bill will plunge this country into a legal morass, and we will all be the losers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people of goodwill in my own electorate who are appalled and outraged by what the federal government is doing with this piece of legislation. At a recent public meeting attended by over 250 people, a Geelong branch of the Defenders of Native Title was established. I commend every one of those people for their courage and commitment in standing up for the decent course of action to follow on this native title issue. I am also pleased that the City of Greater Geelong and the surf coast shire have entered a process of formal dialogue with Geelong's Wauthurong Aboriginal community on a social statement of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wauthurong Aboriginal Cooperative is highly respected in the Geelong community. Along with other groups in our local community, it has played a very important part in the economic, cultural and social life of the Geelong region. For that we thank them. There are many of us who understand how the cuts to ATSIC funding by the Howard government have damaged this Aboriginal community. There are many in Corio who feel very deeply about the injustices that were done to Aboriginal families in our past&mdash;only too well documented by the stolen children report. They are injustices that must be faced. They must be dealt with honestly so that the community can move forward in unity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So today in this debate I simply say to Geelong's Wauthurong community, on behalf of those fair and decent people in Corio, we are sorry. We are sorry for those past injustices that have caused you and your families so much pain. Our plea today goes to the Prime Minister and his government not to repeat the mistakes of history or to compound the past injustices by bringing a flawed bill into this House and passing it through the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are seminal moments in the history of any nation where the opportunity arises for the government of the day to bring its people together, to forge new directions and to carve out a renewed future for the nation. I believe we are at such a point in our history. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9056"> have in our grasp the opportunity to respond to the Wik legislation in a very positive way and to advance the Australian community by doing so. But I fear the government is failing to grasp that opportunity in this legislation and that we will let it slip by, and we will all be diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The onerous responsibility of maintaining the unity of this nation rests with the Prime Minister and the government of the day. There is sufficient criticism of this legislation abroad to categorise it genuinely as a flawed piece of legislation. It will not deliver the certainty that the key stakeholders so desperately need, and it will deliver a message to the Aboriginal community of this nation that the process of reconciliation that we have all embarked upon in recent years will not proceed any further. We will be back to the days of division in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a flawed piece of legislation which will not deliver certainty and will diminish the position of the Aboriginal community in this nation. As such it will be open to constitutional challenge and, at the end of the day, it will cost the Australian taxpayer dearly, not only in financial terms but also in terms that the nation will be diminished for failing to face its responsibility to the first Australians of this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  presented by the government and in doing so reject the opposition's amendment to it. It is very interesting that there is a long list of speakers on this bill from both sides of the parliament, although the list is longer on the opposition side. When you look at the electorates represented by the various members you see an interesting pattern. The bulk of the speakers on our side represent electorates that have been and will continue to be directly affected by native title. In comparison, the bulk of the speakers on the other side represent geographically small, high density, urban electorates&mdash;electorates that never have nor ever will need to confront the conflict, the confusion, the chaos and compromise that was created by the badly drafted Native Title Act prepared by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the former Labor government and passed by the previous parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested to hear the comments of the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). It is unfortunate he has left. He proudly said that 13 shadow ministers were lined up to speak on the bill, and they all come from those sorts of electorates. None of them have had to confront the things that are occurring as a result of that Native Title Act. He talks about the people in Geelong being appalled and outraged, people who are sitting at home very comfortable, never having to confront the actual confusion and chaos this bill has created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the worst drafted pieces of legislation this House has passed in a long, long time. It is because the Labor Party represented such a small minority of real Australia that they allowed that to occur. They had no idea what they were inflicting upon the greater public. For them to speak about the potential cost of challenges that might come as a result of this amendment is unbelievable hypocrisy. Who has benefited from the Native Title Act since it was passed and came into force on 1 January 1994? Who has benefited the most? Lawyers living in big cities. They are people who have benefited most. The impact that it has had for the last few years has been atrocious and only lawyers have benefited from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, on our side of the House you see a list of people from electorates who have had to confront this, who have had to try to work with this dreadful legislation and try to find real benefits for Aboriginal people who are living in their electorates. Besides representing an electorate that has had some impact as a result of the Native Title Act, I believe I can speak very much from a practicality point of view. Probably more than that, the experience I had over a 15&hyphen;year period in the Northern Territory puts me in a far better position than almost every other single member in this House to make some comments in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That experience was fairly wide ranging. As a surveyor in private practice in the Northern Territory, I worked very closely with dozens of Aboriginal communities on the ground, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9057"> understanding what the real aspirations of Aboriginal people are, what the real problems are. I was working not only with them as communities but also with people like the Northern Land Council. The Northern Land Council were clients of mine for many years. I did a lot of work with the Northern Land Council in relation to the Northern Territory Land Rights Act and, more recently, in relation to the Native Title Act. I also worked with clients who had land who were affected by those two pieces of legislation and the problems that came about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The non&hyphen;workability is obvious. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which was passed back in 1976, had enough problems as it was, but compared with the Native Title Act, it was a simple piece of legislation and worked brilliantly. Since the Native Title Act came in, the tribunal has spent in the order of $40 million and there has been one resolution of one application in all that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason that particular claim was settled was that the New South Wales government basically laid down and said, `All right, here's a million bucks.' That was the resolution of that native title claim: the one and only resolution in the whole country that we have seen in all this time. If that does not say that there is a major problem with the legislation, then there is something wrong with the people on the other side who think it is good legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the money that has been spent by the Native Title Tribunal&mdash;a taxpayer&hyphen;funded operation, obviously&mdash;but the money that has gone into other organisations to support these applications to try to negotiate their way through. Something like $88.8 million has also gone from the federal government to a whole series of Aboriginal organisations to help them in processing native title applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So $88.8 million has gone into those organisations and the tribunal has spent $40&hyphen;odd million. What do we have? We have one resolution of one claim on the North Coast of New South Wales, but only because the New South Wales government did not contest it and just handed over a cheque for $1 million. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It does not tell me that it is great legislation under those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I move to some of the amendments and what they are all about, let us go back to the original act&mdash;that dreadfully drafted piece of legislation. After the original act was passed, everybody agreed that pastoral leases extinguished native title. There was much debate at the time because it was an issue of great concern to many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preamble of the Native Title Act in part says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rejected the doctrine that Australia was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">terra nullius</EMPHASIS>  . . . ;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> held that the common law of Australia recognises a form of native title that reflects the entitlement of the indigenous inhabitants of Australia . . . ; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> held that native title is extinguished by valid government acts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">meaning actions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold estates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are all sorts of forms of leasehold. The question was asked, time and time again, `Do you perceive that this act includes pastoral leases?' The word from the government of the day was always yes. I do not have the quote in front of me, but I know that Senator Gareth Evans, as he was at the time, was quite clearly asked that question in the Senate and he said, `Look, pastoral leases extinguish native title.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister of the day was asked that on numerous occasions. In a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> interview with Paul Lyneham, the then Prime Minister was asked a number of questions about this, and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the point is that freehold is protected in this, that is, anyone who holds a freehold title has extinguished native title&mdash;so that's all the back yards they say&mdash;and most varieties of leasehold. I mean, it can be the small lease hold of a bee keeper leasing a bit of land for bees or something, but you know, all the commercial, pastoral, extinguished . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are the words of the Prime Minister at the time. There was no question, according to most people, that that was the case. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9058"> reason why many of the farming organisations were in the end quite happy to support certain aspects of that bill was that they were assured that was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that the government of the day did to recognise the fact that pastoral leases had extinguished native title and to recognise the fact that that would mean that quite a number of Aboriginal groups would not be in a position to make a native title claim on lands that they may have had an involvement with, was to set aside $1.289 billion&mdash;and that is in 1994&hyphen;95 dollars&mdash;to spend up to June 2004 for Aboriginal groups to purchase pastoral leases because they would not be able to make native title claims. The government of the day recognised that they may not be able to claim, so they set aside $1.289 billion for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no question about it, the High Court in the Wik case said that native title had not been extinguished from pastoral leases. It was not in the original bill. It was suggested by everybody and it was in the preamble, but the court ultimately said that it was not. One of the aspects that was always perceived within pastoral leases was that in various states there were differences in the pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, from my time in the Northern Territory I know that the predominance of pastoral leases there have reservations. Reservation in a pastoral lease in the Northern Territory basically says that certain Aboriginal groups can have access&mdash;it might be at certain times of the year, or on certain parts of particular land for hunting and gathering and some ceremonial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an aspect that the pastoral lease holders have lived with forever and it was generally accepted that those types of pastoral leases with reservation had not extinguished native title because the native title aspect was that reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always thought that the term `native title' is not the correct term. It should never have been called native title, it should have been a native right, because it is far more correctly described in that way. Native title does not necessarily mean full ownership of a piece of land; it is often a right simply to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pass over a piece of land at a certain time of the year to hold a particular ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was accepted that pastoral leases with reservation had not had native title fully extinguished, but it was perceived that pastoral leases without reservation, which existed all over Australia, had extinguished native title. That was the reason why the land fund was set up. It was set up for the purchase of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give an example that I was very closely involved in of a pastoral lease with reservation. An application had been made to subdivide this pastoral lease, and those subdivisions were to become freehold land and be sold. Obviously, this was prior to the Wik decision, but there was concern that in doing so they might be extinguishing some native title right that may be there. The whole thing was so cloudy that the government in the Northern Territory at the time was not sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, at one stage this particular piece of land was high on the list for a test case so that we knew where this stood. After some searching, we discovered that this particular piece of land was part of a pastoral lease which had been issued when the Northern Territory was under South Australian government back in the 1920s. A much larger pastoral lease which had no reservation at all had been issued over this land. As a result, it was basically everybody's opinion that native title had been extinguished from that pastoral lease because of the 1920 issue of a lease under South Australian law. It was a pastoral lease without reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the Wik decision, that has been shown to be incorrect. Therefore, part of the amendments that we are proposing in this bill will fix up those problems. The government allowed that land to be subdivided and freehold titles to be issued in good faith because that was the knowledge of the day. It is just one of the many aspects that we have to fix up in these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am talking about the freeholding of pastoral leases, I will mention the scare tactics that the opposition has been using; that is, these amendments are going to leave it open for all sorts of extinguishment of native title, and the handover of large pastoral leases to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9059"> multinationals and overseas companies will give them freehold title. It is the greatest load of rubbish I have ever heard. People such as the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) have no concept of how these things work at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been involved in the freeholding of a variety of pastoral leases for 25 years. It is not something that you do by a click of the fingers. It is not done at a cheap price. It is an expensive process to take pastoral land to freehold land. It is done very rarely. It is not done often at all. You will find that the only freeholding that tends to occur on pastoral leases is where pastoral leases come close to city areas and cities are growing and they need more land for growth. That is where some freeholding of parts of pastoral leases usually does occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this notion that the Sultan of Brunei and people like that will be running around getting freehold titles on their pastoral leases is just a load of rubbish. I have done a lot of work on several pastoral leases on the Sultan of Brunei's land. I would be there for a long time if we were ever going to issue freehold title over those. It is absurd to even contemplate issuing freehold title over such land. It just shows a total lack of knowledge by these urban cowboys across the way who think they know it all when it comes to these things. They know nothing at all. These amendments that we have introduced are excellent. They are amendments that will clear up many of the problems created by the original bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes I have left, I want to speak about a couple of native title claims that impact on my electorate of Eden-Monaro. There are basically two claims. One goes from Ulladulla, which is north of my electorate, all the way to Narooma, including Montague Island. The claim is for every piece of water, every piece of beach, every piece of inlet, every piece of council land&mdash;a total blanket ambit claim. It is a prime example of the reason why we have to make some changes. There has to be some element of proof in the early parts before an application can be lodged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current title, virtually anybody can walk along and draw a map which cannot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be read&mdash;being a surveyor and a map maker, I am horrified at the sorts of maps that get thrown in for these applications; you would not know what sort of land they are covering&mdash;and then put a claim in which has to be accepted. Once they are accepted, people are caught in this bind. You end up with headlines like this: `Native title could affect park plans'. The Eurobodalla Shire Council is trying to create a park right in the middle of Batemans Bay, but that is now stymied while this application&mdash;which is really an ambit application&mdash;goes through these processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second application is at Broulee. Once again, it covers every bit of beach and inlets and these sorts of things. From the information provided, people have difficulty in determining what it covers. These are the sorts of impacts that you have on such an electorate, and that is why we have to clear up these anomalies. I am not speaking against the right to make claims under the act. It is the poorly drafted legislation which has allowed all these extraneous things to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I work very closely with the Aboriginal communities down on the south coast. For instance, Ossie Cruse has been doing an enormous job down at Eden in developing tourism and training for Aboriginal people. I have worked closely with a variety of things to help them in that development. He knows that these sorts of ambit applications do not help his people. They do not help in gaining extra skills and training. They do not help in solving the very crisis that is in Aboriginal health right across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, all the Native Title Act has done is line the pockets of a lot of legal people for a long time. It has forgotten the people that it was designed to help&mdash;the Aboriginal people. Our amendments will bring these things back into order and will allow proper applications to occur, proper applications to be processed and everybody's rights to be protected.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak today in the knowledge that we are involved in a debate the outcome of which will do much to determine our national character and our position in the community of nations. Over the last 18 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9060"> months, on a number of occasions I have spoken about the responsibility that we have as a nation to acknowledge our indigenous heritage and its vital importance to our identity. This acknowledgment must include acceptance of the fundamental truth that there was title and ownership of land prior to European settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the question of indigenous or native title was addressed by the High Court in Mabo No. 2 where the court confirmed what indigenous Australians have always maintained, that they have legally recognised traditional title to their land. More recently, last December in its Wik decision, the court held that the principle of indigenous title was not merely theoretical but had practical application throughout Australia. It is, of course, in response to this decision that the government has placed the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be in no doubt that the debate we are having at the moment is indeed a seminal one. We stand at a crossroads in the development of our nation, and this debate is a defining moment in the shaping of that outcome. It comes at a time when the national agenda is being coloured by another debate, an odious and divisive debate, about issues of race. I think that unnecessary debate has really only flourished because of the failure of our current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to provide the national leadership that Australia requires. In fact, I think the Prime Minister's weakness and his own personal prejudices have given currency to the racist positions being advocated by populist and extremist elements within Australia's body politic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who will ever forget the Prime Minister's determination to break off what he claimed were the shackles of political correctness? Who will forget that it was he who used the phrase `Aboriginal industry' as a pejorative term to denigrate indigenous Australians and to popularise the fatuous and demeaning notion of the black&hyphen;armband view of history?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill currently before the House reflects the weakness and the mean&hyphen;spirited nature of our Prime Minister and his government when it comes to the consideration of issues related to indigenous Australians and the recognition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of their rights. Sadly, the legislation reflects the inability and the unwillingness of the coalition government to deal properly with indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its decision in Wik the High Court did nothing more than determine that native title could coexist with pastoral lease titles which did not confer exclusive possession on the lessees. Importantly, it also determined that, where there are any inconsistencies between the rights of pastoralists and those of native title holders, the rights of the pastoralist would prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of this finding and as an overreaction to the clamour which has resonated unashamedly, I must say, from pastoral interests, from some in the mining industry, from state and territory governments and from the conservative end of the political spectrum, the government has developed this legislative response which in sum significantly diminishes the legal rights of indigenous Australians as held by the High Court. It is a legislative approach which offends every principle of natural justice and the guarantee of equality that must be available to all Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This attack on indigenous Australians is unprecedented, and it is no wonder to hear it described as the final act of theft and dispossession. Let us be quite clear about it: what the government proposes is of extremely questionable legal validity. The Australian Law Reform Commission has prepared comments on the bill, which we know the government has now shamefully and improperly sought to suppress. The night before last we had the unprecedented spectacle of the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, in the jackbooted style of the Howard government, using his casting vote to prevent the Law Reform Commission's report and the commission itself appearing before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This attempt at silencing the commission, a Commonwealth statutory authority, in its damning comments of the Howard government's legislation was, of course, bound to fail. We now have seen copies of the commission's draft comments on the bill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9061"> which say, amongst other things, in paragraph 1.7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission believes that, not only are the declared objectives mutually inconsistent, in particular, competing notions of the preservation of native title and the validation and confirmation by way of purported extinguishment of native title, of prior grants of property rights&mdash;but also that the proposed means by which they are to be achieved are inadequate and counterproductive. In particular, the mechanism by which legal certainty for non&hyphen;exclusive leaseholders is to be achieved will almost certainly fail on the grounds that it will yield more, not less, litigation and compound uncertainty and lack of confidence in Australian real property law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government's own advisory body on legal matters has made it clear that this bill may well be discriminatory and in breach of the constitution. At paragraph 2.23 the commission argues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be considerable doubt as to the validity of either the available sources of the constitutional authority for the bill (that is, s51(29) or s51(26) of the Constitution)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, at paragraph 2.6:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commission believes that this provision of the Bill will likely infringe the prohibition of both direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of race of s9 and s9(1) of the RDA respectively as well as s10(1) which provides for the rights to equality before the law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill before the House today is an absolute lemon. Far from providing the certainty and security that pastoralists, miners and others have been arguing for, the bill is a recipe for uncertainty, for insecurity and for endless litigation. The bill is little more than a document of extinguishment and disempowerment. It provides for the massive extinguishment of native title and it strips away the limited right that indigenous people have to negotiate with third party interests, such as miners, overdevelopments on land where there exists native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a practising but far from perfect Christian. I must say this: when I go to church and I pray the prayer for justice for all Australians, it means just that. It is a prayer for justice and a fair go for all Australians, whether they be black or white. It forms the core of what I believe we should be trying to achieve today in this parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this bill provides neither justice nor a fair go. These simple notions define the differences between those of us on the Labor benches in this House and those on the other side. I think it is why we in the Labor Party stand so united against this draconian bill. And it is why we will oppose each of the elements of it which so unjustly and wrongly attack the rights of indigenous Australians. We will not be held to ransom by populist rhetoric or blackmailed by the vested interests at the centre of this quest to undermine the basic elements of the Native Title Act. We are united in this endeavour because it is an issue that transcends the normal considerations that influence our party debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another element of this debate which deserves consideration by this parliament. Up until the election of the Howard government, Australia was viewed internationally as a nation striving to gain a new identity&mdash;one which featured our vision for a republic, our engagement with Asia and indeed our engagement with the region generally. We were seen as a nation which was seeking to give leadership in advocating the cause of human rights, a nation respected as a good international citizen and, most importantly, a nation engaged in maturely addressing the rights of its indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do not think anyone should forget the hallmark speech of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating&mdash;the Redfern Park address, which represented a turning point in the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians with its public acknowledgment of the fundamental truth about our history and our past. The speech acknowledged the prior occupation and ownership of land by indigenous Australians. The words rang out across the nation when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Isn't it reasonable to say that if we can build a prosperous and remarkably harmonious multicultural society in Australia, surely we can find just solutions to the problems which beset the first Australians&mdash;the people to whom the most injustice has been done?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And . . . the starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non-Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It begins . . . with the act of recognition. Recognition that it was we who did the dispossessing. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9062"> took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the diseases. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice. And our failure to imagine these things being done to us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With some noble exceptions, we failed to make the most basic human response and enter into their hearts and minds. We failed to ask, how would I feel if this were done to me? As a consequence, we failed to see that what we were doing degraded all of us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These words were, of course, not universally popular&mdash;many, no doubt, did not want to hear them. I know that the current Prime Minister would have instantly pigeonholed them as part of his black&hyphen;armband view of history. This is no surprise to us because we know he has no capacity to understand, to deal with or to show leadership on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia was enhanced by the words of Paul Keating and Labor's efforts to modernise our nation's image internationally. Australia enjoyed world respect for our efforts to deal with the rights of indigenous Australians and to guarantee the first Australians the fair go that is their due. In doing so we were acutely aware of our international legal obligations under the various UN covenants and the need to abide by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contrast with the Howard government's approach could not be clearer nor more obvious. The Howard vision is one that looks backwards. It is a rear vision. It is one from, as it were, behind the white picket fence. It is one which contemplates white Australia, which thankfully for all of us is gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet that old Australia is still clearly in the minds of so many who would seek to deny indigenous Australians the proper recognition of their native title. There are those who want to hark back to the days of terra nullius&mdash;the era which, in the words of Justices Gaudron and Deane in Mabo in the High Court, created a `national legacy of unutterable shame'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one can doubt that the views expressed by John Howard give great succour and comfort to people of this view, to those Australians who are inward looking, to those who are offended by our growing cultural diversity and to those threatened by the very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thought of multiculturalism and closer contact with our Asian neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world is watching what we do here, watching what we do with native title and watching what we do with Asian immigration. John Howard acts as if oblivious to how we are viewed internationally. His actions in relation to this amendment bill show he could not care less about our obligations to the international community. He clearly has no regard for our obligations under international law&mdash;obligations that the Australian Law Reform Commission believes are very likely to be breached by a number of the provisions in the bill before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a signatory to nearly all of the international human rights instruments. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICCPR, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Australia agreed under article 27 of the ICCPR to protect the rights of minorities to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion and to use their own language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a growing body of international law and practice on the interpretation of article 27 and its application to indigenous people. The Australian Law Reform Commission makes particular reference to the relationship of indigenous people to land and culture. The nature of this relationship has been expressly recognised by the UN Human Rights Commission and requires state parties to the covenant to take positive measures to protect the cultural rights of indigenous people. By any reasonable standard, the legislation before us breaches this undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obligation of racial non-discrimination imposed by the UN charter upon all member nations is contained in all major UN human rights instruments and has attained the status of customary international law. The principle of racial non-discrimination has been characterised as one of the least controversial examples of the class of jus cogens or peremptory norms of international law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Law Reform Commission was minded to refer to the recently published foreign and trade policy white paper entitled `In the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9063"> national interest'. It points to that part of the paper where the government proclaims its:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unqualified commitment to racial equality and to eliminating racial discrimination. This is a non-negotiable tenet of our own national cohesion, reflected in our racial diversity, and it must remain a guiding principle of our international behaviour. The rejection of racial discrimination is not only a moral issue, it is fundamental to our acceptance by, and engagement with, the region where our vital security and economic interests lie. Racial discrimination is not only morally repugnant, it repudiates Australia's best interests.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a blatant act of cynicism and hypocrisy against that backdrop confronts us here today. All informed commentators are clear in the view that the legislation we are debating is clearly inimical to achieving the white paper's stated policy objective. Instead, the legislation challenges fundamentally our country's commitment to the objectives of racial equality and to the elimination of racial discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surprise, surprise!&mdash;the world takes note. Unlike our Prime Minister, they are very interested&mdash;very interested, indeed. They are alive to what is happening here, to the indolence of John Howard and to his weakness as a leader. We are being marked down by the international community as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has the potential to do great hurt to Australia. If passed, it will hurt us domestically and it will hurt us internationally. All this hurt is needless. All we are doing is shooting ourselves in the foot. Why? Just to satisfy the craven demands of the Prime Minister, who clearly has no concept of fairness or justice or how to achieve fairness and justice for Australians. His narrow-mindedness and his bigoted view diminish us all. And for what?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in the High Court's Wik decision that threatens any lessee operating within the terms of their lease, nor does it prevent development on land over which there is native title. The Prime Minister proposes to reward those state and territory governments which have flouted the original Native Title Act, which have acted illegally by issuing new titles without following the future act processes of that act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation proposes that developers will not have to enter into meaningful negotiations with native title holders. It poses major procedural hurdles to people seeking to assert their native title rights through the claims process. It throws the claims process back into the adversarial court proceedings and it allows other parties to avoid real mediation of the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the government is sending the signal that it is all right to fight rather than to talk to indigenous people, and it provides for bucket loads and bucket loads of extinguishment of native title. It is both racially discriminatory and contrary to our constitution. I am very pleased to speak today against what I characterise as a cowardly attack on the rights of indigenous people. I am very proud to be a member of the Labor Party as we do all that we can to defeat this outrageous measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

Shalom College in Townsville is, I believe&mdash;and I have heard many other people describe it this way&mdash;an inspirational and model Aboriginal community. It is a model community not only for Aboriginal people. With the time, the dedication and the funds, I am sure that what has been accomplished at Shalom can be replicated elsewhere right throughout Australia and across all racial backgrounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shalom college and community have been built quite literally from the ground up and in the most remarkable manner. The people behind this concept did not pick the best and the brightest from the street; they picked the young and the homeless, the destitute and the illiterate. They took these young people and from scratch taught them to read and write and taught them building and construction skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every building at Shalom Christian College in Townsville has been constructed by the young people living in the community. It started from the most basic structures but, as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9064"> their skills and knowledge have developed progressively over the years, the structures have become more complex and intricate. Houses, nursing homes, boarding homes and covered recreational areas are just some of the things that Shalom has produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sincerely glad the member for Batman has had the chance to see Shalom and has seen exactly what can be achieved. I was disappointed, however, that the member lapsed into that old practice of laying the blame for the current health, social and unemployment problems experienced by the ATSI community squarely at the feet of the government. The member for Batman talked about the appalling health standards of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and they are appalling. Infant mortality, life expectancy, the incidence of lung cancer, alcoholism, diabetes, glaucoma, the rate of homicide, youth suicide, drug abuse, it goes on and on&mdash;in each of these areas Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders trail well behind non-indigenous Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the member must recognise that it has not been the Liberal and National coalition who have been in government for the last 13 or 14 years. The coalition party has only been at the reins for the better part of 20 months&mdash;and, golly, haven't we instituted a number of measures which will address these problems!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman talked about the appalling unemployment levels experienced by ATSI peoples. He was right, but it was not the coalition who managed the unemployment programs for the last 13 years. It was the Australian Labor Party. The member for Batman talked about the state of Aboriginal housing and education. He talked about it as if his party had not been in government for the period 1983 to 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not condemn the member for Batman or, indeed, the ALP for the problems currently facing indigenous Australians and this government. These are problems which have plagued all governments in the past, and we have all failed to deliver the goods in these important areas. We have seen little or no improvement in areas such as health, life expectancy, deaths in custody, housing, employment outcomes and education, despite approximate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly $16 billion being spent on these problems over the past 12 years. For the member for Batman and other members of parliament to stand up and lay responsibility for all of these problems at our feet is a cop-out, and I am certain the public would be the first to recognise that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from the opening remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on this bill, the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , this bill will deliver greater certainty, I believe, in a manner that respects and takes into consideration the interests of all parties concerned. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) stated in his second reading speech to this bill, the coalition clearly and consistently viewed the initial Native Title Act 1993 as `inadequate and unworkable' and&mdash;in the Leader of the Opposition's words&mdash;`a recipe for uncertainty'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1993, vast tracks of land have been subject to legitimate native title claims. Many have been subject to multiple claims, many of which have been quite plainly frivolous or ambit claims and recognised as such by both indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. The High Court's Wik decision compounded the uncertainty as it overturned the general assumption that pastoral leases did not necessarily extinguish all native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now about four years down the road from when the Native Title Bill 1993 was passed and, of the more than 600 claims lodged, there has been only one determination of native title on mainland Australia. What kind of a result is that? If we are talking about certainty, if we are talking about a workable and timely system of native title resolution, clearly Labor's attempt in 1993 has not delivered. It has not delivered for any of us in Australia. In 1993, the Keating government stood up and asked pastoralists, miners and other users to `trust us'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at Longreach earlier this year when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) faced some 2,000 Australian farming families and detailed the government's 10-point plan in response to the Wik decision. What I saw that day was a group of people who had put their trust in the Labor Party when asked and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9065"> had been betrayed. They were told by the former government, `Don't worry. Pastoral leases extinguish native title,' and the Attorney-General highlighted this in his second reading speech. The then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, in his second reading speech to the Native Title Bill 1993, said that the government's view is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the future&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is not what the High Court determined in its Wik judgment. The High Court determined on a four to three basis that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General summed it up best in his second reading speech to this bill, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach of the previous government raised expectations of certainty which the act proved unable to deliver. This has proved to be costly to all parties. This government's policy is to bring a much greater level of certainty to bear in relation to native title issues, in particular in relation to the circumstances where it can reasonably be said that native title does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We need to know where the boundaries are. That is what the public are seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate which raged for months following the High Court's Wik decision, I took the time to consult quite widely with Townsville and Thuringowa constituents. I asked people for their thoughts about the Wik decision and what the government should do. The overwhelming feedback I got was that the government should simply extinguish native title&mdash;cut it out altogether&mdash;and this was a sentiment coming back from a vast cross-section of the public. The bill does not do this, and I do not believe this government would ever propose a bill that would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the suggestions and the rhetoric coming from the opposition, the bill does not seek to extinguish native title. The Prime Minister spelt out the reasons for this in Longreach, saying that the alternative blanket extinguishment is attractive on the surface for many people, but there are serious weaknesses with that approach&mdash;namely, it would most likely be unconstitutional. I agree with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prime Minister and I understand that, for many people, blanket extinguishment seems to be a quick fix and an easy option. But it is not an option. It is not realistic, and the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin and various government committees have recognised this and have not attempted to go down this path. I believe this amendment bill addresses the wider community concerns in a fair and equitable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the introduction of a sunset clause is a fair and sensible decision, and I note with interest the ALP's opposition to this. I do not understand that, because I think a sunset clause is eminently sensible. I do not think anyone in this community wants us to be here in 200 years time having the same battle over and over again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often I have seen ambit native title claims initiated at the first suggestion there might be an industrial or a commercial development somewhere. I have seen the blackmail that has been practised. I have seen the frivolous claims initiated. I have seen how it has held up major developments&mdash;such as the Korea Zinc refinery and the Port Hinchinbrook development&mdash;and that is unfair in its own sense. Both Aboriginal communities and investors in North Queensland certainly need the security that this bill will provide. Sunset clauses will not come into effect until six years after the legislation is enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am fortunate to have been part of this process. I have seen much of the consultation that has gone on. The previous speaker, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), said to us that the Prime Minister basically was a bigot who did not understand what was happening. I find that quite sad, because this Prime Minister resisted many of the calls in the community to act immediately when the Wik decision was brought down. Instead, he consulted very, very widely with all parties. He listened. He tried to get the best outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of months ago, he said to me that, when he had all parties saying, `This is not right,' he reckoned he had found just about the right position to be in. Nobody was happy. What he did was seek a solution that delivers the best outcome, in my view, for all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9066"> Australians, and that includes indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To use the Prime Minister's analogy, the pendulum, I believe and I think the Australian community believes, has swung too far to one side on this issue, and this bill does nothing more than bring the pendulum back to the middle. It is fair. It is equitable. It will deliver the greater certainty that all parties seek. It will not satisfy everyone. I recognise that but, to borrow a phrase from the former Prime Minister, good legislation rarely satisfies 100 per cent of the people 100 per cent of the time. I am certainly very supportive of this  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  and I intend to vote in its favour.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we revisited the debates that took place in this parliament when the High Court announced its Mabo decision, and the subsequent comments that were made when the High Court announced its decisions on the Wik case, we would see that former members of the opposition&mdash;now members of the government&mdash;expressed condemnation of the court and of the Mabo judgment. They were attacks which were ill-considered and prejudiced and which added nothing to the complexity of the political decisions that had to be made flowing from that judgment. We found the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) talking about judicial adventurism in this House. I do not know what he meant by that&mdash;perhaps he meant the High Court had reached decisions that he did not personally favour for political reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an Australian citizen, my rights are not only expressed in the statutes of various parliaments; ultimately, much of the processes and procedures depend upon the common law of England. I must say that, as a former legal practitioner who has only been in two parliaments, if I had to rely on my rights and liberties, I would rather trust our courts and our judges than the governments of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one important aspect of our legal system which I hear my Liberal Party colleagues at naturalisation ceremonies explaining to people: if they become Australian citizens, amongst other things, they will have the right to vote. But also they will have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> equality before the law. What does that mean? It does not mean that, if you are an indigenous person and you have common law rights, your rights are any less than the rights of a pastoralist or the rights of a farmer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What in fact the High Court decided in Wik was that under the common law native title had not been extinguished. They recognised the fact that when the first fleet sailed into Botany Bay every rock, every tree and every bush was owned, that there were trading routes that crisscrossed the breadth of Australia, that there was a culture and that there were spiritual beliefs related to the land and to the fauna and the flora. That is part of an historic heritage which is not the exclusive property of Aboriginal people; it can become part of our broader view of ourselves as a community. If we are a multicultural community, it seems to me the first people we have to think about are our indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it surprising that when the Law Reform Commission examine matter&mdash;as they are entitled to because they are empowered to ensure that recommendations and proposals do not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, are consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and have regard to access to justice and the cost of accessing and dispensing justice&mdash;the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) says, `They are not going to do that because they have not asked me for permission.' If they had asked him for permission, would he have said no? I would like to think that the Attorney&hyphen;General, who I think does have regard for judicial process, would have said yes. But because they were not asked, he says, it is important that you do not know about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My overall political attitude to these sorts of issues is well known, but what do other lawyers say about it? I received a copy of the recommendations that came from the Law Institute of Victoria, which established a working group to review the proposed amendments to the Native Title Act. No&hyphen;one would describe the Law Institute of Victoria as a young, radical body affiliated to the Labor Party or to the trade union movement. I think they are committed to seeing that there is fairness, justice and equality of treatment in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9067"> our legal system and before our courts. In approaching this, they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Equity and access to justice&mdash;procedures should be fair, impartial, accessible and avoid unnecessary costs, delays and formalities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recognition of common law rights&mdash;rights should not be removed or compulsorily acquired lightly or in an unfair manner. In the event of competing interests, a fair balance is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recognition of cultural issues&mdash;particularly disadvantage may occur through strict application of "western" legal processes and procedures without due recognition of the particular needs of the respective parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The rights and protections in the Racial Discrimination Act should be upheld.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They then deal at length with various aspects of this legislation. Under the first heading, `Equity and access to justice', they are quite blunt. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed process robs indigenous Australians of their rights and access to justice and to the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They deal with the proposed amendments in a detailed way, and they point out that the process involves a restriction on the generous common law test that allows a court to determine that native title exists where the applicant can demonstrate maintenance of traditional laws and customs. But the statement is simple: it robs indigenous Australians of their rights and access to justice and to the legal system. They go on to say under `Recognition of common law rights':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new legislation does not `merely codify' common law rights but takes away rights and proposes statutory provisions which may be unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to talk about the recognition of cultural issues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments do not recognise the seriousness of the consequences to indigenous Australians of extinguishing their traditional rights and interests in land. The intention to provide compensation to Aboriginal Australians for the loss of their property rights at a market value (as defined narrowly in the Act) is discriminatory. It denies compensation for the broader values/issues of continuity, spirituality and connection to the land which is of integral importance to indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the rights and protections of the Racial Discrimination Act they say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process proposed robs indigenous Australians of their rights and access to justice and to the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are rights that other Australians enjoy. The statutory removal of common law rights held only by indigenous Australians involve a distinction based on race. The proposed Bill violates the Racial Discrimination Act and Australia's obligations under International Human Rights treaties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Time does not permit me to go into all of the detail that they use to elaborate on all of those conclusions. These are not conclusions drawn up within the opposition. These are not conclusions that rest on anything other than an impartial investigation by a group of lawyers whose political complexion I do not know, but within the legal profession of Victoria&mdash;and I know a bit about that&mdash;I would say there would be more people at the Law Institute of Victoria who would probably be supporters of the government than supporters of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of this is that the High Court itself has said in the Wik decision that, if there is conflict between native title and a pastoral lease, the rights enunciated in the pastoral lease will prevail. It also indicated in that judgment that native title might mean no more than a right to visit the land for the purposes of foraging or for the purposes of carrying out traditional ceremonies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within certain states of Australia&mdash;mainly Queensland and Western Australia&mdash;the Premiers beat up a fear amongst pastoralists that somehow or other their economic future was under dire threat. Many of the utterances that they made were not merely deliberate attacks upon the concept of native title but followed the traditional attitude of some of the leaders in those states in their traditional, longstanding attitude to the whole question of Aboriginal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy that I think is befalling this parliament is that it was open to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to take this opportunity to create an appropriate legal structure and methodology of dealing with the issues of native title, of overseeing negotiating settlements and of overseeing and complementing some of the settlements that have already taken place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9068">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there have been try&hyphen;ons. Try&hyphen;ons are nothing new in the legal system. They occur between large corporate structures, they occur between individuals and they occur in many instances where people of vast resources are able to put pressure for commercial reasons on people with less resources. Try&hyphen;ons are nothing new in our legal system and there are methods and processes of dealing with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the attitude of judicial activism that ran through the mind of the Deputy Prime Minister, which means that we have got a piece of legislation that is discriminatory in its effect, because what it is doing and what it is aimed at doing is not solving this problem but depriving the indigenous people of Australia of their rights&mdash;denying them access under the decisions of the court to what are now recognised as common law rights attaching to their land and themselves. That is a serious step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the detail of it, as impartial bodies have&mdash;the Law Reform Commission and the working party of the Law Institute of Victoria&mdash;one finds that the same conclusions are reached. We cannot have it both ways. We, as a parliament, have to accept the concept that for every citizen there is equality before the law. But what you are saying to one group of Australian citizens is, `Because we do not like the ramifications of this particular judgment, we are going to solve these problems not by reference and not by upholding common law principles but by legislation which will take away the rights of indigenous people at common law and attach to pastoral leases'&mdash;which are a uniquely Australian concept&mdash;`rights which normally attach to freehold land. And that will be done at the expense of the Australian taxpayer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the court has made it clear in its judgment that a common law right is legally enforceable but that if there is a conflict&mdash;if a farmer wants to build a dam or an airport&mdash;between the pastoral lease and native title the pastoral lease will prevail. In that framework it was not appropriate for the Prime Minister to respond in a way that abolishes the rights of one group of people and confers additional rights on pastoral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leaseholders in the upgrading of their rights at the expense of the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you think we are doing this without the eyes of the world being upon us, you are making a grievous mistake. You will be told by journalists, by visitors and by members of the government who are travelling overseas that there is continual criticism in Asian newspapers of the failure of the Prime Minister to deal with the nonsense spoken by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). There is a perception that racism is rife in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what does this Prime Minister do? He goes for the quick fix. Of course there are problems that flow from this, but it was possible if he had used his influence, his wit and his wisdom, if he had any, to lean towards the creation of structures which could negotiate their way through this and which could deal with the problems of legal try&hyphen;ons. There is nothing difficult about that. But what the government has gone for is to reduce the rights of indigenous people and to take a risk with legislation which puts us, in terms of the Racial Discrimination Act, in breach of international conventions. Don't you think there are nations in Asia which will be only too happy to berate us for that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is appalling legislation. The Prime Minister, who was given an opportunity to pull this nation together and to recognise the longstanding grievances, hopes and aspirations of our indigenous people, has walked away from it because he was not prepared to stand up to the Premier of Queensland and to the Premier of Western Australia and their sleazy, dishonest arguments. This legislation ought to be withdrawn because, as has already been pointed out by my colleagues, it will have the impact of not solving problems but creating more legal argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the Prime Minister really believe that the High Court of Australia, which have expounded these principles, are going to roll over? Are they going to say, `Because the Prime Minister and government feel we have got it wrong, we must now reverse the underlying sense of justice which prevails in their judgment?' Of course they are not. So this legislation is going to be subject to challenge, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9069"> and that challenge is going to produce more tension and more confrontation&mdash;confrontation that does not need to exist in this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the Prime Minister could not bring himself to apologise for the problems which have bedevilled the Aboriginal community in this generation, he could not bring himself to say sorry to Aboriginal people on the basis of a report which I believe had to be dealt with in that way&mdash;it did not give the bishops, the churchmen or other important leaders in our community any problem about saying sorry&mdash;and now, when given an opportunity to create a structure which will in fact be seen by Aboriginal people as delivering a level of justice to them and ensuring that their rights of common law are no less than those of every other Australian, the Prime Minister has funked it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is going to create many problems for our nation and for our people. More definitely it will create, as I think has been pointed out, further scope for legal argument. This legislation will not solve these problems, it will simply extend it, and we will have a situation where there will be more confusion and more uncertainty as this goes back&mdash;as it will go back, as everybody knows it will go back&mdash;to the High Court. I therefore propose to vote against this legislation and I believe the position taken by the opposition ought to be seriously considered by members of the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no doubt the suggestions being made by the opposition will be looked at carefully by the government and that during this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill serious consideration will be given to them. I am not a lawyer, which I suppose I would regard as being something of a strength, particularly when it comes to a debate about this. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) is making the suggestion that this will be an ongoing fertile ground for lawyers and for courts. I suspect he may be right about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is also right when he says that the eyes of the world are upon us as we look at this particular issue and contend with it. I do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think he disputes&mdash;and nobody in this place disputes&mdash;that this has been a difficult issue. For those of us in the parliament who have been here for a few years, it has been a difficult issue since the High Court Mabo decision and it has been divisive in the Australian community. What we have before us now is another step in the process of attempting to address the issues, solve the problems and face up to the challenges which are presented to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not accept that the member for Melbourne Ports is right when he says that this is about abolishing the rights of one group of people in favour of another. In fact, on the contrary, from the outset in this issue the government has been careful to produce a balanced response which looks after the interests of all concerned&mdash;the indigenous groups as well as land&hyphen;holders. I do not think anyone can argue that that was not the right place to start, that we had to balance in some way the interests of everybody concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of misinformation floating around about the government's intentions and there have been a lot of attempts to frighten people. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), in her contribution to this debate, attempted to do just that: to misrepresent the government's intentions by somehow comparing what is happening in Australia with what is happening in other countries. It is true that the problem faced by us in Australia with respect to indigenous people is not dissimilar to the same sorts of challenges that are being faced up to in other countries. But let me very quickly make clear what the government's intentions are with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we should understand that the government's proposals do not overturn the Wik decision any more than we would seek to overturn the Mabo decision. We accept that as a starting point. We, on this side of the parliament, have probably moved a considerable way since that legislation was passed through the parliament, but there is a broad acceptance that there were major deficiencies with the original legislation that had to be fixed. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9070">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to the Wik decision and the legislation that we are dealing with do not overturn the Wik decision. I should also make clear that the common law relating to native title on pastoral leases will continue to operate. In line with the Wik decision, the bill confirms the rights of pastoral leaseholders, and that those rights will prevail over those of native title holders. Further, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made it clear that there will be no mass freeholding at the expense of native title holders or taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main concerns that many of us in this place have about this whole issue is how it will impact on the process of reconciliation. I need to make the point that reconciliation is only under threat from those who deliberately misrepresent the High Court's Mabo and Wik decisions and the federal government's 10&hyphen;point plan. I believe strongly in the process of reconciliation. I am on record as having said on a number of occasions in this place that, as we run down toward the year 2001 when we will celebrate our centenary as a nation, our celebrations will be hollow and even hypocritical if we have not by that time seriously advanced the process of reconciliation or, desirably, brought the process to some degree of finality if that is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that most Australians want that to occur&mdash;and I hope that most understand the importance of that occurring&mdash;unless they want to take the view that is espoused in some sections of the community that it is somehow not our problem&mdash;that it happened a long time ago, that we did not cause the problem and, therefore, we can sweep it under the carpet or simply bury our heads in the sand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, in one way or another, that process has to be furthered. But nothing is served by those who go around this community attempting to misrepresent what the government is attempting to do with this legislation and with its response to the Mabo and Wik decisions. The plan and the legislation that the government has arrived at&mdash;and the Prime Minister, to his great credit, was personally involved every step of the way in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the negotiations with the various interested parties&mdash;work to promote balanced coexistence between those holding interests in the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that, in a sense, that is the crux of the debate that is going on here. But because I do believe in the process of reconciliation and I think I understand&mdash;and this understanding has not come easily to me&mdash;what the process of reconciliation is about, it has been important for me, in dealing with this legislation, to come to the view that this particular legislation is not inconsistent with finding a desirable end and, hopefully, a substantial degree of reconciliation between black and white people in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that this particular legislation promotes balanced coexistence and that it is not, in that sense, damaging to the process of reconciliation. But what is damaging to that process are those who seek to misrepresent or exaggerate, and the member for Oxley is foremost amongst those. Almost every word she says here in this place and outside is divisive and certainly is damaging the process of reconciliation, which she apparently pays no regard to and obviously has no understanding of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take serious issue with a number of the remarks made by the member for Oxley in this debate. Yesterday, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today this House will debate whether we are to be one people belonging to one nation or many peoples belonging to many nations. For many years Australia has been divided through policies of multiculturalism and an unfair view of history that have led to the impractical, discriminatory and stupid notion of land rights, and special treatment for so&hyphen;called minorities at the expense of everyone else.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is just rhetoric. It is shallow and it is hollow and, essentially, it is untrue and it is divisive. I have got no doubt that it appeals to some people who just simply need to be educated about the challenge that we face as a nation on this issue of reconciliation. In her speech she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Aborigines comprise less than two per cent of our population, yet they will claim perhaps as much as 75 per cent of land that is supposed to belong to us all. It is beyond belief to even consider giving less than two per cent of the population of Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9071"> ia a stranglehold over 75 per cent of Australia, yet that is the issue before us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In very simplistic terms&mdash;and of course that is the sort of logic she is appealing to&mdash;that might be the case, but it is not. This legislation is not about handing back three&hyphen;quarters of Australia in some total sense to our Aboriginal people. In her speech, she went on to talk about the degree of disadvantage. Let me deal with that issue; I want to put on record my view about that because that seems to be the crux of her constant attack on the interests of our Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very instructive to look at the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was completed back in 1989. I am relying on some information here that was actually provided by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, but I do not doubt its veracity for a moment, and I shall quote from this material. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation booklet entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Walking together: building better relationships between all Australians</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission examined the deaths in custody of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons. The profile of the dead was, and is, astounding. Of the 99, only two had completed secondary school and 43 had experienced childhood separation from their families&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and, if I get time, I would like to comment briefly on the removal of Aboriginal children as an issue&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions. Their standard of health ranged from poor to very bad.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was where they were on the scale. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average of those who died from natural causes was a little over 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point needs to be made, again quoting from this material:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite some people's belief that indigenous Australians live a privileged life on `government handouts'. . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the line of the member for Oxley. That is what she wants everyone to think, and she says so in the speech that she made the other day. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, they do not have a monopoly on being disadvantaged, as it is also true that a million other Australians are not working. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we are talking about unemployment, yes, a million Australians are not working and some of them are Aborigines. But let us look at some of the other measures of disadvantage and put the lie to the argument that the member for Oxley puts forward as a justification for this constant berating of the interests of our Aboriginal people. Some people do believe that, somehow, Aborigines are living on handouts. But it is very clear, when you look at the facts, that indigenous Australians are the most disadvantaged group in our community. To the extent that our welfare system is predicated on giving to those in need, there can be no doubt that our Aboriginal people are the most disadvantaged of Australians. The material continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On average the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander unemployment rate is four times the national average&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and the member for Oxley picked on unemployment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and incomes are less than two&hyphen;thirds that of other Australians. Health and housing figures show a massive gap in the well&hyphen;being of indigenous and other Australians. About 11 per cent of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population aged 15 years and over have never attended school.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Few of them have graduated from high school, but that percentage has never attended school. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A child born of indigenous parents will, on average, live 20 fewer years than a child born at the same time of parents in the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the degree of disadvantage we are talking about. The member for Oxley, and others who share those sorts of views, take the line that somehow Aboriginal people are getting special treatment. If you look at the figures, you will see that they need and deserve special treatment. But they do not want handouts; they do not want welfare. Let me put the lie to that argument which we so often hear. They want help and assistance and I believe that is, arguably, what we owe them. We owe them the help and assistance that they require so that they can enjoy the same standards of living and other measures that other Australians enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of this debate, I want to make it clear that I disagree very strongly

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I hope the member for Mitchell shares my views on this issue. I am not sure that he has said quite as much about it as I have, but I believe he would share my views. The irony is that Ms Hanson says that we must be one nation, and that we must not have an Aboriginal or any other nation within our nation. There is no suggestion whatsoever that that is going to occur. That is the argument that we are having. We must be one nation, but we will not be one nation, we will not even be a nation, if we do not come to grips with the problems of our Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, if we continue the run&hyphen;down to 2001 without having solved the problems then we, as a nation,  will be the lesser for it. The argument is about us becoming one nation, but it is also about recognising what that actually means. It does not mean simply driving the wedge in further between Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal people in Australia; it means taking a realistic approach. It has been important for me, in dealing with this legislation, to be assured that the 10&hyphen;point plan that the Prime Minister has negotiated was not inconsistent with my strong belief that we must move down the track urgently towards reconciliation; that that process is not under threat from this particular legislation. There will be those on the other side who will argue that it is under threat and that is, again, one of the cruxes of this debate. But, for my own conscience, it has been important for me to satisfy myself that what we are proposing to do is not inconsistent with that particular objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently visited Sri Lanka, one of the many troubled nations around the world. When you look at the basis for the trouble that is occurring there, you can see in that country a vivid illustration of the fact that a nation cannot separate itself from its history. It is often the history of a nation that leads to these problems. Sometimes, as we have seen in the former Yugoslavia&mdash;and which has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been seen in a lot of other places&mdash;it is a history that goes back thousands of years. Yet ours only goes back 200 years&mdash;to 1788. The recency of that makes it more difficult for us to separate ourselves from our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I do not pretend that we should necessarily take the black&hyphen;armband view of history. We could easily say, `We weren't there in 1788; it's not our problem.' That is not the argument. None of us was here when it happened, but the fact is that we, as a nation, need to face up to the fact that certain things did happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote from former Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs's remarks when he launched the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Past wrongs, future rights: anti&hyphen;discrimination, native title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy, 1975&hyphen;997</EMPHASIS>, written by Michael Warby of the Tasman Institute, which he suggested that every politician should read&mdash;and I do not disagree. I have not read it yet, so I had better not commend it. But I did enjoy reading Sir Harry Gibbs's remarks when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The collision that occurred after 1788 between the members of a developed society and the Palaeolithic hunter gatherers who inhabited Australia not only made it impossible for the indigenous inhabitants of the continent to adapt to the change, it also rendered it quite impossible for those expanding white settlement to do so in a way which could prevent the destruction of Aboriginal society. The resulting disruption of Aboriginal life left an entrenched bitterness on the part of the Aboriginal people, which was exacerbated by the perception that they were despised as inferiors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was a very good speech and, at the end, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues tend to provoke bitter divisions in the Australian community, and reason, temperance and goodwill, rather than emotion, exaggeration and animosity, are required to resolve them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think he is absolutely right. We will debate this legislation in this parliament, and there will be some of that emotion and exaggeration. We have already seen it. I am not berating members of the opposition because, other than the speech of the member for Melbourne Ports, who made some very good points, I have not heard any of the other speeches. I mentioned the member for Oxley, and I definitely accuse her of emotion, exag 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9073"> geration and every other decent adjective, I suppose, I can think of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if we are going to resolve the problem as a parliament and as a nation then we must do so with reason, temperance and goodwill. I happen to think that it is in our nation's absolute best interest to resolve the issue. I accept what the member for Melbourne Ports says, that lawyers and courts may continue to argue, but for my part I think that this legislation furthers the process, and I support it for that reason. I hope that I have made it very clear in my remarks to this House today that, as a conservative member of this place, I understand&mdash;and the understanding has not come easily&mdash;the importance of reconciliation with our Aboriginal people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting when one comes into this place to speak about what is unquestionably a matter of genuine national importance that, even when we disagree about the bill, we can often find many members on both sides of the House who agree on many of the issues that need to be addressed in its approach. I find myself in the pleasant circumstance of saying to the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) that, while I disagree with his detailed views about the Native Title Amendment Bill, I endorse many of the remarks he made in his second reading contribution. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to stand up and say that. There were many principled points he articulated which should be shared by the overwhelming majority of the House, and I welcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for me is that, while this is unquestionably a matter of profound national importance, we have here a bill dealing with issues that go to the very integrity and moral and spiritual core of this nation, and to the interests of the most underprivileged members of this nation&mdash;our indigenous people. But, in my view, we approach the bill within a flawed context because of its shortcomings. It is a necessary bill; a bill had to be introduced to respond to the High Court decision on Wik, just as a bill had to be introduced to respond to the High Court decision on Mabo&mdash;the original Native Title Act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe, and the opposition does not believe, that this bill comprehensively or adequately responds to all the aspects of Wik, and I support the comprehensive amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). He makes it clear in the amendment that the opposition acknowledges that there are aspects of the bill which may advance many of the objectives that we share in common, in particular by encouraging and assisting the entering into of agreements and by setting a stricter regime for the registration of claims. However, there are a number of other concerns that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been asked by the whips not to use the full 20 minutes, to enable as many colleagues as possible to speak to this. I will try to accommodate myself to that requirement. In the all too brief time allocated for discussion of this very important legislation, I want to particularly focus on clauses 7(f) and (g) of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's amendment, those that relate particularly to the issue of the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regard it as a very important issue. It is central to this whole debate and brings into sharp focus the essence of the difference between the opposition and the government on the issue of native title. In so doing, it will also point up some of the contrasts in approach that flow through into other legislation and how similar conceptual differences&mdash;similar important differences of fundamental approach to the concerns of Australians and to the reconciliation of differences between Australians in different circumstances&mdash;need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help but pause to reflect for a moment on the advice from the Australian Law Reform Commission, which we now have the benefit of, despite&mdash;it must be said&mdash;the very best efforts of the government to cover it up. The detail of that advice is emerging and becoming more apparent to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to waste too much time discussing the shabby circumstances surrounding the attempt to cover up that advice. The people of Australia can and will make their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9074"> own judgments about that and about a government which goes out of its way to seek to ensure that an advice by the country's leading law reform body is not provided to members of the parliament to assist them in their deliberation on this bill. It is a government which sought to make sure that it had the opportunity to assess that advice but, when it did not like the advice, it sought to make sure that the parliament and the people of Australia never knew that the advice existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, I must say, a wonderful irony&mdash;and it happens so often in our democracy&mdash;that the incompetent way that the government has gone about trying to cover up the Law Reform Commission's advice has given greater profile and status to that advice, which otherwise might have gone essentially unremarked. It is a profile and status that that advice warrants on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important advice from the Australian Law Reform Commission. It offers some very damning criticisms of this bill. The most damning indictment offered is contained in the following paragraph. I do not wish to do it an injustice by summarising it. I will read the paragraph in full:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission believes that, not only are the declared objectives mutually inconsistent&mdash;in particular, competing notions of the preservation of native title and the validation and confirmation by way of purported extinguishment of native title, of prior grants of property rights&mdash;but also that the proposed means by which they are to be achieved are inadequate and counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A more devastating critique of a piece of legislation is hard to imagine. What the commission is saying is that the bill is flawed in two fundamental respects. It is flawed in its ends and it is flawed in the means which it seeks to use to achieve those ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an achievement! What a sorry reflection of incompetence&mdash;flawed in its means as well as in its ends. But, far more importantly, what a serious problem for the future of good governance of the nation, for our hopes of reconciliation and for the legitimate expectations of the indigenous peoples of this country to a say in the use of the land in which they have legally recognised property rights.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is these legitimate expectations on which I wish to focus today, because it is these that are central to the right to negotiate which is presently so important a part of the Native Title Act. The opposition understands and accepts the importance of the right to negotiate. We start from a fundamentally different premise than the government when it comes to recognition of native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a number of my colleagues who have spoken before me have highlighted, we recognise the notion that native title is a fundamental legal property right recognised by the common law of this country which is entitled to the same respect and protection as other property rights recognised by the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contrast with the government could not be more stark. They refuse to accept that native title is a fundamental legal property right; rather they see it as an intrusion or an encumbrance or an obstacle to the exercise of other property rights not peculiar to non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. In essence, the government regards native title rights as illegitimate, and that is a great indictment of the government. It is a failure of vision; it is a failure to understand what a strong, united Australia in the 21st century fundamentally requires. But at least it does allow us to understand why it is that the government is proposing such a wholesale restriction and, in some cases, removal of the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard&mdash;and I personally regard&mdash;the right to negotiate as a necessary and important aspect of common law native title rights. The right to negotiate gives practical effect to native title rights. It gives the prospective holders of native title rights a say in the future use of the property to which their native title rights attach. This is of fundamental importance. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition put it succinctly in his second reading speech when he said that the right to negotiate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . amounts to a legitimate form of economic empowerment of a group of Australians who have been spectacularly denied respect and a capacity to advance themselves economically through just about the whole 200&hyphen;plus years of Australian history.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9075">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the right to negotiate is a legitimate means to restore some balance to a relationship which would otherwise be significantly imbalanced; a relationship which pits long recognised traditional common law rights of property against newly recognised rights of property, which because of the attitude of the coalition and their fellow travellers are struggling for broader acceptance, and a relationship which pits the economic power of mining and pastoral interests against the moral power of indigenous rights to their traditional lands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It comes as no surprise to me that the government is blind to the need to redress this power imbalance because, in my principal responsibility as shadow minister for industrial relations, this is an issue that I have confronted on many occasions. The government's Workplace Relations Act is also blind to this power imbalance relationship&mdash;the relationship between the employer and the employee at work. That power relationship, which is also of profound importance to the way our society works, is similarly misunderstood by this conservative government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the House, the members have shown by their response and instinctive recognition that the relationship between employer and employee is fundamentally weighted in favour of the employer. Therefore, we see the need to provide employees with fundamental rights to redress this imbalance: the right to bargain collectively, the right to access the Industrial Relations Commission and the right to have wages and conditions protected by an effective award system. But the government is blind to this. They start from the flawed assumption that employees at work are capable of representing their own interests before their employer and that they do not need these rights. That is why they have introduced an act which so fundamentally undermines these rights. It is the same myopic view which explains why they have introduced this bill, which systematically undermines the right to negotiate enjoyed by indigenous Australians. It flows from the same fundamental misunderstanding of the differential power relationships that exist not just in Australian society but in any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> free society. Make no mistake: undermining the right to negotiate is precisely what this bill will do. The scale is unprecedented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Law Institute of Victoria has identified numerous instances in which this bill removes or restricts the right to negotiate in specific cases; for example, the reduction in the period allowed for negotiation and in the period during which arbitration must take place, the removal of the right to negotiate at both the exploration and the production stages of mining development, the provision to exclude non&hyphen;exclusive areas on the basis that states and territories will provide suitable alternative procedures, the provision to exclude mining renewals from the right to negotiate, the widening of the exclusion in relation to private construction of infrastructure facilities and the exclusion in relation to future mining acts. Needless to say, the Law Institute of Victoria comes to the damning conclusion that these provisions of the bill undermine and contravene common law principles in relation to native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The now infamous Law Reform Commission advice also reserves some harsh criticism for the bill's attack on the right to negotiate. The commission does a devastating job of destroying the government's whole rationale for the proposed changes. It then concludes that the right to negotiate provisions in the bill are detrimental to native title holders. That goes to the whole question of constitutionality, which I do not have time to address but which goes to the core of the Law Reform Commission's and the opposition's criticism of this legislation. Its inherent probable unconstitutionality makes the situation more uncertain rather than less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an indictment against the government. Its own law reform agency has categorically concluded that the government is proposing to act to the detriment of indigenous Australians. No wonder the government tried so desperately to gag the commission. No wonder it has acted so stridently to cover up the commission's advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other aspects of the legislation that warrant equal or more detailed consideration than the right to negotiate provision to which I have referred. But, with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9076"> 20 and more of my colleagues choosing to speak on this, and with pressure from the whips&mdash;quite understandable and proper in this instance&mdash;that we do not speak for too long so that many of our colleagues can speak, I will restrict myself to a focus on those two aspects of the amendments proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, endorse his and the leader's remarks in response to the bill as a whole and support the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the amendment is passed by the House. I hope also that, by the time the parliament as a whole has concluded its consideration of this very important piece of legislation, we have a more adequate, comprehensive package that responds to the High Court's decision in Wik in a way that preserves the core principles of the Mabo No. 2 decision and the Wik decision of the High Court, recognises the rights of indigenous Australians as well as the rights of miners and pastoralists and gives us that certainty and that fairness of outcome that properly constituted legislation in response to Wik can and should achieve.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This move to debate the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , amending the Native Title Act 1993, is of enormous significance in the history of Australia's evolution. These amendments will bring us to the stage where not only do the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have their status and rights as the previous owners of the land acknowledged in law but that law will be made workable. Once amended, this legislation can do the job that was originally intended. It can become the vehicle for the delivery of some native title to indigenous people where acts of title extinguishment have not occurred over the years of closer settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it stands, the act has been nothing more than a mirage, a cruel hoax that promised so much and delivered so very little. After nearly four years and with 612 applications covering 45 per cent of Australia lodged, not one native title has been delivered through the workings of the act. No-one would deny that the previous government had very good intentions when it tried to translate the Mabo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 2 judgments into legislation. However, that government's workmanship and its attention to detail was shoddy; it was badly advised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process of registering, evaluating and granting native title should have been an important part of the reconciliation process for all Australians. Instead, the problems with this act have heightened the cynicism in non-indigenous Australians, in the community as a whole. The act in its current form has pitted one indigenous group against another. The genuine claimants find themselves competing in what I would call a compensation driven frenzy, as dozens of other claimants try to negotiate with those same mining companies. Tragically, references to secret women's business and `how to pick a sacred site' are now standard in stand&hyphen;up comedy and office party routines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is 30 years since Vincent Lingiari led his Gurindji countrymen into history, as he withdrew their labour in a demand for better pay and land rights. Thirty years should have been enough to redress past wrongs. However, today we debate amendments to the 1993 act because we still have not got it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important at this time to pause to acknowledge all the contributions, and reflect on the long and bitter struggle, of generations of indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians who laid the foundations for the recognition of the survival of some native title. They had the persistence which ultimately led to the High Court victory for Eddie Mabo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal land rights movement evolved in line with Aboriginal demands for full citizenship rights, decent wages and work conditions, and self&hyphen;determination. The pleas for recognition of land rights began long ago. For example, on 5 July 1882, a deputation of Aboriginal community leaders presented a memorial to their member, Mr Alfred Deakin, in the great hall of Victoria's parliament house. They asked to be released from the jurisdiction of the Aboriginal Protection Board and they wanted security of tenure for the lands they farmed at Coranderrk. The media report in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Leader</EMPHASIS> on 15 July&mdash;that was a Melbourne newspaper at the time&mdash;spent many of its column inches marvelling at the formal morning dress, the decent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9077"> English and the dignified demeanour of those presenting their case to one of Australia's greatest statesmen. The journalist wondered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where is the restless, furtive, hunted look about the eyes, which we are wont to regard as one of the most characteristic of aboriginal features, and as a sure index of the aboriginal nature?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The deputation's request for self&hyphen;determination and land tenure was denied. The memorialists were told by the chief colonial secretary that they `must go back and make the best of it'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commentator witnessing this exchange was moved to write in his editorial a few days later, in 1882 in Melbourne in Victoria:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such is the case of the poor blackfellows of Coranderrk; and we may state our conviction that did the public but thoroughly understand it, they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the memorialists&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would not have much longer to wait before getting (what they want). The public, we believe, would recognise the great principle involved, that the blacks have rights which we are bound to respect, and that to allow them to be deprived of their rights would be a lasting stain upon the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">William Cooper, Sir Douglas Nichols, the people of Cumeragundja and many others like them spent the first decades of this century trying to gain security of tenure over the land they farmed on reserves or where they squatted in fringe camps in towns and cities throughout Australia. Spurred on by the US Indian Lands Development Act, they knew their circumstances could be different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the 1960s the battle for rights to land focused on eastern Australia, but in the 1960s it turned to the areas where traditional Aboriginal culture still held sway, in northern Australia. In 1963 the Yirrkala in Arnhem Land faced the excision of some 140 square kilometres of their reservation lands. A bauxite mine was to be established in the area. The now famous bark petitions were submitted to this federal parliament. There was widespread media attention. The time had come for the first official inquiry into land rights in Australia to be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1967, when most of us here were still teenagers, Vincent Lingiari put down his stock whip and led his people quietly away 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from their work at Wave Hill Station. The first demand articulated was for a decent living wage but, as the mainstream media began to focus on the novel events in this remote corner, they found Vince was determined to lead the community in a long and bitter fight to obtain title to their traditional home country, an area largely under lease to pastoralist Lord Vestey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Gurindji continued on strike, camped in the heart of their traditional lands at Wattie Creek, the long awaited Northern Territory High Court judgment on the Yirrkala people's challenge to the excision of their land was brought down. It was the summer of 1972. Mr Justice Blackburn's ruling acknowledged that the Aborigines had a spiritual link to their land but rejected the contention that this involved a property or economic relationship. Thus, Justice Blackburn argued that there was no capacity within Australian common law or property law to recognise indigenous rights to the land.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his second supplementary answer on the Australian Law Reform Commission yesterday, when he said that he had received in August a minute containing the following paragraph:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Law Reform Commission has submitted a critical submission addressing supposed breaches of international treaty obligations and questioning the constitutional basis of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Prime Minister, when precisely was that minute brought to you or your office's attention and by whom? Given that you have delayed the return to order in the Senate until after question time today, can you advise this House whether your search in response to that order has turned up further documents which make your second supplementary answer yesterday on this matter incomplete or incorrect?</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the document was brought to my attention yesterday. I am not aware of any other documents. I have asked that further searches be carried out; if there is anything further, I will let the House know as appropriate. I take the opportunity of saying that, lest the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he has lighted upon something, the second supplementary answer that I gave to the Leader of the Opposition's question in no way alters the substance of this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substance of this issue is that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth has acted correctly at all times. What matters is the substance. The substance is that there was no reference on these matters to the Australian Law Reform Commission. It has long been the situation that the Australian Law Reform Commission acts on references.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you seen recent reports which have confirmed that the coalition's family tax initiative is helping those families who need it most? How much better off will a low income family be under the family tax initiative? Does this confirm that the coalition government is the only government to have brought true benefits to Aussie battlers?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="9079" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I take the opportunity of reminding the House of the enormous benefits to Australian families of the coalition's family tax initiative. That initiative, worth $1 billion of tax relief to Australian families, is a very generous, well targeted initiative which was delivered in full, on time, without deduction, in accordance with the undertaking that had been given by me on behalf of the coalition parties during the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members will be aware, under this initiative the government increased the tax&hyphen;free threshold by $1,000 a child for families on incomes up to $70,000. The family tax initiative also provides additional benefits for single income families. If these families earn below $65,000 a year and have at least one child under the age of five, they are eligible for a further increase in their tax&hyphen;free threshold of $2,500. This income cut&hyphen;out also increases by $3,000 for each additional dependent child. This, as I know honourable members on the government side will be aware, translates to a $500 a year increase in disposable income for single income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent piece of information about this initiative has come to my attention in the past few days. It comes out of a recent presentation at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, known as NCSEM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dr Lawrence interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice the member for Fremantle is interjecting about NCSEM. I am glad the member for Fremantle has interjected. She might like to interject on this observation of the presentation. It is particularly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important for those in the parliament&mdash;and most of them are on my side of the House&mdash;who really do represent the average Australian and represent battling Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what the presentation had to say, and it makes very interesting reading against the class posturing of those who sit behind the Leader of the Opposition. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall impact of the measure was progressive as the largest gains in percentage terms were received by the families in the lowest private family income deciles.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, what the NCSEM presentation was saying was that this was a measure deliberately and successfully targeted to help the low income section of the Australian community. In other words, it was a progressive, pro&hyphen;battler tax initiative. It was not a measure designed to help either the big end of town or those people who are able to look after themselves. I think the Australian Labor Party should ponder that presentation, seeing that it tried to destroy the superannuation tax surcharge. What was it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry rolled the Leader of the Opposition on that, didn't he? The NCSEM finding also contained a damning indictment of the former Labor government. NCSEM said that the bottom 30 per cent of working families with dependent children had lower private family incomes in 1993-94 than they had in 1981-82. On both surveys the Labor Party loses out very badly. Not only is our measure seen as a pro-battler, progressive taxation initiative but the comparison of disposable family incomes for the low income deciles of the Australian community compare very badly in terms of the Labor years against 1981-82, the last full financial year of the Fraser government.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<ANSWER PAGE="9080" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say in reply to the honourable member that the reforms to the aged care sector which have been carried out by this government and for which I warmly thank the Minister for Family Services are changes and reforms that were long overdue. They are changes and reforms which the Labor opposition have done their level best to misrepresent and about which they have done their level best to create a campaign of fear amongst elderly people within the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it very plain to the House that these reforms will inject a much needed amount of additional capital into Australian nursing homes. Most importantly, the model that has been used in these reforms is essentially the model that was followed by the Keating Labor government. It is absolutely hypocritical of those who sit opposite and who have nothing better to do than to run around scaring older people when, in reality, we are applying a proper income test, we are allowing very generous exemptions, and we are doing what is necessary to rebuild the infrastructure of aged accommodation in Australia. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we followed the rantings of those who sat opposite, we would be condemning old Australians to rapidly deteriorating and dilapidated buildings. We would be condemning many Australians to buildings that did not meet adequate health and other standards laid down by the appropriate authorities in the Australian community. For example, the quality of nursing homes in this country after 13 years of Labor was such that the Department of Health and Family Services recently found that around 300 homes may not meet the standards required to charge accommodation bonds. Are those who sit opposite seriously suggesting that those 300 homes got into that condition in the last 15 months? The reality is that, after 13 years, that was the neglected state of the aged accommodation sector that we have inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The easy and cheap political thing to have done would have been to have squibbed it and ignored it, which you did in the final years that you were in government. Of course it is easy to run a scare campaign. It is easy to get photographs in newspapers about elderly people. But if you had any sense of responsibility and any skerrick of decency about this sector, you would recognise that it is necessary to get money into it and that it is necessary to address the declining state of the infrastructure of the aged accommodation sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of the changes that my government has enacted in this area. The objectives of those changes would be to improve the quality of nursing home buildings. We have provided appropriate funding&mdash;in fact, in many areas we have increased it for dementia care. We have guaranteed higher funding of up to $12 a resident a day for homes which care for financially disadvantaged people, and we have provided increased support for people in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the sort of reform that it is easy to squib if you are a gutless government, and it is the sort of reform that was squibbed by the former government. It is not a reform that we have squibbed. We have tackled it with courage. We have laid the foundation for expansions in this area. I believe it will be

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been advised that there was no record of any advice given that he had such approval. It is up to Senator Sherry to provide the evidence of the advice that he claims he was given that allowed him to make these claims. The senator has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9082"> claimed, both in the media and in the Senate, that he abided by the guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition is now seeking to defend his colleague in relation to his colleague's position. Last night he issued a media release, attaching what he claims to be the relevant guidelines. We all know that there are different guidelines relating to cars and travel allowance claims. It is perfectly obvious why there are different allowances. It is expected that people who are staying in a capital city may incur expenses which are to be recouped through a capital city allowance, which is much larger than would ordinarily apply if you were in more remote and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the car allowance, I am sure members and senators know&mdash;many living, as they do, in electorates beyond cities and suburbs&mdash;that they need transport to meet their parliamentary commitments. The Leader of the Opposition, with advice perhaps, scoured through all the guidelines, and found and used a definition of capital city that obviously suited them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was wrong on two counts. The definition he chose relates to car entitlements and not travel allowance. The definition he chose relates to senators and members, not office-holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to table the relevant documents.

The complete section of the document he used, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senators and Members Entitlements Online</EMPHASIS>, makes it clear that the section he used refers to car transport.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that proves, I think, is that the Leader of the Opposition has done a cut and paste job. I would in other circumstances suggest that it was a doctored document.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Productivity is a measure of output for any given amount of inputs. Productivity is what adds value and productivity is what actually creates wealth in the community. A recent Industry Commission research paper on Australia's productivity performance released last month shows that underlying annual productivity growth is now around two per cent, and it appears to have lifted recently above the long-term trend. The government believes that, if it is to improve competition in our markets, micro&hyphen;economic reform will go towards allowing Australia to boost its productivity and to increase wealth in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an illustration of productivity, I thought we might run the ruler over the opposition's performance in parliament this week to measure their productivity against the goals that they stated that they had at the opening of the week. Of course, it all starts with the member for Hotham, to whom we owe a great debt&mdash;the author of the latest little morals campaign on behalf of the Labor Party. He was asked on the Channel Nine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program this question&mdash;the final issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it true that files from the Department of Administrative Services computers on parliamentarians' travel and charter flights have been downloaded to the opposition via the Internet?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crean: Yes. And it is not the only way we have our information, Laurie. I mean I think it is amazing&mdash;over the last 72 hours&mdash;the extent of the information that's come to us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just to clarify that, he is asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You're saying that information from DAS computers was downloaded into your computers in opposition?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I neither confirm nor deny, Laurie. I simply say we've got a wealth of information.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9084"> as I said. The receiver of stolen information. The Arthur Daley of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Sunday, of course, when he was asked about Senator Nick Sherry's claims and why they were so high, he said, `Oh, Senator Nick Sherry doesn't have a home.' Poor old Nick Sherry. He becomes the Bedouin from Burnie pitching his tent across the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania. But it gets curiouser and curiouser, because although it appears that Senator Nick Sherry did not have a home on Sunday, by Monday he had one, and it was his office or his office was his home or his home was his office. By day the Bedouin of Burnie but, by night, nocturnally, he is just the home&hyphen;town boy going home to mum at Opossum Bay&mdash;the Boogie&hyphen;Woogie Bugle Boy from Opossum Bay, he becomes known as.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that becomes known and the Opposition Leader is asked to comment on Senator Sherry, rather than actually discipline Senator Sherry he engages in this extraordinary attempt to try to claim that Opossum Bay is a capital city, Hobart, and that you need $300 to stay in Opossum Bay&mdash;presumably because accommodation costs are great. There is no hotel in Opossum Bay; there is not even a motel in Opossum Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then he produces this press release which uses a definition for car transport. He says in his release that this is the definition of `capital city' for the purposes of travel allowance&mdash;completely false. When you look at the attachment, you can see that the bit making it clear that it was in relation to car allowance has been cut off the top of the definition before it was photocopied and put out. Can you see what we are dealing with now? Edward Scissorhands&mdash;you know, cutting off the top and putting it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition said on Sunday that he would have the courage to deal with these people; he said that he would have the courage to deal with Senator Sherry&mdash;but he did not.

So, Australian ownership is good and foreign investment is welcome in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to taxation, foreign corporations in this country pay the tax that they are assessed under the laws of this country. When you produce figures like that, they invariably show low taxation rates because there might be, for example, negative gearing in relation to that or depreciation in relation to that&mdash;which Australian companies can claim as well as a foreign corporation. This government is serious about making sure that corporations&mdash;and, indeed, individuals&mdash;pay their fair share of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you some of the measures that we have introduced&mdash;I hope you supported them. One of them, of course, was the announcement in the recent budget of the changes in relation to foreign source income. We have changed the rules in relation to foreign source income so that, in relation to passive income, you are not treated as an equal country, except New Zealand and the G7 countries with comparable taxation regimes. That was done to tighten up taxation in relation to international tax agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We introduced changes in relation to withholding tax to cover royalty payments as well, because it was becoming clear that interest payments could be dressed up as royalty payments and would escape the scope of the interest withholding tax arrangements. We introduced those matters to make sure that corporations are paying a fair share of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia took the lead in holding a joint symposium between APEC and the OECD to discuss transfer pricing. Australia is considered to be one of the leaders in this area. Whilst the OECD has guidelines in relation to taxation, they are not well known in the APEC countries. So we had a symposium, which I opened, in Sydney last year dealing with international taxation arrangements to try to discuss comparable arrangements around the region.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of people who think, probably, we are too strict in relation to these things, because we are one of the strictest countries. This has been one of the most active governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is always going to be a trade-off in relation to taxation and investment. We want to make sure that foreign corporations pay their fair share. We also want to make this a good place to do business for foreign investors. There is always going to be those two competing equity balances which this government is going to make sure that we keep balanced when we are taking economic decisions that are in the interests of all Australians. They are the principles that guide us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our record is an active one. This government stands tall in relation to tax avoidance. Do I need to remind the House about the measures we took in relation to R&amp;D syndicates? Do I need to remind the House that this was the government that took on superannuation surcharges? Do I need to remind the House that this was the government that took on dividend streaming, that this was the government that dealt with the trading of franking credits. This was another area in which we tightened taxation: the trading of franking credits, which are of no use to income exempts or outside the country. So we put in place measures after discussion with business after the last election to address it. This is a program that all Australians can and should be proud of and this is an active government.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I have noted in recent days there has been some newspaper speculation which indicates that there may be a limit placed upon large investors in respect of the Telstra issue. I noted 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9086"> that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  carried a headline yesterday, I think it was, which said `Big Telstra investors face limit'. I can confirm to the House that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  got it right: big investors will face some limits in respect of the Telstra issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made a decision to put an upper limit in the broker firm allocations for each individual client. That upper limit is likely to be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 shares for each individual client of a broker firm. I want to confirm that by making that decision the government is again giving a clear massage to the people of Australia that it regards the Telstra offer as a people's float, a people's privatisation, and we are determined to give as many Australians as possible, the mums and dads of Australia, the opportunity to purchase shares in this company, the opportunity to invest in a great Australian company, in a very exciting area which has considerable growth in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the government is determined to ensure there is a spread of shares in all parts of Australia. I am sure the honourable member for Stirling would appreciate the fact that the government has appointed an independent accountant. That independent accountant is to advise on the broker applications. The criteria that will be used is to ensure that brokers right around Australia, including brokers that service the honourable member's electorate of Stirling, brokers in Perth, in Adelaide and in like cities, are given an allocation to ensure that there is a spread of these shares on offer to the public in all parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, when the brokers apply for an allocation of shares they will be required to indicate to the independent accountant just what shares they are prepared to give to the Financial Planners Association of Australia to ensure again that the spread occurs. I am sure all honourable members would know that there are several hundred members of the Financial Planners Association spread throughout Australia. They are in towns like Ballarat, Bendigo, Toowoomba and Townsville, not capital cities. Last year investments through the Financial Planners Association of Australia in shares amounted to something like $16 billion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further point I want to make is that, whilst the offer document indicates that the minimum level of shares will be 400, or 600 if someone reserved the offer document through the guarantee that applies there, I want to assure the House that this will not become a de facto maximum level. In the event that the offer is oversubscribed and a scaling back of applications is necessary, that scale back that does occur will be weighted to ensure that small investors receive as close as possible the number of shares that they applied for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is significant enthusiasm in respect of this particular offer, as has been evidenced by the media in the past few days. What that translates to in terms of applications remains to be seen over the next few weeks. Again, I assure the House that the government is inclined to ensure in the allocation of shares in this offer that the ordinary Australian, the mums and dads, will be accommodated. We are not about simply looking after the big investors in this country. In the manner in which we put this issue together, it will certainly be about ordinary Australians and the rules will ensure that occurs.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are good with the paste and the scissors. The latest developments in the coal industry in New South Wales are important and should be reflected on. As members will be aware, there has been a long&hyphen;running dispute at the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine, and we have seen an attempt by the CFMEU to try to spread that dispute to a range of other coalmines in New South Wales. In the last 24 hours they have in fact announced this planned much wider industrial disruption. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to that attempt by the CFMEU and the Labor Party to try to widen this dispute, applications have been sought under the new Workplace Relations Act to obtain from the commission an order under section 127 to require a return to work. What is very interesting is that in response to the 127 application, which has been in the commission in the last 24 hours, we, in fact, saw the unions&mdash;under the threat of the handing down of a 127 application&mdash;call off their industrial action. We also had, I think perhaps for the first time, a commissioner stating that the commission may, in any future developments in respect of this dispute, act of its own motion; in other words, proceed to issue a section 127 order even without application. The new Workplace Relations Act does provide for the commission to act on its own motion in specified circumstances. As I say, I think that is the first time that has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why that is important is that the way these disputes have run in the coal industry in the past has been that the CFMEU, where they have a particular problem in a particular mine, threaten the whole industry basically through the usual thuggery and industrial tactics to get their way. What we have seen in this particular instance is the successful operation of the government's new Workplace Relations Act to require people to return to work. That is a step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need in this particular dispute to focus on the real problems of inefficiency and lack of productivity in the mining operations. In the time before last when this matter was in the commission, a representative from the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine made a very interesting point. He said that last year they were making a profit of $1 a tonne. Since that time, in April of this year, they have had a price reduction of $3 a tonne. What that tells you is that the economic viability of these operations is under severe threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the international market&mdash;and they have to compete in the international market&mdash;the truth is that these Australian mines are not just competing against themselves; they are competing against mines in South Africa and Indonesia and elsewhere.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We haven't. Very often, for dementia residents, there is nowhere for them to walk. We know that the physical features of modern, contemporary nursing home and hostel care are very important in reducing chemical and physical restraint. Of course, that is one of the aims of this government, to produce a restraint&hyphen;free environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, more importantly, we have found that not only are residents of nursing homes living in an environment that is unsafe&mdash;and these are the most frail and most vulnerable in our community&mdash;but also they are not able to live in comfort and with the dignity that they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have absolutely every confidence in Australian families. The majority of them would not want to see their frail, elderly mother or father or relative living in those kinds of conditions. I have every confidence in Australians in that regard. With the contribution of $13,000, which this government has now set, and unlike Labor which introduced hostel fees where people had to put the whole lot up&hyphen;front, we have said that people entering nursing homes and hostels can now pay their accommodation bond weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly or half&hyphen;yearly, or they can pay in a lump sum if they choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that the maximum a nursing home provider or hostel provider can draw down out of the bond, regardless of what that bond is in total, is $13,000. This means that, if people really want to keep the family home, if relatives want to keep it as part of their inheritance&mdash;and I can fully understand that many relatives would want to do that&mdash;I am sure they will be able to find the small weekly contribution to keep their frail, elderly mother or father or citizen in decent conditions, not in the appalling and squalid conditions that they lived in under a Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear to the House that, regardless of how much the bond is, the drawdown is $2,600 per annum. It can only be drawn down for a maximum of five years, which means that no&hyphen;one who can afford to pay a bond will pay more than $13,000 in total. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now almost 24 hours since Cut and Paste Kim over there released his quite infamous press release. Mr Speaker, this is no small matter. This is a document under the hand of the Leader of the Opposition. This is a document under the hand of a man who not only lacks the moral courage to sack Senator Sherry but, in order to hide his own weakness, is unwilling to acknowledge to the parliament of Australia that he deliberately set out to mislead the people of Australia. There can be no other explanation. This is no mere inadvertent error. This is no mistake of a young mistake maker. This is the deliberately deceptive act of a man who knows that, if he is to match my standards, he ought to sack Senator Sherry. This is the man who has gone on and on about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that has really fascinated me over the last 24 hours is that we have had this suggestion that perhaps we should not talk about these matters any more. We were not having those suggestions at the end of last week. We have only started to have these suggestions from those opposite and from some who sit above us over the last couple of days because it is starting to scorch the hide of the Leader of the Opposition. That is the reason why this has come along and here you have a clear-cut difference in standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the difficulty was, I was prepared to take the difficult action. My opposite number lacks the moral and political courage to get rid of Senator Sherry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The annual South Pacific Forum brings together the leaders of the region's island countries, Australia and New Zealand. It is a good opportunity for informal discussions which are valuable in maintaining a strong sense of community and common interests in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's membership of the forum is an expression of commitment to our partnership with the countries of the region. Australia is part of the region not just because geography makes us neighbours, but also because we have shared interests in the region's stability and in the well&hyphen;being of its people. There are close links between Australians and the people of the South Pacific through business, tourism in both directions, family ties and the many thousands of island people who have been educated in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia recognises that there are harsher dimensions to life in the South Pacific than the idyllic beaches and clear water that tourists enjoy in the island paradises. The other realities for island countries are their isolation, smallness, dependence on the ocean and vulnerability to nature. Australia has always been there to help in times of difficulty, as we are now, for example, in helping Papua New Guinea cope with severe drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My government is committed to strengthening that partnership. We have maintained aid levels to the Pacific, despite cuts in the overall aid budget. About 40 per cent of our total bilateral aid goes to the South Pacific. We are committed to helping island countries achieve their goals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our strong partnership with the countries of the region does not mean that we will not sometimes have differences of approach and perspective. But we have common interests in working them through and reaching, if not full agreement, at least an understanding of each other's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant outcome of this year's forum was leaders' endorsement of the action plan for economic reform drawn up by forum economic ministers in their meeting in Cairns in July. Many of the regional countries&mdash;including the forum's host country, the Cook Islands&mdash;have made good progress in reforming their economies over the past few years. The action plan provides a sound and flexible framework for promoting economic development and will help the region respond to the challenges of a fast&hyphen;changing world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The action plan requires countries to:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> develop comprehensive economic reform strategies;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> invite the private sector to recommend to governments measures to improve competitiveness;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> adopt a set of best&hyphen;practice principles for public accountability and transparency of government finances and economic management;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> pursue open investment policies consistent with APEC principles;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> work towards a common goal of open and free trade, with each country deciding its own timetable; and,</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rationalise and progressively reduce tariffs, while recognising the special circumstances of some smaller island economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has been an active supporter of economic reform and sustainable development of the region's resources. We think the future stability and viability of the region's countries depend on them taking the necessary action now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has not foisted these reforms on the region. The island countries themselves have control of the scope and pace of reform. They will make their own decisions, taking into account their own circumstances and the nature of their societies and cultures. Australia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9098"> is investing considerable resources in aid programs to back up their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second significant outcome from the forum was the leaders' retreat statement on climate change. My objective in discussions on this topic was to promote and protect Australia's national interest. Some members opposite have criticised me for this, but I am never going to be apologetic about standing up&mdash;particularly aboard&mdash;for the national interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's negotiating position at the forthcoming climate change meeting at Kyoto has been fully protected. This was my responsibility as Australia's leader at the recent forum meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome was therefore good for Australia. But it was also good for the other participants. It was a fair outcome that reflected a consensus of views, not one on which particular views were subjugated to others. Despite the claims of some, no threats regarding aid were made or even hinted at by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the statement emphasises, all forum members share concerns about the impact of climate change. A visit to the region makes one conscious of the sense of vulnerability that the very small island states feel to the potential impact of climate change and rising sea levels. It is not, however, just the small island states who face problems. Changing weather patterns would affect us all, including Australia with our long coastline and vast rural areas. Australia shares with the island countries a strong common interest in an effective international regime for a net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's position is that any regime will be effective only if it is realistic and fair and therefore has a reasonable chance of being implemented. There is no gain for the environment from an agreement which is not worth the paper it is written on because the commitments are not credible and the burden of efforts and cost is not equitably distributed. The bottom line is that an unrealistic and unfair agreement will not work. That is not in the interests of the island countries any more than it is in Australia's interests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We firmly believe that any agreement has to provide the basis for involving the developing countries. Everyone who contributes to the problem has to contribute to the solution, and developing countries will account for nearly half of global emissions by the year 2010 compared with less than one&hyphen;third today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to achieve a realistic, fair and environmentally effective agreement, Australia is arguing for different targets for different countries, taking into account each country's circumstances. That is what the Europeans have arranged for themselves in their increasingly well&hyphen;known `bubble'. We are asking only that the same principle be applied to other countries, including Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to play our part in addressing this global problem. We are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, including through the greenhouse challenge program. We are also providing climate change related support through our aid program with projects worth $45 million in the South Pacific. But we will not accept the economic burden of targets which mean Australia is required to shoulder a disproportionate part of the effort and that Australians pay a greater cost than others for doing so. The uniform reduction targets being called for, and apparently by the opposition in this place as well as other countries&mdash;15 per cent from 1990 levels by 2010 in the case of the Europeans and 20 per cent by 2005 from the Alliance of Small Island States&mdash;would have a dramatic impact on the Australian economy and her people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be penalised for being an efficient producer of energy and emission intensive goods, most of which we export to other countries that need the products for their economic growth. The impact on our energy intensive and resource processing industries would devastate parts of regional Australia. The job losses and dislocation of peoples' lives would be immense, including in the Illawarra and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Geelong and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Port Pirie in South Australia and the Kwinana and north&hyphen;west regions of Western Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9099">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New investment in energy intensive industry would be threatened, risking the potential in some estimates for up to 90,000 new long&hyphen;term jobs. According to ABARE, if Australia returned to 1990 levels of greenhouse emissions by the year 2000, it could involve an increase in petrol prices of up to 70c a litre, a similar increase in diesel prices, an increase in natural gas prices of up to 40c a litre and an increase in average electricity prices of up to 100 per cent. That, in a nutshell, is why I, on behalf of our country, am taking the stand that I am on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what would this destructive result for Australia achieve for the environment? The answer is very little. Australia contributes only 1.4 per cent of global emissions. Even if we closed down every emissions producing industry, it would have virtually no impact on global emissions growth. Many emissions producing industries would simply move offshore. Australia's role as an efficient supplier of energy would be taken by others whose controls and technology are not as good as ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our differentiation approach would also provide a fair basis for the future involvement of developing countries. The only way to bring them on board is to identify different targets, taking account of their different stages of development and their capacity to contribute. This was an important element in the forum statement on climate change. The need to involve developing countries was recognised by all forum leaders. The forum statement's call for the Kyoto outcome to provide procedures and time frames for drawing in significant developing country emitters in the future is a major step forward in the negotiations leading up to Kyoto. It is the first time that developed and developing countries have joined forces in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On another issue of significance to the region's environment, I announced at the forum that Australia is prepared to make a significant contribution to the building in Samoa of a new headquarters for the South Pacific regional environment program, the design for which we have already funded. This program has an important role to play on a wide range of regional environmental issues 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and forum leaders are in agreement that it needs new headquarters to carry out its tasks effectively. We will also talk to the government of Japan about joining us and New Zealand, and other forum countries which may also wish to contribute, in putting together the necessary funds to ensure that the new headquarters are built as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also discussed at the forum the main challenges to the security of regional countries, especially their vulnerability to increasing transnational criminal activity including drug trafficking. The outcome of our discussions was the Aitutaki Declaration on Regional Security Cooperation which provides for the enhancement of existing consultation and coordination arrangements to respond to these challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is already working constructively with regional countries to address these issues. In regard to the particular threat posed by drug trafficking, I hope that some of the work being done by the recently established drugs task force will be relevant to the needs of the island countries. We would be happy to share the results of that work with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For almost a decade now the conflict in Bougainville has been a major security concern in the region. Forum leaders therefore warmly welcomed the recent progress made in restoring peace to Bougainville and noted the appreciation of the Papua New Guinea government for the assistance of Australia and New Zealand, the latter of which is hosting peace talks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my discussions at the forum with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Bill Skate, I was greatly impressed by his determination to achieve a peaceful settlement of this long&hyphen;running and debilitating conflict. I assured Mr Skate of Australia's readiness to support his government's efforts and facilitate the peace process. At his request, we have transported PNG government and Bougainvillean participants to the second round of talks in New Zealand. We hope that the outcome of the talks is another step towards peace for the people of Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forum also expressed its support for the readmission of Fiji to the Commonwealth, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9100"> following the recent successful conclusion of its constitutional review. In my meeting with Fiji's prime minister, Mr Rabuka, I congratulated him on his leadership in achieving an outcome acceptable to Fiji's communities. The news earlier this week of Fiji's readmission to the Commonwealth was therefore very welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the common interests which draws together the people of the forum member countries is sport. Australians' love of sport, as both participants and spectators, is matched by the enthusiasm of the people of the island countries. The value attached to it is expressed in the declaration on sport and development adopted by the forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was therefore particularly pleased to announce in Rarotonga that Australia will underwrite the journey of the Olympic torch, on its way to Australia for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, through all those Pacific countries which are members of the international Olympic movement. This will complement the work Australia is already doing under its South Pacific 2000 program to assist the development of the region's sports men and women, and maximise their participation in the Olympic and Paralympic games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made every effort to include Australia's South Pacific neighbours in Sydney's hosting of the Olympics. The torch's journey through the region will provide an excellent opportunity for the island countries to take advantage of being in the world spotlight and boost their tourist flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forum also commended to its members Canada's candidature for the UN Security Council and appointed Mr Noel Levi, the former head of Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister's Department, as the next secretary&hyphen;general of the forum's secretariat. The Australian government wishes Mr Levi every success in his new position.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the South Pacific was yet another sad reflection of the extent to which this country has lost, under this government, a leadership stance in regional affairs. We have seen it in South&hyphen;East Asia, we have seen it globally, and this time we got a demonstration of it in the South Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has produced&mdash;and I will get to the issue of greenhouse gas emissions shortly&mdash;a litany of the decisions that were taken at the South Pacific conference. Some of those decisions are very good advances in the direction of diplomacy in the region: the greater moves to security cooperation, the increased emphasis that is being placed on the control of illicit drugs, the emphasis that is being placed on environmental matters generally, the stances that have been taken there in improving the fiscal performance of a number of the states of the South Pacific area. All those matters that were mentioned in the Prime Minister's report, and the progress on them, were very welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point is that he had absolutely nothing to do with them&mdash;nothing at all. These were a product of what the other nations of the South Pacific, over a period of time, have managed to cobble together. They are leftovers of initiatives from a time when there was a government in operation in this country which took seriously its international responsibilities and actually had the competence to push them through. They are there in place, essentially without the driving force of any form of Australian intellectual leadership behind it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are critical matters related to the economies of those states which have to be dealt with, but they were not dealt with by our Prime Minister on this occasion. Every Prime Minister that I can remember, Liberal or Labor, sat in the forums where there are opportunities for private meetings and sat in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9101"> the forums where there are more pro&hyphen;forma discussions taking place. It has been the Australians who have led, the Australians who have accepted the responsibility of international leadership in the one area of the world where we are in fact a substantial, if not formidable, power and where our moral authority carries very great weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so far as you could see any leadership being exercised in this regard, the people you would tick off as having demonstrated that were, to my surprise: the Prime Minister of Fiji; the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Bill Skate; and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Jim Bolger. Those were the individuals exercising leadership at this forum. They were the ones making waves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember when the Prime Minister first became Prime Minister and he went across shortly after his election to New Zealand and met Jim Bolger. I said something extraordinarily unkind about Jim Bolger at the time. I said that the Prime Minister was relieved because he had finally found somebody in international politics he could actually patronise and he appeared to be taking full advantage of that in regard to Jim Bolger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say, and I congratulate him, that Jim Bolger turned the tables. Jim Bolger has finally found an Australian Prime Minister that he can truly patronise, and he took full advantage of it in the leadership that he offered in so many areas, including I might say, peace in Bougainville&mdash;to our shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this lack of leadership goes to the very heart of what is the problem with this government. Having had an opportunity to look at it for 18 months you can say they have problems with principle and problems with policy direction&mdash;all those problems. The central problem of this government&mdash;after 18 months it should not be there; with what was once a very good Public Service it should certainly not be there&mdash;is basic competence. That is fundamentally the problem with this government&mdash;basic competence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw that in the diplomacy being exercised by the Prime Minister in the South Pacific. Every journalist who reported on it, everybody who had any opportunity to witness it, reported back to this nation the ap 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pearance of a nervous, isolated, palely loitering&mdash;to coin another leader of the Labor Party's phrase&mdash;Prime Minister. He was palely loitering on the outskirts of every gathering, frightened rotten that some terrible motion was going to emerge on greenhouse gas emissions, wringing his hands with fear about the consequences of any repudiation of the Australian position. He had no constructive suggestions to give to them as to where they might arrive at a reasonable conclusion on that&mdash;just arrive at a conclusion with which we can live politically; not one that starts to deal with the problem, just something that we can live with politically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After an unprecedented delay, members of the island nations had to get used to something they had never seen before. I know the Prime Minister has been portrayed as a bullying Australian and I know some of our folk have said something about that, but I am afraid to say that they were wrong. The Prime Minister was not bullying the South Pacific nations. He was not threatening the South Pacific nations with a $450 million aid cut. I know we have said that, but that is the sort of thing that oppositions would say. What the Prime Minister was doing was begging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Prime Minister was in the South Pacific&mdash;not cajoling, not threatening, as we have said; he was begging. I have never seen a picture of an Australian Prime Minister in such a humiliating posture in the region's affairs. That grovelling, wheedling, begging: `Please do not arrive at a conclusion. Please come down to some position.' You could see Jim Bolger there with his head in this hands, secretly delighted at the sight. Bill Skate was bemused. The Fijians were a bit bemused also; they have been used to a bit of strength from Australian governments in years gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They sit there musing: `How do we handle this quivering object? Australia has meant a very great deal to us in the past. We know darn well that any particular resolution that we pass in this place is only going to have a marginal impact on any decisions made at Kyoto. In our situation&mdash;which is a pretty terrible one if the science on the greenhouse gas emissions is right, and there are very few 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9102"> scientists who disagree with the science&mdash;at least some of us face almost total annihilation as countries.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have the sight of a begging Australian Prime Minister not engaging them but wandering around with a permanently worried expression on his face. The midnight oil was being burned back in Australia as the constant message flow went to and fro: what could we possibly do if all this went wrong? And, of course&mdash;it speaks very well of the contribution that Australia has made over the years in the South Pacific&mdash;they rescued him. They filled the begging bowl. They gave the beggar his food and he was able to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister has the temerity to stand up and denounce us for always being supportive of critics of Australia. What rubbish! We ran a tough government for 13 years, a government that had a very distinctive Australian attitude to what the region ought to be and what it ought to look like. We were, from time to time, involved in bruising encounters in those matters when we happened to be in government, and on not a few of those occasions the Liberal opposition took exception to the positions that we were taking. We offered military leadership. We offered economic leadership. We offered leadership diplomatically in the arrangements that we put in place. We had one idea after another. And we stood up for the region when we needed to, vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the French or anyone else who was imposing upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you had was a government of Australians, a government that reflected the true spirit of this nation, which has completely disappeared from the countenance of our political diplomatic representatives as they present themselves elsewhere. And don't think we don't know it. As they said in that great movie, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chinatown</EMPHASIS>, `We've still got a few teeth in our head and a few friends downtown.' We know darn well what is said of you in international forums and we know darn well what our public servants think about the way in which this government presents itself internationally. They have some time for Tim Fischer&mdash;the rest of them absolutely mortify them! Foreign Affairs, which used to be a powerhouse of ideas, produce nothing. Even 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> though they have been curtailed&mdash;probably too far by us; now exceptionally too far by this government&mdash;they have no work to do; there is nothing being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister comes back here and most of his speech was devoted to the only thing that bothered him at this forum&mdash;he had no leadership to offer&mdash;the shape of his begging bowl. He has presented here the shape of his begging bowl, being his greenhouse gas emissions position. He likes to pretend what the opposition's attitude is. He likes to pretend that the opposition's attitude is Tony Blair's. He likes to pretend that the opposition's attitude conforms to the extremist European position. There is not one member of the opposition who has ever made a statement like that in any forum at any time&mdash;not one! This is part of the fantasy world in which our international beggar lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is, though, this: we present a case for differential treatment of Australia when we go overseas. We see the same people that this Prime Minister sees. We see the same people that the foreign minister sees. We present the arguments to the same people about the need for a differential target as far as Australia is concerned. We get back from them&mdash;which, no doubt, as they indicate to us, the Prime Minister has experienced&mdash;this, `Okay, you make a pretty good case. We can make a pretty good case as far Australia is concerned.' Then, `What do you propose? What is the right international regime? How may we help you?' That is the response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter whether you go to the UK, it does not matter whether you go to Japan, it does not matter whether you go to the South Pacific nations or wherever else you go; they ask a question: how can we help you? What they get is another bout of wringing of hands from the international beggar as far as greenhouse gas emission is concerned. They are none the wiser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked a question here in this place about what the government's position actually is. We are now 18 months on into the litany about the bad economic effects of these undifferentiated targets on the Australian economy. If this problem is actually of the dimensions that the Prime Minister says it is, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9103"> to not have a plan 18 months in is an act of criminal negligence on the people of this nation. If that is what his view is, for him not to have presented an argument on what we actually need is total negligence as far as this Prime Minister is concerned. He has no ideas&mdash;no ideas whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  got this pretty right. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fin Review&mdash;</EMPHASIS> I could not have summed it up better myself&mdash;said: <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But Australian ministers have so far done little to develop their argument in a sophisticated, rather than simply self&hyphen;serving, direction. They must do so before the November global summit on the greenhouse problem in Kyoto. Simply asking for a special exemption is not enough. If Australia genuinely believes it is a more efficient place for emission&hyphen;intensive activities than elsewhere, it must demonstrate its fossil&hyphen;fuel based industries are willing to pay for the privilege of polluting.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They have got a very good idea here which could easily be developed. `Internationally tradeable emission' permits are probably the best route. I think you could also get a differential related to the fact that we absorb many energy intensive processes in our production lines here that save other people on that front. You could point to the fact that we once had in this country really decent research into alternative energies. We also had a very decent posture in so far as encouraging from our business community the right sorts of responses. But it is only just now that this government has started to build this stuff into our arguments&mdash;only just now, 18 months on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This critical issue, so ill&hyphen;served by incompetence, is a depressing picture. It has got a real opposition mentality: you strike attitudes but you have no solutions. But, really, after 13 years in opposition you ought to be a bit better than that. You have the people in your bureaucracy&mdash;if only you knew how to use them&mdash;who could tell you the things that you ought to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This trip of the Prime Minister's was a sad trip. It follows many other sad trips, the last one being the last train to Klutzville, which we all remember. The Prime Minister has got to learn to do a bit better. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no attempt to single out the Australian Law Reform Commission because of some submission that the Attorney&hyphen;General did not like. In fact, it was asked to make a submission to the Wik task force. Its views were asked for by the Commonwealth government in relation to the drafting of that bill. It has been employed by the government, properly so, and that is how it should be employed. But it should not be improperly employed, and that is where it embarks on aspects which are beyond its powers under the act.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the Attorney-General's representative in the other place. That is the person who seeks to take his place. Those remarks are in direct contrast to what the Attorney&hyphen;General has had to say before this House. So someone has it badly wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position is that we have only discovered this week that the Law Reform Commission wanted to come before the parliamentary committee and give evidence. That is something that has been going on for over 20 years of their existence. I am a member of the joint parliamentary committee. There are now, on the public record, letters of correspondence between the secretariat of the committee and the Law Reform Commission. It is obvious from those letters of correspondence that the Law Reform Commission wanted to come before the committee. What we have had this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> week is slowly, inch by inch, we are getting more information. The parliamentary process is extracting the information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position is that earlier in the week the Attorney-General sought to cite the parliamentary committee that I sat on with him in the last parliament, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which actually was not a prisoner of the executive. I remember that, when we were members of that committee in the last parliament, we did an inquiry into the child sex tourism bill. After day one of that inquiry, three members of the executive issued a press release attacking the committee. But we continued on, and we were vindicated. We brought back a report that said, in effect, we think there should be 38 amendments to the child sex tourism bill. I think 35&half; of those amendments were picked up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, this Attorney-General sponsored legislation through this parliament: the Australian Law Reform Commission Act. It was an update of the earlier Australian Law Reform Commission Act. It contains, in almost identical terms, a section&mdash;section 26&mdash;which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a House of the Parliament, or a Parliamentary Committee, requires the Commission to give it any information about the performance of the Commission's functions, or the exercise of its powers, the Commission must comply with the requirement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There has been a convention for over 20 years, in terms of the existence of the Law Reform Commission, that they give evidence before parliamentary committees. In our 13 years of government, they kept doing it and they came up with submissions critical of the government. They were regarded as an independent statutory authority. Indeed, the Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills . . . modernise the commission's legislation, making it consistent with enabling legislation for other independent statutory authorities and also give effect to a number of specific recommendations of the standing committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the practice has not changed. If this Attorney-General did not want them to come before parliamentary committees, he could have amended the Australian Law Reform 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9108"> Commission Act. What happened was they split the section, and they split the section specifically, in effect, to say that the commission can give evidence before committees on those aspects and also on proposed expenditure and income.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Alan Rose, who is President of the Law Reform Commission, was appointed on 23 May 1994. He is a distinguished public servant who, before that, was Secretary to the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in politics and English literature, an honours degree in law from the University of Queensland and a Master of Laws degree from the London School of Economics. He lectured in administrative law and legal history at the University of Queensland from 1971 to 1973.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before joining the Attorney-General's Department, first as Associate Secretary in 1987 and then as Secretary in 1989, Mr Rose was Secretary to the Department of Community Services from 1986 to 1987. Prior to that he held several senior positions in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. These included: Deputy Secretary from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1982 to 1986; First Assistant Secretary in the Welfare Division, the Cabinet Office and the Operations Division from 1979 to 1982; Assistant Secretary in the Government and Constitutional Legal Affairs Branches from 1975 to 1978; and other positions in relation to the Prime Minister's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has served with distinction governments of both political persuasions. He is an outstanding public servant who has given meritorious service to both sides and when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister of this country. He is not a Labor stooge, but that is how he has been painted by those on the other side of the House&mdash;in particular, the chairman of the joint standing committee, who had a bigger conversion than Saul on the road to Damascus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday, he said he was happy for everyone who wanted to come before the committee to come before it and we would sit for as long as we want. He said he would go and talk to the Attorney-General about this controversy that was blowing up because he wanted to hear his point of view. The next day, he does a conversion. Then he goes to a joint standing committee. He reveals the next day what happened; that is, his casting vote was used to stop an invitation to the Law Reform Commission from coming before the committee. This is what Mr Rose had to say about the commission on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World at Noon</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was very keen to provide a submission to both the Government and to the Parliamentary Committee on a matter that is the Native Title Amendment Legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no question about the Wik amendments falling squarely within the ALRC's role . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 29 September, he went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the commission's creation 20-odd years ago, it has provided submissions and right up again till the last two or three weeks under this Government, to parliamentary committees applying the touchstones that I've just outlined to you, that is we have not had such a narrow interpretation of our role and functions as is now being put to us by the Federal Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interesting thing is that the Attorney&hyphen;General sent a letter to the Law Reform Commission on 28 August. Nowhere there did he say, `You are not to appear before parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9109"> mentary committees.' What he said was, in effect, `I should therefore be grateful if you would ensure that you undertake consultation with me should such occasions arise again in the future.' He was obviously referring there to the commission providing comments to the Wik task force after, as Senator Ellison in the Senate says, they were invited to do so or, as the Attorney&hyphen;General says in this House, they responded to pro forma letters. He did not say, `You shall stop appearing in front of parliamentary committees' back then when that letter was written.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The note that came into this House on 1 October is a note written after the Law Reform Commission went through what they were asked to do by this Attorney&hyphen;General, and that is, `Can you have the courtesy to provide me with prior notice if you're going to be doing things outside references?' That is what the input of 28 August was all about. But the position is that there have been exchanges of letters. The government does not want this report to come out. The problem with this Attorney&hyphen;General, unfortunately, is that he was supposed to be an alibi for the Prime Minister in the Woods affair, but he was not. So the position is that this commission should be coming before the parliamentary committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a complete breach of convention. Why? One only has to look at the substance of the report. All they have done is highlight the report. The Attorney&hyphen;General should be defending independent statutory bodies. This has been a convention for over 20 years with this commission, yet it is obvious there has been a wink and a nod. Mr Rose knows what it means when he gets a phone call. He knows, when he is given the ultimatum `You have got two choices' by a public servant in the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, that he has&mdash;as I think one of my colleagues said&mdash;Buckley's and none.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that I am incensed at being used in this way. You are just engaging in a political stunt. You are engaging in a smearing exercise, you are engaging in besmirching, and there is no substance in what you are doing. As I said in question time, this is a great to&hyphen;do about nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let me just tell you what the facts are. First of all, I absolutely reject any suggestion that I directed or authorised anyone to direct the ALRC not to appear before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. I also reject any suggestion that I have in any way suppressed any submission or gagged the ALRC in giving evidence to the committee. Mr Rose has conceded that no threat was made to him. If you analyse what Mr Reaburn's note indicates, you will see that Mr Rose was having pointed out to him the choices that were open to him&mdash;and he made a choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just give you the history of the ALRC's involvement with native title. The ALRC sought a reference from the previous government, and my predecessor declined to give it. He would not give them one on native title. They raised the issue with me again earlier in the year, in about February, and I did not give them one either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next matter is that they received, at their request, a copy of the papers from the Wik task force distributed on a public basis to a large mailing list, and they wrote in offering a submission on the bill. They were not invited to in any way, except by receipt of a publicly directed circular that went to hundreds of people. They put in a draft submission, and it was drawn to my attention. It occurred to me that this was not a matter that was a reference to the Law Reform Commission, so I decided that I would query it with them. I wrote a letter, which was tabled on Monday, indicating that, while I understood the commission's comments were provided in response to a generally issued 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9110"> invitation, I noted that their functions set out in the act were confined to matters referred to them by the Attorney&hyphen;General. In my view, therefore, it would have been appropriate for the commission to have consulted me before providing comments to the government on a matter which is unrelated to any current reference upon which the commission is working.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The object of the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996, which the member for Banks and I were closely involved in developing, is to confine the Law Reform Commission to the work which it can most appropriately do. It does things on reference from the Attorney-General. The committee of which the member for Banks and I were members unanimously recommended a continuation of the system whereby the sole source of references was the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of functions set out in the act, including the possibility of referring to international obligations and human rights issues. Those functions are entirely related only to references that are within power. If the Law Reform Commission wishes to make submissions on human rights or international obligations issues, it can lawfully do it only by reference to the act or if it is a reference from the Attorney-General. It plainly did not have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say at this point, my reaction to the conduct of the Law Reform Commission was not based on any knowledge of the content of the submission.

<PARA STYLE="Para">What has the Labor Party done about these issues? Let me tell you the first thing that happened. Senator Faulkner went to see the Clerk of the Senate. He told the clerk that he would like his advice on the implications of a situation in which an office holder of the executive government directs a person who is not a public servant and who has been invited to appear before a parliamentary committee not to appear before the committee, to suppress evidence which may be relevant for the committee's inquiry and to destroy such evidence. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clerk's advice in his first letter of 29 December relates to that hypothetical factual situation&mdash;I say `hypothetical' because he does not really indicate that there is a factual matrix to it until he goes on to refer later on to a type of committee before which the evidence might be given. It was plain he had the situation in focus right from the start. He was then asked by Senator Faulkner or an agent of Senator Faulkner to comment on an answer I gave to the House on Monday in question time. What was told to the clerk was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been revealed by answer to a question in the Senate that the Attorney-General suggested or directed that the Commission not make a submission to the joint committee because the Commission does not have a current relevant reference and that the government wishes that the Commission confine itself to the subjects of its references.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So on two occasions he has given a factual situation that is entirely unrelated, except in so far as it talks about a witness appearing before a committee. On both occasions he has referred wrongly to my having given a direction. The clerk on this occasion did not seek to make it hypothetical; he focused it on me in particular. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These matters do not alter the conclusions drawn in the earlier advice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course they could not because they were founded on an assumption that I had given a direction. Under the Law Reform Commission Act I do not have the power to give a direction to the commission; I can only give it references. Once it has a reference, it has an independent operation in relation to that reference. That says everything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus is now accusing me of nobbling witnesses. He originally sought advice on the basis that I had directed a witness. Of course, I did not know about the clerk's advice until I read about it in the newspaper on Tuesday. It was on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, as one might expect, and it plainly suggested that I was guilty of contempt of parliament or even a criminal offence by reason of having directed somebody to do something and that the clerk had given advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clerk did not take into account the legal matrix upon which my relationship with the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9112"> commission is founded and he did not have the correct factual situation. But it continued and we still had Senator Bolkus saying this morning in the Senate and later on outside the Senate that I am involved in nobbling witnesses. That is scurrilous. That is irresponsible. I am incensed. I was incensed on Monday when I discovered what was going on. I continue to be incensed. I was doing my duty. I was doing what the Chief General Counsel has said was in fact a constitutional duty to remind the commission to remain within its statutory duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the public interest involved in this? Nobody on the Labor side has thought about the public interest issue. The first point is that the submission has been given to, and taken into account by, the Wik task force. The opinion is well known. There are more experienced people offering better views in the same area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the real point at all. The damage that has been done in this situation is to the Law Reform Commission. The Law Reform Commission has invited itself to get involved in issues that it should never have got involved in. Law reform commissions only have any standing in the community and can only operate independently and objectively if they act on references from the government. Governments would not have law reform commissions on any other basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that taxpayers' money is involved. We have the commission deciding for itself when and on what it will make submissions and spend money. There was a Law Reform Commission report due to be delivered to me on Tuesday. It will not be delivered. It will be late. That is taxpayers' money involved. The report prior to that was delivered late. The Law Reform Commission needs to get on and do its job, and the Labor Party had better stop telling lies publicly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a pathetic defence of his actions we have just heard from the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) here this afternoon. The matter of public importance before the House today is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney&hyphen;General's actions in seeking to stop the Australian Law Reform Commission's submis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sion being put before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All we heard from the Attorney was filibuster and bluster. The Attorney-General would have us believe that the Law Reform Commission came to that decision on its own. He would have us believe that the Law Reform Commission was provided with gentle guidance by the acting secretary to his department on the role the commission should take and on its place in the world and that the commission said, `Of course, we'll just roll over and do this.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the Attorney's thinking was shown by his interjection across the table to the member for Banks (Mr Melham) during this debate when he said that Mr Rose, the president of the commission, is a pushover. He said that he gets pushed around too easily. That was the Attorney's problem. He tried to push him around and, unfortunately, Rose would not be pushed around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is, of course, the Attorney is the only person in the world who believes the fairytale that they took some gentle advice&mdash;some gentle advice from a gentle man. Good old Norman Reaburn, he is a real gentle man. Like the Attorney, he is a gentle man. Those of us who live in the real world know, like the Attorney said, that that is a lie. Mr Reaburn's note for file, which the Attorney was forced to table here yesterday, spells out very clearly how the Law Reform Commission was warned off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that lawyers use different language from that language that might be used, for instance, by a tradesman&mdash;a plumber talking to another plumber or, dare I say it, a telephone technician. If my friend the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) and I were talking to each other, we would call a spade a spade. But a lawyer or, dare I say it, the Attorney-General talking to another lawyer is likely to call a `crushing defeat' a `minor backward step'. Understatement is the name of the game in that profession, and we all know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when the Attorney-General's messenger, the acting secretary to the department, Norman Reaburn, says to Alan Rose, the President of the Law Reform Commission, that, if the commission were to pursue its Wik 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9113"> submission, the commission would get&mdash;in Mr Reaburn's words&mdash;`an unhappy letter' from the Attorney, can't you see it? They do the wrong thing and Daryl will write them an unhappy letter. Of course, Mr Rose was not in any doubt about what that meant. If it was a plumber talking to a plumber, they would know what it meant: do it, and you get the bullet, sport. Rose, the man who the Attorney less than 15 minutes ago said was a pushover&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WILLIAMS" NAMEID="7V5">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now he tries to qualify it by saying, `Sarcastically.' He said that Rose was a pushover and he sends the secretary to the department down to say, `You'll get an unhappy letter from the Attorney.' That is the bullet. Rose knows it. The Attorney knows it. Reaburn knows it. Every lawyer in the country knows it. We know it. The only person who is trying to pretend that it was a joke, or thinks it was a joke, is the Attorney-General. The trouble is that he did not let anyone else in on the joke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Rose knew that this was a direct threat to the future operations of the Law Reform Commission and, in particular, a threat to Mr Rose's position as the president of the commission. Norman Reaburn did not have to say to Mr Rose that the Attorney-General would dump him&mdash;the commission and him as the chairman. Mr Rose knew it. Mr Rose was left in no doubt as to the real reasons for, in Mr Reaburn's note for file and in that wonderful understatement of lawyers, an informal chat. That is what they tell you the coppers are coming around to see you for when they want to put you away: `We're just here to have an informal chat with you about your future.'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TUCKEY" NAMEID="SJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr Tuckey</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coppers come around and see good old Wilson all the time. Wilson has had more visits from the coppers than anyone else in this place, so he would know all about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they go around and have their informal chat. You can just see it, can't you&mdash;the acting secretary of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department sitting there with the President of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Law Reform Commission saying, `We're not here to stand over you, old son, we're not here to tell you what to do, but we do want you to understand that you're at the crossroads.' The police told Wilson that once, and he understood what they meant. The acting secretary of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department told the President of the Law Reform Commission, `You're at the crossroads,' and we are meant to believe that that did not mean Mr Reaburn was warning Mr Rose off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General would have us come in here and think he is a decent man who would not do anything to this bloke who he said is a pushover and gets pushed around too easily. So the pushover gets told by the acting secretary of the department, `You're at the crossroads. If you do the wrong thing here and put this submission in, you'll get a naughty letter from Daryl. Daryl will be unhappy.' If you are the plumber, you know that, if Daryl is unhappy with you, you are getting the sack&mdash;and that is what Rose knew. After all, Rose has been in this game for a long while. As the Attorney knows, Rose was the secretary of this department and Norman Reaburn was one of his subordinates.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LAWRENCE" NAMEID="XS4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr Lawrence</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They knew the language.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They both knew the real intent behind the language, as my colleague says. They share a long history together. They have had these discussions with lots of people before and they know that to talk about the crossroads, to have the little chat, is a very strong message. To get an unhappy letter from the Attorney-General, if you are the former secretary of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, means that you might be in just a little bother. The Attorney-General is such a gentle man that you would not want an unhappy letter from him, because that would mean he was really angry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Alan Rose knew it clear enough, but the trouble was that Rose was not a pushover, as the Attorney thought. Rose had finally had enough, and he went public about this. He went public because Rose knew, as a person who had been the most senior legal bureaucrat in this country, that this piece of legislation was bad for Australia. He knew it was a piece of legislation that was unconstitutional and a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9114"> piece of legislation which would have very, very significant compensation effects on the Australian taxpayer. Even if it meant he was going to get an unhappy letter from Daryl&mdash;who was going to give him the bullet if he did not do what he was told&mdash;he still did what he believed in. He was not piqued at being slapped over the knuckles. His fears for the future of the commission and its independence caused him to go public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this mean for the parliament? It means that this very important advice on legal issues that the parliament can get has been denied to it. It means that, if the Attorney is allowed to get away with this, the parliament may find itself denied access to advice from other statutory bodies that the Attorney has under his control. So far in the life of this government there have been 24 submissions from the Law Reform Commission to parliamentary inquiries, and they could be stopped. But why would the Attorney want to deny the parliament this particular advice from the Law Reform Commission&mdash;advice, as the Attorney told us this afternoon, that had already been made available to Senator Minchin and the Wik task force? Why did he not mind it being given to Senator Minchin but was deadly scared of it being given to a parliamentary committee? Why was he worried?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has used that commission in relation to the Wik legislation. From early 1996, Senator Minchin had been involved with the commission in discussing the native title amendments, including by writing to the commission on 3 July this year. Would it be that this little bit of independence by the commission did not fit with the government's new <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> policy? I think the answer to that is yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for the government, the Law Reform Commission's submission reinforces the reasons the opposition opposes elements of the native title legislation. Here is an example of the commission's views in relation to the objectives of the Native Title Amendment Bill . The commission believes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not only are they declared objectives mutually inconsistent . . . but also that the proposed means by which they are to be achieved are inadequate and counterproductive. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>

This is an absolutely facetious cause being put to this parliament, because the Labor Party are desperate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that mummy's boy from Opossum Bay is the flavour of the afternoon. We know this is not really of any interest to the people out there. When the opposition have no cause, no material and no substantive facts, what do they do? They bluff and bluster, and look at the people they have got here 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9115"> to advance the cause. But let us go from that and look at what they are really talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it quite fascinating that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) should even have had the hide to advance this whole thing. Talk about Alice in Wonderland. At one stage, he, the Attorney and I were all members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I know the honourable member for Banks had legal training, but the first thing you do in the law is look back at your precedents. You do not go and mouth off without at least looking at what it is all about. What all those who are listening need to understand is that the honourable member for Banks is pursuing a course of action which is quite contrary to the findings that he reached in May 1994 when each of us, amongst others, presented a report to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I look at the conclusions that we reached, I can say that the committee's findings constituted by far the most significant review of the Law Reform Commission of Australia in its almost 20 years in existence. Daryl Melham, who was at that time Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee and Legal and Constitutional Affairs, said that it was `the most comprehensive parliamentary review of the Law Reform Commission of Australia in its almost 20 years of existence'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that we turn to one of the appendices in the committee's report. We are looking at a cause whereby he has said that, in some way, the Attorney-General has not acted in accordance with his powers. It is important that we understand that he is talking about the Law Reform Commission. Under clause 4 the commission's functions are clearly defined&mdash;I will come back to what we said about it, because I have to do this in the few minutes that we have&mdash;as being in pursuance of references to the commission made by the Attorney-General. We have all this hogwash about the commission having functions that are not subject to constraints. The opening phrase constricts them by the words `in pursuance of references to the commission made by the Attorney-General'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to my friend opposite that he go back and start studying law again so that he understands that, before you bring a cause into this place, you look at the words and you try to comprehend what they mean. You do not do it out there by repeating them, thinking you can somehow make them change what their purport is. The purport is `in pursuance of references to the commission made by the Attorney-General'. So the functions are subject to references. I do not know whether the member opposite understands that. He is not very interested, after all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole of this matter is about the Attorney-General doing as the Australian Law Reform Commission Act, endorsed by this most comprehensive review for 20 years, said the Attorney&hyphen;General should do. We will come back to this later, because I am not going to have enough time to cover all I want to cover. It is quite fascinating, because not only did we endorse that power but in fact the commission was said specifically, when the Labor government was in power, to have to act in accordance with references to the commission made by the Attorney-General.</PARA>

We said that the commission already had the power under the act to make suggestions for reference to the Attorney-General, but that the actual pursuit of references should be in accordance only with directions from the Attorney-General. So it is no use trying to pretend that in some way the Attorney-General has done other than direct the Chair of the Law Reform Commission to the constraints that we identified in that report. A few other things need to be said; I will come back to that, because I think the findings of that report really are quite fascinating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to recommendation 21 of the committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interests I have&mdash;as most members in this place know&mdash;is as a primary producer. One of the organisations to which I belong is the New South Wales national farmers. I found it quite intriguing because, quite properly, Mr Dennis Rose QC, whom all of us regard as a very good lawyer, looked at the whole question of the Native Title Act, and he was briefed by the New South Wales national farmers association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that primary industries committee to which the national farmers brought this evidence is the chair of the committee, about whom the member for Banks seems to have some concern. At that particular committee meeting we were shown a legal opinion that was given to the New South Wales farmers association by Mr Dennis Rose QC which, in effect, claimed that western division grazing leases in New South Wales should be included in the schedule of property listed as extinguishing native title, contrary to legal opinion that the New South Wales and federal governments had. As I understand it, that is virtually

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My case this afternoon is that the member for Banks does not understand the simple form of the legislation. The legislation which is important is the Australian Law Reform Commission Act. That act quite specifically says in section 6(1) that the functions of the commission are in pursuance of references to the commission made by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need to know is that there is nothing in the actions of the Attorney-General, nothing in the correspondence from the Attorney-General to Mr Rose, and nothing in the act which says other than that the Attorney&hyphen;General has acted entirely in accordance with the powers that are his. He has not been seen to intervene improperly in the affairs of the committee and its collecting of evidence. The Attorney-General has acted as he should to ensure that the Law Reform Commission acts in accordance with its responsibilities and in accordance with the constraints on the exercise of its function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, not only is this MPI out of order but also it rather reflects that the Labor Party has absolutely no evidence on which to make the claim against the Attorney-General. I think it is fascinating that, only a few years ago, the honourable member for Banks endorsed that there was no substance in the MPI which he is this afternoon canvassing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I think that is very good advice, but it seems to me that if you want any commonsense in this parliament you have to keep the lawyers away from the parliament. I want to oppose this sophist nonsense being put forward by the Labor Party. The Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill amended the Crimes Act 1914 to include cultural background in subsections 16 A, Z and N as a relevant factor to be taken into consideration by courts when considering convictions and sentencing. This was an application of the multicultural lobby's pressure par excellence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not been equal before the law for quite some time; certainly not since this event. We now see that the Australian Law Reform Commission is responsible for making things considerably worse. I say more power to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to keep this treacherous bunch in their place. I support the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and applaud him for supporting the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan Rose is a political opportunist par excellence. We have the Howard government's legislation on Wik and the 10&hyphen;point plan. This does not go as far as the Labor Party or as far as Paul Keating thought his own act went. The Labor Party understand this fully. The Labor Party know that Paul Keating was of the view that pastoral leases extinguished native title. As a result of that, all those Aboriginals he gathered around him thought so too. He also believed that he had a prima facie case in the act. It was in the preamble, but sloppy drafting kept it out of the act. Here we have the Liberal Party labouring mightily in bringing forward legislation that does not even go as far as Keating thought his own act went. We now find the Labor Party jumping on what they see as some sort of populist bandwagon. They are entirely wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to understand what is happening in this parliament. There is fundamentally no difference between Labor and Liberal. They are identical on all the major issues. They are Tweedledum and Tweedledumber&mdash;they are identical. What is happening is that this place is taking to argument ad hominem. Both sides 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are now arguing on the basis that `We are not as corrupt as you are'. Does anyone understand what this does to the whole situation of parliament or how it attacks and undermines everyone's integrity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the Labor Party leading an attack on expenses claims which, overall, does not amount to a hill of beans. Many of those claims were in a finite group. If it was not used in that area, it would have been used somewhere else, with the result being exactly the same for the taxpayer. It is a nonsense. It is particularly galling because I know where some of the skeletons of the Labor Party are. They have done exactly the same thing over a considerable time. There is nothing to distinguish between them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this does an enormous disservice to the country. I agree with the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that it is a waste of this parliament's time when this sort of thing is brought into this House. I would hope that the Labor Party has learnt its lesson from the damage it has caused in the last week or so, some of which it is now reaping the consequences of. But, no, we have this issue before us today in this parliament. As the member for New England said, it does not have the courage or the substance to bring a substantive motion; it does it with an MPI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a waste of parliament's time. I believe that it should be summarily rejected. I hope the Labor Party is going to lift its game and be more constructive.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to say a lot more on this. I do commend Daryl Williams. You simply cannot have unelected bodies going out in the community and doing this sort of thing. Where is it going to end? How are we going to get any sort of control? What is going to happen if this parliament abandons its own authority and refuses to make decisions? John Howard is one of the worst offenders in that case. I went to Mr Howard and said, `You have to make a decision on Wik. You have to make a decision to extinguish native title.' He said, `It's too controversial. I'll leave it to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9118"> court.' This parliament is handing it down to the High Court. They are an unelected, unrepresentative body living in their ivory towers, most of whom have never done an honest day's work in their lives, and yet we leave these decisions to them when these are the responsibilities and the prerogative of the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the government's 1997&hyphen;98 budget and to one non&hyphen;budget item. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The first of those measures is the introduction of a single `parenting payment' to replace the current sole parent pension and parenting allowance. The new payment, which will be introduced from 20 March 1998, simplifies income support arrangements for parents by providing support for people with child rearing responsibilities, regardless of whether they are partnered or not. It also aims to reduce the social stigma which is sometimes associated with being a recipient of sole parent pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parenting payment also aligns a number of conditions that currently vary between the existing payments. Administrative arrangements will be simplified, particularly where people move between lone parent and partnered status. Currently they need to cease receiving one payment and claim another. Core conditions, such as rates, income testing and concession cards will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both parenting allowance and sole parent pension are paid for the same reason, except that parenting allowance is paid to partnered parents and the sole parent pension is paid to lone parents. A single parenting payment recognises a person's responsibility for caring for children irrespective of marital status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the move toward simplicity and consistency, the bill also makes amendments to the social security allowance provisions aimed at simplifying the hardship rules which apply in relation to the ordinary waiting period, the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period. Current 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly, the rules for waiver of various waiting periods in the legislation are inconsistent. They have different definitions of hardship and different types of expenditure can be taken into account. Amendments contained in the bill will introduce a common approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hardship rules will be standardised, with the first requirement being that the person is in `severe financial hardship'. The test for determining whether a person is in severe financial hardship will be whether or not the person's readily available funds are less than the appropriate fortnightly rate of allowance. For the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period, there will be an additional requirement that the expenditure that caused the severe financial hardship must have been `unavoidable and essential' (such as emergency medical treatment or mortgage/rent payments falling due in the waiting period). The bill also provides that the liquid asset waiting period may be partially waived, which is not possible under the current rules. This will align the liquid assets waiting period provisions with those applying to the income maintenance period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains amendments to simplify the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. In particular, the bill will remove references to specific payment and program types dealt with by the Social Security portfolio and replace these with a generic reference. This will remove the need to make legislative amendments each time a new payment is created or an old payment is renamed. Other amendments will also be made to the act to streamline the administration of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains amendments that introduce significant reforms in the area of child disability allowance. A simpler assessment process, involving a child disability assessment tool, will be introduced for use in relation to all new claims for child disability allowance from 1 July 1998. The assessment tool will measure the impact of a child's disability on his/her functional ability in communication, mobility, self&hyphen;care and community living skills against developmental milestones. It will also assess a child's behaviour, emotional state and special care needs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9121">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of the assessment tool will provide a simpler, more objective means of assessing eligibility for child disability allowance than the current criterion of `substantially more care and attention'. It will provide a more objective method of assessment for parents and treating medical professionals, will minimise the subjectivity and inconsistency in the current criteria, will reduce the number of reviews and appeals, and will increase the level of understanding of the program by staff, parents and the medical profession. Parents with very disabled children have been concerned that the child disability allowance payment has been seriously compromised over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A list of manifest disabilities and a list of chronic medical conditions that will be attached to the assessment tool tables will provide fast track entry to the program and less frequent medical reviews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Existing recipients of child disability allowance are protected through the insertion of a five&hyphen;year savings provision. The amendments made by the schedule also increase the number of days allowed in the temporary cessation of care provisions and a reduction in the maximum period for which child disability allowance arrears are payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes amendments that impact on health care cards. The first change is a part of the major overhaul of the child disability allowance that I have already mentioned. It is designed to assist those children whose parent or guardian does not qualify for child disability allowance (due to the amendments to the child disability allowance qualification criteria for a disabled child), by maintaining their eligibility for a health care card. The second measure extends the period over which a person's income is assessed for the purpose of determining whether they are a low income, disadvantaged person who is eligible for a health care card. The assessment period, presently four weeks, will be extended to eight weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the bill changes the name of `family payment' to `family allowance'. The change is made to help customers to understand more easily the social security system 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and their entitlements. Many families still use the term `family allowance', which was used to describe family payment entitlements from 1987 to the end of 1992. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The new youth allowance, commencing on 1 July 1998, is an income support payment for young Australians which integrates payments regardless of whether they are in education, training, unemployed or sick. Youth allowance is a very important social policy reform. It is a response to concerns expressed by young people, their families and the general community that current arrangements are inefficient and inconsistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In introducing youth allowance, the government will help young people to make key decisions about education, training and employment by making income support arrangements simpler and more flexible. Understanding entitlements will be much easier. This will help young people make the right decisions about their future. Youth allowance will encourage young people to complete or further their education by removing undesirable incentives to leave education early or to choose unemployment over education and training. For younger students in particular, it creates a real incentive to complete year 12 or its equivalent before they look for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance activity test requirements recognise that increasing numbers of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9122"> young people do not follow the traditional pathway from full&hyphen;time study to full&hyphen;time employment. Young people whose circumstances change slightly will no longer have their payments cancelled and have to claim another payment. Youth allowance will be subject to parental income and family assets and actual means tests, as currently apply to Austudy. This parental means test reinforces the government's message that families should support their young family members until they have achieved financial independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that the current income support arrangements for young people encourage them to leave home, with the financial incentive of a higher rate of allowance if they live away from home. In developing a payment structure for youth allowance, the government has taken account of those suggestions. It has also recognised, however, that young people sometimes have to live away from home for employment or study reasons, even if they are not independent. Accordingly, the away from home rate of youth allowance, together with rent assistance, will be available to that group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth allowance will be available to full&hyphen;time students under 25, and to those over 25 who are still doing the course which they started before turning 25 and for which they were receiving youth allowance. The allowance will also be available to young people under 21 who are looking for work, combining part&hyphen;time study with job search or undertaking any other approved activity. Young people who have turned 15, who are above school leaving age and who are considered independent&mdash;for example, because they are homeless&mdash;may also attract youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To qualify for youth allowance, a young person will have to undertake an approved activity, such as full&hyphen;time study or job search, voluntary work or another approved activity. Alternatively, he or she will have to undertake a combination of approved activities equivalent to a full&hyphen;time activity load, or else be temporarily exempt from these requirements, for example, if ill or caring for a frail relative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people under 18 will have to be in full&hyphen;time education or training to get youth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allowance, unless they meet one of the special exemption criteria, such as being ill, homeless or unable to secure an appropriate education or training place. The government firmly believes that young people will benefit from being steered toward completing year 12 or undertaking appropriate training, thus making them much more likely to be employed than young people who leave school at the end of year 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The types of courses that will be approved for youth allowance are generally those currently approved for Austudy, that is, secondary education courses, graduate courses&mdash;excluding most masters and all doctorate courses&mdash;undergraduate courses, associate and certain other diplomas and TAFE courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students will have to make satisfactory progress throughout their course. If they do not, they may be required to meet other activity test requirements such as job search to continue to be paid youth allowance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Young people who are continuing as full&hyphen;time students will not have to look for work during vacations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important factor in setting a person's rate of youth allowance is whether he or she is `independent'. Young people will be independent if they: are homeless; have supported themselves for at least 18 months out of the previous two years; satisfy the special safety net criteria aimed at a person who is specially disadvantaged in terms of education or employment; are, or have been, married&mdash;including living in a de facto relationship for two years or more; or have, or have had, a dependent child. In addition, some other grounds for independence are being carried over from the current payments, for example, being an orphan or a refugee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For young people who are not independent and who are under 18, their youth allowance will be paid to a parent rather than to them personally, unless an exemption is granted. This is consistent with the arrangements now in place for younger Austudy customers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9123">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth allowance will be paid at the higher `away from home' rate for independent young people who live away from their parent's home, and for those who are not independent but who need to live away from home to pursue their education or to look for work. Young people who are not independent and who do not need to live away from home for such a reason will be eligible only for the lower `at home' rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth allowance provides more support for those who have to leave home to study or look for work, especially from rural areas, by extending rent assistance to more young Australians who are studying. Rent assistance will also be available to independent youth allowance recipients who are partnered or who have a dependent child or to other independent young people who live away from their parent's home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance parental means test will measure the capacity of parents to support their dependent children financially by looking at parents' income, assets and actual means. It will be based on the Austudy parental income, family assets and family actual means tests and will generally apply to recipients who are not independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual means test was introduced for Austudy in January 1996. It was developed in response to a perception that taxable income is not always an accurate measure of a family's ability to provide for its children's education. This is still a valid concern and, accordingly, a family's actual means are to be assessed for non-independent youth allowance recipients and claimants. The details of the test will be provided by regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A family assets test will also apply for non&hyphen;independent youth allowance customers. A personal and partner assets test will apply for partnered independent people, and a personal assets test alone for single independent people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The personal income test, and the partner income test for partnered independent people, will be based on the social security allowance income test. However, full&hyphen;time students will benefit from a higher income free area of $230 per fortnight, whereas other youth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allowance customers will have a free area of $60 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Full&hyphen;time students will also have access to an income bank, in which they may accumulate unused portions of their fortnightly free area, up to a maximum balance of $6,000, to be used to offset future income. The income bank is designed for students in recognition of the fact that their income earning tends to be concentrated in vacation periods. Part&hyphen;time students and job seekers are more able to, and expected to, undertake paid work at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the approximately 560,000 young people on income support who are prospective youth allowance customers, about 358,600 will receive the same amount of money as they do now. About 153,750 will receive more. Although around 47,650 will lose money, mainly because of the parental means test, many of these will benefit from the other aspects of the new allowance and most will be affected for a short period.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill complements the surcharge legislation already passed by the parliament. The

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The collection mechanism under the bill is similar to that which applies to members of unfunded defined benefits superannuation funds under the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997. The only difference is that the liability to pay the surcharge will rest with the member rather than the superannuation fund. The surcharge liability for a member for a year will be accumulated in a surcharge debt account, maintained by the Commissioner of Taxation, for the member and will be payable by the member when the member's superannuation benefit becomes payable. The member will have the option of paying off the debt as it arises once an amount of surcharge has been assessed.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill amends the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Application to the Commonwealth  Reduction of Benefits) Act 1997 and nine acts dealing with superannuation for federal parliamentarians, new federal judges and certain tribunal members with the status of a judge, Commonwealth sector civilian employees, Defence Force personnel and the Governor-General. These acts are the Defence Act 1903, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, the Judges Pensions Act 1968, and the Governor&hyphen;General Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will ensure that the superannuation contributions surcharge, which is designed to make superannuation arrangements more equitable by addressing the concessional tax treatment for superannuation contributions in respect of high income earners, applies to people entitled to superannuation benefits under the acts to be amended by the bill. However, serving federal judges are constitutionally protected from the application of the surcharge. As is the case for all other employees whose superannuation contributions are subject to the surcharge, members of these schemes will be able to pay the surcharge as it falls due instead of having the amounts deducted from their superannuation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The schemes under the acts to be amended by the bill are either unfunded or largely unfunded defined benefits schemes. Except where the surcharge is pre&hyphen;paid by a scheme member, it is notionally accumulated during 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a member's service and paid by the scheme trustee or administrator when the member's benefits become payable. The bill will ensure that trustees are able to meet their surcharge liability.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In August, the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  was all pumped up by its victory in scaring off the federal government and the nation's health ministers from the ACT's proposed heroin trial. The editorial of 20 August said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two weeks ago, the Telegraph described health Ministers who supported the proposed heroin trial as "drug pedlars" in the hope such language would prompt the government to action. Yesterday's Cabinet decision vindicates that uncompromising stand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They finished the editorial on a stirring note:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let governments heed that message. The . . . fight for a drug&hyphen;free society is the only approach the community&mdash;and The Daily Telegraph&mdash;will accept.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The paper's successful crusade against the heroin trial was spearheaded by its columnist Piers Akerman, who boldly fired off paragraphs such as the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is this crazy notion that drugs are not dangerous, though the manner in which they are used may be, that has dominated the drug debate in this country for the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of illicit drugs is a crime, just as the peddling of illicit drugs is a crime.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem with all this stirring stuff is that New South Wales upper house MP Richard Jones has made very serious allegations concerning Mr Akerman's own use of drugs. Just two weeks ago, Mr Jones told the New South Wales parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The joke is that Piers Akerman, when he lived in Albion Street in the 1970s, used LSD and marijuana regularly. He also used cocaine regularly when he was in the United States of America, in Los Angeles and Washington. I have spoken to someone who shared a number of cocaine lines with Piers Akerman.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Following that, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> , Mr Col Allan, attacked Mr Jones and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is outrageous that this bloke would launch a baseless personal attack on Piers simply because he disagrees with Mr Akerman's position on a social issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Akerman also attacked Mr Jones, but he gave a very qualified denial indeed. He said 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he was not a drug `addict'. He also said he had never seen drugs such as LSD used at the Albion Street flat when he stayed there. Neither of these is inconsistent with Mr Akerman having been a cocaine user.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never pretend to be a member of the moral majority and I do not claim to have the answers to this nation's drug problems, but I do hate hypocrisy, so let me tell the House that I too have been aware for some years of reliable reports that Piers Akerman was a cocaine user&mdash;and much more recently than the 1970s. The copy kids who worked at News Ltd in Sydney in the mid&hyphen;1980s could hear him in the toilet at 9 p.m. snorting cocaine while he was working on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and he used to reminisce at the local pub about his drug&hyphen;hazed days in the US in the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the man who is telling us how we should conduct the fight against drugs. I say to Mr Allan: there are a lot of people out there who know the truth about Piers Akerman. It is not good enough for you to parade your newspaper as an anti-drugs campaigner until you clean up your own house. For as long as you have Mr Akerman writing for you and, in particular, pontificating on the issue of illegal drug use, your claim to be the standard&hyphen;bearer of the anti&hyphen;drugs campaign will ring absolutely hollow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> was back at it as recently as Monday, 22 September when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no quick fix to the drug problem. But it also cannot be fixed by soft&hyphen;hearted, weak&hyphen;kneed approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drug trade, and the addiction it causes among too many of NSW's young people, must be combated with tough, determined actions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday I had the pleasure, along with other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9128"> women members of parliament representing the coalition government, to join the Prime Minister (John Howard), Senator Newman, Pru Goward and some other members of the family of the late Dame Enid Lyons at the relaunch of Dame Enid Lyons's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Among the Carrion Crows</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dame Enid Lyons's book was based on her time in this great institution. The title came from something Billy Hughes said to her during her first few days in parliament. He called her aside and said, `Let there be no talk of equality of the sexes. There you sit, like a bird of paradise amongst the carrion crows.' I am sure that, if she were alive today and saw the performance of the opposition in the last week, she would have renamed her book `Among the Carrion Vultures'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year marks the centenary of Dame Enid's birth. She was elected to parliament 54 years ago. One could only imagine how special this occasion was for her&mdash;a woman, a widow, a mother of 12 children; the first woman to ever address the House of Representatives. As the history books recorded, she went on to be the first woman member of federal cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women have always played a respected and prominent part in the Liberal Party. Dame Enid was not the token female, and neither are the 25 women in the federal parliament today representing the Liberal government. We contested vigorous preselections, fought strong campaigns and, following the election 18 months ago, we have achieved the highest percentage of women in Australia's parliament ever&mdash;over 20 per cent, which is twice the world average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a perception out there that the Labor Party has been the champion of women's issues for many years. Those sitting opposite need a few lessons on how the Liberal government over the years progressed women in Australia's society. It was the Menzies government that delivered child endowment, national divorce laws, the medical benefits scheme, the national health scheme and tax concessions for married pensioners. In the Holt, Gorton and McMahon era, the Liberal Party delivered assistance to deserted wives, lifted the Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Public Service marriage ban, and introduced equal pay legislation and the first Child Care Act in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Fraser government introduced the new family allowance system, which involves payment made directly to carers&mdash;principally then, and still generally the case, directed to mothers. It established the Office of Child Care, the National Women's Advisory Council and the Institute of Family Studies. In 1979, pensioner health benefits were extended to single parents and dependants and, before losing office in 1983, the Fraser government developed the family income supplement scheme for low income earners. I might add that it was the Fraser government that signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our recent Workplace Relations Act removed restrictions on permanent part-time work, which previously forced some workers into casual employment. Permanent part-time work with pro-rata conditions is an enormous step forward for Australian women. For the first time, work and family can be combined with security, certainty and full entitlements. This is a far cry, for example, from two years ago, when 28 per cent of women in the work force were casuals, with little or no access to government subsidised child care. We have also further broadened employment and training opportunities for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) constantly knocking our child-care policy. But the reality is that we have increased expenditure on child care by some $44 million, to $2.1 billion, annually and over the next four years the government will fund an additional 83,000 child-care places. Our family tax initiative has provided significant assistance to all Australian families within a reasonable income band who have children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said at the book launch that his goal is to provide women with the maximum achievable degree of choice in Australian society. He said he did not believe, and would never believe, in patronising quotas&mdash;although the Prime Minister went on to say that he believed in effective anti-discrimination laws. That is why we have retained and will enhance the role of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9129"> federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Perth lawyer, Wally Goodlet from the firm Unmack and Unmack, is representing this group of Indonesian fishermen who have illegally strayed into Australian waters and are currently arrested in Broome. They have been beaten by the legislation previously regarding illegal fishermen in Australia so they are trying to use the current messy native title laws to lay a native title Mabo-style claim over our waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I ask is: who is paying for their defence? Who is going to pay Mr Wally Goodlet of Unmack and Unmack to fight their case? These people, as he said, are gypsies of the sea. These gypsies of the sea have wandered into Australian waters and an Australian legal firm is going to represent them&mdash;not on the little bit of money they earn from shark fin and crocus shells, so who is paying? We need to find out whether the money that is going to be used for this case is coming from the native title representative bodies or from legal aid. Legal aid is already short of money at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Thompson said that this Indonesian group fishing in our waters has allowed Australian lawyers and academics to explore the opportunity for native title. He also said that this is an opportunity not only to win the case for these fishermen but to lay an exotic claim. It certainly is a very exotic claim over our Australian waters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday legislation was passed in this House capping aircraft movements at Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney at a maximum of 80 per hour by introducing a management scheme administered by a corporate slot manager and endorsed by a compliance committee. This legislation was supported by the Labor opposition. I would like to say a few words on this legislation in this adjournment debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is known, KSA is Australia's primary international airport and, with the massive spending on infrastructure, it is likely to remain so for many years to come because the immediate urgency of having a second international airport in Sydney to cater for the Olympic Games has passed and because of the doubts about the site of Sydney's second airport due to the massive community opposition to an airport at Badgerys Creek. It is, therefore, important that appropriate commercial and environmental safeguards are put in place to take KSA into the 21st century.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9131">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, KSA handles up to 75 aircraft movements per hour. The need to provide fair access for international, domestic and regional flights is important. The present scheme includes cluster scheduling where a group of flights is scheduled with the same arrival and departure times. If applied on a literal basis, the practice of cluster scheduling would be beyond the capacity of KSA to manage. This legislation imposes a slot management scheme which will spread aircraft movements evenly across each hour of operation at KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One may ask why the member for Greenway is so interested in the  Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997 . The answer is because I am interested, firstly, in the welfare of residents affected by aircraft pollution wherever they live in the Sydney region; secondly, in the commercial viability of the airport; and, thirdly, in the special welfare of people living in western Sydney, who are fighting to prevent a KSA environmental disaster happening. I would like to give a few examples of how aircraft pollution is presently affecting residents of western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at a Salvation Army presentation at Parramatta Park some 18 months ago. It was a wet and overcast day. On two occasions the proceedings were interrupted by low flying commercial aircraft. People around KSA have this same experience, I know, on an hour-by-hour basis. I do not want the people of western Sydney to inherit this same experience by transferring the KSA problems to Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point to remember is airport pollution does not necessarily remain around the KSA and surrounding suburbs. Climatic conditions force this pollution inland right up to the Blue Mountains. The wind patterns then lock pollution&mdash;polluted air&mdash;over the western Sydney basin covering the electorates of Macarthur, Macquarie, Parramatta, Prospect, Mitchell, Lindsay, Greenway and Chifley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This air sometimes sits there for months causing huge problems for people living in this catchment region. The pollution problems experienced around KSA would be three times worse in western Sydney if an airport 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was actually built at Badgerys Creek. A simple transfer of aircraft from KSA to the land&hyphen;locked and residentially surrounded Badgerys Creek is not the solution at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proper and vigorous campaign that has been raised by inner city MPs right across the political spectrum about the issues has had a profound effect upon western Sydney people. The residents of the inner city are to be commended for waking us all to the serious environmental problem that confronts them. We all understand the desperate need to manage aircraft movements in and out of KSA. I am sure all residents of Sydney, irrespective of what part of Sydney they live in, support moves to reduce noise pollution around KSA. If the inner city residents of Sydney are being subject to these terrors from the air with an airport curfew, just imagine the concerns people in western Sydney have about being subject to a 24&hyphen;hour airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like, in conclusion, to take a bipartisan note and just refer to an article that appeared in the local paper following a protest meeting that was held at Blacktown two weeks ago. The heading is `Libs anti-airport', and there is a quote from the President of the Greenway Federal Electorate Conference. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President of the FEC and Blacktown Councillor Allan Green said his organisation's bi&hyphen;partisan support of Labor in opposing the airport was because it would have "major implications for the quality of life" of western Sydney people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This opposition is based on the fact that the major airport proposal would result in unacceptable impacts of aircraft noise, air pollution and pollution of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This would result in a significant reduction in our quality of life in Greenway and in western Sydney."</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. When the coalition government was elected in March 1996, just 18 months ago, we inherited what could only be described as a financial mess. The current account deficit, which we were told did not exist, was $10.5 billion. Interest rates were well over 10 per cent. Business interest rates were running at 15 per cent, 16 per cent and even 17 per cent for business overdrafts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many businesses were still recovering&mdash;those that had survived of course&mdash;from the recession that we had to have when the interest rates skyrocketed into the 20 per cent range and we had inflation running into the high teens. Unemployment had reached almost 12 per cent of the Australian population. Thousands of businesses were destroyed in the 1980s and tens of thousands of jobs were destroyed. This is the legacy which we inherited from the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community expected us to set the economy right, and this is what we are doing as a government. Interest rates are now at their lowest levels since the 1960s&mdash;I have a press release here from the National Australia Bank announcing business interest rates of 8.75 per cent&mdash;inflation is almost non-existent and we have created an investment environment that we have not seen in this country for decades. It is an environment in which people can invest, businesses can look forward to the future with certainty and confidence and young people can plan their futures and can plan to buy a home of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drop in mortgage rates for home buyers means that most families are $200 to $300 per month after tax better off, far better than any wage increase. Over recent months the government has been criticised because the unemployment rates have not fallen. The unemployment rate nationally at the moment is 8.7 per cent, and this rate has remained basically static over the last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am confident that the strategies put in place by the coalition government will see results, and tonight I particularly want to highlight the unemployment figures in the electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast of New South Wales. According to the ABS 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> figures, back in August 1996 the unemployment rate in Robertson was 9.1 per cent with 11,400 people actively seeking employment. Since that time  businesses have continued to expand and prosper on the Central Coast of New South Wales, and the August 1997 ABS unemployment figures show that we now have on the Central Coast of New South Wales an unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent with some 7,700 people actively seeking work. That is a drop of 2.3 per cent, or almost 25 per cent, of those who were seeking work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This drop in the local unemployment rate on the Central Coast of New South Wales vindicates what the government is trying to do and what the government has done for the economy. As the federal member, I spend a great deal of time travelling around my electorate and speaking to people from all walks of life. I can tell you that small business, particularly in the manufacturing sector in my electorate, is confident of the future. There are 308 businesses actively involved in manufacturing on the Central Coast of New South Wales. A vast number of those are exporting, expanding and looking to put on more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you would have noticed the increase in the consumer spending figures that were released recently with a 2.6 per cent increase in consumer spending nationwide&mdash;again, a signal that confidence is returning to the community and the people are beginning to spend more. This, of course, is generating business activity and generating jobs. The economy of the Central Coast of New South Wales is now starting to flourish once again. The building industry is very busy. Real estate agents report a steady increase in inquiries and, as I mentioned earlier, manufacturing continues to expand on the Central Coast of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still much to do. Our youth unemployment is still unacceptably high, although it is down below the national average. Even at 6.8 per cent, the unemployment rate is not acceptable. We have to continue to strive as a government and we have to continue to strive as a community to ensure that all those people who want jobs can secure jobs and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9133"> secure their future. I am proud to be part of a coalition government that is managing the economy correctly and giving new hope to tens of thousands of Australians who had basically given up hope for the future under a tired Labor government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9133"><TITLE>Trams: Melbourne</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope the honourable member for Bendigo might give this motion some support. The article reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The motion reads: "That the State Government review the extension of the Plenty Rd tram line from McKimmies Rd to University Drive, Mill Park. The extension . . . would make life easier, particularly on a weekend when other forms of public transport are less frequent."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course I support such a motion, but this story is quite a joke. It was the state Liberal government that prevented the extension of the Bundoora tram towards Childs Road, shortening it to McKimmies Road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the extension of what was originally the East Preston line is that, under the Cain Labor government in May 1983, the line was extended to Boldrewood Parade, Reservoir. Under the Cain Labor government in January 1985, it was extended to La Trobe University. Under the Cain Labor government on 23 April 1987, it was extended to McLeans Road, Bundoora. Then under a joint effort between the federal government, under better cities money, and the new state Liberal government, the Bundoora tram was extended to McKimmies Road. Originally, it was to extend about another kilometre towards Childs Road, but the actions of the state Liberal government prevented that extension.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the local Liberal branch, who would have needed a Melways to find Mill Park, have decided that this has been a successful extension. I agree that this is the type of project that should go forward. In fact, I believe this extension should go not just to the Centenary Drive end point; it should go towards the hard rail, which could be an extension of the hard rail train from Epping to the now defunct South Morang Station, which is in the vicinity of the civic offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Projects like this that have great community benefit are the types of projects that the Commonwealth government should look to be involved in. Perhaps this Commonwealth government, if it really believes that the Federation Fund is going to be a success, should look towards using that type of funding to ensure this type of project goes ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a whole host of reasons, these types of public transport on fixed rail&mdash;whether it be the light rail of the tram or the heavy rail of the train&mdash;have successful benefits, not only for the community but also for things like the environment. It gives alternatives to the car, and I do not think we have spoken of that enough in the overall discussion about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We have debated that issue in a very narrow fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, to curry favour with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), I mention another tram extension that has some merit, and being an old Preston boy, I think I can speak on this. I speak of the extension of the West Preston tram from the Gilbert Road terminus at Regent Street right through to Edwardes Lake. This means the honourable member for Batman is quite in my debt, but I am sure he will do the right thing at some stage. I do urge the state Liberal Party to have a look at this proposition being put forward. This is a project that has great merit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is the first part of a two&hyphen;stage process to implement a new strategy for wheat marketing in Australia that will eventually lead to the conferring of export monopoly in one grower owned company. It provides a framework for the complete restructuring of the Australian Wheat Board and gives the board revised functions that will completely change the marketing structure for an industry that has traditionally been subject to strict government intervention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this century, Australian producers' returns were subject to the market distorting influences of price and shipping cartels which colluded to depress prices and control transport. Government got directly involved in supporting the industry during the Great Depression when, after several abortive attempts, a bounty of four pence halfpenny per bushel was paid for all wheat marketed in 1931&hyphen;32.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 1930s, both state and federal governments became involved in a variety of direct support measures for the industry. Orderly marketing and price stabilisation schemes came into effect with the bill of 1948, with guaranteed prices, including domestic consumption prices, and Australian Wheat Board and other stabilisation arrangements remaining part of subsequent legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Wheat Board had sole receival and marketing powers over wheat grown in Australia in return for the absorption of most of the risk of downward prices by the government. Under the pressure of several critical reviews of the AWB in the 1970s and 1980s, the Wheat Marketing Act 1984 introduced the first significant changes to the monopoly role of the board, including permits to allow stock feed trading and separate categories of wheat to reduce cross&hyphen;subsidisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the royal commission of 1986&hyphen;87 recommended the setting up of marketing authorities, which would no longer be required to grant sole receival rights to state agencies for receival and storage. As well, the recommendations included removal of restrictions on transport of grain by road and the implementation of charges for port and shipping services to more accurately reflect the costs incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the Industry Assistance Commission's review in 1988 recommended even further deregulation of the industry, including the discontinuation of the underwriting provisions. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9136"> 1989, legislation was introduced that created strong tensions between the industry and government, with its mix of further marketplace deregulation but a rolling back of government commitments, including a fixed government guarantee on AWB borrowings, removal of the requirement for major grower membership of the board, a wheat industry fund financed by grower levy, and passing back of more costs to growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following this, the industry took the reality of deregulation and lesser government support by the horns, when the Grains Council initiated the Grains 2000 project and the eventual establishment of the national grain marketing strategic planning unit, made up of all major industry players, to create the flexibility in the market required to meet the challenges of the new market realities, both here and abroad. Led by the Grains Council, the debate of 1994&hyphen;95 centred on the form that any lasting restructure of the Australian Wheat board should take, with retention of single desk selling for exports and grower control and ownership foremost in industry minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grower corporate model was essentially the model announced by the minister in April this year for wheat marketing in Australia. The Western Australian Farmers Federation has been dissatisfied with the one&hyphen;grower, one&hyphen;vote system, based on what it sees as the greater productive output of growers in that state. That in fact is a reality. Hopefully that issue has been resolved with shares to be allocated on a delivery basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the National Competition Council has been urging a review of the wheat industry before the expected 2000 date set for such reappraisal, the government has indicated through the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) that it firmly is committed to retaining the wheat export monopoly. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) is on record too as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a corrupted world market . . . the adage that you ought not to divide your strength applies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says also that he is `absolutely convinced of the value of single desk arrangements,' which perhaps begs the question how this philosophy fits into the general attitude prevailing in this government about the value of deregulation and the view that the unregulated marketplace will deliver all the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The single desk status is under challenge from international grain traders who are already active in the domestic market. I wonder how long the resolve of the minister and government can hold out, particularly with a cartel of multinationals like Cargill, Continental, ConAgra, Dreyfus and certain Japanese traders circling our industry like sharks and sure to stir World Trade Organisation activity to challenge this export monopoly, presenting it as some sort of free market distortion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The planned ACCC review of the industry in 1999 is also, on that commission's form to date, likely to advise a scrapping of the single desk, and the resolve of any minister for trade and others will be sorely tested again at that time. The trade minister is on record as making no apology for defending the monopoly against the `eco rats, the extremely dry economic rationalists,' and he says he would continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS> on 31 July, the Minister for Trade said that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AWBs export marketing arrangements allowed many small producers to combine and to be confident they would not be exploited by the multinational trading companies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, bravo! I only hope, come 2000, that we will not be overwhelmed by forces beyond our control who want to control our industry, aided and abetted by the WTO. Retention of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9137"> AWB's export monopoly is not only advisable but essential to the Australian wheat grower and our wider economic fortunes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main features of this bill retain the AWB's functions to control export of wheat and the marketing overseas of Australian wheat. It repeals the AWB's power to buy wheat in Australia or overseas, to import wheat into Australia, or to sell or dispose of wheat in Australia, and it establishes three wholly owned subsidiaries of the AWB to take over wheat marketing and financing arrangements. Company A will be engaged in matters, including value adding, for the purposes of foreign trade, including the promotion, funding or undertaking of research into marketing or value adding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I surely hope this will, in some way, lead to a restoration of incentives to continue the kind of value adding work conducted by the Manildra group of companies in my electorate and also on the south coast in its ethanol development program&mdash;a program cruelly and short&hyphen;sightedly terminated by this government's abolition, prior to its agreed date, of the ethanol bounty scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has not only penalised a company with a multimillion dollar commitment to regional Australia and the wheat industry&mdash;incidentally, it was engaged with the sugar industry, and I know the Deputy Speaker, the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) would be interested in extracting ethanol, under the same bounty scheme, from sugar&mdash;but also has seriously hampered development of alternative energy sources at a time when our national commitment to greenhouse gas emission reduction is under worldwide scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, we will have a holding company with a single desk power and two subsidiaries. One will handle all pool wheat and will be charged with maximising returns to the growers; the other will handle the company's commercial activities to maximise profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many in the area of primary industry who are not wheat growers but end users, such as the stockfeed or lotfeed industry, who would want a much more liberalised wheat marketing system. However, claims that the existing system, even after the changes this bill will bring about, will not deliver the growers the returns they deserve or the grain using industry the flexibility of market it wants really deserve a closer scrutiny, because I do not think they are accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new range of branded wheats built on quality gradings developed by the AWB will be part of its operations still&mdash;and expanded&mdash;and that is headed by premium white suitable for instant noodles, baked products and pan and flat breads. Other brands that have been developed through the AWB include soft, prime hard, durum and the Australia standard white.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Customers for Australian wheat are becoming more and more discerning and now 40 quality differentiations are available. As well, there is an active involvement by the AWB in value adding and marketing initiatives. Research and development into end use is taking place at the Academy of Grain Technology with its recently installed Asian Food Research Centre. There is a joint venture flour mill in the Chinese province of Shenzhen, with similar ventures committed in Suez and Ho Chi Minh City. Long&hyphen;term trading relationships are developed with buyers and, to my mind, the single desk of the AWB system offers surety to growers, not the gamble the complete deregulation of the system, with its domination by foreign traders, would present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AWB will, hopefully, be able to maintain a credit rating it has built up through solid accumulation of grower levies, so that when the government guarantee runs out in 1999, both 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9138"> a strong capital base and strong reliable reputation will still be intact. Board chairman, Trevor Flugge, in an article in the Bankers Trust annual review of 1995, says:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I realise that there is still a Senate committee report on this bill to be completed and tabled by the third week in October. With the proviso that there are no substantial problems from the industry about the restructuring of it&mdash;and I have not fielded any significant objections in my office&mdash;I will not be supporting the opposition's amendments and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R266">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is an interim measure which, in my mind, is a very doubtful necessity, which is aimed at establishing a holding company to become the company owned by the Wheat Industry Fund holders&mdash;otherwise know as WIF&mdash;and controlled by Australian wheat growers. It is an interim measure that the second reading speech tells us is necessary to allow the Wheat Board to start to get a commercial base out there in the real world. The only bit of real world that it does not confront today is the fact that it has a government guarantee to its borrowings. Funnily enough, this legislation does not remove that guarantee. It is proposed to be removed in 1999, so one would wonder why it is necessary that the Wheat Board get into the commercial arena at this particular time when its cosseting is to remain. In fact, there is a proposal in this legislation to create a holding company, a pool sale company, which would deal with the export of wheat and a domestic trading company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that, by doing this at this stage, the parliament sets a process in concrete which I think will be difficult to get out of when the second round of legislation comes forward. The major concern I have is that it is proposed that, within this structure, the companies will be the holders of this single desk monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech makes some suggestions that might not be the case, but we have got to understand that the proposal has grave difficulties in what it sets out to achieve. This is not necessarily a criticism of the minister or the government, which is responding to the requests of the grain industry. I might add that it is the industry who got itself into this mess in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I wish to point out to the House and particularly put on the record my objections on behalf of my constituents&mdash;and, in a single electorate, I represent between 60 and 70 per cent of the total grain exports of Australia. Furthermore, in that regard, I point out that that is the only component of the grain industry where the Commonwealth has any interest. We control the grain market in Australia through the export powers of the constitution. If it were not for that export sector, we would not be passing this legislation. The domestic market, which is significant to the company that is going to operate under this legislation, is a deregulated market open to all comers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a grower model, yet as they presently propose, the structures are totally unworkable. The problem is that the proposal is to create a company that is run by its customers but which seeks over time to attract non&hyphen;customer share capital. This creates a massive conflict of interest that will, at least, probably deny existing WIF contributors any chance of recovering their forced contributions through the sale of the proposed B class shares.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9139">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the House consequently to a news release from the Grains Council on 29 September, headed `GCA pushes on with AWB restructure'. In this they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Growers have also been seeking advice from the council regarding our support for the public listing of the new company structure post&hyphen;1999. `This issue is pivotal to ensuring that growers can have access to their wheat industry fund post&hyphen;1999 and ensuring that the AWB has a mechanism to maintain an adequate capital base,' Mr Stewart said. The council has resolved that listing should occur as soon as commercially possible after the revocation of the government underwriting of AWB Limited's borrowings on 1 July 1999, and that a mechanism be put in place to guarantee capital value at conversion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That sounds pretty interesting, seeing that we are going into the field of commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point of all this is&mdash;and I think it is well recognised in those words&mdash;that the problems are as follows: the AWB, which has been a statutory authority, cannot exist, as a private company, without the WIF capital base. Many grain growers today&mdash;and with the current El Nino effect, drought and everything else, this situation is being aggravated&mdash;cannot afford to continue to provide these funds. I have wheat growers in my electorate who every year go to their bank and borrow money to put in a crop, yet they have WIF funds of up to $200,000 which they cannot access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution proposed&mdash;and Mr Stewart makes it quite clear&mdash;is to list the holding company on the Australian Stock Exchange, thus allowing those WIF or B class shareholders as they become, to recover their forced contribution by disposing of their shares to interested investors. It sounds nice and simple. The question is whether the proposed structures will achieve this outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is the problem that the Australian Stock Exchange rules oppose company structures that restrict access to the board of directors. Recognising this is a proposed company in which you must be a wheat grower to be a director and must be elected by wheat growers, I do not think the Stock Exchange will be too keen about that. I have had correspondence with financial advisers who recognise the problem but say that they think they can get around it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this obstacle is overcome, then the question arises of investors being interested in shares when the directors' main interest is in returns to their customers. Is the AMP going to go and buy a lot of my farmers' shares when they  desperately need their WIF money back? Are they going to buy their shares and say, `This is a great investment. The directors do not want to make a profit. They want to return all the money to their customers, the wheat producers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there is another aspect to all that, and that is the fact that company law provides that the directors' first responsibility is to the shareholders. So how can they represent the interests of the customer, the wheat grower, and the shareholders at the same time? Under the proposed structures&mdash;as I will read to you, they have a solution to this which is equally alarming&mdash;the reality is that outside investors are not going to be interested in buying shares where there is grave doubt over what sort of returns they might get. So this is a problem. In recognition of the problem, the Grains Council of Australia proposes dividends to shareholders based on&mdash;to use their words&mdash;`a commercial rate of return'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me read to you what Mr Stewart said about that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The council was also able to support the principle of a commercial rate of return which included the establishment of a service agreement between the pool subsidiary and the AWB holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commercial rate of return must be commensurate with the risk borne by the capital providers, the competitive market for capital, and will fluctuate over time to reflect market circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Stewart also said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9140">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The council support for the principles of a commercial rate of return protected by the service agreement is contingent on the acceptance by government of the council's pool subsidiary board structure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What they are saying there is that to overcome the problem that no&hyphen;one wants to buy shares in a company run by its customers, they will be guaranteed a commercial rate of return&mdash;10 per cent&mdash;on their investment. That will certainly attract investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what if the company, this free enterprise business operation out there in the real marketplace where we are sending it, is grossly inefficient? What if it is a poor performer? The normal response to a poorly performing company is for its shareholders to flog the stock, they devalue the shares. That is a discipline over the directors. But, suddenly, the shareholders under this proposal are going to be in absolute comfort. They can buy shares and they are guaranteed a return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is that money going to come from? From one place only: wheat growers returns. So you could end up with a mob of mugs, of no&hyphen;hopers, running a company and paying themselves big salaries, and the shareholders are not going to go crook. So all the normal disciplines of the share market disappear. How can we have that? It is silly&mdash;and that is what we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, as I said, it gets worse. We are going to have a group of farmers who have just had this big fight, which is resolved. As an issue of fine detail, which I think is worthless, I have supported my constituents in arguing for their voting rights in the election of directors, which primarily resides with A&hyphen;class shares&mdash;and these are applicable to wheat growers. You can grow 30 tonnes of wheat a year for three years and you get a vote for a director. But the argument now is that if you are a substantial grower of wheat, wherever you live&mdash;and they particularly reside in my electorate&mdash;then in fact you will get additional voting rights. There is nothing wrong with that, except that when you send the bloke there, someone is going to drop the company law in front of him and say, `I know that you have gone and made all these promises to your wheat grower constituency but, mate, your responsibility now is to the shareholder.' And it is, legally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is the dilemma: people desperately want their WIF money back. There are people going off their farms with a residue of money in the Wheat Industry Fund. That is how bad it is in some situations. This is recognised by the Grains Council; they say so in their press release. Their solution is to say, `Yes, we will get you your money back. We'll guarantee the AMP or, for that matter, Cargills or whoever buys it, a commercial rate of return with your money.' That is what we have got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a solution. I have argued it extensively in my electorate. I have even brought with me and made representations to the Senate committee on all the places I have run this story, and not one person has criticised my solution. It is not beyond achieving.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the minister?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have talked to the minister. But the reality is this: the minister is still trying to respond to what the grain industry wants. The grain industry is out there cutting its own throat. I do not think it uses halal slaughter; it may as well! But the reality is that the solution lies in retaining the single desk at total arms length from the company, not as is proposed in the bill&mdash;and they talk about transparency, which I could refer to as well&mdash;in not giving it some involvement of any nature with the AWB commercial structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export monopoly is a creature of government and it should be retained in a statutory authority to which we elect wheat growers on some representative production basis. We say 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9141"> that is yours. It is your property. It is the decision of all your people that you want an export monopoly. You sit there with only two functions. The first is to let a contract to a marketer which, I believe, would be the AWB in its corporatised form. Your second responsibility&mdash;and we will give you some resources for this purpose&mdash;is to monitor the performance of that contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contract can have benchmarks in it. It is not difficult, in the international grain industry, looking to the Chicago futures exchange and whatever other indicators are available, to say these are the levels of performance that we expect you, Mr Corporatised Wheat Board, now owned by the AMP and all sorts of other people and it does not matter, to deliver. What is more, we will give you a bonus if you exceed those benchmarks which will give the company the right sort of profile out there on the stock exchange because it can say, as it constantly reminds us, that it is better than the rest of the world. It will achieve above those benchmarks and make additional profits by doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, it can trade, as it presently does, in the domestic market provided, as the Grains Council suggests, that business is at arms length and it is not discounting export wheat to itself so that it can make major profits in its domestic trading. I believe they have been making $17 million or $18 million per year out of domestic trading and that is good. That is a commercial function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their asset becomes their contract and not a government provided export monopoly. Just imagine anyone else knocking on our door and saying, `We want you to grant us an export monopoly. We are BHP; we want to be the only people in Australia to export steel products.' We would laugh them out of the room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are talking about. We are talking about corporatising a body and letting it hold the export monopoly. I say the export monopoly should stand in total independence of the commercial structure. There should be a contractual arrangement and then it does not matter. The growers do not need to press for wheat growers on the AWB&mdash;the marketing arm. They should be people determined to maximise the profits of their shareholders, whomsoever they may be over time and to do so by being super&hyphen;efficient marketers which return the best possible benefit to the customer but the customer is represented by the holders of the export monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a difficult thing to do. It is still possible as a flow&hyphen;on from this legislation. That is why I will not oppose it although I am criticising it strongly. I think these issues should have been set in concrete and, as I think the opposition is trying to say, one piece of legislation would have been better than two. I am not convinced that there is any great advantage to the wheat industry in passing this legislation at the moment but I will not be opposing it because a lot of the outstanding issues have been settled. I just do not think that the people in the Grains Council know what they are talking about. I think, as we have found in so many of these commodity councils over recent times, they do not understand the views of their constituency. They have become too distanced from them over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say I am disappointed to see in the second reading speech that there are certain matters which are going to be done in the future, and we have selected the Grains Council for that purpose. I have been reminding people that there is a simple opportunity for plebiscite on some of these major issues and that is by running these elections concurrent with local government elections. It is always a major problem when one sets out to have a plebiscite to decide issues in agriculture because it is a very expensive process but if it was brought in with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9142"> local government elections, in truth the only cost would be the ballot paper. I think local government, considering it is their own constituency that they are servicing in this, should be prepared to do it for nothing or, at most, no more than a very minimal cost. It could be done through their postal ballot arrangements or it could be done through their polling arrangements. It would be just another vote that people cast at the time. I would encourage people to think about that in the broader sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am really saying is that the proposals that the Grains Council talks about are simply not practical. They will not achieve what the Grains Council says it wants to achieve. That is to create a mechanism where there is adequate capital for this export marketing operation which is the WIF funds and an opportunity for wheat growers who need that money, or do not like that sort of investment, to get their money back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve those two goals you have to be able to list on the stock exchange&mdash;you have to have a vehicle that is listable&mdash;and you have to have a vehicle that stands on its own two feet and does not go running around enticing shareholders to buy shares on the basis of robbing the people you are servicing, that is, the wheat growers. That is what a commercial rate of return will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trevor Flugge will ring me and say, `I'm going to be perfect. I'm going to be so good to all these people. You'll have no doubt and worries about my efficiency.' There is no discipline on them under that arrangement to perform&mdash;none&mdash;yet there has got to be a process whereby they perform. There is the cost of managing the process and there is the financial return by way of wheat sales. They are both extremely important but if it has cost an extra $1 a tonne to sell wheat, that is one thing, but if you lose $10 a tonne on one million tonnes, that is a real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disciplines are not there, and they will not be there while the AWB holds this export monopoly. There is a suggestion the government is going to control it. If that is the case, why are we changing anything? There is no point, we may as well just leave the existing statutory authority in place, and a lot of my wheat growers would argue for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that if you are going to have a market situation, then have a market situation. Have proper contractual arrangements at arms length and then the company stands on its own feet and its share price reflects its ability to make profits for its shareholders. It will only do that if it is properly servicing its customers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I enjoyed the contribution of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). This is an issue on which I would not dare take him on head to head because it is a subject that he would know much more about on the basis that he has been in this place much longer than I, and also on the basis that he represents an electorate with a very large wheat interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested in what he had to say about democracy in rural Australia and the plebiscite idea. I have just recently experienced great public uproar in the Merriwa area in my electorate as a result of the New South Wales state Labor government forcing an amalgamation of the Merriwa and Mudgee Rural Lands Protection Boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been very difficult for those with an interest in the boards to put their case to the government because the concept has been supported by the peak council that oversees the Rural Lands Protection Boards in New South Wales. Here we see a fine example of the peak body of an interest group not necessarily taking into account the interests of those people who make up its organisation. The idea of a plebiscite to be held in conjunction with local 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9143"> government elections is a very interesting one and one I would be prepared to have a look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor has made some very valid points. It is fair to say that if a master of business administration came down from Mars today and took a look at our rural sector and how government involves itself in it, he would probably faint. He would surely be surprised that there is such strong government involvement. In markets such as wheat, we do offer guarantees of price and export market monopolies and other things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what he would not understand is the historical context of these things. He would not understand that people have involved themselves in these industries over many generations on the basis of the status quo&mdash;on the basis that government does have a hand in the industry, does express a strong interest in our rural sector, and does involve itself to ensure that we maximise our returns as a nation. Government has done so for many years and quite often that involvement has its roots in wartime conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the  Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 today. I would have liked to have been here earlier to hear all of the comments from the member for O'Connor but I was at a Public Accounts Committee inquiry into Internet commerce, which in the longer term might have some impact also on this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Wheat Board is a statutory authority which has existed continuously since 1948. Its principal function is to control the export and overseas marketing of Australian wheat, but it also has responsibility for a number of domestic functions. The bill before the House today puts in place the first phase of a two&hyphen;stage process to transform the Australian Wheat Board from a statutory authority to a grower owned company by 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transitional phase is supposed to commence today so that still has me a bit confused, and it raises a number of questions. The Australian Wheat Board's commercial wheat marketing and financing functions are to be transferred to a wholly grower&hyphen;owned holding company and its subsidiary. The subsidiaries will include a trading subsidiary and a pooling subsidiary. Shares in the holding company will be issued in two classes, A class and B class. Of course, as the member for O'Connor has pointed out, it is those holdings in the A class where the real power will reside on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One A class share will be issued to each grower and the Wheat Industry Fund will be converted to B class shares. The shares will be distributed to those with an equity in the fund in proportion to their equity holding. The single desk system will remain, at least for now, until we work out some competition policy issues. The Australian Wheat Board will continue to manage the Wheat Industry Fund, and will be accountable to the parliament and to the industry. The holding company will of course operate under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is the fourth largest wheat exporter in the world, trailing only the USA, Europe and Canada. Our wheat producers produce, on average, 15 million tonnes each year of which around 60,000 tonnes is produced in my own electorate, not a significant amount but certainly an important amount to my electorate. Most of that is grown in the Merriwa and Quirindi and surrounding areas. Of the 15 million tonnes that I have mentioned, some 85 per cent of that is exported. So no other country is as dependent on the wheat export market as is Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997  is a very important bill to the nation and indeed to my electorate. That is why I rise today to support the amendment put forward by our shadow minister, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). It does appear extraordinary that, with so many issues remaining outstanding, as the member for O'Connor has articulated so well, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9144"> the government should be proceeding to the second reading of this bill in the House when at the very same time the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee is holding an inquiry into the bill. The committee has identified the outstanding issues. The nature of the evidence being placed before the Senate committee and the various concerns being expressed in the media, in the community generally and, indeed, by the member for O'Connor, should have set the alarm bells ringing within the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee is due to report to the Senate by 23 October so what is the rush on this bill? This is a process which effectively began back in 1989 and has essentially been driven by the Australian Labor Party. So our position in terms of this amendment is not one of opposition but one of a carefully, carefully approach. We support the main thrust of the bill but the industry is entitled to be extensively consulted and the Senate committee process is an appropriate forum for the airing of those concerns. It is a chance for the government to make amends for an earlier period where it has not been prepared to listen carefully enough to the concerns of the industry, and there certainly have been some concerns, Mr Deputy Speaker. One only needs to look at the screams coming from the Western Australians about the allocation of A class shares. I did not think that issue had been resolved but I thought the member for O'Connor said something that would indicate to me that maybe it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then there was the member for O'Connor's submission to the Senate committee which he also mentioned. For those who have not read the submission, it is very extensive and it is very critical of the government's approach. From what I heard him say today that was only partly representative of that extensive submission. Of course, we are speaking here of the member for O'Connor, a member of the government, who represents an electorate which produces 60 per cent, as I understand it, of Australian wheat exports. I was disappointed that he did not answer my question when he was talking about his preparedness to speak openly on these issues, both before the Senate committee and publicly. When I asked him what the minister had to say about his concerns, he avoided the question. His submission to the committee, as I said, was extensive, and can best be described as a bombshell, as was his speech in here today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe not a bombshell. That is probably the wrong term, because the member for O'Connor is well&hyphen;known for criticising his own government, and has been criticising it on this issue for some months. I should not say it was a bombshell, but it certainly was a good shot at his own government in terms of the way it has approached this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just last Friday, the chairman of the Grains Committee of the New South Wales Farmers Association gave evidence before the Senate committee. He told the committee, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of our members have a strong view that what has been successful for nearly 60 years should mainly be left alone.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Some may see that as an extraordinary statement not reflecting the reality of today's world, the globalisation of the economy and all the rest. The point is that we have a bill before the House today which has many in the industry most concerned, but the government is not prepared to hold it over until those people have had the opportunity to put their case. The Senate committee is a perfect opportunity and again, I do not understand why the government is rushing this through before the Senate has given them that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too many questions remain unanswered to allow the passage of this bill through the House at this point: questions relating to competition policy and the single desk issue, and questions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9145"> relating to whether the proposed statutory arrangements will run into problems with respect to World Trade Organisation negotiations and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the main thrust of the bill. It is an important part of a process which will deliver to the industry ownership and control of the Australian Wheat Board, and it provides a mechanism for maintaining at least the existing level of harvest payments. It will deliver greater commercial flexibility and will go some way toward making the industry players masters of their own destiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry has been the subject of a number of High Court rulings, Senate standing committee reports and Auditor&hyphen;General's reports, and two Industry Commission reports. I hope that we are at least partly on track to getting it right this time around. Allowing the Senate inquiry to proceed and make recommendations before this bill makes its passage through the House is one very effective way of ensuring that that will be the case. I commend the member for Burke's amendments to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will attempt to answer, for his benefit, the very genuine concerns and questions of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R266">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill</XREF>  is an historic piece of legislation, and very important to an electorate like Mallee, which produces&mdash;and I will be kind&mdash;a lot more grain than Hunter. I am not churlish about this. My grain growing constituency have urged me very much to support this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The view needs to be adopted that this represents an enabling bill to start a process. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) enjoys the same level of respect from me as the member for Hunter. I believe that through the process&mdash;and the government is indicating quite clearly there will be further legislation on this&mdash;we will get the rest of it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of this bill to me, Mr Deputy Speaker, comes from the vast grain growing interests of the Wimmera region of my electorate, and the rolling sandy dunes of the Mallee. As we see it now, thanks to the providence of the heavens, we are very hopeful that just from my electorate we will make a contribution to the GDP this year probably nudging at least a billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the extent of the interest that I have in a piece of legislation like this: roughly a million tonnes. In the Mallee and the Wimmera we are talking about a region with the potential for up to three million tonnes, if the good Lord will provide adequate rainfall at precisely the right time. So the activities of the Australian Wheat Board are of keen interest to me and my grain growing constituency, and I am very pleased today to have an opportunity to make a contribution on this legislation on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, this bill is the first stage of what will be a new suite of legislation, with improvements and further detail next year. I will be as actively involved and as interested as the member for O'Connor and many other members of this place in what is a very, very significant industry to the Australian interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is enabling legislation to set up a process to transform ownership of the Australian Wheat Board to growers. That is something that the industry and the grower organisations they represent have driven themselves. I am willing to acknowledge the member for Hunter's suggestion that the previous government was part of that process. It needs to remember that for years now growers have wanted access to control their own destiny.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9146">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The restructure of the Australian Wheat Board brings to fruition a process that goes back seven or eight years now aimed at putting ownership and the control of wheat marketing firmly in the growers' hands, driven by the industry itself, for a very good reason, which I would like an opportunity to point out later. The push for change started in 1989 when industry commenced building up funds for a capital base for a future grower owned Australian Wheat Board via a levy on wheat sales paid into the wheat industry fund. We were grateful for the legislation that enabled that at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As anybody knows who has had association with agropolitics over the years, and particularly the wheat industry, it is like any form of agriculture and any form of commodity in trying to get a geographically diverse constituency together. We have seen the same ingredients with wool, another very significant commodity to the Australian economy. We are currently seeing it now with beef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a difficult process to embrace all of those different interests and the variety of debate to get a consensus. We have that&mdash;within reason. The debate that the member for Hunter needs to understand that is going on now is the detail: the assignment of the shares, even the name of the new organisation. I am quite confident that the consultation process and the confidence which the organisations and the growers themselves now have in that process will see us get it right in the final end product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key element of the new arrangements is the government's intention that, by 1 July 1999, its only involvement in the wheat industry will be in relation to the export monopoly, which is to be conferred on that independent grower owned company. If you look at the history of the wheat industry, for someone like me who has lived in the Mallee for the majority of his life and my family contacts who are still in grain growing, the history has been a torrid one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking on a wheat marketing bill way back in 1984, my predecessor, the former member for Mallee, Peter Fisher, said that in the early part of this century:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . wheat was being given away at two bob a bushel. There was no stability. Producers were at the whim of a small consortium of buyers who played one grower against the other and reduced an expanding industry to a very sorry state.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That has been the history if you go back 50 years. The impact on Mallee farms in that era is now a matter of recorded history: devastation and people walking off their properties, many of them soldier settlements at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, owing to a sensible approach to orderly marketing, the fortunes of the grain industry are vastly different. In our modern era there is a very positive approach. But it has been undergirded by that concept of orderly marketing because of this difficulty of geographic divide, with an industry that spread from the west coast right across to the east coast, and an almost impossible task to get that broad consensus and so many people with different interests together. That has been achieved and undergirded by that concept of orderly marketing which has been provided by the single desk concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1979, legislation of the Sinclair&hyphen;Nixon primary industry ministry portfolio was the most positive for wheat marketing in Australia since the original formation of the Wheat Board. The guaranteed minimum price arrangements gave producers, at long last, a known price for their product. This was achieved at small risk to government, whose only exposure was the contingent liability of guaranteeing the borrowings to support the pool. That is something that these days in the late 1990s governments do not wish to be exposed to, even though it is a very minimal risk. There are other reasons why that link needs to be removed. Growers wish 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9147"> to have control of their own destiny and, by their own monetary contributions now through the levy, established a very significant fund to undergird those borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to go back to the guaranteed minimum price, it gave some security because, like many Australian commodities, we are so exposed to the domination of world prices. A crisis in some part of the world creates a crisis for our own growers here, through no fault of their own. But it did give the industry opportunity, through its very good intelligence to a well&hyphen;structured, good organisation in the Australian Wheat Board, which has to be in corporate terms regarded as one of our most successful Australian companies. It gave the industry access, in a very organised way, to the market signals and ensured continued productivity and efficiency increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gave growers some security that they would receive a certain price for their commodity whilst they watched it grow and continued to invest in it, with weed control and all the other things that need to be done in any form of agriculture. It gave them some security to adopt some innovative farming techniques and for a gradual restructuring of their industry without the massive trauma, crisis and personal social costs so regularly experienced in many rural areas because of the lack of prospects for the primary industries that undergird the activities of the economy of the small communities in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the successful things was the 95 per cent up&hyphen;front advance providing a high delivery payment which enabled growers to rapidly repay their immediate costs of production. This positive cash flow situation had an ongoing benefit for the surrounding communities, and gave many rural townships some buffer against some of the other rigours that country communities face. A lot of this still continues, and much of the focus of the government's current policy is directed to address this. A fortnight ago we were very proud to announce a very specific policy directed towards advancing Australia's agricultural prospects, which has been received very positively in an electorate like Mallee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as I have said, things have changed for the grain industry. The last decade has seen a greater willingness by the industry to assume greater control of its own destiny, and these changes are now represented in this enabling legislation before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the view today has achieved a lot greater consensus than it did in the very early days. If you go back and read the history, which I wish I had time to read&mdash;and I am sure other members and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be keen to read the tortuous history of the wheat industry and government's role in it; it is a fascinating history, and I commend readers to it&mdash;it involved the parliament, members crossing floors and changing parties. But the end result was a very good result. Most of my growers now speak very highly of the manner in which the Australian Wheat Board has operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there is diverse opinion. Even in my own electorate, there are those who say that if it is time to rejig the industry, let us do it completely and expose it completely to competition and repeal the statutory marketing operations. That is a view I am listening to, but I have to form my final view based on a broad consensus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somebody earlier made reference to democracy. Democracy is all about 100 people in one room with a problem to solve. Humans being what they are, you will get 100 different suggestions on how that problem might be solved. At the end of the day, you can get 51 of those people agreeing on one solution and that still leaves 49 unhappy ones. That is democracy. That is the process and that is probably what this parliament is all about.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9148">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some people who want greater access in our own right to export markets. There is provision for that. There is a permit system within the statutory marketing arrangements that currently exist, that will continue in the new arrangements. If people discover a niche market&mdash;whether it be a particular small volume of a particular variety of grain or a market for bagged grain into Asia&mdash;and if there is opportunity to put that, there is a permit system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, tomorrow, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) is visiting my electorate for a very large meeting at Warracknabeal, which is roughly the geographic centre of my electorate. I have provided some time for him to see somebody with a particular interest in this; this person does not agree that this legislation goes far enough. I have to accept that he is in the minority in the general view of my constituency. I am supporting the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another reason. In February this year, I had an opportunity to visit the United States. I have been very concerned about the view of the United States Congress. They seem to have a very jaundiced view about the use of the word `board' in the name of the Australian Wheat Board. They have a very near neighbour in Canada whose grain board is very uncooperative in terms of trading arrangements. That jaundiced view extends to their attitude to the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of a brief from my growers, I was able to speak with quite significant congressmen involved in agricultural committees over there. In recent times, my particular visit has received the focus of national attention; I used the provisions provided in members' entitlements via a study allowance to attend that visit. Essentially, the invitation to visit Washington was extended to me by the congress to attend their international prayer breakfast. You might permit me some indulgence here, Mr Speaker; it is relevant to this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My objective was to attend that very significant event and represent my constituency and the parliament. It coincided with President Clinton's inaugural celebrations as well. Some members of the press seem to make it their purpose in life to portray members of parliament in a very unfavourable light. I take a very dim view of my use of my study allowance on that visit being considered inappropriate. I suggest that anybody who wishes to make any comment ought to speak with my constituency, particularly the wheat industry, and more particularly the citrus industry, whose interests I very actively pursued during that visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of parliament, naturally, are fair game for the media. I can accept that we trip up and make a mistake. As long as the reporting is fair and reasonable. I think the attitude of some journalists, and particularly radio commentators, ought to be based more on a principle of fairness. My growers believe that the investment of their taxpayer contributed funds in that visit was appropriately expended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found a very interesting view from some very important congressmen. They see the Australian Wheat Board and raise a smokescreen in terms of their own activities in subsidisation and distortions in the trade market&mdash;the buyer subsidies. My concern at the time was a $500 million proposal from President Clinton, as a budget provision, to allow for subsidisation. I was assured by the congressman involved that that was simply there to give them some threat against the Europeans, whom they see as bigger rogues than us, and that they would not use those subsidies against their good friends in Australia, and I hope they are up to those assurances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have a very misguided view on what the Australian Wheat Board does, contributed to by the fact that we provide them protection via the parliament to have a single desk 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9149"> monopoly on the exporting opportunity. Because of the statutory marketing arrangements which currently exist for the Wheat Board, their concern was that this represents some form of indirect subsidy. That is simply not true. The only exposure to government&mdash;as I mentioned earlier&mdash;is that listing as a contingent liability which appears when the government guarantees the borrowings for the pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the process will end up with when this enabling legislation is passed and we subsequently introduce the rest of the fine detail, is that the United States will no longer be able to allege that a smokescreen exists. We will have a completely grower owned, grower managed operation in the Australian Wheat Board&mdash;or whatever name it comes to be known by later as a new operating company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to stand here today and represent my constituency. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy who, unlike the member for Hunter, I would like to assure has gone out of his way to facilitate consultation on this matter and he deserves credit for that. He has done the same with the wool industry and is currently engaged in the same process in the beef industry&mdash;both of them are significant primary industries to my electorate. I think that he deserves congratulations and he certainly has them from me. I am looking forward to a very positive process down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 July 1999, there will be an industry standing on its own two feet and in partnership with the government, whose involvement will be in relation to the export monopoly&mdash;and for very good reason. On many occasions already the public benefit has been demonstrated. The industry will survive any test that competition policy will place upon it. I would simply urge all members to support this bill and I commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me acknowledge, before I commence my discussion of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill, the contribution by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). His electorate is certainly one where the wheat industry is critical to the economic survival of the region. I do not think there would be many in this parliament who would doubt his own bona fides as far as wanting the best outcome for the wheat growers and the wheat industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing here with one of the major rural primary industries in this country. The wheat industry has been the mainstay of many rural communities across the length and breadth of this country&mdash;in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales particularly. It is an industry that has made a massive contribution to Australia's economic advancement down through the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at Australian primary industry and the big industries, the wheat industry is certainly up there. It has undergone massive change over the period of its existence in Australia. At present nobody on the floor of this parliament would doubt the economic significance of it. Australia, of course, is a major exporter of wheat to the rest of the world. We are the fourth largest exporter of wheat, behind the United States, Canada and the Europeans, and we account for some 10 or 11 per cent of world exports. So we are a significant player. Our exports are focused in very key and strategic markets&mdash;the Asian markets, with Japan and China, and the Middle East, with Egypt and Iran.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an industry that is facing significant change to the framework in which it has operated historically. It is an industry that is under significant pressure externally, from influences such as the World Trade Organisation and the interests of major wheat exporters from other countries, namely the United States, which has some concerns about the framework in which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9150"> Australia undertakes the export of its wheat products. Internally, the framework in which the industry has operated is also under challenge from competition policy and the imperatives that that puts on the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an industry that is significant but it is one that is in a process of change and the bill before this House extends the process of change that has taken place. The member for Mallee mentioned that this is an industry with an extraordinary and interesting history in terms of the involvement of government in it and the imperatives that gave rise to that involvement. The federal government's involvement goes back to 1915 with the creation of the Australian Wheat Board. As with the involvement of the federal government in the marketing arrangements of many commodities, that involvement was initially necessitated by the deficiencies that existed in the market at that time, which saw the wholesale exploitation of farmers in a corrupted marketplace, and by unscrupulous merchants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act of 1948 that set the framework and the objectives for the industry and the legislation that governs it. That particular act had two key objectives which have set the framework for all that has gone on in this industry and the government's involvement in it down through the years. Those objectives were price stabilisation and the maintenance of predictable and consistent returns to farmers, and the establishment of orderly marketing arrangements to ensure that the corrupted marketplaces did not deliver a bad deal to farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political party that I represent in this parliament has a long association with wheat marketing reforms. It was the Wheat Marketing Act 1984, with its key change of altering the guaranteed minimum price arrangements to send more correct market signals to producers, that set the framework for reforms that have taken place over the past 15 years. We saw in 1989 the most significant reforms to wheat marketing arrangements. In those particular reforms, we saw the deregulation of the domestic wheat market through the removal of the Australian Wheat Board's compulsory acquisition powers and the termination of administered domestic pricing arrangements. We saw also a removal of the requirement that there be a majority of growers among board members; the establishment of the Wheat Industry Fund; and the expansion of responsibility of the Australian Wheat Board in its ability to trade in other grains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now in another era of reform and, as in the past, the reforms that have been proposed by the previous government and are being pursued by the current government have excited considerable debate among growers of this country, all sections of the industry and within government itself. We are challenged in this new environment that this industry operates in, in the global and domestic sense, to debate fully and to consider fully the arrangements that will propel this industry beyond the year 2000 into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it an odd state of affairs that when this particular legislation was brought back into this House there was a Senate legislative committee process already under way to provide wheat growers and others in the industry an opportunity to air their concerns and grievances as far as what is being proposed with this particular restructuring is  concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been sufficient disquiet within the industry for the Senate to approve this hearing process, and those hearings, as you would know, got under way in Canberra last week. These hearings are extremely important to the process of consultation between this parliament and the industry itself. They provide the opportunity for the airing of grievance. They also provide an opportunity for the articulation of new perspectives. They have been an important 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9151"> opportunity for many people to highlight potential deficiencies in the marketing and financial structures that are being proposed for the wheat industry in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention here the contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) to those Senate committee hearings. We acknowledge on this side of the House that the honourable member is somebody with an intimate knowledge of the industry. He is someone who has had a longstanding interest in it. When the honourable member for O'Connor gets excited about any particular proposals that are being put by any government, I think it is beholden on all of us to sit up and listen to what he has to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in the proceedings of the Senate committee hearing on Monday 15 September, when the honourable member for O'Connor had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I doubt the need for this particular piece of legislation in any form whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was a fairly strong statement that the honourable member made. I have not read all of the proceedings of that committee, but he has rung an alarm bell. That, in many ways, reflects the diverse opinion within the farming constituencies on the direction of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some concerns and they have been well articulated by the growers themselves before that particular Senate inquiry and certainly by others on the floor of the parliament in this debate. In the light of the matters of concern that have been raised, my suggestion to the minister would be to look, perhaps, at some alternative marketing and financial structures that would overcome some of the concerns and the problems that are being articulated at this point in time. Certainly, I think that on both sides of the House and within the industry there is a consensus on the need to support the concept of the single desk. Certainly growers themselves have expressed, as many of them always have, their concern for the maintenance of grower control over the direction of their industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Growers have expressed some concerns about accessing their funds in the Wheat Industry Fund, which will provide the capital base when the new companies take over the functions of the Wheat Board. There have been concerns raised about the conflicts of interest that might be generated between providing for the interests of growers and the interests of shareholders who might take equity positions when these particular companies are set up. Those concerns have been articulated and I do not propose to go over them here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my comments in this debate, let me say that this is a significant industry in this country. It is one which supports rural communities in key states of the Commonwealth and any arrangements that any government makes must be taken after a period of extensive consultation with all the players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the history of this industry is one of great conflict within the industry itself over its direction, and there are those who are arguing for a more pronounced deregulation of this industry to put it on a commercial footing and be more accepting of the global realities as well as domestic realities. However, we on this side of the House will support reasonable arrangements for this industry that are based on the consultative process and on the retention of the single desk, and that do give growers an important say in the future of their industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to follow the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R266">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill</XREF> . I endorse much of what he said in this debate, although I think it would be only fair to observe that the member for Corio's claim to have had a certain sort of monopoly on wisdom in the wheat industry on his side of the parliament was just a shade uncharitable, given that the changes that occurred 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9152"> in l984, which I very well remember and in which I participated whilst in opposition, were changes that were supported by the opposition. The member for Corio, while he was not here at the time, would at least have to concede that it was the fact that the opposition was prepared to support the then government, in what were politically difficult changes to make, that made it possible for those changes to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would indicate as well to the member for Corio that the political difficulties were much more acutely felt on the coalition benches than they were on the government benches of the day because of the way in which the majority of coalition people were representing affected wheat growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, the member for Corio is perfectly right. Here we have a significant, by any standards, Australian export industry. As the member for Corio has said, we are the fourth largest exporter of wheat around the globe. This significant industry is an industry that has been built following the difficulties that it faced through the early part of this century, an industry that has been built on the proposal of a guaranteed minimum price, giving growers price surety, but not necessarily giving them a sensitivity to marketing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that have occurred, partly as a result of pressure from the wheat industry and partly as a result of the pressure that we faced from the World Trade Organisation and from the movements into competition policy, have meant that we now have a wheat industry that is obliged not only to be an efficient producer of wheat, in which capacity it has always led the world, but to be an industry that is sensitive to world markets and an efficient marketer as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is always a difficulty for any industry at any time with a scheme that guarantees a minimum price, and even greater difficulties with a scheme that guarantees a cost of production. If I were able, as a legislator, to guarantee a cost of production to agricultural commodity producers and to do it knowing that I was not going to affect their marketing schemes, I would instantly have solved all of the major agricultural problems and I would have every investor in Australia desperate to get into agriculture as a way of guaranteeing forever a return on their investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, as the wheat industry knows, as the wool industry knows, as the dried fruit industry knows, and as the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) illustrated, simply not possible to guarantee growers the cost of production. Even a guaranteed minimum price tends to send the wrong signals to producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wheat industry, under pressure from both the WTO and competition policy, is now going through a major restructure. As I said in my response to the remarks from the member for Corio, I was here in 1984 when we dealt with the first step in this restructure, which was the deregulation of the domestic market for Australian wheat. I recall all of the apprehension that was expressed at the time, much of which has subsequently proved to be unfounded. That is not to be critical of it. It is easy to be wise with the benefit of hindsight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a situation in which we are being pressured to amend our export marketing provisions. This pressure, while it has partially come from the WTO, has been largely resisted by the government but it has wisely agreed that the marketing powers, and the single desk selling arrangements that exist for the Wheat Board, should be retained and should be defensibly retained so long as our competitors have the sort of non&hyphen;competition sensitive policies that they have. Make no mistake: there are very few growers around the globe as exposed to global realities as are Australian grain growers. So long as our competitors continue 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9153"> to thwart the market pressures, as they do by sundry and assorted support mechanisms, we should make no apology for the retention of the single desk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But as part of the commercial reality that is seeping into the wheat industry, as part of the exposure of the wheat industry to the cold winds of market reality, the industry and the government have agreed to restructure the Australian Wheat Board so that we will now have, as other speakers have said, a grower&hyphen;owned company which will have, through A and B class shareholders, control of a fund to be known as the Wheat Industry Fund, a fund which I understand currently sits at about $440 million. This fund will provide the sort of surety that is needed to enable growers to be paid in advance for the wheat that they are growing. That very technique of paying in advance out of a grower&hyphen;owned fund means that the reality of the market is not something that the growers are insulated from, because the government will no longer be the insulator that has sat between the growers and the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some criticisms levelled at the government, and at the way in which we have entertained our involvement with the World Trade Organisation, particularly by the member for Calare (Mr Andren). In participating in this debate, can I say that, uncomfortable as it may be, if we are to continue to be exporters, and if we are to continue to have any sort of say in world export markets, we have no choice but to be participators in the WTO and, through the WTO, in the GATT agreement as it exists. The simple reality is that, in spite of our predominance in the wheat, grain, and wool industries around the world, we remain participators on the world scene with little more than two per cent of world export trade. That means that, as a nation, we have no levers to pull in world export terms. We cannot adjust the settings. We are largely ignored by our competitors. That is why we choose to be participants in the WTO&mdash;not to the disadvantage of all Australian producers, as the member for Calare has suggested, but so that those of our competitors who have in the past manipulated their markets to our disadvantage can now be eyeballed by us around the WTO table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the last one to talk about a level playing field. I regret the fact that any such phrase ever entered into the marketing vocabulary, because there is not, and never will be, a level playing field in the corrupt venue of world markets. We should not talk about a level playing field. We should recognise that under the WTO, and under the arrangements that we are talking about today, which allow us to retain some credibility around the WTO table, while there is no level playing field, it is leveller than it has been at any other time in your lifetime or mine. I notice the schoolteacher sitting opposite looking a little bemused at my term `leveller', and I understand his bemusement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For want of a better word, it is more level&mdash;picking up the member for Stirling's remark&mdash;than it has been at any other time. What I am saying to the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) is that this is the lesser of the available evils and so we ought to pursue it, uncomfortable as it is. While the WTO has obliged on Australian traders and on the wheat industry, in particular, the changes that we are debating here today, we need also to recognise that our adherence to the WTO has gained for us market access in places which were previously closed to us and has given us the opportunity to eyeball competitors who would otherwise treat us unfairly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have nothing to apologise for as representatives of the Australian grain growers, but we need to recognise that our competitors have used the present Wheat Board arrangements as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9154"> if they were something that we were accessing to their disadvantage. We are now able to eyeball them and say, `We have set the industry apart from the government guarantee that was once in place in order to meet our WTO obligations'; and they, too, are obliged to reduce the sundry and assorted protection mechanisms and market restriction mechanisms that they have in place that have been to our disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleagues know, and as I suspect the member for Port Adelaide knows, there is no shortage of illustrations of those markets that are now open to us, or at least more available to us than they were, under the arrangements that the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) has entered into and under the arrangements that previous ministers for trade entered into as well. But we are only able to continue to access those markets while we meet our obligations under the WTO, and the legislation currently before us is one step in meeting some of those obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is legislation that has been controversial. It is legislation that has caused some disquiet in Western Australia. Along with every other member, I am conscious of the comments of the member for O'Connor. I have to say, as a South Australian, that the same sense of apprehension has not existed in my state. In fact, I have had very little lobbying from my constituency, which is largely a wheat growing constituency, about these changes. Most of my growers accept the changes as well&hyphen;founded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the concern of Western Australian wheat growers, because they are such large contributors to the Wheat Industry Fund, but in participating in this debate it would be wrong for me not to mention the degree to which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has shown himself prepared not only to listen to but also to heed the concerns of Western Australian growers and, with legislation likely to come in at a later stage, to endeavour to recognise some of the needs they have for further representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view of the Senate inquiry referred to by the member for Corio is very simple. I privately think the purpose of the Senate inquiry was largely mischievous&mdash;it has obviously suited the purposes of the opposition to refer to it&mdash;and the amendment that we currently have to this legislation is equally mischievous. The government is well aware of the concerns of some large wheat growers across the nation, particularly in Western Australia. It is not deaf to them, and it intends to heed them so far as it is able, without disadvantaging other growers and without making the scheme unworkable. For that reason I support the legislation and believe the amendment to be unnecessary.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have to confess, in rising to speak in the Main Committee, that we do not grow very much wheat in Page, being on the north coast of New South Wales. Nevertheless, having been the Minister for Agriculture in the New South Wales government, I have certainly had some involvement with the grains industry across that state. I am well aware of the fact that the Grains Council of Australia has been pushing since 1989 to deregulate the Australian wheat industry in some way and try to make it more modern to compete in the very competitive world that we have just heard about from my good friend the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997  is intended to facilitate the transition of the Australian Wheat Board to a wholly owned subsidiary which will eventually become a corporate body to take over the selling of Australian wheat. I know, and we have heard, that there has been some disagreement and some differences of opinion as to what should be the right structures and how this transition should take place. Having dealt with farmers for quite 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9155"> some time, I can assure members that they are very independent people, they all have opinions, and they certainly put those opinions very forcefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great effort by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, and by Senator Winston Crane, the chairman of the backbench committee. I know Senator Crane has put a lot of work into it. It is a great tribute to those people that we do have a sense of agreement within the industry that this is certainly the right way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention something about the single desk selling because I come from primary industry myself and have quite an involvement in it. There is still a great debate going on as to whether under the competition policy single desk selling is anti&hyphen;competitive. I have some grave concerns about the debate at the present time and the directions that it is taking. I do not disagree with competition and efficiencies. In fact, you have to live with them all the time in industries that are certainly at the mercy of world markets. Australia is at the mercy of world markets because of the fact that we export such huge volumes of our product. In most industries at least 80 per cent of our product is exported to world markets and we are at the mercy of those markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, we should understand the fact that farmers are not in a position to go out there to barter and bargain with their own product. They really do need a single desk arrangement to get the maximum price for the product that they have. That is not easy because, obviously, when you have a single desk arrangement, there are people within the industry who feel disadvantaged, people who feel that they have a superior product, people who feel they are not getting the maximum for that product and, therefore, probably disagree with the idea that there should be single desk arrangements when selling to the world market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came home vividly to me, as Minister for Agriculture for New South Wales in 1994, when I had agreed that the rice industry in New South Wales should have single desk status, and the Japanese went through that terrible typhoon in 1994 where, for the first time, they were going to import rice into Japan. I have to say to you that they were not impressed when they came to Australia and found they had to deal with the Australian Rice Board because they had to pay the price that was commensurate with world market price&mdash;the maximum world market price. They could not barter and play one off against the other. They could not drag people down to the lowest common denominator. They had to pay true value for the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is what is lost and what is forgotten in some of the argument about competition policy. It is not policy that is disadvantaging the consumer; it is policy that is advantaging Australia to get the maximum value for products. But, having said that, when you have a single desk arrangement there is a huge responsibility on that body to make sure that it takes into consideration all the niche markets that might be available around the world to maximise the price of the product. That is where some of the argument about it has come in. People have a niche market and they believe they can get more value for that product. Therefore, the Australian Wheat Board, or the new corporation, must take that into consideration and be flexible enough to allow that to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently had the privilege with the Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs Committee to interview members of the Australian Wheat Board and go through with them very carefully the arrangements that they have in place for the selling of Australian wheat. I think we came away with the opinion that they were across the issues, that they do give licences to independent people who might be accessing some of these smaller markets to maximise the value, and that they are aware of the responsibility that is placed on them 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9156"> because of the single desk arrangement that they enjoy. But, at the end of the day, I believe it is in the interests of the majority, and probably all Australian producers, to see that they are in a very strong position on the world market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States of America has been mentioned in this debate and I think that we should say something about that because we are tied to the World Trade Agreement. The World Trade Agreement is certainly valuable because Australia does need to access markets across the world. It is a valuable agreement as long as people honour that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very disappointed in recent days to see some of the actions of the United States of America. I am in no way surprised because we have seen them do this in the past. They are very aggressive marketers on the world scene; they certainly subsidise in their home production areas; and they use export enhancement programs to market around the world. They cause us extreme pain, in many instances, in these world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because they are a major player, they have a major responsibility to act in a way that is responsible in world markets. It is disappointing, I think, to see some of the actions that they have taken in recent days to inhibit the importation of products into their country. I note that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, has had something to say about that; it does certainly impinge upon the arrangements that we have. We are doing these things in good faith; we in Australia are trying to abide by the World Trade Agreement. We are trying to be good citizens and to have a free and open marketing system. I think it behoves the United States of America to act the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that even though my voice is not going to do much to the United States of America, we do have to speak up around the world about what we see as unfair trading. There is a little bit of suspicion in my mind when we see some of the debate on competition policy, because one of the things that worries me is that the debate is often driven by multinational companies. We must watch carefully whether the value that is being reduced on the producing side of some of these industries is in fact transferred across to the consumer. I watch closely some of those, and I start to question whether that is happening. That is one thing that obviously we, as parliamentarians, should be watching closely, because the philosophy of competition policy is that consumers should get a cheaper product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is not happening, then we have to ask ourselves, `Who is gaining from this policy?' If the answer to that is that it is the intermediaries, the big companies, and the people who have the power to manipulate, then I think we should be looking very carefully at what is happening in that particular area. As I said, that leaves farmers in a very vulnerable position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These arrangements have been mooted for a long time. The industry has certainly worked its way through them. They set up a wheat industry fund to make sure that they had reserves available; the minister is now putting in place this enabling legislation so that the transition can take place; they will have reserves; and the industry itself will have control over its own destiny because of the way the structures are framed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, with the A class shares, only wheat growers will be able to get A class shares and they will elect the majority of the directors; they can keep control. Those shares cannot be transferred. That is very important; we have learnt that lesson in cooperatives in the past. That is a very important part of the whole legislation. As far as I can see, and as far as I have heard from producers generally, there is an acceptance that this is the right way to go and that there are great benefits in it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9157">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the debate continues, and if people are still dissatisfied with this single desk arrangement, my only suggestion would be for a dual desk arrangement and no further. A dual desk arrangement would in fact put competition into the marketplace. It could be a private competitor competing against the statutory company that we have at present or the corporate entity that is being formed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are some concerns about competition, it would inject competition into the marketplace as far as the buying of grains from individual producers is concerned. I think that most of the dissatisfaction is probably in the barley industry, not so much in the wheat industry. I know that there is quite a bit of dissatisfaction in the barley industry about the maximising of values in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before, if there is total deregulation and if the individual growers have the responsibility to go out and market their product, they neither have the time nor the expertise to do that. If that were the case, I am sure that the big companies involved in the buying of grains across Australia would rub their hands in delight because they could then play one against the other, and they would certainly bring prices down to the lowest common denominator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all I want to say about this bill. I congratulate the minister again. I do not believe that the amendment would add anything to this legislation. I believe this is the right way to go. Obviously, as the years progress, there will be more legislation following to ensure that the transition takes place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to speak on the motion to take note of the summary report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> . I am pleased to note that I will be followed by my friend and colleague the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), who is the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report, a very small but very dynamic report, flowed from a very successful one&hyphen;day seminar held in the House earlier this year. Experts in the field were able to paint a very accurate and very clinical picture of the trends in youth suicide: methods chosen by males and females; the differences in the success rates between males and females; the suicide rate&mdash;capital city, major urban, major rural, remote towns; hospital separation rates and death rates. It is all very clinical and all very statistical. The information is there for us members to use as we seek to compare our Australian figures with those from other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second half of the seminar revolved around the support services provided by a broad spectrum of non&hyphen;government organisations and was a general, broad ranging and very informative discussion on this very important issue. To my mind this was the key part of the one&hyphen;day seminar.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9158">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we find? Firstly, Australia has an absolutely appalling record. We are at the wrong end of the spectrum. Australia, the so&hyphen;called `lucky country', has a depressing, almost Jekyll and Hyde psyche when it comes to the issue of youth suicide. Evidence was given at the seminar about the complexities of youth suicide. We were asked: do we bring the topic out in the open? By taking this issue out into the light, do we encourage our at&hyphen;risk youth to attempt to solve their seemingly insurmountable problems by taking their lives? Will vulnerable friends of a suicide victim copycat the successful suicide if we focus on trying to work through the reasons why the young person took his or her life? As it states in the report on page 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major part of building effective suicide prevention programmes is recognising the major factors that affect young suicidal people. This will always be a difficult task, as the factors are myriad and complex and not always obvious to those close to a suicidal young person.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That statement is the crux of the whole issue. It worries me and I often ask: why have we got to the stage where our young teenagers find it so difficult to share their feelings and inner fears with their parents, siblings, close friends, teachers or church leaders? Why are so many parents and extended families left wondering after the tragic death of their son or daughter, `Why did they do it'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just parents, extended family or the deceased peers who wonder why. The teachers who have charge of these young people for probably one&hyphen;third of every day of their lives are also left wondering why they have not been able to pick up the signs and perhaps been able to intervene to provide the necessary counselling which might have prevented the tragedy from occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the seminar, we were informed that there are some significant sociological factors that bear on the possibility of young people attempting suicide. As I read through these, I would ask the people to remember some of the things that have been mentioned in the papers recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These significant factors are: firstly, a high divorce rate in the country; secondly, a high youth unemployment rate; thirdly, high female employment; fourthly, extremely high alcohol consumption; fifthly, a high number of unwanted pregnancies and, interestingly, sixthly, low church and religious participation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is important to note that these factors are not of themselves the cause of youth suicide, but they are present in countries like Australia, which, as I mentioned, is at the higher and tragic end of youth suicide statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar was told that events which can trigger thoughts of suicide and potential suicidal behaviour are: the death of a family member or a close friend; divorce in the family or some other major family upheaval; the break&hyphen;up of a relationship with a boyfriend or a girlfriend; excessive use of alcohol or some other drugs; physical or emotional loneliness; confusion over sexuality, or rejection because of sexuality. And the last one was the issue of contagion: school friends or peers committing suicide; heroes committing suicide, and media reports of other suicides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the cold facts. The thing that concerns me most is the human dimension of youth suicide that faces our nation. I am sure that all of us in this place can recount stories of young people in our electorate who have chosen to try and end their lives&mdash;and so many have succeeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I returned to my electorate last week, a constituent of mine, a good friend, related the story to me that at the weekend her friend came home unexpectedly and, as it turned out, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9159"> just at the right time. What did she find? She found her teenage son hanging from the ceiling. Because of her unexpected arrival, she happened to be there at the right time. She cut him down and was able to revive him and then take him for medical assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments of both political persuasions over the years have allocated considerable resources to try and tackle this problem. The Keating government allocated $13 million for the years 1995 to 1999 for the very successful here for life programs. The Howard government has provided an additional $19 million under what they call the national youth suicide strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between them, these two programs have set up a series of services to attempt to address the issue of youth suicide&mdash;services such as follow&hyphen;up for young people presenting to hospitals and health services following self&hyphen;harm, and support for GPs and health workers to identify, treat and refer young people at risk of suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note on page 6 of the report that a survey was done by the Jesuit Social Services, and they found a very mixed result amongst hospitals, both in the Catholic and public systems. And it is amazing to me to read that some hospitals have minimal psychiatric and/or psychological care, and have actually discharged suicidal patients with no counselling or follow&hyphen;up. That absolutely amazes me. If you had someone, for example, with a rifle involved in some situation of violence there would be immediate reaction and counselling and following up. But because a young person presents at a hospital with slashed wrists or a drug overdose, it is a matter of treat, discharge and you are on your own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other hospitals have an established process when dealing with young suicidal people, including mental health assessments and appointments with youth workers and their GP. It makes sense. But why have we got this dichotomy between almost total rejection on the one hand and on the other a considered, socially responsible approach to these young people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our report we made three recommendations which, to me, are pivotal to the government's response. Hopefully, once implemented by this government, and supported wholeheartedly by the community, they will result in Australia finally and successfully addressing this horrendous issue. We did something similar with the horrendous road toll in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s&mdash;and look how successful we have been since we adopted a national approach to the road toll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Priority 1, as we saw it, was to establish a national advisory council to provide strategic advice to the minister and the government on youth suicide prevention and related matters. The council should be responsible for creating appropriate arrangements for consultation and cooperation between governments and the community at state and territory as well as at federal levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Priority 2 states that a research advisory committee should be established to complement the work of the national advisory council on youth suicide prevention. The research committee will be responsible for advising the National Health and Medical Research Council on the management of research projects and research grants, and ensure consistency with national research priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Priority 3 to me is the key to getting an immediate response. It recommends, firstly, the setting up a depression awareness campaign to educate young people and their support networks on how to recognise depression and get help. That is the key&mdash;recognising and treating. Secondly, it recommends standard procedures for hospitals to adopt when treating a young person presenting with attempted suicide or self&hyphen;harm injuries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9160">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly&mdash;and it has continued to amaze me since I have been a member of this House that we have not done this&mdash;it recommends ensuring consistency in data collection at all levels of government. I am absolutely amazed that this just does not happen as a matter of course. When you ask states, it is a mish&hyphen;mash. Finally, priority 3 recommends an immediate review of current funding, and redirection of some funds to more appropriate and better targeted programs. There are some excellent programs out there, but they do not have enough in the way of resources, despite the $32 million. Some programs are not working and need to be wiped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to bipartisan support for our recommendations and hope that our three priorities are implemented by the end of this year. Unless we do, daily we will be hearing stories in our electorate offices of young people, in the prime of their life, taking their lives because of what, to them, are seemingly insurmountable problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that my friend the chair of the committee, the member for Mallee, who is sitting opposite and is going to speak after me, will be dealing with the problems faced by young people in the rural areas. It is bad enough in the big cities. Once you get out into the small country towns, there are very few services and there are cutbacks by state governments of all persuasions in hospital and community services. If the services are not there on the ground, it is ridiculous to expect a young person, who probably is not of driving age, to access a service in a country town 60 or 70 kilometres away. They need the service in their country town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the government responding as quickly as possible. Hopefully, by the end of this year we can have those three priorities from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> adopted and we can say to our young people, `We are going to do something for you.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue of youth suicide involves us all. I would say, from listening to previous speakers and looking at the long speaking list, that there would not be a member in this House who has not been involved, either as a family member, relative, associate, good friend or parent, with this tragedy of suicide. I am really pleased to be following the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) on the speaker list and I am going to refer to the member for Franklin and me in terms of what is a key element in resolving this difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Franklin and I enjoy a good relationship. Somehow we have been able to find a way to bridge the dreadful political void that we often see and experience in the chamber. There are a couple of reasons for that. The mother of the member for Franklin lives in Nhill in my electorate and she reminds me very much of my own mum. Whenever I am going through I always like to drop in and have a cup of tea with her. She is always full of good advice. That is one reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason is that I am now elevated to the lofty status of chairing the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs which was responsible, under the previous chairmanship of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), for conducting a seminar earlier in the year and producing the report which we are commenting on here again today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Attending that seminar and in the discussions we have had since, we are reminded again of the tragedy that families experience, having to go through self&hyphen;doubt and questioning. Parents of young people especially go through the dreadful self&hyphen;doubt of `What did I do wrong? It must be my fault,' when very much of what occurs is a mismatch of a society that I think has lost its way a bit. I know the report speaks about every age group and in every age group the issue is awful. But my heart is with the youngsters. These are future Australians 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9161"> who somehow have lost themselves and have sought to end it all as the only option, when really, with the opportunity we have, they should be positive about their future. They should have facilities in their own sense of self&hyphen;security to deal with life's difficulties. Nobody wants to pretend that life is not going to be difficult and that there are not going to be crises to confront. For example, there is going to be the first time the most precious gem in your life rejects you at the age of 16 and wants to go out with somebody else. We need somehow to find a way to undergird our youngsters and warn them that this is going to happen and that dealing with rejection is something you need to develop strategies for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that alarms me is having been close to where a young man committed suicide&mdash;only 30 metres from where I slept across the street; we were neighbours. People said they did not see it coming. I think that the clue to resolving all of this is to have some obvious triggers learned by people across the community because we are all going to be part of this. I support the member for Franklin's plea for complete non&hyphen;partisanship in respect of this. I really appreciate the very positive way in which members have spoken already and their response to what our committee has put on paper and tabled in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make reference to my own 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter who last Saturday night brought home a friend of hers from school. They have developed into really good friends. I had had a busy week in parliament; if you remember what happened last week, all I wanted was a nice quiet night at home to relax and have an early night. But she was concerned about this friend who has already made three attempts to commit suicide. In a sort of desperate plea I said, `Honey, I don't need this.' But we put the time in. We made an investment. Her attitude was, `Dad, I just want to love this person. I love this person and I want you to help me help her.' If we can find a way to trigger that kind of caring concern amongst the school community and amongst the adult community, then I think we will all have achieved a great deal towards addressing the tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar provided a real focus for the preparation of the report. I do not want to focus as much as the member for Franklin has done on the alarming nature of the statistics that are presented there but we have to accept the fact that in the last 30 years the suicide rate for males has trebled and the suicide rate for females has doubled. I do not want to make that the focus, I want to make the solutions the focus. Our report very clearly, with a priority one rating, recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That a National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide Prevention be established to provide strategic advice to the Minister and the Government on youth suicide prevention and related matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That will involve the whole community. I hope that the examples given by the member for Franklin and me might provide some lead. There have been in excess of 25 suicides in my electorate in the four years I have been the federal representative. My observation is that there has to be a caring, concerned group of people who have some insight into the body language and the emotional state that causes somebody to take this step. Those troubled people have to be embraced in a caring community, a caring environment, and they have to feel wanted and needed. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not complicated. It is not about spending millions of dollars on research and psychoanalysis; it is simply about ensuring that people feel that they are needed and that somebody cares about them. If they have an emotional crisis, whether it be the tragedy of losing someone they have loved, or the tragedy of being rejected by their first girlfriend, they need assistance. We have all experienced the latter. In fact, in my time I have had quite a few.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9162">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One needs some strategies to deal with that because rejection is something that human beings have a great deal of difficulty in coping with. The only mechanism to cope with it is if people have a sense of wellbeing about themselves, that they have a regard for themselves as being a person of worth, and that involves a view that can only come from inside a person, almost like their soul, so that they feel good about themselves. Even though somebody else might reject them, they know in here that they are of some worth. It is very much a relationship environment that reinforces that for people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw it happening in my own home last weekend and I can only hope that I can play some part in the bigger picture to extend that very simple example from my own lounge room to the parliament, that we find the key.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In trying to deal with 25&hyphen;plus suicides, I have found that it affects everybody in my office. In fact, I have said to my staff, `Do not take any chances if you get a distressed phone call.' On one occasion I jumped in my car and drove 200 kilometres to be there within a few hours, and I am glad I did. It was somebody who was feeling desperate, but all they needed was somebody to take action to share this terrible burden that they had. It turned out to be caused by a government department putting them under enormous pressure, and it was ultimately resolved. We now have a very happy family there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will involve us all. I am very pleased to hear the comments of members in this debate. This report has been on the table now for quite a considerable time. It gives us cause to reflect and see what other members are saying. I am very pleased to support the remarks of the deputy chairman, the member for Franklin, and I am looking forward to a very positive response from the government. I urge it to consider the recommendations in the committee's report, adopt them, and proceed from there.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to paint a similar picture to that that the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) so lucidly and compassionately portrayed to the House. He shares the view I have that basically, whilst many solutions may be put forward to address the issue of suicide per se&mdash;both youth suicide and suicide by older persons&mdash;people have a strong desire to feel needed, to feel that they are loved, and to feel that they have some worth and role in life. If that can be addressed by greater one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one counselling, of the kind that occurs in sections of my electorate of Isaacs, primarily through the work of people like Andrew Humphreys, then I am sure that we will, as the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) has said, in adopting a national approach be able to gradually address this most tragic issue that blights our modern society. In fact, not only does it blight our society but in many ways it is perhaps one of the most difficult to tackle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Mallee submitted to the chamber an analysis of statistics that deals with the topic that is both alarming and confronting. From a local perspective, the figures are indeed quite shocking. They are particularly concerning in the south&hyphen;eastern coastal regions of Melbourne. Let me relate to the Committee figures for the Mornington Peninsula. The rate of suicide is more than twice the state yearly average amongst men. There are some 24.9 per 100,000 male suicides in this region each year, while the average for the rest of Victoria is some 11.2 deaths per 100,000. The picture in the Frankston area is equally as bleak. The number of men taking their own lives annually is 16.6 per 100,000&mdash;again, a figure that is well above the state average for the rest of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Cranbourne, where my electoral office is located, as at the end of July this year, nine young people under the age of 25 had committed suicide. This figure is triple the number of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9163"> deaths that occurred in Cranbourne in the previous three years. The city of Kingston is a municipality that covers much of the federal electorates of Hotham and Isaacs. Suicide claimed the lives of 67 young people in the city of Kingston in 1995, which is up from 45 in the previous year, 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the picture on a local perspective is quite bleak, the story is similar at an international level. When recently reading the Victorian task force report on suicide prevention, I was most unsettled to learn that it is estimated that in recent years nearly one million people on this planet take their own lives each year. Suicide has consistently remained one of the top 10 causes of death in developed countries in recent history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I applaud every aspect of the findings of this most worthy report, I disagree to some extent with the focus on the issue of youth suicide. The biggest group of people committing suicide in society is men aged 25 to 60. Without in any way demeaning the problem of youth suicide, it is clear that, from any objective analysis of the data, the risk to young men does not really commence until they reach the age of 19. I have referred to Mr Andrew Humphreys. Andrew is a youth crisis counsellor at the Chelsea Community and Information Support Centre and has been at the forefront locally of tackling the prickly issue of the high male suicide rate. Andrew points out that, while seven per cent of suicides are teenagers&mdash;and this is not an insignificant component&mdash;the biggest proportion of deaths does, however, fall in the category of men aged 25 to 60.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An interesting point that Mr Humphreys makes is that the suicide rate for boys when they leave school accelerates, because that is the last time that they enjoy any form of day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day social interaction and day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day social support from friends or peer groups on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the extensive research that has taken place over the last five years, as this problem has been brought out into the open, it becomes apparent that, again as succinctly submitted by the member for Mallee, men kill themselves due to an inability to cope with life events such as relationship break&hyphen;ups of the kind that both he and myself have suffered, and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the topic of marriage or relationship break&hyphen;ups, Mr Pierre Baume, head of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention, is on the public record as saying that in a study of some 4,000 male suicides over 70 per cent were caused by relationship break&hyphen;ups and men's subsequent inability to come to terms with the situation. Again as submitted by the member for Mallee, that is a time when men most feel alone, most feel unloved, and most feel that they have got no place in this world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, another major cause of suicide is unemployment. An Australian Institute of Criminology research paper into the causes of suicide has shown that a correlation exists between suicide rates and periods of economic turmoil. For instance, during the Great Depression Australia had extremely high male suicide rates. Another example of the effect of economic insecurity affecting the incidence of suicide was the 1987 stock market crash. In the six months after this event, suicide rates were up by 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other factors include separation from children, childhood trauma and learning disabilities. But as a rule, it is men who cannot talk about their problems, and there are too few services available to them&mdash;especially, as the members for Franklin and Mallee have outlined, in Australia's rural and regional areas. Men are often turned away by the all too few support agencies that are there to help, because those services are burdened with other cases.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9164">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The discrepancy between male and female suicide rates has increased during the last 30 years and, as those two members have previously indicated, this difference is greatest in rural areas. The overall ratio between males and female suicides is four to one, and the youth ratio is five to one. Men in particular have nowhere to go. Access to counselling services which have a specific focus on combating the propensity for male suicide is sadly lacking, and this needs to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way social supports have been dramatically improved over the last 20 years for battered women provides a good blueprint for what needs to be done. We must tailor our community support services to tackle specific problems, rather than trying a sweeping, broad brush, generalised approach, which will inevitably mean that many seeking help will feel alienated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some quite urgent changes do need to be made if we are to cut the number of self&hyphen;induced deaths in our society, especially amongst the most vulnerable in our society, those being males. We must extend counselling services within our community to target groups that are not being serviced, and I suggest that that is primarily men in the 25 to 60 age bracket. As an extension of this, it is important that we up&hyphen;skill social workers in appropriate assessment and counselling techniques, which have been so sadly lacking in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must be greater education for both doctors and health service providers within the community about the risk factors which can lead to suicide amongst older men. As the member for Mallee has said, this does not mean that we embark on huge psychoanalytical research papers as to why these things happen. That is not needed. Doctors need to be trained in skilling themselves as to why these events occur, based on people's lack of self&hyphen;worth at the times at which they are most likely to take their own lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among the lesser known statistics about suicide in Australia are the high levels committed amongst older men between the ages of 65 and 69. In 1995, there were 15.2 deaths per 100,000 people for men and 3.27 deaths per 100,000 people for women. It is important that, as an institution, parliament should take a closer look at the hidden categories of suicide in Australia. The fact is that until we, as a society, are open and informed about suicide in the most vulnerable of categories&mdash;again amongst older males&mdash;the pattern of death will no doubt continue unabated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A positive aspect to the debate about youth suicide is that we are probably much more capable of tackling this tragedy on a national basis, as the member for Franklin has quite rightly submitted, now that the problem is out in the open and that people are rightfully aware of it. It is to be hoped that in this country such an enlightened approach can now be extended to other forms of suicide which are perhaps less readily acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is perhaps a little too early for extensive statistical evidence to be processed, the anecdotal evidence that I have received from people in my electorate is that the increasing focus on gambling in Melbourne has led to financial problems in many families. Sometimes the tragic consequences of these strains has resulted in suicide. Figures released by the coroner's office reveal that the number of gambling related suicides has steadily increased since 1992. It is of concern to me that, while over $1 billion is flowing into the state government coffers in Victoria from gambling revenue each year, only about $40 million has been spent on problems with gambling services over the last five years. If we are to tackle the incidence of suicide in society, the issue of problem gambling must be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud and welcome with open arms the fine efforts of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and its summary report on aspects 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9165"> of youth suicide. I am hopeful that the positive work done by the committee in formalising this report will act as a catalyst for more research into the various other aspects of suicide which, to date, have not been given the amount of attention that I would suggest they so rightfully deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some factors which lead to suicide are quite hard to quantify, there is certainly a need for our community to work towards an environment in which people feel a sense of belonging and meaning, as the member for Mallee has hit upon so accurately. If we can achieve such a state, then the incidence of all suicides&mdash;young or old, male or female&mdash;will no doubt be reduced.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it is very hard to create a sense of belonging for people that transcends individual needs and material things in a society which is increasingly obsessed with individual self&hyphen;advancement and the attainment of material goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just conclude by stating that, if we can tackle some of the fundamental problems in society, such as the quality of education, unemployment and job security, then there will no doubt be a flow&hyphen;on to reduced family breakdowns and, by extrapolation, fewer suicides. Unless we as a society can tackle the fundamental problems and causes of angst in a way that the member for Mallee has suggested, then all the programs in this world and all the heartfelt words of compassion from politicians like the member for Franklin and the member for Mallee will indeed not change a thing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the seminar that was held here earlier this year, which I attended representing the Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge). The symptoms of depression have been recognised since antiquity. The Old Testament describes King Saul suffering from a depressive illness and Homer's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iliad</EMPHASIS>  gives us the story of Ajax's suicide. Hippocrates actually used the terms `mania' and `melancholia' to describe mental disturbances and other Roman physicians like Celsus and Galen also discovered melancholia. In fact, some of Durer's woodcuts dealt specifically with the subject of melancholia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Closer to home, in Australia, those who are familiar with Michael Leunig's excellent cartoons will have seen often that a lot of them actually depict depression. He will often have one of his characters in a small, dark room with a tiny window with just a little bit of light coming in. About five years ago, I heard Michael Leunig speak at the art gallery in South Australia. He talked then, amongst other things, about youth suicide and about how, particularly in Perth, there had been a cluster of suicides that had occurred at one of the private schools there. He described his own suffering that he had had with depression and how it had translated into his work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has often been noted that Australia has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the world, and it is truly a tragedy that suicide occurs as commonly amongst 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds as does death resulting from motor vehicle accidents. Thirty years ago, no&hyphen;one would have ever believed that the number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents would be almost the same as that from youth suicides. What has happened is that a very efficient public health strategy&mdash;through changing people's behaviour with the wearing of seat belts, with random breath testing and with checking people's speeds&mdash;has led to a change in behaviour and a rapid decline in the number of 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who die in motor vehicle accidents. Unfortunately, we have also seen a two to three times increase, since 1970, in the number of young males who are killing themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9166">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as suicide attempts go, there are almost equal numbers between male and female, but the attempts by young males are often more successful; something like nine times as many young males will actually successfully complete suicide as opposed to females. For every successful suicide attempt, there is something like 40 to 100 unsuccessful bids. What is particularly significant about that is that the No. 1 predictive factor&mdash;more than any other factor&mdash;of whether someone will actually commit suicide is a previous suicide attempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do we lead the OECD in youth suicide rates, and why is it particularly high in rural and regional areas amongst our indigenous population? The reasons people attempt or commit suicide are unavoidably complex. While certain sociological influences and mental health background are factors, often the family and friends of the people who commit suicide just cannot recognise what the catalyst was that caused their friends to take their own life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the speakers in the seminar highlighted, mental health problems and sociological factors can combine to induce a severe state of depression which, if undetected and untreated, may result in suicidal behaviour. One of the real tragedies of youth suicide is that this depression is completely treatable. The real tragedy is that often the depressive symptoms are not detected and not treated. The cost that that imposes on us as a society is that we are losing part of a cohort of Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professors Cosky and Goldney, in a 1994 study, found that 90 per cent of people who actually committed suicide had evidence of psychiatric illness beforehand. One of the advances that I think we could see in public health would be people being able to recognise the symptoms of depression in their family members, and friends recognising symptoms of depression. Often it is very hard, especially amongst adolescents, to know what is normal adolescent behaviour and what is actually depressive behaviour. Amongst adolescents, depressive illness can be manifest in things like poor academic performance. It can be manifest in drug abuse, antisocial behaviour, sexual promiscuity, truancy and running away. They are all some of the symptoms of depression amongst adolescent children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A mnemonic to remember the symptoms and signs of depression which I was taught at medical school was `in sad cages'. That was a very useful way of remembering how people manifest with depression: `i' was for a loss of interest; `s' was for suicidal ideation; `a' was for appetite&mdash;they often have disordered appetite or complete loss of appetite; `d' was for depression; `c' was for lack of concentration; `a' was for affect&mdash;their whole mood was blunted; `g' was for feelings of guilt; `e' was for energy; and `s' was for suicidal ideation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the greatest advances in the area of mental health will be when people recognise it, just as people recognise that when they have chest pain it is a good idea to get to a hospital as soon as possible or that if they are passing too much urine they may have diabetes. It would be useful if people realised that, if their appetite and sleep are disordered or if adolescents are particularly antisocial&mdash;perhaps more than normal&mdash;it may be something that is treatable without any sort of stigma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Countries with high youth suicide rates&mdash;and the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) touched on this&mdash;have exhibited sociological factors such as high divorce rates, high youth unemployment, excessive alcohol consumption and low religious participation levels. Perhaps all of those could categorise Australia. They also apply to New Zealand, Canada and northern Europe. What we actually need in Australia is a coordinated program which includes things like primary prevention activities. They are just activities focusing on having a healthy school 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9167"> environment and on having strong families that actually encourage and nurture the individuals within them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area is media strategy. One of the problems with the reporting of suicides in the media is that it has been shown in research that it leads to an increase in suicide rates, especially if there are reports of, say, the hopelessness of people who commit suicide or the method used for the suicide. What is actually needed is for the media to focus on how treatable the depressive and sociological factors can be and also how these people can get help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other programs could involve: restricting access to the methods, such as firearms, particularly common in rural areas; school based programs; targeted intervention for high risk individuals&mdash;those individuals who are already displaying symptoms of mental illness and those individuals who have already actually attempted suicide&mdash;and professional training for all health professionals, including medical practitioners, so that they are able to recognise who is at risk from suicide and who needs follow&hyphen;up after an episode of self&hyphen;injury or suicidal behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, personal events which may appear insignificant to the outside world can often have a huge impact on young people and can trigger suicidal thoughts or behaviour. Those personal factors can include: the loss or death of a family member or friend; major family upheavals such as divorce or remarriage; relationship break&hyphen;ups with boyfriends or girlfriends; isolation from other people both physically&mdash;a problem in rural and remote areas&mdash;and emotionally, such as having few friends or low social skills; excessive use of alcohol or other drugs; confusion over sexuality or rejection because of sexuality; and contagion&mdash;that is the idea of media contagion where you are surrounded by either friends who suicide or rock band heroes such as Kurt Cobain of Nirvana or media images of people who have committed suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that copycat suicide is not a new phenomenon. Two hundred years ago, Goethe wrote a book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Sorrows of Young Werther</EMPHASIS>, which was about a young German hero who did commit suicide. That book was banned in several European countries after young men across Europe were killing themselves either dressed in the manner of Young Werther or with the page in the book open at the part where he killed himself. What is modern, however, is the concern that is shared by counsellors, youth workers and researchers alike, that suicide is becoming a more acceptable problem solving option in our society, a notion which is reinforced by media coverage and television and film dramatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the seminar, Associate Professor Pierre Baume pointed out the large amount of information on the Internet on how to commit suicide. There is not much we can do about actually controlling the information which is on the Internet, but it is important that that negative information on the Internet must be also counteracted by positive information about the early intervention or treatment of depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One project which was just recently launched at Flinders University in my electorate of Boothby deals with the early identification and treatment of mental health problems in children and young people, and that project will be jointly managed by Dr Graham Martin of Flinders University and Professor Bob Cosky of the University of Adelaide, who was one of the participants in the seminar. Funded under both the national mental health strategy and the national youth suicide prevention strategy, AusEInet II will establish a national communications network to provide information to services, researchers and policy makers in this area. It will also develop best practice models of early intervention for the mental health of children 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9168"> and young people. Divided into three streams, AusEInet will focus on research, reorientation and relevance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having spoken with both Dr Martin and Professor Cosky, I am confident that a network will be established which will have national coverage to make sure that as many people as possible working in this area will have access to the information. Particularly encouraging is that the outcomes of the national youth suicide prevention strategy projects will also be disseminated through a clearing house set up under AusEInet II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth suicide is an ongoing tragedy in Australian society. I commend the organisers for the aspects of youth suicide seminar for addressing this problem and granting it the urgency and importance that it deserves.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 1.30 p.m. last Thursday a funeral was held at Cessnock's John's Anglican Church for 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Jason Bambach. Jason had taken his life the Saturday night before. As is usually the case, Jason appeared to have the world at his feet and appeared happy. He was a gifted footballer who, I am advised, had been approached by the Newcastle Knights. Typically, what went wrong in Jason's mind will probably remain a mystery. My sympathy goes to Cessnock's Jack and Kay Bambach and their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jason Bambach is likely to be just one of more than 400 15&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who will commit suicide in Australia this year. Many more of course will fail in their attempt. Most of those 400 or more have been, or will be, on a proportional basis, from rural and regional Australia&mdash;just like Cessnock's Jason Bambach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are now three times more young males committing suicide in Australia than was the case in the 1960s. For young females the number has roughly doubled. One of the great mysteries for me is why the suicide rate in Australia appears higher than compared with other developed nations. What does not surprise me is that so many suicides occur in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth spends more than $30 million annually on youth suicide prevention. Much of that money goes to the national youth suicide strategy, which has allocated some $6 million over three years for rural and regional youth counselling services; $6 million to Lifeline and the Kids Help Line; some $3 million for parental programs developed by the Department of Health and Family Services; some $2 million for the education and training of professionals, such as doctors and other health workers, and school teachers; and $1 million over three years for child mental health research, which is designed to at least attempt to determine the factors that lead to suicide amongst our youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But while I commend the commitment of both sides of parliament, both the present government and the former Labor government, to the funding of these programs, in a sense&mdash;and I do not say this disparagingly&mdash;all but the last of the allocations I mentioned is somewhat reactive in its nature. They are commendable, appropriate and essential, but they are somewhat reactive. We will only begin to make ground against this terrible social ill when we get on top of the larger economic issues in this nation. Chief amongst those is unemployment and economic decline in rural and regional Australia, which, in large part, indicates why youth suicide is higher in rural and regional Australia than is the case in our metropolitan areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in rural and regional Australia are continually told that trade liberalisation, competition policy, financial deregulation and privatisation are all good for them. If that is true, and if it is true that all of those reforms lead to higher or faster economic growth, those living in rural and regional Australia are entitled to ask: where is our dividend? Where is the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9169"> additional commitment to infrastructure projects which create jobs in rural and regional Australia? Where are the greater transport and telecommunications links? These are communities which are dying. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I know that in your own area, in Coffs Harbour and surrounding areas, the unemployment rate is very high, as is the case in the lower part of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These communities are experiencing what the experts describe as dynamic decline. It is a vicious circle, usually precipitated by the withdrawal of a reasonably large industry in the town or, indeed, the withdrawal of a government department or the withdrawal of a bank. The withdrawal leads to job losses. Family incomes decline as a result. Consumer spending falls. Other businesses in turn close and further jobs go. Those who can afford to, or who have the ability to, exit the town. Those who are aged or infirm, or who do not have any job prospects in metropolitan Australia, in the cities, remain. The largest industry in the community becomes the local social security office&mdash;and even they are now going as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> is a good report, one that I am sure will go a long way to addressing this terrible social problem. I congratulate the committee on the establishment of the forum held in February. I enjoyed reading the report which came from it. But a comfortable society is a working society, and a greater commitment to jobs by government in this country must come now. It is now not just desirable; it is essential.</PARA></SPEECH>

What we seem to do is to talk about what the problem is and then very often seek to rationalise it or put bandaids on it, rather than getting to the fundamental causes of the problem and doing something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect&mdash;and I am not trying to be unkind, because I really do believe this is a valuable contribution&mdash;that already we have seen a reaction to this report and to the problem that again seems to me to some extent to be not getting to the fundamental causes of the problem. We have a national youth suicide prevention program in place which will result in the expenditure of a large amount of money. It seems as though the reaction to a problem often is to spend a lot of money on it, and the more money you put into it somehow that is a greater recognition of the extent of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution to some of these problems is money. The solution to many problems is resources, and that certainly has been the reaction to this problem, with a strategy that allocates millions of dollars to rural and regional youth counselling services, millions of dollars to Lifeline and Kids Help Line, millions of dollars to programs for parents, millions of dollars for a youth suicide prevention and education and training program and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not condemning that expenditure of money, and it may be helpful. I am sure it could be demonstrated that those things are going to be helpful, but the point is that this report very clearly identifies the causes of the problem. I think Associate Professor Baume's contribution was a very worthwhile one. I know him and I believe the work that he does in this particular 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9170"> area, particularly his desire to establish a national approach to the collection of data, is very worth while. He identifies in his contribution the causes of the problem, and these are they: a high divorce rate, high youth unemployment, high female employment&mdash;that is interesting and I will deal with each of these in turn&mdash;extremely high alcohol consumption, a high number of unwanted pregnancies and low church or religious participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first problem that Professor Baume identifies is a high divorce rate. I just want to note that. An article came across my desk yesterday which summarises the extent of that problem as well as any other document. The number of divorces in Australia has quadrupled over the past 20 years. Last year, Australia had the highest divorce rate since no&hyphen;fault divorce laws were introduced in 1976. We have also recorded the lowest number of marriages per capita this century. Last year, Australia had the third highest divorce rate in the world, 2.9 per 1,000 people, just behind America with 4.6 and the United Kingdom with 3.0. If we accept&mdash;Professor Baume makes the point and I think the report reinforces it&mdash;that there is a correlation between youth suicide rates and divorce rates, then part of the answer to the problem obviously is to look at the problem of divorce in Australia because it is such a big problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at what we are doing about that, one wonders whether our response to that problem is strong enough. At the moment we are talking about making some changes to the Child Support Agency. They are long overdue for those who have been dealing with that particular bureaucracy for a long time. But, again, in a sense they are not the solution to the problem. The Child Support Agency's problems are a product of the high divorce rate in Australia. Even with the wisdom of Solomon, it has become evident to those who have confronted this problem over the years that it is almost insoluble. Ironically, it was Solomon who demonstrated his wisdom, as I recall the story, in the first place by dealing with a custody problem&mdash;and his solution was to cut the child in half. Of course, that in a sense solved the problem. I will not go into the story because there is probably not the time here this morning for bible stories. But it is instructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a problem with divorce, which then leads to our problem with the Child Support Agency bureaucracy. If we did not have the huge divorce problem then we would not have as many problems as we have in picking up the pieces. The problems associated with the level of divorce in Australia can be solved, and that is where our emphasis ought to be. I am not going to speak at great length about that today. It is something I have spoken about quite a bit in the past, but we have to look at the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, since the no-fault divorce law was introduced in 1976, we have had this huge escalation, this quadrupling, in the amount of divorce. I am not going to argue here, and nor have I argued in the past, that we wind back the clock to pre&hyphen;1976, but we have to recognise that since 1976 we have got this problem. We are dealing with that particular fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has occurred largely because we have made divorce too easy. I recall Archbishop Hollingworth in Brisbane being asked once what he would do about the problem, and his response, when he thought about it for a moment, was very good. He said that he would make marriage more difficult to get into and more difficult to get out of. That is part of the solution to divorce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lest colleagues opposite, or even on my side, start getting excited, as some of them do, and particularly some of our female colleagues who are of that bent, and say, `What you want to do is get more women chained to the kitchen sink and be subservient to their husbands', and all that sort of garbage that we hear trotted out when you make these sorts of suggestions, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9171"> fact is that it is too easy for people in the current situation to simply walk away from a contract that is entered into solemnly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No other contracts can be walked away from so easily. We enter into commercial contracts that have sanctions attached, and important as they might be, they are not as important as a life contract that involves the care and nurture of children, in most cases. Despite that, people can suddenly decide today, `I'm tired of this relationship; I want to find the new me; I want to experience new horizons', and so out the door they go. The CSA is knocking on the door the next day and, of course, it is all downhill from there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a connection between high divorce rates, as Professor Baume points out, and the high rate of youth suicide. When we understand that fact and look at all the counselling services, all the millions of dollars that we are expending on worthwhile things, as they might appear to be, we will come to understand that money will not solve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to get to the core of the problem in our country and realise that marriage as an institution needs to be revitalised and that we need to re&hyphen;establish the importance of it as a fundamental relationship. We need to stress the importance of families, which is something I speak about in this place quite often, as the fundamental unit in our society. We need to start supporting marriage and placing value on it and making it more difficult for people to walk away from without sanction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the underlying thing. You talk about a contract. This is a relationship you can walk away from without any sanctions. It is not a question of who has caused the problem. I am not arguing that we go back to the days before no-fault divorce law, but I am talking about people accepting responsibility for their actions. In this particular case there is no responsibility accepted for people's actions. There can be a lot done to reduce the rate of divorce in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often observed that we also make it very easy for people to get married. I suppose the law reinforces the view that `We will give it a go. If it does not work, then under the law we can just walk away,' which is no way to enter into such a solemn and important and fundamental contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why there is the need to make sure people understand, through the benefit of pre&hyphen;marital counselling and other such opportunities, the importance of what they are doing. I will make a point that I have made before: just look at how much money we spend picking up the pieces after divorce. We spend billions of dollars, one way or another, picking up the pieces after a divorce, whereas we spend so little at the front end, on educating people to understand what the nature of marriage is and providing them with ongoing help and counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get serious about fixing divorce and then we will be addressing one of the fundamental causes of youth suicide. There is no doubt that children suffer from divorce. The trendy view in recent years has been that a good divorce is better than a bad marriage, that kids are okay and that it is a bit like influenza: they will cough and splutter for a few days and then get on with their lives. But the fact is that they do not. Kids suffer from divorce. They suffer not just for a short period of time: the evidence I have seen indicates that they suffer for the rest of their lives. Their children are also likely to suffer because of the impact the divorce has had on their parents. It goes through a number of generations. Kids are hurt by divorce, and ultimately that is what will lead, in some cases, to kids becoming so desperate that they will want to end their agony by unfortunately taking their own lives.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9172">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought this particular report was useful because it reinforces our understanding of the connection between divorce and youth suicide. I want to make a plea for us to get serious about fixing up the fundamental problem rather than thinking that we should spend more money on all of these other things. As worth while as they may appear to be, they will not solve the problem. It is interesting that we are very keen to stop people smoking because we realise smoking is a health hazard. I make the point very clearly that divorce is a health hazard for our kids. It also makes life harsher for our kids. Kids these days, I think, have a much harsher childhood than perhaps kids of my generation did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our parents, as I recall, looking back at my own childhood, may not have got on terribly well the whole time but, in the end, they were very good parents and they stayed together till death parted them. I think we have benefited enormously from that. Kids today, faced with divorce rates of the magnitude that we are talking about, are faced with a very much harsher and more difficult childhood, and that, as we recognise, may lead to an increase in the rate of youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently read a book by David Blankenhorn, who visited Australia recently, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fatherless America.</EMPHASIS> While Mr Blankenhorn was here he did a number of interviews during which he talked about America and the importance of fathers to young men. Of course, divorce very often separates boys from their fathers, and we understand the reason for that happening. Mr Blankenhorn said that over 40 per cent of America's children do not live with their fathers, and I suspect that those sorts of percentages are almost being reached in Australia. Before they reach the age of 18, more than half of our nation's children will spend at least some of their childhood growing up without a father in their home. Nearly half of all children living apart from their fathers have not seen them in the previous year. More than 30 per cent of all children today are born to unmarried women. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Not wanting to cheat the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) of the opportunity to make a contribution I briefly want to respond to the very correct observation by the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton). He quite rightly asked: `Why is so much of the focus of this report on youth suicide?' The answer is that it was the first initiative of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. However, I would like to advise him, and all members, that as recently as last Friday, in this very chamber, we had a seminar on men's health. I assure the member for Isaacs that, very clearly, the overwhelming evidence collected will show that&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  will be available as soon as it is approved&mdash;adult male suicide is very much a men's health problem, which was his quite correct observation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased with the activities of the committee and we are very hopeful that shortly we will be able to present, on the table, a report in respect of that particular activity.

I assure him that it will be addressed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for this initiative and for the excellent report it has produced, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> . Some of the committee's members are in the chamber today. In looking through this report I was reminded once again of the staggering statistics that it represents. This is a major social problem in this country, and it must be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9173"> attacked not only by state and federal governments but by the community generally. The community is aware of it and is tackling it, certainly in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the statistics just staggered me, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the statistics quoted here, in 1995 there were 350 suicides by young males and 84 by young females. That is a staggering loss to this nation if that particular statistic is repeated over time. Rates of suicide per 100,000 of population show that since the 1960s, the rate of young male suicides has almost trebled, and for young males in Australia between 1979 and 1995 there has been a fivefold increase in deaths arising from hanging. They are extraordinary statistics, and the report quite correctly homes in on the fact that this problem is endemic in rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my particular state we reflect the statistics that are contained in this report. Suicide rates for males have increased dramatically in Victoria, from 5.6 per 100,000 in 1964 to 22.9 per 100,000 in 1995. That is an appalling and staggering increase. While deaths by suicide are most common among males, suicide attempts are most common among women. Here we must look to the causes of this situation&mdash;not only why many young people are attempting suicide, but why it is that many females attempt but do not go through with the act, while many males do it and lose their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess many in this house have had experience of suicide and youth suicide. I go back to my time before entering this parliament. When I returned to the farm on the death of my father in 1979 I was asked by a local Catholic school to teach part time while I was working on the farm. I spent a lot of time with young people over quite a long period, and I can vividly recall one particular example of a young man who, to all intents and purposes, as the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) expressed in his contribution here, had the world at his feet. He was a runner and a bit of a goer and I, along with some other people in the school, spent a lot of time keeping him out of the principal's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a fine young man who, I would have thought, had he been able to make it through a particular period of his life, would have gone on to be a productive member of his local community and the Australian community. He had a very supportive family and he was much loved by that family. But at the end of the day, for reasons that we will never know, that young man took his own life. That is an experience that many of us on the floor of this parliament have been intimately acquainted with and have had contact with. In a very personal sense, it rocked me to my foundations, and made me aware of the tremendous trauma that is visited not only on families but on school communities and local communities by youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have canvassed the reasons, and this report does that. We can go through those. They are many and varied. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who preceded me, quite correctly pointed out that some are within the ambit of government and some are not. I think we have to look primarily at the economic hardship of families and unemployment. That is concentrated fairly substantially in regional areas of this country. That is a major contributing factor. Families in distress are families that are prone to have members commit suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other factors, as I read the literature, have been advanced: the loss of a sense of community, homelessness, depression, sexual assault, drugs, family conflict and decline in government support services. All of these factors have been mentioned as contributing factors to suicide, particularly youth suicide, in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9174">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Geelong community is aware of this problem. There was a meeting in Geelong on 5 March 1997, which was attended by around 90 people, to deal specifically with this problem. The meeting was convened by the Victorian Premier's Suicide Prevention Task Force and I commend politicians of any political persuasion who show an active interest in this subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message from that meeting was not one, I think, the Victorian Premier would want to hear, because speaker after speaker, of all political persuasions, condemned governments for the massive cutbacks in services that have occurred in rural areas particularly. They sheeted that home as a contributing factor to suicide in rural areas. I do not think we can just narrow that factor down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member who preceded me in this debate said that we are perhaps treating this matter after the fact. He made the point that money was not the solution to the problem and he quoted the financial contributions of the previous government and this government in addressing this problem. Maybe it is not so much in the $19 million that this government has allocated, or the $13 million that the previous government allocated, to address this problem but, in a broader sense, the responsibility of government to resource services in rural and regional areas that is able to play a role in combating this insidious disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to very briefly comment on the Victoria task force report. When it delivered its report it identified the Barwon adolescent task force&mdash;BAT force&mdash;in my electorate as one of two bodies in the state which was providing a coordinated response to youth problems and addressing this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate in the Barwon region, the number of youth suicides is well below the Victorian state average. I congratulate BAT force, its committee of management and its network of concerned officers and agencies for their untiring work on behalf of youth in my electorate. It is the BAT force network which has delivered the real support to our youth, which has directly contributed to the situation which was acknowledged in the Victorian government's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the solution? Why has this organisation been so effective? The chair, Ms Armstrong Rowe, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BAT force has built up strong community networks, good communications between agencies and it has well resourced the youth programs that are provided.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I suggest to honourable members that if we are looking to part of the solution to this problem, it includes all the ones that have been mentioned in the report and by honourable members previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the solution is correctly resourcing in a financial sense these sorts of organisations that are able to deliver to youth the network of support services that can address some of the real and fundamental problems that youth face before youth go to the point of taking their own lives. I commend this report to all members of parliament and I congratulate those members who have participated in its preparation.</PARA>
