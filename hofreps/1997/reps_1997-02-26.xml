<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Last budget, the government announced that it would transfer the development import finance facility, DIFF, loan liabilities from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to the government's account. As a consequence, EFIC would make a special payment to the Commonwealth, estimated to be $40 million. At that time, it was noted that amendments would be required to EFIC's legislation to allow the transfer of loan liabilities and associated payments. This bill implements that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EFIC is a statutory corporation which exists to increase Australia's exports by providing international competitive insurance and export finance services. It has traditionally filled a gap left by the private sector, which has often been reluctant to finance or insure exports in certain markets because of the risks involved. EFIC operates on a commercial basis and meets all of its costs from revenue, including the need to build up reserves to enable it to meet future claims. EFIC operates essentially at no cost to the taxpayer and will, in fact, pay a dividend to government during the current financial year of $12.6 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995&hyphen;96, EFIC supported $7.5 billion of Australian exports, supporting over 1,000 Australian businesses exporting to some 155 countries around the globe. Most of EFIC's clients are small to medium enterprises with an annual turnover of $50 million or less. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> availability and cost of export risk mitigation is extremely important to these smaller companies. Some 87 per cent of new clients to EFIC in 1995&hyphen;96 were SMEs, of which 60 per cent were manufacturers&mdash;exactly the type of company needed to drive Australia's future prosperity and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EFIC's role as a direct financier or guarantor has become increasingly important in line with the need to match overseas government supported involvement in the area of trade financing. EFIC's financing book stood at nearly $3 billion at the end of last year, all involving the export of capital goods and services from Australia. An important part of EFIC's financing role has been to deliver the soft loan component of Australia's overseas aid program through the former DIFF scheme. DIFF loans were concentrated in Asia and were long term&mdash;up to 25 years in the case of loans to Indonesia. A DIFF grant component of some $120 million per year translated to soft loans through EFIC of some $350 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Delivering DIFF loans of this magnitude presented EFIC with two problems. The first was the need to build up reserves in case of defaults on these loans, noting that the loans covered a significant portion of EFIC's exposure at any one time. The second problem, a result of Australia's overseas aid program focussing on Asia, was the concentration of exposure in a fairly narrow range of countries. Like all insurers and financiers, EFIC would normally seek to spread its exposure. However, the concentration of DIFF loans made EFIC's loan exposures undesirably lopsided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, this concentration also had the potential to restrict EFIC's ability to provide non&hyphen;aid medium&hyphen;term credit for Australian exports in these countries, particularly Indonesia. This was a matter of concern to the government, given the increasing interest of Australian business in Asia. The removal of DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC's account to the government's account, managed by EFIC on behalf of the government, removes these unintended consequences. This transfer will change EFIC's risk portfolio for the better, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1286"> allowing room for EFIC to grow its medium&hyphen;term business, particularly in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the financial impact of the bill, EFIC will make a special payment to the Commonwealth of $40 million. This amount reflects the liability that the Commonwealth will be assuming for the loans. The calculation of this amount was made by the government in the knowledge that EFIC's viability, and capacity for growth, to a large extent depends upon its reserve structure and the income generated from those reserves. The government will be liable to reimburse EFIC for any losses occasioned by loan defaults or other interruptions to repayment. The Commonwealth will also pay EFIC a fee for managing the loans. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most contentious of the proposals being debated is undoubtedly the Medicare levy surcharge. It is remarkable on more than one count. Amongst its controversial features will be the introduction for the first time of an income test, excepting of course the levy&hyphen;free threshold that has applied to this tax since its inception. The levy is and remains a tax on income, of course. To borrow from a television program aired way back when, only the name of this tax has been changed to `levy' to dupe the innocent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge of one per cent will be levied against individuals and families who have supposedly high incomes and have not taken out private patient hospital cover. The income test to be invoked will operate with the same effect as tax brackets applicable to taxation of income. In other words, tax brackets will apply to the Medicare levy tax for the first time, however qualified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments love tax bracketing. Tax bracket creep has always been a source of joy to spendthrift governments because it enables greater income in the form of tax revenue to be gathered off wage and salary earners without changing either tax laws or tax rates. Even in times of low inflation it is a realised expectation of the majority of salary and wage earners that their incomes will increase commensurate with the experience and skills accumulated the longer they are in the workplace. Increases in income take those same taxpayers into tax brackets which attract a higher percentage of income tax than previously payable. Admittedly, the Medicare levy in the form to be created by this legislation will result in only two income brackets, whereas there are several for ordinary income tax purposes. But, as with the proposed superannuation surcharge, the precedent for tax bracketing will have been established.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1287">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What then will there be to stop this or any future government which falls on hard times and finds itself irretrievably spending more than it collects from adding a couple more brackets? The principle having been set by the passage of this legislation, no-one will be able to argue against, say, a 1&half; per cent levy on single incomes over $70,000 and a one&hyphen;half of one per cent levy on single incomes in the $40,000 to $50,000 income range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, four brackets applying to a Medicare levy tax would arguably be more progressive than a regressive one or two income brackets. Then the theorists will have a field day arguing the relative merits of progressive and regressive tax systems all over again. Happy days! That is happening. Government apparatchiks will be rubbing their hands with glee, delirious in the knowledge that the proceeds of another growth on expansionary tax are there for everyone to enjoy. Growth will occur naturally through the medium of bracket creep supplemented by expansion, only a few strokes of the pen being needed to change taxation laws as they will then be as a result of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another controversial element of the Medicare levy tax proposal is that it arose out of not one but two broken election promises. The first promise to be broken was to the effect that the coalition in government would not touch the Medicare levy. It intends not only to touch it but to touch it along. The second broken promise was that a coalition government would neither increase existing nor impose new taxes. If the levy surcharge does not increase an existing tax, then it most certainly is a new one and vice versa. That is not a bad quinella of broken promises&mdash;two as a result of one measure. The original intent was described by Dr Blewett, a former Labor minister for health:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this levy would provide cover for medical and specialist services outside hospitals, and accommodation and treatment without direct charge in public hospitals by salaried or sessional doctors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There has been a lot of water under the bridge since then. The Medicare tax has become just another means of raising revenue, with the downside psychological effect of giving taxpayers the impression that the levy should 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be sufficient to meet all or nearly all their health costs. How often do we hear from constituents claiming that, because they have made their contributions by way of the levy on their incomes, they should not have to pay anything more or as much as they do in practice towards their health care needs? The answer to that question is: all too frequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all too easily forgotten that the Medicare tax has never raised more than 35 per cent in any one year of the total government expenditure on Medicare. Even with the passage of these proposals, the total raised is unlikely to exceed one-third of the cost of Medicare. Indeed, according to the information provided on the cost implications of these measures, there is to be a reduction in revenue of no small consequence over ensuing years. The estimated net figures, after taking into account a late government amendment to raise the threshold to apply before a tax rebate of 20 per cent can be claimed for the costs of health care in any one tax year, from $1,000 to $1,500, are $8 million in 1996-97, $436 million in 1997-98, $504 million in 1998-99 and $491 million in 1999-2000. Mind you, given recent revelations following a mid-year review of the Commonwealth's fiscal position in relation to its budget, it is much harder now to have faith in those estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House will recall that company tax yields to the consolidated revenue were in fact overstated in the budget papers by perhaps billions of dollars. The reason for that is said to be the failure of the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of the Treasury to factor into their predictions companies modifying their behaviour and legally paying income tax on profits earlier to avoid an announced future increase in the company tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure by the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Treasury gives rise to misgivings about the estimates of the financial impact of these proposals. As with the proposed supercharge on contributions to superannuation by higher income earners, individual taxpayers will modify their behaviour to minimise or legally avoid the proposed hike in the Medicare tax. It is fairyland stuff to believe that, on the best professional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1288"> advice, affected taxpayers will do otherwise. The ATO and Treasury should be as aware of that inevitability as they should have been alert to the reaction of companies in the example just given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being a predictable probability and given the failure of the relevant government agencies to accurately advise the government accordingly, any nervousness about cost impact estimates in explanatory memoranda is entirely excusable. Such doubts extend to all cost impact estimates for all proposed legislation. After all, if figures so fundamental to the budget can be so wrong, given that actuals are eventually measured against budget forecasts, why would the cost impact estimates in proposed legislation, which are never subjected to tests of their accuracy, be believable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are more than superficial reasons for thinking that the revenue and expenditure consequences of this proposed legislation could be well wide of the mark. Most important is the lack of any advice or assurance that the likelihood of affected taxpayers modifying their behaviour has been factored into the government's predicted overall reduction in tax collectable during subsequent years, pursuant to these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questionable also is that the carrot and stick approach adopted by the government to entice or motivate more people to take out private health cover will be successful. It is hard to fathom why anyone in the higher income tax brackets targeted will be induced by these measures alone to take up private health insurance. Presumably, such taxpayers took a conscious decision to either not join or to opt out of private health insurance. If that original decision was based on personal cost benefit analyses, as seems likely in most cases, these proposals will not tip the balance back in favour of private health insurance, given the safety net provided to everyone under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The incentives, at best, will narrow the gap between prudent self&hyphen;interest and the cost of private insurance. However, increases in premiums have already eroded the potential benefits substantially since the government announced its well&hyphen;intentioned proposals. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most cases those higher income earners confronted with the decision are hardly likely to be persuaded to take out private health insurance by what is now proposed. That assessment is merely as hard&hyphen;headed as will be the decisions of the affected taxpayers and not necessarily a preferred outcome. If that is an accurate prediction, then the total Medicare tax take might very well be greater than the cost impact estimates imply. That may very well suit the government in terms of going some way towards eventually balancing the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A late amendment, which the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) kindly advised me about, is to be moved by the government some time during this debate. It gives rise to some concern. It proposes to raise from $1,000 to $1,500 in a full year the threshold to apply to medical expenses an individual must incur before he or she can claim a tax rebate on the surplus at the rate of 20 per cent. This represents a pretty hefty tax slug, being an increase of 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more significantly for most people, it will have been a pretty bad year to have spent $1,000 or more on health care costs. There has to have been a bit of pressure on the old purse strings, as well as on health, to have to pay out over $1,000 after Medicare claims and perhaps even private health insurance refunds. It will be even worse if it is over $1,500 as is now proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If some battler, whose health is also likely to have suffered during a catastrophic year in terms that we can all understand, cannot in the future claim a 20 per cent rebate on all expenditure over $1,000 in that same year, it may very well induce a relapse. It is to be hoped that it is not to be the case for too many, but it will be for some. The same battler will forgo up to another $100 in the form of a tax rebate on top of what is already probably a forgettable year for him or her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another element to the government's proposed amendment is worrisome. The separate explanatory memorandum tells us that the raising of the tax rebate threshold will benefit the revenue by between $45 million and $50 million in a full year. Given that the maximum rebate to be lost for any one person 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1289"> is $100&mdash;that is 20 per cent of $500&mdash;simple arithmetic suggests that 450,000 to 500,000 people will personally outlay $1,500 or more per year on health costs over and above Medicare and private health insurance refunds. On the face of it, that appears to be a little over the top; and perhaps the relevant government spokesman can enlighten the House when responding in the second reading debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996. This bill provides incentives in two components of health care: hospital and ancillary cover. There are three levels of incentive. For singles earning less than $35,000 a year, there is a total incentive of $125. For couples without children earning less than $70,000 a year, there is an incentive of $250 per annum. For families with one child earning less than $70,000 a year, there is an incentive of $450 per annum. That ceiling rises by $3,000 for each additional child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will benefit at least five million Australians who have over 2.5 million private health fund memberships. It will cost the coalition government over $600 million per annum. One of the most pleasing aspects of this bill is the Medicare surcharge. For those who can well afford to fund their own private health insurance, there will be a surcharge of one per cent of income. It will affect singles earning over $50,000 and couples or families earning over $100,000. This is absolutely necessary. The pressures on private health insurance are great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1983, when the previous Labor government took office, 65 per cent of Australians had private health insurance. In June 1996, that had fallen to 33.6 per cent. There is a vicious circle at work in Australian private health insurance. As the funds pay out more claims, either their reserves dwindle or they have to increase their premiums. Of course, when they do increase their premiums, there are those who will not or cannot pay that premium. These are usually people who believe that they will not be making a claim on the health industry: young healthy Australians. This leaves those with higher health care 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needs to continue to pay the higher premiums. So the vicious circle goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chief Executive Director of the Australian Health Insurance Association, Mr Russell Schneider, recently revealed the difficulties in and the squeeze on the private health insurance industry. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Monday he said that the private health fund payouts had increased nine per cent in 1996. The claims had now topped $4 billion. Membership, however, had fallen by 1.2 per cent. Although this has slowed with the recognition that the government will be giving incentives for private health insurance, there is no doubt that there is still a terrible squeeze in the private health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This difficulty is fuelled by older members. In 1996 those aged over 65 years made up 14 per cent of private health holders; whereas in 1995 it was 13.5 per cent. Claims by over 65s have increased by $200 million to a total of $1.3 billion. Private health demand is soaring, with claims for private hospital treatment rising 13.5 per cent in 1996 to $2.2 billion. It is timely that our Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) moves to halt the exodus from private health insurance, to persuade people not only to rejoin but also to maintain their private health insurance, to ease the pressures on the private hospital system and to ease upward pressure on premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in the addresses made by those on the other side of the House yesterday. Some of them said that the incentives would not work. Others said that the surcharge was unfair. What did Labor do? How many health insurance premium rises in the health insurance industry did they stop in their period of government? None. How many incentives did they give to halt the declining membership in private health insurance? None. How many punitive measures did they take against wealthy and comfortable Australians who could well afford to fund part of their own health care? None. In fact, they boasted that their Prime Minister and their minister for health did not take out private health insurance. They were irresponsible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1290">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average premium rise under the previous government was 12 per cent per annum. In one horrific period&mdash;1986 to 1988&mdash;private health insurance premiums went up by 40 per cent. It was irresponsible and was fuelled by the Commonwealth removing two of the advantages that they had given the private health industry: the Commonwealth bed day subsidy for private hospital beds and the Commonwealth contribution to the private health insurance reinsurance pool which enables them to average their risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is salutary to look at some of the figures given out by the Australian Health Insurance Association in February 1997 on those Australians who are doing the right thing. Of those over the age of 65 on fixed incomes, over 850,000 people have private health insurance. Of single people earning less than $20,000&mdash;and that is a modest income&mdash;580,000 people have chosen to take out private health insurance. Of families with an income less than $20,000, 220,000 have taken out private health insurance. Those people are doing the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at those people who are being less responsible. Of families earning more than $100,000 a year, 50,000 do not have private health insurance. Of single individuals earning more than $50,000 a year, 105,000 do not have private health insurance. In fact, of singles earning over $70,000 a year, 25,000 do not have private health insurance. These are people who could well afford the private health insurance premium and so relieve the burden on the public health system and the burden of premium rises. But they have chosen not to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An insured family on $35,000 a year contributes $3,476 to the nation's health bill which is more than the $3,442 contributed by a single person on $64,000 a year. I believe that the surcharge is necessary; it is certainly the tax that the government does not want to collect. But it will persuade people who can well afford to insure themselves to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the Productivity Commission this Friday will release its recommendations on the private health insurance industry, and the Health Department apparently will be making recommendations to cabinet. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We all recognise that this incentive package, while it is very worthy and helpful, is only part of the solution needed to meet rising health costs, with an ageing population and increasingly costly new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community rating plainly is not working and needs to be reinforced. There are too many hit&hyphen;and&hyphen;run members. What I mean by `a hit&hyphen;and&hyphen;run member' is somebody who may be over the age of 65 or 75 who suddenly decides, `Goodness me, I'm going to need more medical attention, my needs are increasing. I'll take out private health insurance; I'm going to need it.' At present that person will receive the same benefit as received by one of my battling families&mdash;one of those families I have mentioned with children which earns less than $20,000 a year and which has taken out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hardly fair that people who have done the right thing, who have found it very difficult with children to take out private health insurance, should receive the same benefit as someone who has decided they will leave it until they need it. Community rating needs to be examined for the viability of the funds and to make it more attractive for Australians who want to do the right thing&mdash;get in young and insure themselves, and to keep their cover until they are older Australians when their needs are greater. This will be a very difficult situation. But I believe that we now have a health minister who really is facing many of the difficulties in our health system. To date, he has shown that he is wise and has the courage to take the hard decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been instructive, again, to watch the reaction of those on the other side of the House to many of the changes that our minister has brought forward. I know that the rabid Left will never be convinced. The shadow minister for the aged, family and community services&mdash;and general doom and gloom&mdash;will never accept any of our changes. But I notice that more thoughtful members do recognise the long-term problems in the health system in Australia. I think, certainly after having listened to some of them yesterday, those more thoughtful members perhaps have a touch of regret that the 13 years of Labor government did not see a minister 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1291"> willing to tackle the long-term difficulties in the health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an excellent minister for health. I guess it is somewhat ironic that the man who rode into town to give the bush a fair go was a doctor from Melbourne. But throughout all of my country towns, people recognise that now they have an opportunity to have a doctor come to their town. In Collinsville, Glendon and Bowen, in many of our small bush towns, it is very difficult to encourage a doctor to serve the community there. The Minister for Health has taken that difficulty, faced it, and now we will see a far better situation with country doctors. He has brought in tough action on immunisation and a range of other measures that will assist all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Minister for the latest incentives in private health insurance. I believe that we finally have a minister with the calibre to face the difficult situation in our health insurance industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a very interesting debate on these health bills which obviously has enabled us to have a comprehensive discussion about the health system, and especially the role of private health insurance in that system. It is interesting that throughout the debate we have had, on the one hand, people proclaiming that everything was wrong with the health system under the Labor government and claiming that all these changes will fix everything up and then, on the other hand, the view that everything was all right in the previous administration. I think it is true to say that there have always been problems in the health system. However, rather than bombastic political comment, what is required in this matter is an assessment of what can be done to achieve the best health system for Australia, based on the contribution of ideas from a range of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who think that all the solutions lie with private health insurance and the private health system are obviously mistaken. We know from what has happened in the United States and other countries that, if you place excessive emphasis on private health insurance, on private health generally, a large 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> number of people drop out of the system. You then get a situation in which health, rather than being universally available, becomes something which can be afforded only by the rich or those in the middle classes who are prepared to sacrifice considerable resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all heard of the horror stories in the United States where someone goes into hospital and effectively loses all of their life savings&mdash;their house, their property, everything&mdash;in order to pay for their health costs. I do not think anybody, no matter whether they are on the right or they are on the left of the Australian spectrum, with the exception of a few fanatics, really wants us to move into that system. I hope not anyway. If that is what people are trying to say we should move towards, then they should look at the American experience and see how disastrous it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is even more serious in America is that the Congress and the President have been for years and years trying to bring in a universal scheme. Every time they try, vested interests in America who obviously benefit from this situation where health costs are excessively high and where individuals suffer dramatically from those costs have prevented legislative change. They have prevented the President&mdash;President Clinton, for example&mdash;being able to put in a national health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very fortunate in Australia that we have been able to maintain a national health system. Anyone who has studied this matter will remember the history. The Whitlam Labor government introduced a national health system. As soon as the Fraser government was elected, they dismantled that system. When they dismantled it, they thought, `What will we put in its place?' They tried a variety of health insurance schemes which were a combination of private and public. All of those combinations&mdash;every one of them&mdash;did not work. None of them worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They kept changing the scheme because they could not get it right. They could not get it right because they had missed a fundamental element, which was universality. The number one requirement is that everybody must be covered in any decent health system. That is a requirement of natural justice. That is a requirement which everyone in a civilised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1292"> society is entitled to. So that should be the premise with which we all begin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, during the Fraser government and by the election of 1983, which swept Labor back into power, they could not get it right in the final analysis and as a result two million Australians were not covered by health insurance. Two million Australians did not have any coverage, and that was a disgrace. That was one of the fundamental issues in the election. No matter whether the economy was growing or whether there were prospects of that&mdash;in fact, it was not growing at that time&mdash;the basic reality is that, if you do not provide certain essential services as a human right, especially health, then people will vote against you. And they did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came into government, we introduced the new Medicare system as a universal system. That universal system has served Australia very well. More than 80 per cent of Australians think that the Medicare system is a great system. One of the foolish actions of the coalition going to the elections over those years, especially in the 1993 election, was that they never embraced the universality of Medicare&mdash;that is to say, until the Howard opposition came into being in the election of 1996. I will come back to that point in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, right up to that time, in every election the conservatives could not find the heart to say, `We really understand that the Australian people want a universal health system and they want the Medicare system. They want a system that covers everyone where, if you are in real trouble and in real crisis, you can have medical care and you do not have to worry about losing your house or your property. You can get medical care that is affordable and that is in most cases free, with the exception of some cases where there are small charges.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the election. The conservatives, having lost so many elections on the health issue, decided that this time they would commit themselves to Medicare. And so they did. They made a commitment to the principles of Medicare. But the question now is: are these changes that have been announced and the ones that are going through this chamber 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> today consistent with the principles of Medicare? What are they actually doing? More importantly, are they actually dealing with the real problems of the Medicare system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who is a doctor, waxed lyrical about how progressive and wonderful these changes are. `After all,' he said, `this surplus charge on the rich, which is going to make most of them go into private health insurance, is going to be something which, obviously, any person believing in social justice should support.' That is essentially what he said. He said that this surplus charge on the wealthy was something which the Labor Party should support unqualifiedly and there should be no problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At first sight you might think that that is correct. But the problem is, as has been mentioned and as figures given in detail by the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) and other members on this side of the House show, that the concession which the government gave to people to get into private health insurance has virtually been swallowed up by the increased charges in private health insurance. I know members opposite have tried to make naught of this matter. I do not think that one single one of them has addressed this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Bradfield had been less sanctimonious and more to the point, he would have got up and said, `The government intended to do something on this matter, but it has been ruined by the private health insurance companies.' There is no doubt about it that it has been ruined, because virtually the total concession has now gone into increased charges by the health insurance companies, and we even hear of more charges to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all this happened, the Prime Minister thought, `Oh, God. The whole scheme looks like it's going to collapse in a heap,' so he ordered an inquiry. That is very consistent with this government. Every time there is a problem which they cannot resolve, there is another inquiry. Let us see what this inquiry is going to come up with and let us see whether it is going to address the real problems which we face in relation to this balance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1293"> between private health and public health, because we have to get the balance right. Obviously this move by the Howard government did not get it right, because it failed to take into account the fact of greed in the health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is driving this greed? You have a cosy little deal between the health insurance companies and the private hospitals. Charges go up in the private hospitals and the companies say, `Oh, that's all right. We'll put up the charges in the health insurance area,' and Bob's your uncle. There is no requirement to justify what they are doing on the basis of facts. They put forward some rationalisations, and who doesn't when they are trying to make excessive profits?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that those increases should never have been granted. The government should have said, `Okay, we'll hold an inquiry, but we will freeze charges until the end of that inquiry.' That is what a decent and sensible government would have done in this context&mdash;a government that was concerned that this matter be resolved. Instead, what has happened? They granted all the increases and then they said, `We'll have an inquiry afterwards.' Talk about after the horse has bolted. What is going to happen because of these increases? Are people really going to be induced to go into private health insurance with these increased costs? Of course they are not. They are going to say, `Oh, well, in this situation there is nothing in it for me.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was mentioned by the member for Bradfield and others that there were problems even before, when we were in government, which were being addressed by former Senator Richardson and other health ministers. It was claimed that our health ministers did not do any good on this matter. It is all very well, when you do not have a solution, to get up and say, `Well, they didn't do any good on this matter.' The reality is, however, that the matter is a very difficult one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult because there is a division of powers in the area of health between the federal government and the states. We have had the continuing problem of cost shifting, and the public hospitals have been under the control of the state governments. While they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are under the control of the state governments, the state governments are able to undermine the intentions of any federal government, of whatever colour, by insufficiently funding public hospitals. Of course, this is what has happened in Victoria in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Dawson, (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) had the audacity to say that something had been done about health for people in the bush. The minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology, (Mr McGauran) would know what has been done about health in the bush by the Victorian government, alright. All sorts of public hospitals in the country in Victoria have been closed down by the Kennett government. That is what has happened. That is the idea of the conservatives, not only in Victoria but throughout Australia. The response from state governments to the health crisis has been to close public hospitals or to reduce the number of beds or to reduce budgets and thereby force the hospitals to adopt unacceptable practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the impertinence of the government coming in here, saying, `Look, these measures are going to solve our health problems.' They are not going to do anything of the kind. What is essential to solve this issue is to ensure that, no matter how many people there are in the Medicare system and in private health insurance, when a person under their universal entitlement wants to go to a public hospital, they are able to get into a bed in a public hospital. That is the fundamental requirement. It is that requirement which has not been achieved, especially now with the cutbacks in health by state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do the proposals before us have any suggestion as to how this problem might be solved? Of course not. Do the member for Bradfield and the others who sanctimoniously talk about this system as being wonderful have a solution to this crisis? I did not hear it. The member for Bradfield spoke for 20 minutes, and he did not suggest one idea in relation to this matter. Unless you suggest something to deal with this issue, how are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1294"> you going to be able to say that you have some solutions to the problems of health?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was parliamentary secretary for health in the previous government. During that time, we looked at a whole range of proposals to get the states to meet their responsibilities in relation to public hospitals. Certain actions were taken by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when she was minister to try to ensure that the state governments, of whatever colour, met their responsibilities in terms of public hospitals. The reality is that what you got was an attempt by the states to shove costs onto the Commonwealth and a refusal by the state governments to really meet their responsibilities in health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this situation is going to continue in this country, then a question has to be considered as to whether there ought to be a referendum, or an issue to be considered is whether health should become a responsibility of the federal government alone. We cannot continue to have this buck&hyphen;passing in relation to health by the state governments. For example, the Kennett government finds millions of dollars to spend on various circuses and shows and various other things that are totally unnecessary, but it will not fund the fundamental issue of health and human rights.</PARA>

The question really is: what is going to happen to the health system in the long-term, particularly public hospitals?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the factors that was mentioned by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) when he was trying to restrict access to Medicare numbers was that he had discovered that there was a certain attitude amongst doctors about serving in public hospitals. I must say I am appalled to hear about that attitude. We have so many great public hospitals in this country, but there is this idea that  doctors serving in public hospitals are somehow not performing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as useful a public service; it is not thought that they are providing an important service to the community. One has got to ask the question: what is the AMA doing about these sorts of attitudes? Why hasn't the AMA promoted the idea that serving in public hospitals and serving the people through public health is an important and noble goal? Have we totally forgotten about the Hippocratic oath? The fundamental thing for a doctor is to be committed to serving the patient&mdash;to be committed to the good health of the patient, irrespective of whether that patient is rich or poor, irrespective of whether that patient has to be served in a public hospital or in a private practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a beginning in this process, I think we need to get much greater emphasis on the importance of doctors' service in public hospitals. But, as I said, we might also have to think about how we can deal with this constant problem of cost shifting to the Commonwealth by the states. They refuse to understand that, if they have a constitutional right for public hospitals, they have to fund those resources. It does not matter what else they have to forego&mdash;such as their circuses, and other perks and nonsense&mdash;they have to be able to fund those hospitals in the way that is required. As the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said, if you are going to have a universal system it has got to be truly universal. It should not matter how many people are in the private system, your public system should service them. That does not mean that you should not do something about the private system as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The four bills being debated today, which essentially cover private health insurance and the Medicare levy amendment, represent both a solid commitment by this government to its 1996 election promise, as announced in our Healthy Future policy, and a recognition of the importance that we on this side of the House place on the role of the private health sector. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) is a living example of the ideologically driven obsession that the opposition has against the role of the private health sector in the health system of this country. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1295"> These bills, when passed, will go a long way to restoring the sense of security and wellbeing which all Australians look forward to when demanding medical treatment. They will also go a long way toward stopping the rot in our health system that was spawned under Labor's ideologically driven disregard for the private health sector&mdash;an obsession which led to increasing pressure on our public hospital system.,</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will provide a quick sketch of two typical cases that I have encountered in my electorate. They are typical&mdash;I am sure that most members will have examples similar to these&mdash;and I am sure they will illustrate just how that rot has set in in the electorate of Deakin. In the first case, the director of one of the public hospitals covering my electorate tells of aged people forced by rising premiums to drop private cover; this at a time in their lives when they are four times more likely to need it. These aged people, after undergoing surgery or suffering an acute affliction such as a stroke, are forced to join a waiting list for rehabilitation services. While they are waiting they are forced to stay in hospital because they are too weak or incapacitated to look after themselves. The extra stay in hospital results in higher costs for the government and immense frustration, of course, for the patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second case, another constituent broke her back four years ago and lost all sensation from the waist down. Even with surgery it was unknown whether she would ever walk again. What was certain was that without the operation she would not improve and would suffer constant pain for months as the deformed bones re&hyphen;fused, yet the operation she required was considered elective surgery. The situation was not life&hyphen;threatening, but fortunately for this woman she had private health insurance. She elected to have the five&hyphen;hour operation at the hospital with the surgeon of her choice. She now swims up to 15 kilometres a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would think that in this case my constituent would be a lifelong convert to the need for private health insurance, yet this person, too, has given up private health insurance; given it up because, like many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> others, the spiralling cost of private health insurance is beyond her normal means. She is now taking a punt that her condition will not deteriorate with age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two constituents are not an exception; they are the rule out there in Australia. They typify the almost seven in 10 Australians who do not have private health cover. More alarmingly, they are among the one in three who have let their cover lapse since Medicare was introduced by a Labor government in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in saying this I am not critical of the Medicare philosophy. Contrary to what the member for Calwell was insinuating, this government is not about dismantling the national health system. We are not the United States. We are not ideologically driven to dismantling Medicare or the public hospital system. It is obviously one of those nice catchcries from the opposition. The member for Calwell talks about us not having ideas&mdash;that we are bereft of ideas! They had 13 years to introduce ideas to address the spiralling decline in private health insurance and the pressure on public hospitals, and we still find ourselves in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Medicare philosophy is a right one. It is important and it is a successful system in Australia and we should be proud of it. I will certainly resist any attempts to try to go down the American path. Australians should rightfully feel secure knowing that they can receive medical treatment when they need it, without worrying about whether they can afford it. But Medicare was never designed to stand alone. In announcing details of how the new Medicare scheme would work on 24 May 1983, the then health minister, Dr Blewett, said quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that cooperation between the private health funds and government will ensure an improved, cheaper health insurance cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medicare was originally seen as a safety net for low income earners. It was introduced to a society where 65 per cent of Australians had private health insurance. Ten years later in 1993, the then Labor health minister, Senator Graham Richardson, who has been quoted a number of times in this debate, prophetically stated that Medicare would become financially unviable if the proportion of Australians 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1296"> with private health insurance fell below 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We passed that mark many years ago. Today 12 million to 13 million Australians are dependent on the public health system. By last March only 34.6 per cent of Australians&mdash;barely one in three&mdash;had private health cover. The most recent figures published last week show that by December last year another one per cent of Australians had given up on the private health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are indisputable figures in simple to understand terms that even the opposition should recognise and respond to. At this rate of exodus and cost, it is impractical to expect the Australian public to completely fund the public health system either through existing taxes and/or the Medicare levy. The private health sector must have a significant role to play in our health system. Even after the massive exodus of people, the private health system still contributes $4 billion towards the nation's health costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 1995 report commissioned in part by the Labor government found that 69 per cent of people who drop out of private health cover do so because of the cost of premiums. Since 1990 the cost of cover has risen on average three and a half times faster than CPI. Between 1990 and 1993, the cost of premiums rose by 72 per cent. Who was in government between those years? It was a Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not be hypocritical in making accusations towards this government and feigning some sort of concern when the health funds come to us asking for premium increases. The Labor Party knows full well that increases by health funds are necessary at times in order for them to maintain their prudential requirements. They know this because under 13 years of Labor every single request by the health funds to increase their premiums was approved. Under Labor we had a 12 per cent per annum average increase in premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rise in premiums under Labor essentially occurred because of changes made by its leaders throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Let us have a look at some of these changes very briefly. First of all there was the abolition of the Commonwealth's contribution to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reinsurance pool. The reinsurance pool is a measure that makes community rating work. Secondly, in 1986 Labor removed a private day bed subsidy paid to patients in private hospitals&mdash;a subsidy which today would be worth $235 million a year. It has gone. More private health patients are out of pocket and more are leaving the system. Thirdly, in 1987 the Medicare rebate was cut from 85 per cent to 75 per cent, forcing health funds to either cough up the difference or yet again leave people with private cover still further out of pocket. The result is that Australians pay a total of $850 million more in premiums each year and these increases have occurred, as I have mentioned, throughout the Labor government's reign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The incentives for private health insurance that we are debating here today are designed to stop this downward spiral. They are measures the coalition demanded while in opposition and which Labor ideologues stubbornly refused to consider. Figures from the Australian Health Insurance Association (1994) showed that 66 per cent of people without private health insurance would take out cover if incentives were introduced. I believe our incentives will encourage my two constituent cases, and many more like them, to reconsider private health cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private health incentives scheme will also recognise and support the 33 per cent of people who still do have private health insurance. Ironically, many of them are the ones who need it most. These are people who are sick, elderly, or have disabilities. Many of them are on income support. At a local level in my electorate of Deakin, the government's private health incentives scheme will potentially benefit more than 20,000 families whose household income is less than $70,000 a year. Approximately half of my electorate will benefit from these private health incentives. It will substantially increase the choice that these people have as to whether or not they take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition of the substantial costs of raising children, we have introduced even more generous income levels at which this rebate applies than were promised during the federal election. This measure takes the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1297"> pressure off the public hospital system. It also indirectly provides additional health dollars to the states and territories&mdash;dollars that the minister states the federal government will not claw back. At the same time 1,000 families in my electorate who presently earn more than $100,000 a year will be encouraged to take out private health insurance if they do not already have it. At the end of the day this is the surcharge that the government hopes that no&hyphen;one will have to pay as long as they take out private health cover. There is nothing fairer in terms of a private health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will take place in the context of wider health reforms that benefit both public and private sectors of our health system. In discussing the matter with local public and private hospital CEOs in my electorate, they have told me  that the incentive schemes `would be a tremendous help for many people.' Furthermore, they have made some suggestions which I am sure I will be able to present to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for his consideration, measures which will add to those suggested by the Productivity Commission when it brings down its report. In fact, I look forward to reading the Commission's final report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also look forward to a positive and constructive dialogue between the state health ministers and the Commonwealth when they negotiate the next Commonwealth&hyphen;state health agreement. It is clear that while the private health incentive scheme may not be the only reform that this government introduces to our health system it is a significant one. It is a reform we took to the electorate last March and a commitment we are proud to be able to deliver in full. I look forward to these bills delivering a stronger public and private health system to the people of Deakin and therefore I commend these bills to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Chief Government Whip for the additional bit of motivation. I hope he will pay me the courtesy of sticking around and hearing what I have got to say. I have been watching the debate on the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and cognate bills 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before the House today with a great deal of interest&mdash;and why wouldn't I? Despite the plethora of decisions taken by this government since its budget last year&mdash;decisions which adversely impact upon rural and regional Australia&mdash;there are few issues in my electorate causing more concern, more fear and more confusion than the issue of private health insurance and the implications of its problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why wouldn't people in my electorate be concerned when they pick up their newspaper off the lawn each morning and read headlines such as those in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> which say `NIB raises premiums by 17 per cent' and `Members are sick over NIB's increased premiums'? Why wouldn't they be further concerned and confused when they see advertisements in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> placed by private individuals expressing concern about the way in which our private health system operates?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to an ad placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> by my constituent Mr Bill Vercoe. Mr Vercoe had a motor vehicle accident in 1994. He was not the driver at fault. You can understand that he felt comfortable in the knowledge that behind him he had the third party cover of both himself and the driver at fault and, in addition to that, he had top private health cover with NIB health funds. But, alas, CIC, the third party insurer, decided to challenge the validity of the connection between Mr Vercoe's injuries, or at least the extent of them, and the 1994 accident, and there has been a protracted legal wrangle ever since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">NIB have a policy that says that they do not make a payment to an insured while ever he or she has pending a right of claim. So Mr Vercoe, despite having top cover and despite having felt comfortable in that knowledge for many years, has found himself with spiralling private hospital bills since 1994 and no avenue to turn to in terms of insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that most of our private health insurers voluntarily offer a provisional payment in the same way that Medicare offers a provisional payment in compensation cases, but NIB and others do not. I have made my own submission to the Productivity Commis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1298"> sion, notwithstanding the fact that it may be outside its terms of reference, suggesting that it recommend to the government that it should legislate to make compulsory the idea of private health insurers providing a provisional payment in the case of compensation claims until that claim has been settled. I have also put a question on notice and asked the minister to consider doing the same. It seems a commonsense approach to me and I do not see any other negatives attached to that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I have watched this debate with intense interest, and I listened particularly to the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). I have a great deal of respect for the member for Bradfield, particularly on this issue. As he is a doctor and a former president of the Australian Medical Association, I think it is fair to say that the member for Bradfield should have and would have a very good grasp of this issue before the House today. He shared with the House many of his personal experiences and many of them are heart&hyphen;rending. Many of them did highlight the deficiencies in our health system in this country. It is often said that, while our health system is a bit of a mess, it is also the best in the world, and I think that is pretty true. No health system will ever be perfect and, at around eight per cent of GDP, I think it is fair to say that our health system is one of the most cost efficient in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is true that we must address this rapid decline in the participation rate in the area of private health insurance. I think it is incumbent on us collectively to put politics aside and to do that together. But what the member for Bradfield and, indeed, what the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi), and all those on the other side who spoke before them, did not recognise is that the bills before the House today will do absolutely nothing to address the problems in the system. Rather, the bills before the parliament today are simply a manifestation of an electoral strategy, a plan put in place in 1996 to ensure that the mistakes of 1993 and the electoral consequences of them were not repeated. Because of the overwhelming support of Medicare among Australians, the Prime Minister (Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Howard) was forced to attempt at least to convince Australians that he is now a supporter of it, despite the plethora of public examples of his longstanding opposition to the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was determined before the election to convince the electorate that he recognised Medicare's legitimate role, that he understood the importance of its universality and that he understood the importance of a health system underpinned by a strong public scheme. But he went further than that. He promised to address the rapid decline in private health insurance membership at no expense to the public system. Of his private health insurance initiatives, in his 1996 election policy he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentives will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But within months all of the Prime Minister's promises have gone out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have brought in with me Budget Paper No. 1. Not too many Australians get to see Budget Paper No. 1. If they did, they would probably find its reading a little challenging. But it really can be very simple. It is certainly very simple to read pages 3-94, 3-95 and 3-96, which are all about the effect of function measures on outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A quick glance demonstrates the massive slashing of funding in the area of health in this country: the across the board reduction of two per cent in running costs, $46 million; the limited Medicare access for new doctors, $570 million; the cessation of the Commonwealth dental program, $399 million&mdash;these are over four years, of course&mdash;the pathology reform savings package, $345 million; the diagnostic imaging reform savings package, $240 million; the withholding of the 1 November 1996 Medicare fee increases, $238 million; the increase in the Medicare maximum patient payment, $57 million; the reductions in hospital funding grants to the states, $312 million; and the increases in the co-payments for pharmaceuticals, $503 million. The list goes on and on. I have just highlighted some of the bigger ticket items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the surcharge&mdash;the idea of imposing an additional one per cent Medicare levy on those earning either $50,000 or $100,000, depending on their circumstances&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1299"> we see the breaking of an absolute core promise. That is the promise that no new taxes will be introduced. There is no other way of looking at the Medicare surcharge. It is simply the raising of an additional tax. That is why the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has sought to split these cognate bills&mdash;so that the betrayal can be highlighted by way of an amendment to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is an appropriate time&mdash;it has not been done today since the adjournment last night&mdash;to remind the House of the amendment. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> deplores the Federal Government cuts to public hospitals, pharmaceuticals and public dental services which have been made to fund these incentives in direct breach of an election promise;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the cost of providing the incentives&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">would be better spent in providing extra Federal Government funding for public hospitals and direct subsidies for private hospital accommodation".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said, the Medicare surcharge is a direct breach of a core promise&mdash;that is, not to raise any new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the government's plans to fix the ills of our health system. They are going to take $1.7 billion, as I said, of taxpayers' money. So it is a case of taking out of one hand; there is no other way of looking at it. They are going to take $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money which, as the member for Dobell has said, could be spent on reducing waiting lists in public hospitals. They are going to use that to subsidise the private health insurance industry. There are no tricks in that. That is quite obvious and quite clear. We have already seen the result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in my electorate have been wearing an additional increase on their private health insurance premiums, as I indicated by giving those examples of articles from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS>, since this great incentive was an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nounced. Yet no relief under the bills before us today will be available to them until July this year. For almost a year now my constituents have been paying up to $200 more per month, if they are part of a family, to be covered under their private health insurance scheme. If these bills do pass the House, they will get some relief after July this year. I think they will be a long time catching up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second main proposal is to introduce a surcharge on those earning more than X dollars per year. What can we say about that? It will raise about $60 million a year. We have heard the member for Deakin say, `We hope it is less than that.' That will do wonders for the public health system. It will reduce a lot of hospital waiting queues. I can just see it: $60 million. The figures show that around 100,000 individuals and 110,000 families will be affected. Obviously, as the member for Deakin quite rightly pointed out again, no-one is going to cop the surcharge. In any case, those who are likely to be affected by the surcharge are already participants in private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wonderful initiative will do nil to address the ills of our system and will do nil about driving people into private health insurance. But what it will do is introduce for the first time a two&hyphen;tiered system in our Medicare system, something we should all be resisting. It is something, I know, that others on the other side will say that we ourselves contemplated as a party at one point&mdash;but it is also something that we rejected; and it is something I believe the parliament should reject today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A reading of the Productivity Commission's draft report into the private health insurance industry indicates that the commission is at best ambivalent about the initiatives contained in these cognate bills. The former Labor government also went to the 1996 election with some incentive schemes to encourage people to go into private health insurance, but we did so in such a way as to strengthen the public system. We encouraged people to stay there if that is what they chose to do. They were able to stay there and still attract those incentives. We were going to allow them to stay in the public system but still enable them 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1300"> to access some of those additional benefits people enjoy in private health insurance schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the government that where the largest contrast lies between what we were offering and what you are offering today is that our policy strengthens the public system and yours undermines it. That is the very big difference. That is why we as an opposition are expressing concern about these bills before the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that if the government is really serious about doing something about the ills of our health system, it should expand the Productivity Commission's terms of reference and have a look at the whole system. Looking at private health insurance in isolation really is a waste of time. You really need to look at the system as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I suspect that the government were not too interested in having the Productivity Commission put its tentacles into Medicare because they would know the result. I know they know that the Productivity Commission would give Medicare its overwhelming stamp of approval. But we could not have that because, despite the Prime Minister's protestations&mdash;and he is on the public record enough&mdash;we all know that he does not like Medicare. It is some sort of socialist plot to the Prime Minister and his supporters. They do not like the way Australians love it, because they have always opposed it. They hate its universality; they basically hate the fact that it works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than get up and say so, they misled the Australian public and then came in the back door by introducing for the first time a two&hyphen;tiered system, which is the thin end of the wedge and which could very well spell the beginning of the end of Medicare. That is their plan; that is their ideology; and that is what these bills are all about. I commend the amendment moved by the member for Dobell to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), sticks around to hear a few of the facts instead of his wild imagination which we have just had to listen to. The future of Australia's health 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system depends upon an effective public sector and a revitalised private sector. The mess left behind from years of neglect under Labor has placed the responsibility of rescuing Medicare from collapse firmly with the new coalition government. Simultaneously, there is an interdependent need to encourage Australians, especially young families and the middle aged, back into private health cover.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government ignored the significance of the private health sector and remained unresponsive to the desire of Australians for a choice in health care services. Ironically, this approach jeopardises the viability of the system as a whole&mdash;and Labor got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983, 65.1 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. After 13 years of Labor, this figure had dropped to 33.6 per cent. The human costs associated with this departure from the private sector has resulted in extended waiting lists and declining levels of service in the public sector to the point where Australians were subjected to the absolute tragedy last August in Victoria where 124 patients waited on trolleys at St Vincent's Hospital for more than 12 hours in emergency&mdash;such is the pressure on our public health system while beds in the private sector remain vacant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of South Australia, the figures are amazing. The failure of Labor to maintain a competitive and viable private health sector meant that by September 1996 only 502,000 South Australians had private health insurance&mdash;this was less than half the number of policyholders in 1982, which totalled over 1,030,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the growth in long-term and youth unemployment figures, these figures are the most damning evidence of Labor's incompetence and neglect. The legislation before the House today, however, is one measure in keeping with the coalition's election promise to address the structural crisis in the health system inherited from Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill acknowledges the role private health services have to play in getting the balance right to ensure a high standard of health care for all Australians. The bill provides incentives for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1301"> people to purchase private health insurance and, therefore, lift the weight of demand on public health services. Between 1984-85 and 1994-95 the contribution of the private sector to total health expenditure had increased from 8.8 per cent to 10.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medicare remains the centrepiece of Australia's health system but its effectiveness is directly dependent on a strong private sector. For the Labor Party to market themselves as the great champions of a national public health system and then remove the private hospital bed subsidy and Commonwealth contribution to the private health insurance fund reinsurance pool shows just how confused they are over what a viable Medicare system requires to remain successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shift in demand to the public sector during the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting from Labor policy, threatened the entire health system and resulted directly from inaction over the decline in numbers of those with private health insurance. The turnaround will cost $491 million next financial year and $609 million in 1998-99. In the current climate of fiscal restraint to haul in Beazley's black hole, this expenditure is testament to how seriously the government takes the rescue of Australia's health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government, in stark contrast to Labor, is prepared to take the tough decisions to reverse this trend. The private health incentives scheme and the complementary initiatives, such as the Medicare levy for high income earners, will halt the slide away from private health insurance. These reforms may take time to reverse trends, but at least they mark the end to Labor's do nothing approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the pure economics of the government's reforms, I also believe it will take time for Australians to again recognise the value of the partnership of viable private and public health sectors. This is not solely dependent on the government. This legislation also provides the private health sector an opportunity to regain lost markets and improve consumer relations and management practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The spiralling cost of health insurance premiums remains, however, the major hurdle 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for most Australians entering or returning to private health insurance. As reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> last September, 44 per cent of Australians believe private health care is too expensive. It is not hard to see why. Almost 850,000 people over 65 have private health insurance. Most are on a fixed income. Over half a million of these people with incomes below $20,000 per annum have had to cope with spiralling premiums. Those people wanting to receive the premium reduction may obtain information from their participating health scheme. Alternatively, if people choose to receive the tax rebate they can pass on the details of their membership in private health schemes when they complete their records for the Taxation Office. The ATO will then adjust the applicant's final refund or liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the beginning of July this year singles earning under $35,000 a year will be entitled to up to $125 each year to help pay premiums. Couples earning up to $70,000 may receive up to $250. Couples earning less than $70,000 with a child will receive up to $450 per annum. Consistent with the government's efforts to assist families, this income threshold will increase by $3,000 for each additional child. What constitutes a couple or a family unit for private health insurance purposes will be left up to individual health funds, and that will be the basis of registering the couple or family for the incentive scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has estimated that these measures have the potential to affect five million Australians, and the previous speaker should have listened to that. The incentive payments will cover two components of health insurance: hospital insurance; and ancillary cover, including optical, physiotherapy and other non-hospital items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, these measures will encourage those already in private health schemes to remain there. I believe that this may provide a much needed breathing space for the sector to induce stability and long-term planning. Secondly, they will encourage many Australians who have not formerly thought about taking out private health insurance to do so&mdash;many for the first time. Some of these Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1302"> tralians will be high income earners. It has been estimated that 50,000 families on incomes in excess of $100,000 do not have private health insurance. The Medicare levy surcharge will be an additional contribution of one per cent of the taxable income of high income earners. It will apply to singles earning over $50,000 per annum and couples or families earning over $100,000. This levy will be over and above the 1.5 per cent Medicare levy already paid by eligible Australians. It will apply only to high income earners who choose not to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will be the second dimension of the government's attempts to rebuild membership of private health funds. Those affected will be able to avoid the surcharge by taking out at least hospital cover with a private health fund. This is a tax, however, that the government would prefer that no-one has to pay. Most health funds offer basic hospital cover at a rate less than the amount the person would otherwise have to pay as a surcharge liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is expecting about 70,000 high income earning single people and 65,000 couples and families to join health funds as a result of this measure. It is estimated that this measure alone will increase the participation rate in private health insurance by 1.5 percentage points. This should be considered a positive development as the costs of advances in technology and the pressures of an expanding ageing population increase. As the minister has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our strategy will work on two fronts. Lower and middle income earners will be able to claim an incentive payment if they have private health insurance, and the higher income earners will face an increased Medicare Levy surcharge if they do not choose to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The legislation before the House today affirms this government's commitment not to simply remain idle while Australia's health system is destroyed. The government is dedicated to a strong national public health system and a complementary and effective private health sector. If the truth be known, the coalition have far better credentials as the managers of Australia's public health system because of,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All members would remember the nonsense being circulated by Labor at the last election that the coalition would destroy Medicare if they were elected to government. Today, almost a year after coming to office, this government has begun introducing a series of measures aimed solely at rescuing Medicare. I cannot, indeed would not want to, imagine what the future of Medicare would have been had Labor won office. The former Minister for Human Services and Health, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), asserted that Medicare could survive without a private health system. This is clearly not the case and indicates the inability of the former government to grasp the fundamentals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since Medicare was first introduced, Labor's withdrawal of subsidies to the private health sector has been responsible for the bulk of premium rises. It has been estimated by the Productivity Commission's private health insurance inquiry that Labor's attack on private health is responsible for around 30 per cent of the current levels of insurance premiums. The AMA has also estimated that the cessation of the contribution to the reinsurance pool has had a $220 million effect on cost shifting and the cessation of private hospital bed day subsidy a further $235 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The immediate effect of premium increases has been the spectacular drop-out for persons under 65. The subsidisation of the reinsurance pool in particular reduced the cross-subsidy required from low claiming members. The over&hyphen;65 age group now represents 13.6 per cent of the total insured market. These changing demographics of those holding private health insurance are the worst possible result if the intention is to keep premiums low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Statistics on Medicare usage show that females aged over 75 years are five times more likely to use medical services than girls between the ages of 10 to 14. In the AMA's submission to the Productivity Commission it was noted that:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1303">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elderly people not only have relatively more health problems requiring hospitalisation, they also need longer time to recover from major procedures and require greater length to stay. As a consequence, the age variation in the use of hospital service is far greater than for medical services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our younger population between 21 and 35 need to be given far more encouragement to take out private health insurance, especially those who can best afford to do so. This can happen only with a coordinated approach by government and the industry being more effective in its marketing and in providing a service that is deemed reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been more recent nonsense from the opposition benches to the effect that the recent increases in private health insurance premiums have eroded any benefit which this legislation would provide to low and middle income earners taking out private health insurance. I remind members opposite that, under Labor, premiums rose by an average of 12 per cent and that between 1986 and 1988 premiums rose by a massive 40 per cent. The resulting reduction in private health membership by a further two percentage points increased demand on the public sector by over 320,000 bed days. Labor have this record, yet they can still come into this chamber and berate us for trying to revive the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, increases in premium levels will remain a fact of life until the exodus of those with private health insurance is stopped. It is interesting to note that in the last June quarter the private health insurance industry made a loss of $40 million. The opposition health spokesman, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), stated in August last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone in Australia knows that if you're providing a tax concession for people with private health insurance, that helps the private hospitals and people in private medicine. What I'm concerned about is the waiting lists and the delays that are taking place in our hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This statement shows his total lack of understanding of the situation. Graham Richardson had a better understanding, because he has already told us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Convincing the Labor Party that the rapid decline in the number of Australians who take out private health insurance is any sort of problem is a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difficult task . . . Labor health ministers are not allowed to believe that the decline in private health insurance is anything other than a vote of confidence in Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The previous speaker should have listened to this. Returning to Graham Richardson, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are also not allowed to believe that the public hospital system will ever find itself unable to cope with the influx of formerly insured citizens, which one day will create one hell of a problem.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How right he has proved to be. The cynicism in Labor criticising these measures is also hard to understand. At the last election Labor offered a family health rebate of up to $500 to families on an income up to $63,700, including a component of $350 to assist with private health insurance premiums. In principle, is there a huge difference between this position and the government's legislation? I do not believe so, except that under Labor's policy the elderly, single people, the chronically ill and couples without children missed out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's opposition to these measures is politically hypocritical, ignorant of industry needs and completely unresponsive to the crisis in Australia's health system&mdash;a crisis which was created by them and a crisis which this government is setting about fixing up. I commend the minister for his dogged determination to push a broad range of reforms and in taking these tough decisions. I am aware that my colleague is ready to speak, so I will finish there and commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence my comments today on this private health insurance legislation by reminding the House that if there has been one specific area of policy in which the Liberal and National parties have in modern times failed to deal with adequately then it is the area of health policy. As the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) interjected during the contribution of the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), in 1990 the then Liberal Party spokesperson on health matters, Peter Shack, one of the rather infamous predecessors of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), summed up quite succinctly in what was proved to be one of the most 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1304"> famous press conferences in Australian political history when, prefacing the launch of the coalition's health policy for the election of that year, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, I want to say to you, with all the frankness that I can muster, the Liberal and National parties do not have a particularly good track record in health and you don't need me to remind you of our last period in government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a quote which I am sure sends shivers up the spines of all those opposite. Despite having had a subsequent six years to formulate a workable and an effective policy, and the experience of two further electoral defeats, the members of the Liberal and National parties in government in 1997 appear to have little more idea than their colleagues in the dark, old days of their long stint in opposition during the 1980s and 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was one simple theme which ran through many of these years of wandering aimlessly through the policy wilderness it was the coalition's unerring faith that the answer to all our health care problems lay in private health insurance&mdash;a simple, easy solution that required the government encouraging people to take up private health insurance through the use of subsidies. The government has shown that it intends to pursue this process as a part of a two-pronged approach to Australia's health system. The first prong is the introduction of the public health insurance incentives and changes to the Medicare levy contained in these bills. The second prong is indeed far more sinister and involves the dismantling by stealth of the Medicare system, perhaps one of the best systems in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government announced its plans last year in the budget to introduce subsidies which will give a tax break, as the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has said, of some $1.7 billion to the private health insurance industry. The Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, went to great lengths to assure the House and the Australian public that the full benefit of this $1.7 billion would be channelled back into the pockets of contributors and that, indeed, we could be assured from that comment that his intent was not to pay that money in some unscrupulous way back to the health funds.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we were then treated to the spectacle of the minister being made to look like something of a fool by the very industry that he so generously rewarded when in the following days after the budget announcement the private health funds announced major price increases in their premiums to the extent that in some cases the rebate would be totally absorbed by the price hikes some 10 months before the contributors would be in receipt of their rebate relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it were not for the hardship that many people had to endure to meet the new premiums, even with the benefits of these new rebates, the quick succession in which the major funds upped their premiums appears to be a rather satirical reflection on the way that this insurance industry works. In August of last year, HBA in Victoria and Australian Unity increased their premiums by six and 8.6 per cent respectively. This was followed shortly afterwards by a whopping 17.5 per cent increase in Manchester Unity's premiums. These increases  make the sorts of increases acceded to by the ALP in its term of government pale into insignificance. In October, HBA increased its premiums in a range of states by nine per cent and, in November, timed of course very nicely to be shrouded by the glory of Bill Clinton's visit, Medibank Private and MBF announced increases of 12.9 per cent and 15 per cent respectively in their charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has become glaringly obvious, even to this point, that the $1.7 billion which was to be allocated as a rebate to the health system by the government in its last budget announcements has not fulfilled that objective. Providing that $1.75 billion as some sort of tax break has in practice turned out to be nothing more than a very expensive taxpayer subsidised handout for the private health insurance industry&mdash;one which has little or no financial gain for those who need it most, they being the low income Australians the government expect to take up health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to think just how much more efficiently $1.75 billion could have been used and spent on ensuring that all Australians have equitable access to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1305"> quality health services. It could have been spent, as the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has so lucidly pointed out, on measures to reduce waiting lists and to improve the quality of health care in both public and private hospitals in the Australian system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having pinned such faith in its policy of encouraging people to take up private health insurance through tax incentives, the minister had set a target of getting 40 per cent of Australians to take up private health insurance. It seems that this figure was at least more than a little too ambitious. Now the government will settle quite happily for the current private health insurance take&hyphen;up arrangements to remain stable.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then again, if you look at last week's figures showing another fall in private health insurance from 33.5 per cent to 32 per cent, and if those figures are any guide, the government's new private health insurance arrangements and initiatives do not appear likely to achieve even the government's most modest take&hyphen;up objectives and expectations in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of private health insurance funds who have dropped out of those funds in the last few months are doing so despite having received letters spelling out the government's new tax rebate initiative. Clearly, this is an early vote of no confidence in the government's health policies by the Australian electorate. Indeed, even the Department of Health and Family Services has estimated that, at best, the measures contained in these bills will only add a 1&half; per cent increase to the level of coverage of private health insurance, which will only increase from 32 per cent expected in July 1997 to 34 per cent before stabilising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government asked the Industry Commission to investigate and examine the matter of private health insurance and its report was subsequently quite expectedly critical of the tax rebate scheme. The Industry Commission in its report predicted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net budgetary cost of the incentives is likely to be quite large.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is because most of the people who will receive the incentives are already insured and the commission estimates that those people who do take up private health insurance as a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> result of these incentives are likely to be the lower users of the public health system anyway. It then went on to explain that the government will spend $560 million a year on these incentives, leading to savings of around $240 million. This means the government will be wasting $320 million, money which is desperately needed in our own health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To recap, the coalition quite clearly in its election policy before the last election stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentives will not be funded from the public health system or health grants to the states. Other than the $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This has been added to a litany of government broken promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget last year cut grants to the states by some $1.5 billion over three years, effectively meaning a cut of around $500 million to the states' health funding. There were also direct funding cuts to public hospitals of more than $300 million over four years. When these cuts to hospital funding are added to the $500 million taken from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the $400 million saved by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program, we see that the incentives are almost entirely funded by cuts to health services, completely opposite to the government's election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell, has ably pointed out, the $800 million taken out of hospital funding could quite easily have financed 1,000 beds in public hospitals or some 66,000 operations, which no doubt were badly needed. I am sure that the Australian people had expected, with the appointment of a doctor to the health portfolio, that this government would take a more responsible, more understanding and more compassionate approach to the issue of health funding than have their state colleagues. My own state of Victoria springs to mind. As has been pointed out by the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) in his contribution, in Victoria they put budgetary bottom lines ahead of providing decent health services. How disappointed voters in that state must be now.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why the opposition has moved an amendment to ensure that any extra revenue raised by the increase in the Medicare levy for those on higher incomes who do not have health insurance is used to increase federal government spending on public hospitals. The opposition recognises the crucial role that private health plays in our system, contrary to the exhortations of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) yesterday. Hence, we accept the substance of these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a balance must be kept because many Australians, particularly those who for financial reasons have little choice in the matter, will continue to rely on the public health system for their basic underlying health needs. Hence, this government&mdash;in fact, any government&mdash;has a responsibility to ensure that the public health system receives the necessary funding to fulfil this most fundamental of roles. The ALP has always accepted this responsibility, and the amendment moved by the shadow minister for health clearly demonstrates that this is one principle which we will never depart from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major initiative contained in these bills is the imposition of a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge on individuals who have taxable incomes above $50,000 per annum and on families with a combined income of $100,000 per year who do not have private health insurance. This measure will increase the Medicare levy to 2.5 per cent of their taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this measure will be that a single person with a taxable income of $50,000 per annum will pay an extra $500 through the Medicare levy, while a family on an income of $100,000 or more will be hit for an extra $1,000 per year if it does not take out private health insurance. Unlike the incentive measure, the government made no mention of the Medicare levy surcharge in its 1996 election policy. It did, however, make much of its promise not to increase taxes. This is something else we can add to its litany of broken promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also neglected to index the income levels at which the penalty takes effect. By way of bracket creep, more people will be affected each year as their income 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rises. It is doubtful that this measure will either force many people to take out private health insurance or raise much in the way of revenue for the government, as people with higher incomes have a much greater level of participation in private health insurance than do people on lower and middle incomes. Hence, the measure will affect a relatively small number of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, only some 16.3 per cent of families with incomes over $70,000 per annum are uninsured compared with 53 per cent of families within the income bracket $20,000 to $29,000 per annum. As I said earlier, the first prong of the government's health policy is the introduction of these private health insurance incentives and changes to the Medicare levy contained in the bills before the House today. The second prong is, as I have already said, far more sinister and involves the surreptitious dismantling of the Medicare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990 the coalition&mdash;or at least its hapless shadow minister for health, Mr Shack&mdash;promised to leave Medicare intact because they were honest enough to admit that they could come up with no workable alternative. In 1996 the coalition promised to leave Medicare intact because they knew that that was what the voters wanted to hear. Immediately upon being elected to government in 1996, they began the long process of breaking this promise by slowly dismantling, brick by brick, our most cherished Medicare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is taking a carrot and stick approach to health policy, the carrot being the tax rebates, the stick being not only the increased Medicare levy as a penalty to high income earners who do not subscribe to private health insurance but more importantly the cutting away at the edges of Medicare. Indeed, last year's budget saw a 66 per cent increase in the maximum in&hyphen;patient payment for rebates, up to $50; arbitrary limits placed on psychiatric benefits; cuts in IVF funding; and the failure to index GP's fees for inflation, resulting in many doctors abandoning bulkbilling. Brick by brick, we see the dismantling of the Medicare system by stealth. Goodness only knows what we can expect in next year's budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1307">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I reiterate my earlier remarks that the opposition supports a significant level of private involvement in the delivery of health and health insurance services&mdash;again, contrary to the protestations of the member for McPherson in his contribution yesterday. But this can never be at the expense of the public system on which so many Australians will continue to rely despite these bills. I commend the bills, as amended, to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fundamental conundrum facing policy makers in the health portfolio can be best put as follows: at a time and even in circumstances when Australians are healthier than ever, living longer and with medical practitioners who can cure and treat more diseases with greater effectiveness than ever before, 43 per cent of Australians believe that health services in Australia are getting worse, not better, and 58 per cent of Australians believe the public health system to be in a state of crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are some of the sobering results of the Morgan/MBF <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Healthwatch</EMPHASIS> survey published in March 1996, when the Howard government took power. They indicate the size of the task which confronts the government in providing a basis for a workable and affordable health care system for the 21st century. They clearly show that, in an era when medical expertise is steadily improving, public confidence in the public health system is steadily eroding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The perceived problems of the health care system identified by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Healthwatch</EMPHASIS> survey are such as waiting lists, inadequate staff numbers, hospital closures and lack of funding. These are all symptoms of an industry whose resources are seen to be strained to the limit. These perceived problems in Australia's public health system are all symptomatic of a sector which is far too reliant on the public system, with insufficient involvement by private health insurance. As Mr Ross McLeod recently put it in the summer edition of the ANU publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agenda</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . although the charming fiction of near-free access to health care for everybody has been sold to voters in numerous election campaigns, time has shown that we are not prepared to be taxed heavily enough to make this possible. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task of governments in reality has been to find an electorally acceptable balance between taxing us to pay for Medicare, and winding back the quality of health treatment available to Medicare users.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1983, some 66 per cent of the Australian population held private health insurance as their primary means of financing their health care needs. Today, that figure is down to around 30 per cent&mdash;a remarkable drop indeed. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> , as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, reports that 300 people a day are dropping out of private health cover. The decline in the number of Australians financing their own health care through private insurance has meant that the public health system cannot absorb the demands on its resources without showing clear signs of strain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every media current affairs show and every state opposition across Australia can seemingly produce endless horror stories of patients dying while on waiting lists, a patient discharged too early, an ambulance taking too long to respond to a call for help or a small country hospital forced to close its doors as a result of government cutbacks. The political system has engineered the popular myth that our health sector is in decay when in fact the standards of health services enjoyed by Australians today are extremely high by historic and international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our reliance, however, on the public health system is due in large measure to the easy availability of the publicly funded Medicare system. We have bulk-billing GPs on every metropolitan block. Today's front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> also reports that the number of visits to GPs has almost doubled since the introduction of Medicare&mdash;something that I have brought to the attention of this House on many occasions. Pharmaceutical subsidies provide easy access to expensive medicines. There is free hospital admission. Also, high-tech radiology and pathology services are being provided virtually free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increasing life span of the population has also played a role in the raising of health care costs. Improved technology and increasing expectations by the community about what constitutes an adequate standard of care, particularly in the latter stages of the lives of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1308"> individual Australians, are also factors which will see Australia's health care expenditure rising as a proportion of GDP. The easy attractiveness of the public system and the effects of demographic change have been compounded by decisions of the previous government, which starved the private system of funds. In particular, I refer to the Commonwealth's withdrawal from the reinsurance pool, the reduction of the in-hospital Medicare rebate from 85 to 75 per cent and the abolition of the bed day subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this backdrop, a key priority of the Howard government has been to stem the flow of people away from private health insurance through direct financial incentives. The Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and other associated bills at present before the House are the legislative enactment of the coalition's stated policy intention to attract individuals back to private health funds. The strategy is two-pronged: low and middle income earners will be granted a tax rebate for taking out private health insurance and the very high income earners will incur a tax penalty through an increase in the Medicare levy, if they choose not to take up private health cover&mdash;a very desirable incentive and, I think, a very well thought through policy which has been debated for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax rebates will be available to individuals earning less than $35,000 per year and to families earning less than $70,000 a year, although these income thresholds increase by $3,000 for each dependent child. There is also the option of taking the incentive in the form of a payment made directly from the government to a health fund in return for guaranteed lower premiums. For a single person taking out hospital cover with ancillaries, the incentive is worth $125 per year; for a couple that figure rises to $250; and for a family the incentive is worth $450.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initiative will cost the government an estimated $1.7 billion over a four-year period in return for an estimated increase in private coverage of anywhere between two and five percentage points. Meanwhile, the tax penalty for high income earners applies to individuals with income over $50,000 or families with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> income over $100,000&mdash;again, a very worthwhile incentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This initiative completes the carrot and stick approach to the private health incentive package, both encouraging and providing incentives for individuals to join private health insurance programs. These high income earners will pay an additional one per cent on the Medicare levy if they choose not to be privately insured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to estimates by the Department of Health and Family Services, approximately 110,000 singles and 100,000 couples will be affected by the measure, and around 67 per cent of this group will join the private health system as a consequence of these recommendations before the parliament. The remaining 33 per cent will pay the increased Medicare levy, netting $60 million to federal government revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings to the government from a small rise in private insurance are only modest and the revenue from the Medicare levy surcharge will also be minor. It is clear that the incentives package will have an overall negative impact on the budget bottom line. So, in effect, it arguably costs more to attract patients out of the public system than it costs to treat them there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, there are very important justifications for private health insurance rebates. Firstly, attracting patients to the private system does have the net effect of improving the overall freedom of choice, which is a very important aspect of the coalition's philosophy, given that the private system offers choice of both doctor and hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the privately insured already pay health care three ways, which many Australians do not fully understand. They pay through the Medicare levy (sometimes they understand the actual cash figure and sometimes they do not); they pay through the general taxation system&mdash;and the shadow minister at the table, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), would have no idea exactly how much is involved in that particular figure; most Australians and most members of this House do not fully understand the total figure that is taken out of taxation revenue to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1309"> pay for the health system&mdash;and they pay through their own health insurance premium, of which they have a very clear and exact idea because they pay the cheque. In effect, they pay for the insurance of others who are not medically insured as well as for themselves. The imperative of fairness demands that they be provided with some relief in recognition of this fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, moving to the private system creates a greater individual awareness of the true cost of medical services. That is a point that I have argued both here and in other forums. Individual Australians will greatly appreciate what the cost of their health is and they take some responsibility for their own health because they make some payments which they are aware of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Free access to the public health system completely masks the true cost of hospital stays and medical procedures. Moreover, very few people can tell you how much they pay in income tax or the Medicare levy, which I have just mentioned. By contrast, most can tell you the size of their insurance premiums, their doctors bills and their hospital bills in the private sector. By moving away from the public system, we create a greater awareness of, and transparency in, the true cost of health care in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The predicted overall benefits to the health system of these incentives are modest, but we do find a competitive and alternative system. They have certainly never been put forward as the sole solution to Australia's health care woes. There are already calls from a number of quarters for more far-reaching reform to both the private and the public health sectors to address the fundamental underlying problems facing both the government and the health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect of the system being subjected to increasing scrutiny is the principle of community rating, whereby all members of the health fund pay an identical premium based on the average risk profile of the fund's membership. The alternative&mdash;actuarial rating&mdash;would involve a system where individual premiums reflect the actual risk of individual members. As members would be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aware, car insurance is a good example of this approach to insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under community rating, the low risk contributors subsidise the high risk contributors. Unfortunately, the net result of community rating has been to discourage the young and fit from belonging to private funds. The membership of private funds has become older, less healthy and more likely to require medical help. Premiums have inevitably risen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989-90, people over 65 accounted for 10 per cent of health fund membership. Today, that figure has risen to 14 per cent. No doubt in future years that will rise to a higher figure because of the rising demographic age of the older people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent Productivity Commission report into the private health insurance industry recommended some provisions for funds to offer incentives to the young and fit to join the funds. That debate has been around over the last 10 years about providing some mechanism to get the younger, fitter members of the community into the funds. Such provisions could include lower premiums for loyal members&mdash;referred to as `lifetime community rating'&mdash;a no-claims bonus, longer waiting periods for pre-existing ailments and penalties for the hit and run fund members, such as those who join a fund just before getting pregnant. Those initiatives would not be controversial. Most Australians would agree with the fairness implicit in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agenda</EMPHASIS> article by Mr Ross McLeod of the ANU put forward an innovative model for a health care system based on a move away from community rating towards a system of actuarial rating along with subsidies to the elderly, the chronically ill and the low paid for their insurance. Those subsidies would be higher for the higher risk groups and the chronically ill as well as being linked to income so the low paid would get more assistance than the well&hyphen;off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be freedom for the funds to offer tailored packages and every incentive for the young and fit to join a fund. I notice that there are comments in today's press about funds being able to attract those people who have a desirable lifestyle in that they do not smoke and keep reasonably fit. Again there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1310"> should be some incentive for people to join the funds if they adopt that particular lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distinction between public and private hospitals would disappear. Both sectors would simply compete with one another to attract patients. Mr McLeod says that this proposed model is an example of the sort of legitimate community debate over possible future models for our health system, which could inject greater competition and more efficient allocation of resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private health insurance incentives before the House are important. However, they will not solve overnight the underlying problems faced by the private health insurance industry or by Australia's health system as a whole. It will require more debate, more discussion and possibly some far-reaching reforms. We need not have declining confidence in the health system at a time when medical standards are steadily improving. There is absolutely no reason for Australia to have anything less than a high quality, affordable and highly regarded system of health for the 21st century.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a former minister, I am very keen to speak on these health bills, not least because during the election campaign, when the then opposition announced this policy, I had the prescience to very clearly indicate what would be the weaknesses of this proposal. They are weaknesses that have not been amended in any way by the legislation that we now see before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, in February 1996, I indicated that these tax rebates in particular would be a hoax&mdash;a very cruel hoax, indeed. I intend to outline in some detail why that is so. In the long-term, if people were to take up private health insurance as a result of these so-called incentives, they would be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition also clearly misunderstand the contract that was entered into with the Australian people when Medicare was introduced. Medicare was designed to be a universal system that everybody would share in, regardless of their wealth. It was deliberately designed for that purpose. It was deliberately designed to reduce the number of people with private health insurance&mdash;many of whom 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could not afford that private health insurance, many of whom had no cover because of the system that existed at the time. The idea was that through progressive taxation, where the rich pay more, and through the Medicare levy, where the rich pay more, there would be a system that all Australians could share in. Indeed, the wealthy in the community would contribute more of their income to ensure that the less well-off would have a quality system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These so-called incentives&mdash;as applied to all of those people who currently have private health insurance&mdash;do not purchase, as I said in February 1996, a single extra operation or a single extra bed. You are applying $1.7 billion of taxpayers' funds to all of those people who currently have private health insurance&mdash;in most states, about one&hyphen;third of the population. About two-thirds of the population pay this $1.7 billion. I said at the time that, before you get the first extra person into private health insurance, you actually spend an enormous amount of money without buying any extra health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that, if families were inclined because of this incentive&mdash;which is very modest in terms of the total cost of private health insurance&mdash;to see this as a reason to take up private health insurance, many of them would be financially crippled by the private medical bills the first time they had a major operation, or any operation, in a private hospital. As members should be aware, the rebate would be gobbled up by the gap between what the health funds pay and what Medicare pays and what specialists actually charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since you cannot control doctors' fees&mdash;and constitutionally that is probably correct&mdash;what you are offering people is a rebate which is immediately gobbled up the moment they have their first major operation. Those fees are, on average, 17 per cent higher than what they get after Medicare and their health insurance funds pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think people would be seduced&mdash;and they already are in many cases&mdash;into taking up private health insurance when they cannot afford it. It should be a matter of choice, not of necessity. That means you have to ensure that the public health system is in good order. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1311"> Medicare is designed to protect those families from those extra bills. That was precisely what it was all about. It was understood that our taxation would pay for Medicare and, through it, every Australian should have access to high quality care according to their need, not according to their wealth. This policy&mdash;as it was announced before the last election and is now effected in this bill&mdash;does not do that. It robs Medicare of $1.7 billion, and it has done that&mdash;explicitly and directly outlined in the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that at the time when we said, `Where is all this money going to come from? It is a very substantial bill that will have to be paid here, purchasing not one extra bed, not one extra procedure; where will it come from?' during the election campaign in the coalition's health policy <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Healthy Future</EMPHASIS>, we were told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentive will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">an explicit clear promise: `not be funded from those sources'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other than $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice Program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What did we see? Just the opposite. The entire $1.7 billion is funded from the health budget, including grants to the states and including funding from hospitals. I think it is worth reminding members of those cuts&mdash;cuts over four years, totalling $312.7 million, to hospital funding to abolish so-called cost shifting. I know the shadow minister has already spoken about it at length, but it hardly makes sense, when hospitals are struggling, to take $300 million from them over that period. A further $450 million is the effect of cuts to states grants. That is a direct breach of this promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the dental health program&mdash;straight out of the health budget&mdash;saves $399.4 million. There is a number of other measures, including medical work force changes. We do not quite know what the total cost of those will be these days, there have been so many shifts. They will also freeze the Medicare rebate&mdash;$238 million.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In total, it is just about the amount required to pay for these private health insurance premiums. In other words, the less well-off in our community, the people who need things such as the public dental health scheme and access to public hospitals, are funding these rebates, these incentives. So that is a very clear breach of promise and, in my view, very bad policy. It shows that, although they snuggled up to Medicare during the election campaign&mdash;they wanted to say that they really did approve of it&mdash;the government did not understand it. The government did not understand the principle of universality, of everyone sharing in a high quality system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that we have already seen&mdash;again, I said this in February 1996&mdash;is that if families do choose to have private health insurance the policy will push up premiums by blowing out the costs of specialists and private hospitals and, hence, blowing up the premiums they are required to pay. That has already happened. We have seen very substantial increases in the premiums right throughout the country in the order of 13, 14, 15 and 16 per cent, and there is more to come. This is an uncapped price. Doctors can charge whatever they like. Hospitals, with some exceptions, can push up the prices too, and there is no restriction on the health funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you get your rebate, that is fine, but within the first six months it has already been dissipated by the fact that the cost of the premium is now 15 or 20 per cent higher than it was when the rebate was introduced. Not surprisingly, people are continuing to drop out of private health insurance because they can see these consequences. I think what the population of Australia has demanded in the past, and should continue to demand, is a universal sector which is properly funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it needs to be said that the kind of policy&mdash;again, I said it in February 1996&mdash;that subsidises the private sector at the expense of the public sector would take us down the road of the United States route, a system which costs American taxpayers twice as much as it does us in terms of their gross domestic product but still leaves approximately 40 million people without any health 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1312"> insurance at all. I will return to that point in a little while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are extremely foolish if we adopt a system which cripples the public sector and leads to a two-tiered system, the private part of which is far more expensive. This is currently the case: per procedure, per bed day, the private health sector is more expensive than the public health sector. So we are substituting a more expensive system for a less expensive system. That does not make economic sense, and it certainly does not make health sense. What we have seen here is certainly the implementation of a policy in part, but funded at the expense of the public system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess we could ask why this is so. Why has the government got this so thoroughly wrong when it said it actually supported Medicare? I think it is worth going back through a bit of history, because we need to be reminded where the conservatives have been on this issue for a very long time. They do not change their stripes&mdash;whatever they might like to say publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we got into government in 1983, the health system, by everyone's assessment in this country, was in a shambles. It is a shambles we look set to return to, sadly. Under Fraser and Howard the conservatives lurched through five chaotic health systems in seven years&mdash;five changes as they progressively dismantled Whitlam's Medibank. Again, they had promised not to do it, and they did. When the electorate finally rejected Fraser, Australia had gone from universal access to services based on need so&hyphen;called&mdash;the sort of thing that we are hearing now&mdash;to the confusion and injustice of a two&hyphen;tiered health system where income was again the main determinant of the quality of health care received. That is the direction in which we are heading again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fraser's claim that he would keep Medibank had more to do with the name than with anything else, because he successfully dismantled it. By 1983, Fraser and Howard had gone back to the fifties&mdash;something they seem set to do again&mdash;to the basic principles that had actually been adopted when Earl Page was minister for health; to the harsh view&mdash;we heard it again here a moment ago 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from one of the members&mdash;that health services are essentially discretionary and that, by and large, the user should pay. Under the coalition at that time, until we got into government in 1983, only health care card holders were eligible for special assistance from the government. It was welfare medicine. Everyone else was either forced into private health insurance or took their chances. A lot of people had to take their chances because private health insurance was too expensive for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond the very disadvantaged, those without insurance received no government assistance at all, regardless of their ability to pay. As a result of this, over two million people had no health cover at all. This was supposed to be the golden era of private health care&mdash;one that members opposite obviously want us to return to. You would have to say that, at the time, every sharp operator in the private health sector could make a profit under Fraser and Howard. The conservatives spent billions&mdash;as they are planning to do again in a slightly different form&mdash;pumping bed day subsides into private hospitals, making contributions to the reinsurance pool for the private insurers and paying for high cost patients the private insurers did not want. In other words, they were encouraging cream skimming. The public hospitals had to deal with all the complicated cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also provided tax incentives for health insurance&mdash;again, we are returning to that&mdash;to benefit high income earners and they set free, it has to be said, unfettered fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service medicine, which is often attached to Medicare quite unjustly. All this was provided at the expense of the taxpayer, so rich and poor alike paid for it. At the same time, they neglected the interests of ordinary Australians. Over 400,000 middle income families struggling to make ends meet had neither insurance nor access to Medibank. They could not get in either way. Free access to public hospitals was restricted to the very disadvantaged, to say nothing of the lack of information and the confusion that ordinary Australians then faced in trying to sort out what was best for them and their families. We are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1313"> seeing that develop again&mdash;a complex system; unnecessarily complex and expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To add insult to injury at the time, the special purpose grants established by Labor to fund free public hospital care were rolled up and handed back to the states through general revenue sharing agreements. Again, we are seeing pressures in this direction under the current government. The states were not actually required to spend the funds on health, let alone on public hospitals. But even here the conservative user&hyphen;pays ideology dominated their support for state's rights. In handing back responsibility for the hospitals, they actually tried to force the states to introduce user charges for their public hospitals by discounting funds by the amount the Commonwealth minister for health deemed should have been raised through a hospital charge to each state. So they punished them at the time if they did not have user charging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mercifully, in my view, Labor's election in 1983 put an end to this health debacle and brought relief and peace of mind to most ordinary Australians&mdash;something that they subsequently embraced very strongly. It was quite the opposite of what the then Leader of the Opposition said of Medibank. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this . . . scheme goes through this generation will be passing on a vast failure and those who vote for it will regret it. . . . It will bedevil the future. It will reduce the standard of living for generations to come.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He has been shown to be absolutely wrong about that. Indeed, in time the conservatives realised that they had to embrace Medicare too if they were ever to get into government. But should we believe that? In my view, we should not. This legislation in a sense confirms that lack of belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go back through what those in government said while they were in opposition, it is very clear that they have not changed their tune since they were in government. Despite the fact that a great majority&mdash;over 90 per cent&mdash;of the community were satisfied with Medicare during this time, the conservatives were saying that they were going to pull Medicare apart because it was a mess. In the four elections previous to the last, they opposed Medicare as a matter of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy. In three of the four they had detailed plans for dismantling it. On the other occasion&mdash;in 1990&mdash;they made such a mess of their costings that immediately before the election their spokesperson, Peter Shack, announced that they would have no policy at all for that election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and over again through this time in opposition, they argued for the abolition of bulk&hyphen;billing (it is interesting that they are now doing that by stealth); limited access to public hospitals to the disadvantaged (they are now doing that by cutting direct funds to the states and to hospitals); increasing the Medicare levy (they are doing that for one section of the population); the introduction of compulsory fees; the introduction of unaffordable tax breaks for private health insurance (they are doing that now); opting out of Medicare in favour of private health insurance (they are pushing people in that direction as well); reducing the Medicare rebate (it has been frozen); providing subsidies to health insurers and private hospitals (we have not quite seen that yet); and allowing unfettered gap insurance (they do appear to have retreated from that particularly stupid idea).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the whole of his political career, John Howard, now the Prime Minister, has been an opponent of Medicare and universal health care. One of his first acts when he came to this parliament was to vote against Medibank in the first half of the 1970s. In the early 1980s, when he was Treasurer, he was behind dismantling it. He opposed it again in the late 1980s as opposition leader, and again in 1993 with Fightback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is worth quoting some of the Prime Minister's own words on this. In 1987, in particular, he was not afraid to show the Australian public what he thought of Medicare. He said, quite bluntly, Medicare was a failure. Medicare was a failure, in the view of the Prime Minister. Along with words like `incentivation'&mdash;remember that?&mdash;Howardspeak gave us phrases like `Medi&hyphen;mess' and `Medi&hyphen;queues'. He was fond of using those phrases. I must say that what we have in 1997 from the Prime Minister is `Medi&hyphen;fraud'. But one of the most revealing examples of what the Prime Minister actually 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1314"> thinks of Medicare was given in a 1987 address to the Private Hospitals Association. It reveals what he really thinks. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare, a mandatory national monopoly service, has degenerated into a second rate service and failed the great majority of Australians. I give you an undertaking that a Howard Government would break the monopolistic stranglehold.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard said he believed Medicare had become an `administrative quagmire'. It was a `financial monster' and a `human nightmare'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I think the sudden love that has developed between the conservatives and Medicare is not to be believed. Is the Prime Minister a man who has seen the light after listening to the people? Has he gone back and thought hard about what he was actually proposing during his time in government and previously in opposition and said, `I was actually wrong about this'? Not at all. It is about as believable as Homer Simpson renouncing beer and television. The Prime Minister is a man who might be prepared to cap his teeth, clip his eyebrows, get new glasses, update his suits and get his colours done, but he is not a man who changes his philosophy on this or any other matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very clear in warning the Australian people of that during the election campaign and they need to be reminded of it at frequent opportunities as we see Medicare slowly dismantled. The coalition's support for Medicare has been and is cosmetic, as these bills clearly show. They simply do not understand the basic principles that underlie Medicare and, in funding it as they have done in explicit breach of their promises all from Health and Family Services, they have shown that they are embarked on a course of shifting the balance of health care in this community away from that universal provision towards provision based on wealth. I hope that is something that Australians will reject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Prime Minister is fond now of talking about the battlers. The battlers&mdash;those people who do not have high incomes and who have families and a good many responsibilities&mdash;are in fact the people most hurt by this, because in taking out private health insurance with these modest incentives, they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be forced to pay much higher bills than they pay at the moment in the Medicare system. They would be forced to meet expenses that they do not currently have to make. But I can understand them being concerned about the state of our public hospital system in particular, as they have seen since the early 1990s conservative governments at state levels significantly reduce the amount of funding in public hospitals. Yes, there has been cost shifting and yes, I did complain about it, but that was directly the result of the fact that state governments&mdash;conservative ones particularly in Victoria and New South Wales&mdash;removed some $700 million over that time from the public hospital system. What is this minister's remedy for that problem? To take out even more than that&mdash;a further nearly $800 million, if you add up the cost to states grants and the direct removal of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our public hospital system is straining at the seams. There is no doubt about it. Any state you go to in this country is having a great deal of difficulty meeting the demands upon it, not because of the number of people who have dropped private health insurance but because of the very direct, explicit policy of reducing funding to public hospitals in order to push people into the private health system. That has been the explicit agenda of many of the conservative premiers and health ministers. They have been have open about, indeed. They wanted to put people who, as they say, can afford it into the private health system. But can we as a nation afford it? We simply cannot afford to move in the direction of having an uncontrolled private sector partially funded, as it is already and further funded as it will be, from the taxpayers at the same time as we wind down the cheaper, more effective, more equitable and universal Medicare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I think this is an ill&hyphen;considered set of policies, one that will do nothing to improve the state of the health of this nation and the delivery of health services. I will certainly be doing my part, along with the shadow minister, in drawing to the attention of the people of Australia precisely what the effects of this government's policy on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1315"> Medicare are. They are not converts in supporting Medicare; they are going to dismantle it by stealth.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been fascinating listening to this debate over the last couple of days and the wide&hyphen;ranging expertise offered by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), to whom I listened with great interest last night. I would like to put politics aside for a moment and take a look at these initiatives and ask: will these measures actually help improve Australia's health system, which we all admit is in a state of some crisis?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that the answer to that question is yes, but I also believe they will not go far enough in addressing one of the most serious problems facing our health system and that is the mass desertion of people from the private health system. I think overall they are a step in the right direction. I think the general public is well and truly sick of seeing the nation's health system being used as a political football. While elderly people in our community are forced to wait months for basic orthopaedic surgery, such as hip and knee replacements, for many years now we have seen the political leaders take advantage of the problems in our health system and use them as political capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, the people of Australia have had enough of this pathetic politics that simply goes around in circles and gets us nowhere. In my electorate, for example, waiting lists for non-elective surgery have been reasonably long for the past decade. Governments of various political persuasions have come and gone in that time. Each side has blamed each other, state or federal; each side has promised to do something about it once in government, but nothing has changed and it continues to be that political football.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it reached the utmost level of absurdity just before the last state election in New South Wales when Bob Carr, the Premier, and Andrew Refshauge promised to resign unless hospital waiting lists were halved within 12 months. None of us really expected them to keep that promise, even though the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> figures were juggled to suggest that the figures had in fact been arrived at. Those of us who have watched the game of health politics for many years knew all along it was a Clayton's promise. The thing is that the public knew, too. They know that their politicians are not about to admit the crisis that is facing the political parties in this country, they realise that it will be used as a football and they want answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our health ministers and shadow health ministers have been underestimating the public's intelligence on this issue for far too long. There are several important factors we need to keep in mind when discussing health in the country. First, we still have one of the best, if not the best, universal health systems in the world. The member for Bradfield alluded last night to his recent visit to the UK where two deaths a day are attributed to waiting lists on which people are waiting for critical, urgent surgery. Two deaths a day is almost the benchmark that has been agreed on as sustainable and politically acceptable. Pray we never get to a state like that in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly there are major areas of concern in Australia, such as the poor health standards amongst the Aboriginal population, but overall we have it pretty good&mdash;or have had until now. But crunch time is nigh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, as we all know, it is becoming more and more expensive to maintain this health system, and in some respects it is a bottomless pit, because increased technology and improved life expectancy inevitably mean higher health costs. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) alluded to the fact that, when he was shadow minister a decade ago, the costs of the health budget were $7 billion and that they are now in the order of $19 billion. He suggested a scheme then that perhaps the 18&hyphen; to 50&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds might be supporting the rest in some sort of quasi&hyphen;Medicare private health system that sounded pretty idealistic, even coming from the member for O'Connor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could possibly double the health budget again and still be battling waiting lists and battling to pay for new and expensive wonder drugs. I notice the Minister for Health and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1316"> Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is in the House. He took a brave decision late last year to allow those Medicare patients suffering MS to access betaferon as a publicly funded drug on the list; otherwise those patients would be paying in the order of $20,000 per annum, for what is a very debilitating and widespread complaint. That cost immediately is transferred to the public health budget, and that is the sort of medical technology cost we have out there at the moment that we are trying to cope with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What impact has the cost of organ transplant surgery had on the delivery or the ability of state governments to deliver adequate health services to the country areas of New South Wales or elsewhere in Australia? It is a huge transfer of cost to the new technology that the major political parties have not been prepared to admit is a realistic expression of why the health budgets are so high. So we have to challenge it; we have got to attack it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be nice if we, the political leaders, could put the politics aside and deliver to the Australian people the type of health system they expect, or at least as close to it as we can, with the amount of money we have available. To do that, we have to raise the dollars through a reformed tax system and stop the overservicing and overuse that bleeds the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people have shown the one thing they value most is the Medicare system, which is one of the great legacies of the former Labor government. They showed it strongly to the people of Australia in the 1993 election when they rejected John Hewson and the coalition. I believe in Calare that rejection was as much about Medicare and the threat they perceived to that system as it was a fear of the GST&mdash;those fears so shamelessly exploited by a desperate Labor Prime Minister. That election demonstrated how much Australians do regard Medicare, and it would be a very brave federal government which ever dared to tamper with Medicare in the future or allowed the free marketeers to take hold of the system where not only the healthy but the wealthy are the ones who survive. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Medicare will continue to grow. More people&mdash;indeed, more reasonably well&hyphen;off people&mdash;will continue to say no to taking out private health insurance. We must encourage otherwise. The member for O'Connor last night alluded to the fact that the old will be the only ones who access private health cover if we do not add more incentives to the system. And this is true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He spoke after the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who said that his daughter had been sick as a baby and in an emergency had been flown to Sydney for special treatment; and, of course, Medicare looked after her. At the sickest stage of my life, I was a Medibank patient&mdash;the forerunner of Medicare&mdash;and I landed in Sydney Hospital. But for the experience and the expertise along Macquarie Street, I would not be here talking today. I had an amoebic abscess on the liver which was quite unusual in those days. It was just fortunate that I was in Sydney Hospital. I had the greatest medical technology available in Sydney and I survived the illness. Medicare picked up that bill. Today I still ensure that I take out private health insurance, unlike our former Prime Minister, because I believe that I have a responsibility to not overburden the public system. That may be naive. It may be far cheaper for me to take the sorts of risks that the healthy take and just rely on the public system, but I choose not to. And so do many others in the community&mdash;many people who are of reasonable means and some who are not&mdash;and they deserve every incentive we can offer them to access that private hospital and private health insurance system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crisis was most obvious when the former Prime Minister announced that, while he was on a high income, he saw no need to have private health insurance. Many Australians heard that and thought, `If it's good enough for Paul Keating, it's good enough for me too.' The problem is that this country's health system simply cannot survive on Medicare alone&mdash;that is, of course, unless we want a major hike in the Medicare levy or we claw in more tax receipts. That avenue is there, but the political will is not. As the member for O'Connor pointed out last night, the emerging pattern is that only the elderly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1317"> and middle aged left with private health insurance will be there, with the young and healthy all relying on Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Really there is nothing evil or wrong with the private health insurance industry. It must be remembered that the bulk of health insurers in this country are non&hyphen;profit organisations there to serve their members. The one big exception is National Mutual, the third biggest insurer. Thanks to the previous government, it is now a private company and, like so many of our successful companies, now in foreign hands. This is perhaps one blight on an industry that is otherwise there very much for the public good and to serve its members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate, we have the outstanding example of the Lithgow based Western District Health Fund which has its roots in the trade union movement in Lithgow where it originally started serving miners and other workers. Today, Westfund has expanded throughout western New South Wales into the western suburbs of Sydney offering its members a wide range of services, including access to its own optical and dental specialists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's cutbacks to dental services funding has caused major problems in other parts of my electorate, particularly in those areas where there are no dentists and no public transport. Elderly people will lose a service that is not a cost to the budget, as this government thinks, but a proactive health initiative that would save scarce health dollars by keeping these people healthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this cutback has occurred, thankfully, and thanks to this well&hyphen;run local private health insurer, the people of Lithgow, or at least some of them, still have access to an affordable dental service. But in Lithgow, like elsewhere, more and more people, egged on by the former Prime Minister perhaps, have voted with their feet and stopped taking out private health insurance. Many of your old&hyphen;time miners in Lithgow can well remember the days, even before Westfund, when their pay was docked each week and the money would go towards paying a local doctor. Such was the danger of working in the mines that people valued their local doctor that much and their health. It was a different type of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> health insurance but it worked and it did ensure that the people of Lithgow actually had a doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years, like so many country towns, Lithgow has been struggling to keep doctors and to replace the ones who retire due to old age, or would have retired years ago but cannot because they cannot find people to replace them. And Lithgow is only a couple of hours from Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of many health problems facing rural and regional Australia that needs to be addressed urgently. It is probably peripheral to this particular bill but it is a problem that has been raised for many years now. We have been made many promises but we are yet to see any real changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe that the linking of Medicare provider numbers with a community is not a feasible way of attacking this problem. It is not conscription; it is public service by the medical fraternity. Lithgow is a good example of how much our health system has changed in just a couple of generations. It has gone from the era of miners being docked to pay for a local doctor who could set broken bones and do somewhat primitive surgery at the local hospital, to today when anyone seriously injured in the Lithgow district is flown by a helicopter retrieval team to one of the major hospitals in Sydney, and at enormous cost to the system. The vast amounts of money involved in funding these retrieval teams could not have been imagined earlier this century but these costs impact on the sort of service that can be delivered to rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I commend the thrust of these initiatives we are discussing, but I think we are going to need much bolder measures if we are really going to tackle many of the problems. It will be interesting to see later this year what effect these initiatives do have in encouraging people to take out private insurance. I suspect that the impact will be minor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What we are talking about here is a carrot and big stick approach&mdash;the carrot in the form of incentives for low income earners and the big stick in the form of a tax penalty for people earning more than $50,000 a year who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1318"> do not have private insurance. People are simply going to look at either the incentives or tax penalty and say, `Will I be better off with private health cover or will I stick with Medicare?' Sadly, I think in most cases they will vote with their feet and decide to stay with Medicare and either forgo the incentive or, in the case of high income earners, pay the extra tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at a single person, the minimum private health cover is around $800 a year. The incentives being offered for low income earners will go nowhere near paying that amount even now, and they are not indexed to inflation, so they will become even more worthless as time goes on. As for the penalties, you would have to be earning more than $80,000 a year, according to my estimates, to make it worth while to take out private cover. I reiterate that I am still talking about basic hospital cover. Even then, many may still decide that they are better off sticking with Medicare alone because they will not be stuck with paying the huge gap between the health fund rebates and specialists' schedule fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure we can all tell stories we have heard from constituents who have been caught out&mdash;trapped in the gap, if you like. In my electorate a privately insured patient from Orange recently had triple bypass surgery. At the end of the day he was a little saddened, bewildered and angered to find he had a bill of $1,000 or thereabouts to pay. His mate from Broken Hill went down for a similar operation at the same time on the Medicare public system. It did not cost him a brass razoo. What incentive is there in that to be privately insured? There has been no incentive to date. Sadly, these incentives will still not be enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those I have spoken to in the private health insurance industry say that even if this incentives bill is wildly successful, at best they would estimate the number of people privately insured could go up by about 10 per cent, realistically about three per cent, and they concede this figure could well be far less as publicity continues over the recent increases in fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will have to look at further measures over coming years, such as giving 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fringe benefits tax exemption. As well, the taxation break for those who take out private cover must be expanded to induce more to take that option, but it must not be funded by cuts to the public hospital system or the public health care system generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I make mention of Lithgow, one of the things that people of that city do not want is the closure of their local Medicare office. It is the smallest in New South Wales but it is also a very busy one, serviced by a dedicated staff. They do not want to lose this service but they are very scared they will and uneasy because, I am told, it is on the itinerary of every Labor politician who passes through the central west. Whenever they pass through, they all traipse through the Lithgow Medicare office to try to terrify the staff into thinking that Dr Wooldridge wants to shut them down. It seems that everyone from Kim Beazley down has visited Lithgow Medicare. If visits by ALP luminaries count for anything, Dr Wooldridge would never dare shut it down. It gets more Labor visitors than Ben Chifley's cottage up the road in Bathurst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jokes aside, the people of Lithgow do value their Medicare office. While the pharmacy agency services, soon to be trialled by the government, are great in small towns where there has been no access to a Medicare claim service, they are certainly no replacement for a fully functioning Medicare office.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I have been critical of the government replacing face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face services with 1800 lines for taxation, social security and Austudy services in the bush, I welcome this use of technology in remote areas where ready access to counter service is not available.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1319"> out of larger towns which already have a Medicare office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills are a step in the right direction. These private health insurance incentives go very little of the way to restoring a sustainable health system. The Productivity Commission says that the grounds for excluding all those who opt to self&hyphen;insure are `weak and could be re-examined'. The rebate will not help the health budget one dollar. Savings to Medicare through this narrowly targeted rebate will fall well short of the costs of the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As others have said, private health insurance has dropped from 65 per cent to 33 per cent since 1983. The private health funds are in crisis and facing huge loss. There are accusations of cost shifting both ways&mdash;from state to federal and from federal to state&mdash;in the increasing number of geriatric patients now housed in nursing home wings of country hospitals. No-one is blameless in the increasing crisis that is the health care system in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the amendment moved by the member for Dobell, which is more a comment on the government's overall budgetary approach rather than a constructive amendment to this bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take only a few minutes to sum up this morning. First of all, I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution to this debate on health insurance. I apologise for not being able to hear them all in full. I also thank the member for Calare (Mr Andren) for his thoughtful contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing the debate, I want to say how important these bills are for the future of the health care system in Australia. It could not have been summed up better than by the Premier of New South Wales last weekend&mdash;although, it would have been very nice if he had done something in the last couple of years rather than wait till now. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exodus from the private health insurance system was costing New South Wales public hospitals $246 million a year as they struggled to meet the swelling demand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He released New South Wales health department figures to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> , which revealed the number of New South Wales residents with private insurance had plummeted by eight per cent in only three years. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As fast as we hurled money at the hospitals, there was a further abandonment of private health cover and a further rise in demands on the public system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is absolutely spot on. What these bills are about is twofold: first, giving the Australian public choice, which has to be an essential part of any health system; and, second, trying to do something to stem the dropout over the last 10 years from private health insurance. I believe this will do it. I cannot promise a massive turnaround. I can promise though to try to stop the two per cent dropout a year of which Mr Carr is complaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I could just put the money into public hospitals, but I am a bit jaded by the experience of the last four years. While the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) talked about what the states took out of public hospitals, she was actually minister for much of that time and was completely powerless to do anything. Right around Australia the Commonwealth's contribution over the life of this Medicare agreement to hospitals has increased steadily. The states' collective contribution to hospitals has decreased. It is okay to whinge, berate and jump up and down, but the net effect of that was zero. Before I would consider putting additional resources into state public hospitals, I would want to have some assurance that the experience was not going to be just that of the last four years when, before putting extra resources in, the Commonwealth found that the states just took resources out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of that is that that is treating the symptom, not treating the problem. The problem is that we have had a mixed stable system of private and public health provision in Australia that is under threat because of the decline over the last decade. If I just keep putting money into the public system I am not treating the cause of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1320"> the problem. If I can stop the dropout from private health insurance, if I can do no more than retain those people already in private health insurance, it will go a long way to meeting Premier Carr's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has several parts&mdash;and there are amendments that we will have the opportunity to talk to in detail. The government does have some amendments. The reason for that is that, since introducing the legislation in December, we have worked fairly hard to refine and shape the mechanisms by which the incentive system will operate. We have consulted with industry, with consumers and with the Health Insurance Commission and, as a result of this process, we have developed a number of amendments which have been circulated. I will formally move those in the consideration in detail stage. The main effect of this, if I may foreshadow it, is that it will enable applicants to make a simple declaration rather than a statutory declaration of their income eligibility for the incentives. This will make the system much easier to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum. I again thank honourable members for their contributions. This bill, when it is passed, will be the beginning of turning the tide. I cannot say that it is everything that needs to be done to health for the next 10 years. I can say that it is a step in the right direction and I can say that it is very long overdue.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason the opposition is moving these amendments is that we want a firmer assurance built into the legislation that these income limits are going to be indexed each year. These amendments simply seek to adjust each year, using the total average weekly earnings index, the income limits that are in the legislation for this private health insurance incentive. We think that is the most appropriate index, given that we are talking about limits on individuals' taxable incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has a bit of a chequered history on indexation. I am sure many people will remember that back in the 1970s, when the now Prime Minister was the Treasurer in the Fraser government, there were certain promises to the Australian people to introduce full indexation of the income tax thresholds. At subsequent budgets, the then Fraser-Howard government walked away from those promises to index each year the income tax thresholds. As a result, we know that Liberal government promises about indexing various income thresholds are often not kept.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the likely event that our arguments cannot convince the government to accept our amendments, we will be seeking assurances from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that amendments will be made each year to increase these income limits. We would also be interested to know which indexes the government would use in determining what these limits would be if the government went down the alternate path of increasing them in subsequent budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly believe that if the government is not prepared to accept our amendments to index the thresholds each year then that is a sign that it is not genuinely committed to ensuring that as many Australians as possible do have access to the private health insurance initiatives. I will leave my contribution at that and see whether the minister can surprise us by agreeing to accept our amendments or by providing perhaps some other comfort on how the government intends to adjust these income levels each year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be accepting the opposition's amendments. In fact, the income limits that we are proposing in this bill are even more generous than what we promised in the election. I accept that it may be fairly silly of us not to have got the full benefit of that during the election, but when we chose to look at how we would physically manage this there was great merit in aligning the income limits with the income limits in the family tax initiative. That is what we have done and that is why there are further income concessions for each additional child. So the income limits were determined on the basis of the family tax initiative, and the family tax initiative is not indexed. The opposition did not seek to make amendments to the family tax initiative to index it, so to have two different income limits would be simply unworkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just make two points in passing. The first is that the income limits are very generous and, off the top of my head, I think they apply to something like 85 per cent of Australian families already. The second point is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1323"> that in Labor's own health policy, when they were offering rebates for incomes up to $63,766 a year, which is some 10 per cent lower than we are proposing, they themselves were not proposing to make indexation there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might speak a bit longer on this occasion and go through a number of issues that I would be grateful if the minister could respond to during this consideration in detail. First of all, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) during his contribution was commenting on the Lithgow Medicare office and, in an interjection across the table, I thought the minister said that he had not given any guarantees to the honourable member for Calare that Medicare office would remain open. I would be grateful if the minister could confirm whether that is the case&mdash;or any other Medicare offices in that member's electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding that certain claims have been made that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has given assurances to the honourable member for Calare that is the case. I would hate for the minister to be misquoted&mdash;certainly in the electorate of Calare. If he could clear that up, I would be grateful, because on one other occasion I asked him if any members of parliament or senators had been given assurances that their local Medicare offices would remain open and on that occasion he said no, they hadn't but that people would be consulted before final decisions were made. In particular, I would be grateful if he could clear up the issue as to whether any commitments have been given about Medicare offices in the electorate of Calare. If other commitments have been made to other members or senators, I would be interested in those as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also noted in the minister's summing up in the second reading debate that he said that the government cannot promise there will be a massive turnaround in the number of people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1325"> who take out private health insurance as a result of these measures. He also used words to the effect that this would be the beginning of the turning of the tide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that, at the time of the budget last year, a number of documents made public said that it was the government's expectation last August that this Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill would result in a two per cent increase in the number of people with private health insurance and that the Medicare levy would result in a further 1&half; per cent increase in the number of people with private health insurance. It was expected that it would fall to as low as 32 per cent, but the government's line in the sand as of last August was that by 1 July, when these measures cut in, 35.5 per cent of the population would have private health insurance. I would just like the minister to confirm whether that is still the government's expectation at this time or whether there has been a change in the expectations that were published last August. If the minister is to be judged by 35.5 per cent, I am happy to do that. If it is now a level which is much lower than 35.5 per cent and that has changed since last August, could he please explain to us why he has now adopted a more pessimistic attitude to these issues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point I would like to ask is how the minister explains the fact that these measures have been funded by reductions in federal funding for public hospitals, abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program and reductions in funding for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, given that before the last election the minister promised in `A Healthy Future':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentive will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other than the $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, given that undertaking before the election, I am wondering if you could perhaps explain to us why you have funded this $1.7 billion tax break for private health insurance by an $800 million cutback in federal funding for public hospitals, a $500 million cutback 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in funding for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and a $400 million reduction from the forward estimates by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program, which is clearly a breach of that undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, before the last election you and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised to retain community rating. As recently as last August, when the Prime Minister established the Productivity Commission inquiry into private health insurance, he instructed the Productivity Commission not to look at the question of community rating, that community rating was sacrosanct and would be retained. That was the Prime Minister's position then. He said the Productivity Commission could not look at that. I am now wondering how you rationalise the pre&hyphen;election commitment and the direction of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and yourself to the Productivity Commission that they could not look at this issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does the minister rationalise today's front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which has him signing off and personally approving a supplementary submission at the very last minute to the Productivity Commission which supports the introduction of so-called lifetime community rating? Do you argue that this version of lifetime community rating is in keeping with the promises you gave before the election? If your department's submission is successful, it will result in older people having to pay more and many people having to wait longer, having to pay premiums to health funds for up to five years, before becoming eligible for rebates and benefits. Isn't this a complete breach of the undertakings that the Liberal and National parties gave before the election, and as recently as last August, to maintain community rating?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, and finally, would the minister confirm that to be eligible for the private health insurance incentive people will have to complete a 15-page form? Could the minister please explain why it is necessary to provide 15 pages of details before people are eligible for a rebate as basic as this?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister and member for Dobell (Mr Lee) raised a number of points. I suspect Medicare offices are beyond the scope of this bill, but what we are trying to do, for which I make no apologies, is to provide better access to people for Medicare services. The demand for Medicare offices is immense. I cannot conceivably meet the demand for Medicare offices. I am very concerned that a large part of rural and remote Australia has no access whatsoever. They are the people I am trying to assist. The pharmacy agency that we are going to trial first up on Friday and which we hope to have in place by May will, over the next three years, give 400 communities that have no access at all at the moment to Medicare some access. So that will be a plus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to which Medicare offices are likely to close, no final decision has been made. We will be endeavouring, wherever possible, to not in any way disadvantage rural communities. We have not made a final decision on the number, and we have certainly not made a final decision on the location. I have given people an undertaking that I will consult with local members before the final decision is taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have found that we can progress the trials and the offices without having to close any at this stage. There will be some closures, but I am hopeful they will not be some of the wild numbers that have been bandied around. It is nice to know that the Lithgow Medicare 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> office is getting such good attention from Labor members of parliament. I suspect that the member for Calare (Mr Andren) is very happy with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the electorate as a whole, I expect that it will be substantially better off because a lot of people who live in small communities in that electorate have no access at the moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any assurances?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have to check. I have no recollection of giving assurances. To be fair, what I have said to people is that there is a lot of speculation around and that I think they will find the end result proves a lot of the speculation wrong. Some people may have taken that to be assurances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second comment the shadow minister picked up on was that this would not lead to a massive turnaround. In the end, when you calculate the costs of something like this, one has to make judgments. As the shadow minister would know, having been in government, those judgments are not necessarily made by your own department but by departments of finance and treasury. I must say that I have a degree of scepticism about some estimates. Before the election we had these initiatives independently costed by an independent firm of economists. They predicted 40 per cent would be the level of coverage because of these incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never thought that was right. I never used that figure as any sort of public undertaking. Nonetheless, to give the documents credibility, and so it would not suggest that we were fudging the figures, we accepted the figure and costed it on that basis. That was very difficult because it ended up costing us more than it might have otherwise. I have always said that we will try to put a floor under the dropout from private health insurance. That will be a hell of a lot better than any minister has done in the last 12 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first aim is to stop the dropout and stop the two per cent that is causing Bob Carr, other state premiers and state health ministers so much difficulty. The second part is the one per cent surcharge, which is very important. We can better predict that. That will probably 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1327"> increase the level of insurance by 1&half; per cent, and that will be a big plus for older people because it will help bolster community rating. The third point the shadow minister raised was whether this was being funded by budget cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LEE" NAMEID="MG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the public sector. The fact is that this stands on its own. There is no hypothecation. Again, as the shadow minister would know from being in government, Treasury is loath to hypothecate anything. This was fully funded prior to the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we found after the election was that the undertaking the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) had given that the budget was in surplus was in fact incorrect. There was a very substantial deficit and that had to be met and the government had to live within its means. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The last thing I wanted to do was spend the best part of last year trying to find savings in the health portfolio, but that is totally unrelated to these incentives. These incentives were funded prior to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth point the shadow minister raised was on community rating. Community rating is a system whereby people are not discriminated against on the basis of illness or on age. I did see the reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper. People should not always believe what they read in newspapers. The department did say in the submission to the Productivity Commission that we would like to look further at lifetime community rating. This is something I have said consistently over a period of time. I do not move away from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fundamentally unfair that someone who is 65 years of age and has been in private health insurance for 40 years has no additional benefit over someone who is 65 years of age and has decided they do not need private health insurance but suddenly take it out because they might have a need. If the shadow minister wishes to have that debate in public I would be very happy because I think it is one in which the public will strongly support the government. That said, no final decision has been made and it is something 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we are looking at further. It may or may not eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, in trying to look at fairness, I think fairness suggests that those people who have made an effort to look after themselves over a prolonged period should have some benefit. For the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> to say that premiums will go up for older people assumes no change in the current membership base, which is not necessarily correct, and also ignores the fact that older people are paying more than they need to now because of just that sort of person. I had someone in my office the other day who is 87 years of age who said, `I have just taken out private health insurance for the first time. I have not needed it up to now but at 87 I might need it.' That is very nice for him but that is one of the reasons that premiums are so high for everybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, for someone who decides to join a fund just because they want to get pregnant&mdash;they only intend to stay in it for a very short period and drop out as soon as they have pulled as much money as possible out of the funds and hence from other contributors&mdash;I think is quite wrong. We would not be doing our duty to the Australian people if we did not look at that. As I said, no decisions have been made and I have no idea how the Productivity Commission is going to respond to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the shadow minister asked about a five&hyphen;year wait. I guess I have answered that in a sense because I have no idea what the Productivity Commission will say in the end. We put a point of view that it is something that should be examined further but I would think it would be unlikely, quite frankly, that will happen. Is this is a complete breach? It is absolutely no breach whatsoever. We intend to maintain community rating. The only thing that has undermined community rating in the last decade is the dramatic dropout from private health insurance that the previous government presided over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the shadow minister asked about the 15&hyphen;page form. To be honest, I had to take advice on this. I understand that was a very early draft. My department is usually pretty good on these things. Perhaps that was not their greatest day when the 15&hyphen;page draft 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1328"> came out. I can assure you that the final form will not be 15 pages.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go through those points in roughly the same order. The opposition is working to try to keep our comments on this legislation to a minimum. I appreciate the answers the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has given, while I might not accept some of the claims and logic behind them. First of all, on the Medicare offices in the electorate of Calare, the minister said that he would have to check that matter. I would be grateful if he could go one step further and give us an undertaking that he would check that matter and advise us as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, the reason I am raising this is that, in your name, the member for Calare (Mr Andren) has been claiming that he has an assurance&mdash;I do not know whether it is from you or from your office&mdash;that there will not be any closures in the electorate of Calare. Knowing that he is a person of good name and a person who in the past I have found to have not made misleading claims, I would be surprised if he would say that without having had some communication with you or your office. I would be surprised if he would make that claim having only spoken to someone in the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the Labor Party has been beaten up by the member for Calare on this particular issue, if you are not personally aware of any assurance being given, I am a bit intrigued as to what assurances have been given to the honourable member for Calare. I think the people who work at the Medicare offices in that electorate and the many constituents of the honourable member who use the Medicare offices would be grateful to know what the position is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Calare is being treated the same as every other electorate and we do not know what the position is and more work has to be done, I will accept that. If an assurance has been given to the honourable member for Calare that there will be no closures in his electorate, I will also accept that, but I would like to know what the real position is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I would briefly like to revisit is the minister's statement that he has always 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believed that the private health insurance incentive would simply put a floor under the drop&hyphen;out rate and would stop any further reduction in the number of people with private health insurance. He also used a very King Canutish expression in his summing up of the second reading debate when he said that this legislation was `the beginning of the turning of the tide'. I am sure the minister hopes that in a year's time he is not King Canute with water up to his knees and approaching his neck if we continue to have people leaving private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My surprise this afternoon is that I had thought that your own department's documents, released about the time of the budget, suggested that by 1 July, as a result of the publicity around the introduction of the $1.7 billion incentive and the introduction of the Medicare levy penalty, you and your department had expected that there would be 35.5 per cent of Australians with private health insurance. Today you are simply saying that you want to stop any further reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent figures had us down to 33.2 per cent, so the minister seems to have already moved the line in the sand from 35.5 per cent to 33.2 per cent or lower&mdash;a reduction of 2.3 per cent. If the minister has already given up on a further 2.3 per cent of Australians in the period from August to now, then I would like to know the reasons why he is so pessimistic that the centrepiece of the Liberal health policy, which is costing Australians $1.7 billion, is already suspected of having failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, if you cannot achieve the target of 35.5 per cent that you set last August, won't you now admit that the Productivity Commission were right when in their interim report they said that we could have reduced hospital waiting lists better if we had spent the money directly on public and private hospitals rather than giving everyone&mdash;whether they use the health service system or whether they go to their doctor or hospital&mdash;a reduction? I would be grateful if you could address that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on community rating, I would be grateful if the minister, having explained why he believes that his commitment to community rating is not breached by his department's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1329"> support for the introduction of lifetime community rating, could please point out to me and the House any one occasion before the last election when he explained that this government was intending to introduce a lifetime community rating system&mdash;a system that will mean elderly Australians will have to pay more, a system that will mean they will have to wait longer, and a system that ultimately will undermine our private health care system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I could get out of Canberra I probably would. Turning to the second point, which I accept is a point of some substance, as to what we expect this to do, my recollection is that the figures were actually related to 1 July 1998 not 1 July 1997 and that we allowed some time for the incentive to take place. I am pretty confident that is correct because the incentives will not have effect on the first day they come in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the shadow minister is concerned about what the total level will be, clearly he will pass all parts of this bill, including the high income surcharge. If any figure that my department might have predicted is not achieved and the opposition is instrumental in defeating the high income surcharge clearly it will be the opposition's fault that that was not achieved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not given up on 2.3 per cent at all, but I have been fairly consistent in trying not to promise something that I may not be able to deliver. I think people are sick of politicians over promising, making overblown promises, and I do not intend to do it. Why am I so pessimistic? I am not pessimistic. It will turn the tide and give us breathing space. I will be very disappointed if the rate of insurance continues to drop from whatever it is on 1 July 1997. I think what we need to do is put a floor under things and that will give us some breathing space. Clearly, there will be more things that need to be done and we are looking forward to the Productivity Commission report to try to help us on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why am I so pessimistic? To be honest, I have to say that I am not going to be so silly as to give you something to beat me around the head with every day. I am going to make modest promises and we will see what happens. I have been consistent in doing that since before the last election. If we can't achieve a target? Well, we make predictions on which to fund it, but let us see what happens. It will not be a failure at all if we can give the public health system some breathing space. Bob Carr recognises that. Peter Beattie recognises that. The only people who are not generous enough to realise that are the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why didn't I spend the money directly on public or private hospitals? In the world of pure economists I can understand why the Productivity Commission did that. If the shadow minister wants an honest answer, because we did consider this, it is that we do not trust the opposition. The fact is that we used to have a bed day subsidy and you abolished it. What we are doing here is something that you are going to find very difficult to abolish when you, or should you, become the government in the future. I want to do something that is going to have a longlasting effect on the private health sector and, hence, on the public health sector as well. It will be far too easy for a future Labor government that, on its track record, clearly does not like the private sector to just abolish a bed day subsidy to the private sector in the future as it did in the past.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1330">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on the issue of community rating, lifetime community rating is something that I do not think quite honestly detracts at all from the notion that people should not be discriminated against on the basis of illness or age. There are real difficulties in bringing it in; it may not happen. There is a certain degree of sovereign risk if you try to implement something that might have a 40&hyphen;year time horizon. It would be negligent of us not to look at it. But if we do not look at things like this, in the end community rating dies because if you have young, fit people continuing to drop out, which is the net result of the last 10 years of Labor policies, old people get hit with ever spiralling costs. That is what will destroy community rating. That is what I am trying to fight against.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am certainly interested in any evidence that the government advised the Australian community that this was on the agenda before the last election because for the life of me I cannot find it. I suspect that before the last election you and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;the then opposition leader&mdash;said that you would maintain community rating. All of us thought it was the existing system of community rating. I would be very interested if there is any evidence that you did foreshadow the introduction of this form of lifetime community rating.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support the amendments put forward by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), in responding to a couple of points that the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) had made. We need to remember what the purpose of community rating is. It is to see that high risk people and older people can afford access to the private sector through insurance. The rebates to which this legislation gives effect increase the affordability of private health insurance and thereby assist those people in particular to remain in it, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> especially as the rebates are targeted at low income people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point that needs to be made to the member for Dobell is that, thanks largely to the policies of the previous government in withdrawing its support for the reinsurance pool and bed day subsidy and in forcing the funds to pay a quarter of the Medicare benefit schedule fee, there has been a decline in private health insurance in the last four years, since the time when Graham Richardson, at the time the participation rate was at 39.5 per cent, said that we needed to move fairly urgently. The government and the minister would be irresponsible in not looking at the regulatory environment as well as the cost of the premiums, which are in effect of that regulatory environment. So I think any responsible government and any responsible minister would quite reasonably look at, within the confines of community rating, some initiatives which increase the affordability of private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has said that no decision has been made on this, but I must say that, if you can offer a package which makes it quite attractive for 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;old people to come into private health insurance and remain in it for a lifetime, that clearly helps defray the costs for higher risk individuals who are struggling to maintain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also ought to be remembered that under the previous government Medibank Private, for example, was offering its select and save package so that young people could buy packages that did not include coverage for hip replacements, cardiac bypass surgery and even mental illness. That, of course, is very much pushing community rating to the edges. So I think the member for Dobell, if he is sincere, as I am sure he is, in wanting to see that people do maintain their private health insurance and increase coverage, should remember that the government needs to reasonably look at changes in regulation which increase affordability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister mentioned, for example, people buying private health insurance because they are pregnant. Today in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> is a story of a family who took out private health insurance three months 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1331"> before the lady in question became pregnant because she was intending to become pregnant, and now they have dropped their private health insurance. Whilst they had every right to do that under the present legislation, the people who have suffered from that are the people, as the minister has said, who have been in private health insurance for 40 or even 50 years, who have rarely had any claims at all and who now are in a high risk category. These people are now having to face escalating premiums because of what are known as hit and run contributors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make to the member for Dobell is that the so&hyphen;called reductions in public hospital funding over the forward estimates relate largely to cost shifting initiatives. The minister, unlike his predecessor, now on the other side, has had the courage to actually take the cost shifting issue on. All the previous minister wanted to do was to get the AFP and the Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue doctors who were involved in cost shifting. The minister has now removed from public hospital funding what we conservatively estimate will be taken out in the form of cost shifting and has implemented initiatives to recover that money. These things are all very sensible, and I think the opposition ought simply to be supporting this legislation and doing what it reasonably can in the interests of the community to see that we have a private health insurance system that is sustainable, and that is what the minister is doing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just picking up on a couple of points the minister made earlier, I am happy to accept in good faith the minister's assurance that the target date for 35.5 per cent was 1 July 1998. I will hold him to that, rather than 1 July 1997. I think it is fair enough, Minister, that we seek to have some measure of the performance of this initiative, given that it is going to cost the taxpayer $1.7 billion. If the whole aim of this incentive is to allegedly take pressure off public hospitals and it is costing the community $1.7 billion, then if the minister cannot achieve the targets he is setting himself it will be pretty clear that this initiative has failed. As not only the Industry Commis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sion but also the AMA and others have said, and I have argued, perhaps the government should have given greater consideration to spending this massive sum of money directly on reducing hospital waiting lists. So, Minister, I am prepared to accept your assurance that it is 1 July 1998.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last question that I would like to put in consideration of this bill is that this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> has the minister saying that the government will be retaining this initiative indefinitely into the future. The minister alluded to this in his statement earlier, saying that he wanted to lock this legislation in for future governments. I hope that is not too far away but he said `for future governments'. I would just like the minister to confirm that the funding for this will appear in forward estimates for the indefinite future, given that the government remains committed to funding this not just for three years, as previously maintained, but for the indefinite future.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am deeply concerned that people who have been attempting to look after their own health care and to make some contribution to their own health care have had such a rough time for the last 10 years, and this measure is an equity one.

The opposition does not believe that we should punish the members of private health funds because of the government's errors and therefore we will not be seeking to oppose the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my speech on the second reading I did address 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some remarks to this then anticipated amendment and I again express my gratitude to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) for giving me some advance knowledge of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My interest embraces two particular concerns. The first is that, by raising the threshold from $1,000 to $1,500 before which subsequent expenditure over that threshold may then attract a 20 per cent tax rebate, the government has in fact invoked an increase of some 50 per cent. That of itself is remarkable. But, more importantly, I am concerned for those not so well off in our community who under present arrangements have to spend more than $1,000 after Medicare refunds and even private health insurance refunds in any one year. For someone battling, to have to dig into their pockets to meet expenditure in excess of $1,000 at present, or $1,500 as it is to be, they have really had a bad year, and to be deprived of some small relief by way of the 20 per cent tax rebate for up to $500 is going to make that bad year just a little bit worse. I wonder whether on equity grounds it is fair. I suppose if it were means tested&mdash;heaven forbid, given the complexity of that&mdash;it might satisfy my concerns, but there will be people not so well off in the community who will have to meet, without tax relief, expenditure of up to $500 more, and that is to be regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of my interest in this proposed amendment concerns matters of fact. In the supplementary explanatory memorandum we are told that the effect of this measure will be to benefit the revenue by some $45 million to $50 million in a full year. My simple arithmetic approach suggests that, given that 20 per cent of $500&mdash;the amount of the increase&mdash;is $100 and a total take of somewhere between $45 million and $50 million is expected, the cost impact estimate anticipates that there will be some 450,000 to 500,000 Australians affected by this measure. I might have missed some basic fact and there might be some other matters come into play, hence my reason for raising it at this time. If indeed the results of my simple arithmetic are all there is to this matter and the cost impact benefit to revenue is estimated at $45 million to $50 million in a full year, it is an amazing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1336"> statistic. I simply find it very difficult to believe that 450,000 to 500,000 people might be affected. Hence, as I say, my reason for raising the matter. I would welcome any explanation the minister might have at hand. I did foreshadow it in my speech on the second reading and I am sure the advisers have had a chance to check it out.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just for the record, in the second reading debate, I and a number of my Labor colleagues also raised questions about the unfairness of raising this threshold for people who have to purchase expensive medications and I gave an example of an elderly constituent in my own electorate. This is the government's second attempt to roll this one through but we remain totally opposed to it for the same reasons that were outlined by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher).</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I am advised that the difficulty we have with this is that there is a 30 per cent growth rate in the number of people claiming the expense and there is a 50 per cent growth in the size of claims, although that obviously does not affect the calculations because we are working off a base amount. For the year 1995&hyphen;96 there have been 260,000 claims so far and not all tax returns have been lodged yet for 1995&hyphen;96. We have to make an estimate for the first full year, which is 1997&hyphen;98, which means extrapolating two years forward on 1995-96 figures and I am advised that that is how the revenue estimate of $45 million was achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is like many things and I would have preferred not to have done it. It was something that the government has to consider in light of having to meet a revenue shortfall that we were not expecting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that figure is based on an expectation of 450,000 individual claims&mdash;or even as many as 500,000 claims&mdash;I think it is extravagant indeed. In my speech on the second reading I did, in the light of the mid&hyphen;year review of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Commonwealth's fiscal condition, mention my lack of confidence in the estimates that we are getting in explanatory memoranda that accompany legislation in this place. I mentioned the fact that there is no measure of the accuracy of that. In other words, it comes before the House and nothing more is heard of the cost estimates. I think they have been very generous indeed, on the information that the minister has been able to provide, in extending the prospect of 260,000 in the current year to perhaps 300,000&mdash;because all the claims are not in&mdash;to 450,000 or 500,000 souls in two years time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It demonstrates my concern about the efficacy of cost impact statements that accompany all legislation and in the light of a major blooper by the Australian Taxation Office and Treasury being unable to have included in the budget figures accurate estimates of company tax when the budget was drawn up last year. My concern arises out of a demonstrated mistake of billions of dollars in the budget papers and the fact that the cost estimates in explanatory memoranda are not tested by way of subsequent examination. Therefore, they can be quite meaningless.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill 1996. In doing so I indicate at the outset that at the conclusion of my speech I will move a second reading amendment. This bill is to establish a new agency, an agency that amalgamates the former Department of Social Security network of offices with some&mdash;although I might stress only some&mdash;of the functions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1337"> historically carried out by the Commonwealth Employment Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor colleagues who follow me in this debate will deal with various aspects of the proposed agency's operations, including the delivery of child&hyphen;care services and the implications for the future delivery of Medicare services. I will focus on the effects of the proposed bill on the unemployed and on their prospects for finding work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear at the outset that the Labor Party is not opposed to the concept of a one&hyphen;stop shop; if anything, it is concerned about the nature of the one&hyphen;stop shop. There is nothing wrong in principle with combining the resources of current Social Security offices with the resources of the Commonwealth Employment Service offices. That network of CES offices spread around Australia is especially important in areas of high unemployment, both in metropolitan and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the direction in which the Labor government, I might say, was moving. We were moving that way for one important reason&mdash;to make it simpler for the unemployed to obtain both jobsearch assistance and benefit payments at one location. If anything, it was about making it easier for people who were unemployed, especially the long&hyphen;term unemployed, to access decent services at minimal expense, which is in stark contrast to the end result of the current government proposals, both in respect to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill and the employment services bills, which will come on for debate in this session of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, what we intended to do in considering the concept of a one&hyphen;stop shop is not what is going to happen as a result of the legislation now before the House for consideration. I suggest to the House that the intent of this bill is to gut the comprehensive services of the Commonwealth Employment Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is one of a series of bills whereby vital job services are to be sold off to private sector providers for profit. We are going back to the era of fee charging employment agencies. Under this legislation, the new agency will only provide very basic registration, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assessment, referral and self&hyphen;help services to job seekers. Other essential employment assistance, previously universally or freely available from the CES, will not be provided by the new agency. Instead, it will be limited to particular classes of job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill to form the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency may, in itself, seem harmless, but you have to tear the tinsel away and have a look at the actual basis of the bill and its intent. That is what we ought to be considering in this debate. When it is understood as an integral part of a wider legislative program&mdash;and this bill should be considered in association with the employment services bills&mdash;it is obvious that the intent of the government is to make major cuts in public sector resources for the poorest, most needy and vulnerable in our community. The other parts of the program, the reform of the employment services bills, are now before the Senate and the opposition. We will be pursuing amendments to those bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency is also likely to be inadequately staffed, given the revelations made during last year's Senate estimates hearings of extensive hidden job cuts, and this is despite the fact that the current government gave promises prior to the last election&mdash;unfortunately, they were not core promises&mdash;not to sack thousands upon thousands of public servants. However, I suppose you have to understand that employment is not a priority of this government. It has clearly been established as a result of the budget process that not only is it not a priority of this government, they do not have practical solutions aimed at getting the long term unemployed back to work or into real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are plans to have 5,000 fewer staff in the new network of offices. There will be 5,000 fewer staff in the new agency. That represents a substantial setback on the employment front, especially in regional Australia. That is where the biggest losers are, in non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia. One should not be surprised because soon after the federal election this government said that it did not have a constitutional responsibility for regional Australia. What follows from that is not only a lack of industry policy aimed at trying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1338"> to establish a framework for investment in regional Australia to assist in job growth, but also a comprehensive program to slash government employment in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for the government is that it does not understand the multiplier effect resulting from taking government jobs out of regional Australia. The reality is that for every government job you take out of regional Australia, you also have an impact on the capacity to provide for private sector jobs in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one should be fooled by the idea that their CES is going to be adequately replaced by this new, so&hyphen;called Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. The formation of this agency has been driven not by a desire to improve delivery of services, as the government would have the Australian community believe, it has been motivated instead by a decision to impose the burden of budget cuts on those whom the Howard government regards as politically unimportant, people in the community who need assistance, especially the long term unemployed. The long term unemployed, as a result of government cuts in the last budget, have been denied valuable labour market assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House that the cuts in labour market expenditure amounted to $1.8 billion over a period of four years. Under pressure, the government's solution now is work for the dole. This government does not have decent labour market programs aimed at establishing a capacity to benefit through getting an opportunity to engage in proper work arrangements which then bring back the discipline of work, and neither does it have decent training programs which ensure that the unemployed are job ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know members of the government are concerned about being exposed with respect to these matters. The formation of this agency has been driven by their desire to walk away from their responsibility to assist regional Australia, especially those in the community who need decent assistance with respect to labour market opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also concerns from the Labor Party's point of view that agency employees in the future will not have the same condi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tions and rights as other public service employees. Not only will they not have a sense of job security in the new agency, they will also be denied the normal wages and conditions of employment that apply to Australian government employees. I also suggest in passing that the nature of the legislation could place Australia in breach of its international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is currently being looked at by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee which is due to report in mid&hyphen;March. Already this committee has received numerous submissions from concerned Australian citizens and community organisations, groups that are concerned about the implications of the bill, especially for the needy in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among the issues being considered by the Senate committee is whether the agency's resources are adequate to meet the need for agency services. That is a fair question because the government has clearly been shown in recent times to make policy on the run. The work for the dole announcement, an endeavour to cover up political problems for the government, is an example of policy making on the run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue is the arrangement for the transfer of ongoing employment of former CES and Department of Social Security staff. There are also concerns about the fairness and equity of employment conditions for new staff. My second reading amendment expresses concern about the potential erosion of public service terms and conditions through the agency employing staff under terms and conditions that are different to those specified in the Public Service Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, can you confirm that the government of Papua New Guinea has diverted $30 million from the partial float of Orogen Minerals Ltd to conceal its foreign mercenary expenditure from Australia, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund? What are the implications of this financial subterfuge for PNG's relations with the World Bank, which only last month released a $32 million loan to PNG? What representations have you made to PNG's foreign minister, to the Minister for Finance and to Prime Minister Chan concerning the funding of their so-called `Bougainville Initiative'? Finally, Minister, do you consider the PNG government has acted honestly and in good faith in respect of this matter; and what further measures will you now take to dissuade Sir Julius Chan from continuing with his outrageous introduction of foreign mercenaries into the South Pacific?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1339" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As far as the funding issue is concerned, I cannot say anything more to the House than I said the other day&mdash;that we are continuing to investigate these stories, and we have no definitive answer to our investigations at this stage. Really, that is all I can say on that front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I wonder whether I could use this opportunity to make a couple of other points, which are certainly relevant to the general tenor of the question. As the House knows, the Prime Minister and I have repeatedly expressed our deep concern over these reports that the Papua New Guinea government is considering renewed military operations on Bougainville, including the possible use of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mercenaries. We have made our position, I think, as I said yesterday, crystal clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of today I have done three things. First, this morning I called into my office the Papua New Guinea High Commissioner to make clear our concerns again and to seek, urgently, clarification from the Papua New Guinea government of the remarks made by Prime Minister Chan yesterday, including the following: the position of the Papua New Guinea government on the potential involvement of foreign personnel in combat; whether the decision to renew a military offensive is consistent with the PNG government's recent decision to renew the mandate of the Bougainville transitional government and develop a comprehensive peace plan; and also the sources of funding for the employment of the mercenaries. I put all of those questions to the Papua New Guinea High Commissioner, and he has undertaken to get me answers after consultation with Port Moresby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I have done today is instruct my department to contact immediately other concerned governments&mdash;including New Zealand, the United States and Britain&mdash;to ask them to raise these very same issues with the Papua New Guinea government. I note that the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, has now written to Sir Julius Chan this week expressing his very real concerns about the developments. Thirdly, I reiterate my call of last week to the BRA to cease all military activity on Bougainville, and to release immediately the hostages being held in south Bougainville as a sign of their willingness to work towards a peaceful settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will obviously continue to monitor developments closely, and we will decide on possible future action in the light of Papua New Guinea's response to these questions. Our actions will take into account the full range of Australia's national interests.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Could the minister inform the House what the response has been to the government's new immunise Australia strat 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1340"> egy released yesterday? What will community support for the strategy mean for an Australian child born from 1 January 1998 onwards?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1340" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I am very heartened by the strong support that has come for the Immunise Australia proposal that the government announced yesterday. We have had support broadly across the community and from the medical profession. In fact, the AMA put out a very positive press release. We are not used to getting these sorts of press releases. In fact, my staff rang them up and said, `This is a surprise,' and they said, `Don't worry, you're only going to get one good one this year.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say though that there is small ill-informed comment that is disappointing to see that I think should be addressed. The head of the Women's Economic Think Tank, Ms Eva Cox, said that this would hurt the poor:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People with low literacy rates who are scared of authority, not very good at filling in forms and somewhat scattered and disorganised will miss out.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a particularly ill-informed comment that shows, first of all, that Ms Cox does not have any understanding of how the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register works and does not have any understanding of the full proposal. In government you never expect a free kick and you never expect to be free of criticism, but you would hope occasionally that those people who are critical are actually well informed rather than not well informed at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no logical argument that can be sustained whatsoever that a poor child with whooping cough and a maternity allowance is somehow better off than a poor child without whooping cough whose parents are getting a split maternity allowance. The simple fact is that, if you look at vaccine preventable illnesses last year&mdash;the 4,000 cases of whooping cough, the 2,500 cases of rubella, the 500 cases of measles&mdash;the demographic analysis shows clearly that it is poor families who, by and large, are being overwhelmingly hit with vaccine preventable illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a measles epidemic in part of Sydney each year. It is not happening in the eastern suburbs and it is not happening on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> North Shore; it is happening in the western suburbs of Sydney. Overwhelmingly, our negligence has led to poor families sharing a disproportionate burden of preventable illness and it is poor families who will overwhelmingly benefit from these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I should say that forms are not a major problem because we have the capacity to match data between the Australian childhood immunisation register and the Department of Social Security. This is the easiest way to have it done. If that is the case, a cheque will simply be sent in the mail when the Australian Childhood Immunisation register shows that the immunisation milestones have been met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have the right to opt out of this. If they do so, then it will be up to them. If someone is concerned that they may be disorganised or that there is a low level of literacy, it can be done automatically with no detriment whatsoever if the person is poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poorest Australians, those who live in remote Aboriginal communities, already have a high rate of immunisation. In Broome there is close to 100 per cent immunisation of Aboriginal children because the Broome Aboriginal Medical Service for some years has been doing largely what this proposal envisages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Poor families see doctors more frequently than wealthier families. Given that we are trying to make GPs play the central role in this, by using the seven or so occasions on average every year that they see children under six it will be up to the general practitioner to ensure that this works. Far from giving money to general practitioners at the expense of poor people, what we are doing is reallocating existing general practice money so we will reward those GPs who are doing what the community believes they should be doing and penalise those GPs who take no long-term interest in the people they see. Hopefully, that will be a very small proportion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in calculating the cost of these proposals, we have worked on the basis that everyone will get it. We have not made allowances for savings because even a small percentage of people will opt out. As I said 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1341"> yesterday, there are some savings because of the time factor in moving payments from one year to another. Those savings will be used to try to prevent the measles outbreak that is predicted to come in two years time.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Lindsay points out, if we as a government want to maintain a decent system of social security and a decent system of health, it is necessary for this government to maintain a decent revenue base in order to pay for it.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. The government is in the process of implementing the structure for the new workplace agreements, known as AWAs. I am pleased to inform the House that we are basically on time, on schedule, in accordance with that timetable which we were working to last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 March the legislative and regulatory framework for Australian workplace agreements will be in place. There is a lot of activity, as these are new agreements, amongst various organisations to give people good information about them. The department is actively involved in seminars, as is the Employment Advocate. The NFF have got out, or are putting out, 120,000 brochures. The NBA is running an education campaign. In the public sector, one of the unions, APESMA, is looking at AWAs. Steve Harrison from the AWU has said you would have to be an ostrich not to be interested in the service that a union could provide its members through AWAs. Even the office of the member for Perth&mdash;and I must say I was very pleased to get a letter from his office&mdash;was seeking information about workplace agreements for a constituent. This is, of course, to be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian workplace agreement is a new form of agreement. It is to be contrasted&mdash;and I do&mdash;with others who are claiming to have introduced new things into Australia's public life. I do warn honourable members against mistaking mere novelty for actual change. For example, I will contrast the substantially new and different and innovative Australian workplace agreements with the situation of the ACTU branch of the ALP, which has applied to change its name to the `New Labor Party'. I can understand why it is that they might want to distance themselves from the last 13 years. Whilst it is true that it seems to be a change to reflect the change 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the Labor Party in the UK made, there is quite an interesting difference. In the UK they changed their name after 17 years in the wilderness, whereas in Australia they seem to be anticipating 17 years in the wilderness and are proposing to change it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be fair enough to then ask: what of this craving for newness in the Labor Party and its impact on members of the ALP? Is it just a case of old wine in new bottles?

The whole reason why the Commonwealth needs to be concerned is their responsibilities under the constitution for those people who are on social services&mdash;the pensioners, the ex&hyphen;servicemen, the immigrants and the Aboriginals.

Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm press reports that Canada will take action in the World Trade Organisation to challenge Australia's ban on imports of salmon?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that Canada is still examining the risk analysis report on salmon released by the Australian government last year&mdash;by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. As of yesterday, Canada had not yet decided whether to challenge our decision in the World Trade Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me comment, however, that while any such challenge is a matter for Canada and within its prerogative, the government considers that it has acted quite properly in formulating its decision on this matter. Indeed, we are confident that the import risk analysis undertaken by Australia is comprehensive, science based and authoritative. It is fully consistent with our rights and obligations under the WTO and, in particular, the agreement on the use of sanitary and phyto&hyphen;sanitary measures. I might add that Australia already imports some $25 million plus cooked salmon product from Canada, a 40 per cent increase year on year. That ought to be taken note of. I can assure the House that, if Canada does nevertheless challenge the decision in the WTO, this government will defend that decision vigorously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of other issues, I can advise that I have made representations to Mr Art Eggleton, Canada's Minister for International Trade, to strongly object to his decision to unilaterally cut the 1997 quota for Australian beef to 35,000 tonnes. This decision was, as I said last week, very unexpected, unjustified and particularly regrettable given the long battle we fought to establish the quota. Also, the decision comes well into the marketing year. Our industry has clearly indicated its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dissatisfaction with the decision, and I am considering all options for future action, including raising the matter in the WTO. I will be working to achieve an outcome which reflects our legitimate interest in this market. But these are not the only issues within this trade relationship requiring our attention. Let me just say for our part I am dissatisfied with the treatment received by our exports of canned fruit to Canada and, indeed, with the way in which the Canada&hyphen;Australia trade agreement, Canata, over the last few years has become so heavily slanted to Canada's benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to stress is that, as unhelpful as the decision on beef is, I am committed to working through all the problems in the trade relationship to protect Australia's interests and restore the bilateral relationship to good health.

I am aware of reports and suggestions that in the previous six months there may have been a fall in the demand for student and tourist visas, these reports having been encouraged by negative comments, particularly in the media, about Australia that could have discouraged tourists and students from coming here. It is important to have the factual information and I want to put that before the House now.</PARA></TALK.START>

Nine of the 11 countries had an increase and those included India which was up 18 per cent, Indonesia 25 per cent, Malaysia 48 per cent, the Philippines 38 per cent and the People's Republic of China 46 per cent. Only Japan and Taiwan over the period reported a small decline compared with the same period last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range of factors that have led to the slowing of growth in the Japanese market are believed to include the relative cost of airfares to Australia, aggressive marking in Japan by other nations, a strong Australian dollar and the shortage of budget to medium&hyphen;priced accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation in relation to student visas is very similar. The visa grants for students are up by over 10 per cent over the same period for the same countries. Hong Kong was up by 11 per cent, India 10 per cent, Indonesia 20 per cent, Japan 6 per cent, Korea 30 per cent and Malaysia 8 per cent.

I am very much aware that public hospitals are under strain right around Australia. My wife works in a public hospital, so I get at first&hyphen;hand the knowledge of what is going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that I was making is that the Medicare agreement has one year to run. We will fulfil our obligations under the Medicare agreement. People should be aware of a little bit of history. It is not unusual for states to undertake a bit of posturing ahead of Medicare agreements coming up to be signed. I take no offence at that. If you look at what has happened over the years since the last Medicare agreement was signed in 1992-93 and you look at the states collectively, because I think it is unfair to single out Victoria, the fact is that the Commonwealth's funding to state hospitals&mdash;not state health, but state hospitals&mdash;has increased very substantially in real terms since the last Medicare agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Collectively, the states' contribution to hospitals has dropped off, so the net benefit to the hospitals has not been great. Some areas&mdash;the ACT, for example&mdash;have had a good record in maintaining their resources to hospitals, but it has been very patchy across the states and collectively the states have dropped off. This was a problem the previous minister had. It is a problem I remember the opposition leader talking about during the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> election. If the Commonwealth is going to put in extra money just to have the states pull it out to fix the budget bottom line, the net effect is that things are no better. Before I would consider going to my colleagues to argue for more resources for state hospitals I would want to be convinced that those resources were going to make a difference. I would want to be convinced that the states were not just going to pull the resources out and use them elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the private hospital rebates, it depends on what you are trying to achieve. We had Bob Carr over the weekend talking about the difficulty of the drop-out from private health insurance to the New South Wales health system. We have had Peter Beattie in the past talking about how the Queensland health system would be better off if we could stop the drop-out from private health insurance. What these rebates will do for the first time is put a floor under the people pulling out of private health insurance. That will help the states very substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I want to make&mdash;and I make no apologies for this&mdash;is that this is as much as anything an issue about equity. The coalition believes that people who have made the effort to make some provision for their own health care and who have held on to private health insurance for a long period actually deserve a reward. A lot of those people are on very low incomes. The best estimates are that up to 700,000 people on incomes under $20,000 a year have held on to their private health insurance. We will be seeking to help them in a way that you have never done.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the House would recall, last year the government announced an environmental impact study on two sites for the second airport for Sydney, those two sites being Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. The reason we were in this position was that the previous government, having selected Badgerys Creek in February 1986, had done absolutely and utterly nothing over the next 10 years to develop a second airport for Sydney. They fast&hyphen;talked about it but they slow&hyphen;tracked the whole process. As a result, these environmental impact studies are being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the former Labor government, we are embarking on a very comprehensive process of community consultation during this EIS. The EIS has been under way now for several months. There have been over 300,000 newsletters, fact sheets and fliers go out to people in the community with regard to this environmental impact study. There have been over 70 meetings held by those people undertaking the EIS with community groups, councils and so forth. Indeed, the response from the community has been very substantial. As a result of that, and in order to ensure that full community consultation can be carried out in the most comprehensive fashion, the government has decided to extend the period for the EIS by at least two months. So, as a result of the commitment of this government to proper community consultation, the EIS process will be extended by at least two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I compare this with the process undertaken by the former Labor government when they did an EIS on the third runway for Sydney's Mascot airport. That process hardly involved community consultation. The results of it were a complete con of the community, as we all saw, as the facts developed after the runway had been opened. This government is committed to full and open community consultation and therefore this extension of time has been granted to achieve that.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Nonetheless, the question of the surcharge is one, as the Treasurer explained, that is across the board. In fact the legislation and the discussions are soon to be in this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lowe for his question and his ongoing interest in the veteran community, the Concord hospital and its future under a New South Wales Labor government. Also, he mentions the workers at Concord hospital who continue to do a great job in caring for the veteran community and other people whom the Concord hospital serves. I am aware that the New South Wales Labor government is proposing to close the renal transplant unit of Concord hospital in what amounts to yet another example of no consultation with and no concern for the veteran community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The justice system has changed since John Howard was last in full&hyphen;time practice. He is proud of saying he is a suburban solicitor&mdash;and so he should be; it is an honourable profession&mdash;but you cannot run a justice system from a suburban solicitor's office in Wollstonecraft, and that is exactly what is happening in our justice system today. It is the vanity of the Prime Minister, it is the Prime Minister not being properly briefed before going on the Laurie Oakes <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program a couple of weeks ago, that has plunged the justice system in this country into crisis. We have a situation where the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) earlier this week conceded in a question to me that there had been discussions between the Department of Finance and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department in relation to the legal aid situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the Prime Minister dismissed out of hand the complaints by state Attorneys-General by saying, `What do you expect from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1357"> state Attorneys&hyphen;General?' The reality is that those state Attorneys&hyphen;General and the legal aid commissions are those who are suffering at the coalface. While the Prime Minister is living in luxury at the Lodge up the road and at Kirribilli, ordinary Australians are suffering. What was the promise from the conservative parties prior to the election? It was in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal and National government will maintain current levels of legal aid funding as well as funding to community legal centres. In Government we will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">examine ways, in consultation with Legal Aid Commissions, of increasing the extent to which legal aid is granted in civil proceedings, particularly in the family law area; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">explore ways of ensuring equity in the allocation of legal assistance and in devising new and innovative ways of ensuring that all Australians are able to access the court system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What do we have from this Prime Minister? His first commitment to access to justice is to keep the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) outside of cabinet. Why? Because he probably thinks he has sufficient legal knowledge, ably aided by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), to run the show without the Attorney-General in cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this is a re-run of what the Fraser government did post&hyphen;1975. The Australian Legal Aid Office was set up by the Whitlam Labor government and the then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy. From 1975 to 1983, we had a dismantling of the Australian Legal Aid Office by the then Fraser government. They turned it into a referral factory. What this government have managed to do is unite a coalition of groups against them in terms of their move because it has no merit, it has no policy rationale and it is not based on any considered research. It is not based on the delivery of a fair or equitable system of justice; it is based on the bean counters. It is a budget cut pure and simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These words are not just from me&mdash;I might be considered to be partisan in the matter because of my Labor credentials&mdash;but also from the Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr Foss. He has released a letter that he has written to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. That letter states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have created a crisis by your unilateral decision and now you are saying that this imposes some duty on us to meet you part way. I would have thought the duty was on you to fix the mess you have caused.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fairness to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance, they were preparing a submission to put on the cabinet notice paper to be considered by cabinet. So what have we got? We have a Prime Minister so vain, so proud, so incompetent when it comes to knowing what is coming before the cabinet that he goes on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program with Laurie Oakes and says, `Nothing is being considered in relation to legal aid.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this Prime Minister is that he is too busy reading the opinion polls and the research from Mr Robb to look at the cabinet notice paper and to understand what his ministers are preparing. The reality is that the cuts in the budget were based on false figures. I quote from a document provided to me by National Legal Aid:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth made available some statistical data purportedly used in their calculations. Unfortunately, the data that was used was not correct in some cases (and had not been checked with Commissions.) Further, they used data from 1994/95, rather than 1995/96. The importance of this is that there had been an enormous change in workloads over that twelve month period which was not reflected in the Commonwealth's analysis (particularly in the family law area of separate legal representation for children as ordered by the Family Court).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government for families and family values! What this will lead to is further disruption within families. It will lead to a further crisis in relation to domestic violence in this country. Let us make no mistake where the blame will lie. It will lie fairly and squarely with the Prime Minister. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, they only used data pertinent to Victoria and Western Australia. These two Commissions had totally different workloads and figures from the norm. More up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date data was available at the time to the Commonwealth, but was not used in their calculations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After Commissions analysed the Commonwealth figures, it became apparent that in many instances the opposite argument can be proved&mdash;that is, that some States and Territories are in effect `subsidising' Commonwealth matters from the funding 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1358"> they contribute. Commissions devote more funds to Commonwealth law matters than they do local legal matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The document further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a Government that campaigned on a platform that it would be a Government for families, it is worrying that the Commonwealth is now walking away from a responsibility for legal aid in domestic violence matters. Those less able to put their views to the Court will not be in a position to do so and this will have a particular effect on women and children. The fundamental rule of justice that all persons are equal before the Court will no longer exist.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what this government has done. Is this from just the defence authorities, the state Attorneys&hyphen;General and the legal aid commissions? No. There is an inquiry at the moment by a Senate committee which is taking evidence around the countryside on legal aid. Who appears in front of it? The President of the Law Council of Australia. The current Attorney-General would know about that; he was once the President of the Law Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Mr Short say? This is what he said before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on Wednesday, 29 January:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a nutshell we are saying that, by cutting legal aid, the government has reached a wrong priority. We say that in any civilised society equality before the law is one of the hallmarks of successful government. Equality before the law means that people who are attacked or under threat by a legal system must feel comfortable that society is providing them with an equal opportunity to answer and relieve themselves of that burden. It is a positive obligation of a civilised society to provide that minimum level of legal assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Does it stop there? No, it does not. We have evidence from the current Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Rozenes. What did he say before the Senate references committee on Wednesday 29 January 1997? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth DPP&mdash;and I imagine that I speak for all Directors of Public Prosecution&mdash;has a real interest in ensuring that persons brought before the courts are adequately represented. By `adequately represented' I do not just mean being provided with counsel but being provided with counsel who are properly resourced so that they can make a meaningful contribution to the trial process early enough to ensure that the valuable resources that we have to bring to bear in the criminal justice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system are not wasted, that early pleas of guilty are identified as early as possible and that the trial   proceeds not only fairly but expeditiously without error to ensure that there are no successful appeals, thereby saving further cost. There is every interest for the prosecutor to have well equipped, properly resourced defence counsel opposed to him or her.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What does he say further on? It is even more damning. He was asked from the chair:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does your office have a view of when it is appropriate that legal aid be provided in cases?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Rozenes&mdash;We would start off with the proposition that in all serious and complex cases accused persons should be represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">CHAIR&mdash;Do you have a guideline that would determine what is serious and what is not serious?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Rozenes&mdash;If there is a risk of going to gaol, that is a pretty serious case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What does this Attorney-General and government do? They denigrate the High Court. We now have a campaign where there is an attack on the High Court in relation to a number of enlightened judgments that it has made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister on Monday demonstrated that he would not pass the first year of law school. It is not only the parliament's role to make law in this country; the constitution, of which the Prime Minister is a great defender, also gives a constitutional obligation to the High Court to lay down the common law in Australia. The common law is judge&hyphen;made law. It is not a white Anglo&hyphen;Saxon Protestant view of history, and it is not a black armband view of history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the High Court say in Dietrich's case? That was a very important case in which the High Court said that the courts have a discretion to prevent a miscarriage of justice, and that a case should not proceed where there is going to be a miscarriage of justice. So, if accused persons come before the courts unrepresented and there is a chance of a miscarriage of justice, the obligation is on the trial judge to intervene. That is what is happening now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have examples where, at the state level, the state Attorney-General is being asked to provide an ex gratia payment to fund the defence case of an accused. And what does this Attorney-General do? He attacks the Dietrich case and says, `That decision should never have been made; it was wrong.' Legal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1359"> aid needs to be administered, irrespective of whether or not there is going to be a miscarriage of justice. It is the same principle. Cases should not be brought to court, unless people are properly represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have royal commissions going on all around this countryside. There are cases in New South Wales where police officers have now been shown to have perjured themselves. We have a situation now where there is no legal aid in New South Wales for retrials. When I was a public defender I appeared in a number of trials; there were two I specifically remember. The jury was unable to agree and, at the retrial, those accused were acquitted. They were represented. If they were unrepresented at the retrial, it is more likely than not that they would have gone to gaol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have standards, we have a system of justice, we have a rule of law. The obligation is on the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth does have responsibility when it comes to veterans, when it comes to indigenous Australians&mdash;when it comes to a whole range of things. The partnership, the legal aid agreement, is a joint partnership. It was one in which I was involved when I was in the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. It is an efficient system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In New South Wales previously, prior to 1987, you went to one place for an Australian legal aid application, and you went to another place for an application under the New South Wales system. It was inefficient. It was a duplication of services. So an agreement or arrangement with the Commonwealth and the state was entered into. It was a one-stop shop. The Commonwealth undertook to provide 55 per cent funding, with 45 per cent being provided by the New South Wales government. The system has worked well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been calculated that, as a result of the federal government's cuts in the last budget, 33,000 fewer people will be represented. It will mean not only that innocent people are more likely to be convicted but also that judges in this community will not allow trials to go ahead if there is a miscarriage of justice, so people who should be convicted will be set free. Middle Australia, mainstream Australia, when it comes to domestic violence

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an arrangement in place up to the time the Howard government came into office under which there was a common pool administered by state legal aid commissions into which there were fixed contributions made by the Commonwealth and the states. Those contributions ranged on the Commonwealth's part between roughly 55 and 60 per cent. The states, however, in some cases made significant contributions; in others, they made only modest contributions. Some states currently use interest on solicitors' trust accounts as part of the state contribution to the legal aid commissions; most states do not.</PARA>

They generate those funds by client costs&mdash;they seek contributions from the clients and they recover costs against unsuccessful litigants against whom they have funded proceedings. The differences between the efficiencies of the state legal aid commissions in that respect are quite marked. Some states have significant interest income from money that they manage, others have none. All in all, the states have a very patchy performance. When we come to look at how that money is used, we see that there are elements of inequity and there are elements of unfairness to go on top of the inefficiency that is built into the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The priorities for the disposition of legal aid funding are not determined by the Commonwealth government under the system put in place by Labor. They are not even determined 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1360"> by the state governments whose legislation set up the legal aid commissions. They are determined by legal aid commissioners who, acting in good faith I accept, respond to the wind and the waves of the legal landscape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens when the High Court decides the Dietrich case? All the money suddenly shifts to criminal law. What happens when the full court of the Family Court in the case of re K decides that children need to be represented in family law proceedings? Some of that money drifts back into family law. When there is another decision of another court that lays down some broad principle about representation in proceedings, no doubt we will have another drift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result is that the governments that provide the funding are not able to determine the priorities as to the use of the funding. But it is those governments that are accountable to taxpayers. If you are an applicant for funding for a separate representation of children in family law proceedings in Victoria, you have got three times the chance of getting that funding than you have in any other place. But the Commonwealth puts in its money just the same. If you go to a particular solicitor in Western Australia for a family law matter, the legal aid commission will pay three times the amount that would be paid in another jurisdiction for performing the same service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about equity and we talk about access. The member for Banks makes a great fuss about it. I think on both sides of the House there is a desire to achieve access to justice. There is no access to justice when 70 per cent of the money devoted by legal aid commissions for private referrals is devoted to 20 per cent of cases. The member for Banks referred to the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission. The New South Wales Legal Aid Commission is a classic in this instance. In New South Wales, 75.4 per cent of funding for referrals goes on 20 per cent of matters. What has happened is that trials have got longer, courts have laid down the rules as to who will be funded and the legal aid commissions have just washed around. They have slopped around in the wind and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> waves. This system has been allowed to go on for 10 years by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the accountability? The governments that provide the money are accountable to the taxpayers for the expenditure of the money. But, under the current system, the boards of the legal aid commissions are the ones who make the decisions. The boards of the legal aid commissions usually contain one or two representatives of the Commonwealth and maybe one or two representatives of state governments. The bulk of the representation on those boards&mdash;and they comprise 10 or 12 members in many cases&mdash;comes from stakeholders. They are volunteers in the main and they do a good job given the circumstances in which they find themselves, but they are not accountable to anyone. In most cases they have a direct conflict of interest. They are certainly not accountable to the taxpayers whose money is used in the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the comparisons between the legal aid commissions? We have a system under which each legal aid commission maintains its own records. It maintains records of its funding. It maintains records of the matters that are referred to it and the results. In some cases they are able to compare costs of cases, costs of matters. When it comes to the Commonwealth's money, can you compare what happens in one legal aid commission with what happens in another legal aid commission? No, you cannot. The Commonwealth is unable to get data that will tell us whether its money is being fairly and equitably used across Australia. Such data as is available suggests that in many cases it is quite inequitable. I have mentioned the separate representation of children being three times the rate in other jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Labor do about these problems? Did they take steps to ensure that the states made even contributions? No, they did nothing. Did the Labor government take any step to ensure that the legal aid commissions in their management of funds sought on similar principles to have client contributions, recovery from unsuccessful opposing litigants and interest on managed funds dealt with on a similar basis? No, they did nothing. Did the Labor government do anything to ensure that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1361"> the priorities determined by legal aid commissions achieved equity between legal aid clients in different states and territories, different jurisdictions? No, they did nothing. They allowed the 10-year&hyphen;old agreements to drift on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Howard government do when it came into office? It sat down and said, `We can't allow this situation to continue.' Pursuant to those agreements, on 26 June last year I gave notice to the different states and territories that we wanted to renegotiate those agreements and we wanted to achieve reforms. Since 26 June we have been endeavouring to negotiate with those jurisdictions an improvement in the legal aid system that will achieve equity and efficiency and will see the best value achieved for the legal aid dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that the member for Banks really talked about was Commonwealth funding of legal aid. We came into office faced with a $10 billion deficit and a commitment to bring the budget back into surplus. There was no way, given the cuts that were necessary in various programs, that legal aid could be immune to the cuts necessary to bring the budget back closer to surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took the figures available for 1994-95, which was the best available data from the states and territories and from the legal aid commissions, and determined of how much money was actually being spent on matters for which the Commonwealth has a responsibility&mdash;not on people who have some Commonwealth connection, which was the ruse used by Senator Murphy as Attorney-General to get the Commonwealth foothold into the legal aid system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were looking at how much money was spent by legal aid commissions on matters that arise under Commonwealth law&mdash;that being a basis, a principle, upon which the Commonwealth can say to the taxpayers of Australia, `We are accountable for the provision of legal aid that is necessary in dealing with those sorts of matters.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The calculations we made indicated that on an annual basis, using 1994-95 figures, an amount of about $33 million was being used by legal aid commissions to fund matters arising under state law. We say, and we have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been saying for months now, the Commonwealth will accept responsibility for matters arising under Commonwealth law. If we do not provide legal aid, we are accountable to the taxpayers and to the applicants for legal aid. The states should be responsible for matters that arise under state law. States should be responsible to their taxpayers. They should be responsible to legal aid applicants for matters arising under their law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that principle we have made a commitment, which is in the forward estimates of the current year's budget papers, to maintain in real terms the funding that has been provided in previous years. That represents a significant reduction in the total funding&mdash;that is accepted&mdash;$33 million. But it is not $33 million in one jurisdiction; it is spread over the lot of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states, since then, have engaged in a political campaign designed to put pressure on the Commonwealth to reverse that decision or to reduce the reduction in funding that is contained in the forward estimates. What they have not done is effectively address the reform proposals&mdash;reform proposals that will see thousands of people receive more legal aid if it is properly administered. If we can reduce that 70 per cent of referral funding going to 20 per cent of cases, hundreds and thousands of people will get legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a case in Victoria, about which I have been told, where a person is on trial on criminal charges. Legal aid has provided $2 million in funding to that accused, and the trial has not started. What is happening is that legal aid is being treated as if there were no end to the funding. The representatives of that particular accused are doing things that, if the accused were not in a legal aid applicant situation but were an ordinary person, would never be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words&mdash;and I use these words advisedly; I have used them in the past&mdash;the system is providing Rolls Royce justice to a few people. What we really want is to get the legal aid distributed so that a lot more people get it. That means stopping what is really a rort, whereby very large sums of money are spent on individual cases resulting in nothing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1362"> being spent on a large number of smaller but deserving cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate that has gone on, the states have used some unseemly tactics in referring to individual cases in saying what will happen if legal aid is denied in this case. Let me make it plain. For the current year, no legal aid funding has been reduced. The Commonwealth has maintained its contribution under the old system. The Commonwealth has said that, from 1 July this year, it will reduce the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks made particular reference to some correspondence from the Attorney-General of Western Australia, Mr Foss QC. Mr Foss was replying to a letter. I received the reply on Monday, I think. The letter was written about seven weeks ago. In the interim we have heard nothing. We have heard a lot from other states, and we have heard a lot from stakeholders in the legal aid debate&mdash;all designed to raise the spectre that more money is needed and the Commonwealth must reverse its decision. Let us make it plain. The Commonwealth is not going to reverse its decision. The legal aid cake from the Commonwealth was set out in the forward estimates. That is the cake that must be divided. What we want to see is that that cake will be equitably distributed and it will be efficiently used. The states and territories need to sit down and talk to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Foss's sins are compounded by the fact that Western Australia is effectively the only jurisdiction which has failed to provide data that enables us to compare performances. That suggests to us that the funding provided by the Commonwealth and used on states matters is, in fact, even greater than the estimate that we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal aid landscape is not confined to the issue of Commonwealth funding to legal aid commissions. There is a lot more to be put into the picture. Community legal centres are a major source of legal assistance in the community. No funding cuts, despite the $10 billion deficiency, were effected on community legal centres. They received $15,152,000 in the current budget, and in the forward estimates it is not projected there will be any cuts whatever.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have funding provided for mediation and counselling in the family law context. That is done outside the court. That needs to be taken into account in any system of access to justice. We have courts addressing the issues of case management so that the big cases can be made into medium-size cases and the medium-size cases can be made into smaller cases. We are currently addressing proposals that will see cases that are conducted in an expensive way in the superior courts conducted in a cheaper way in the intermediate and the lower courts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Reference has already been made by our previous speaker, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), to the High Court ruling in the Dietrich case, which I was going to mention today, but there is a another point that has been mentioned that I want to repeat. That is, the decision by this government, by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to break a very definite promise to the Australian community. I would like to repeat these words. It is very important they go on the record. The coalition's `Law and justice for all of us' policy statement said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal and National government will maintain current levels of legal aid funding as well as funding to community legal centres.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is very clear to me. We can have pedantic arguments all afternoon about who is paying for what, where and why and how we justify the level of costs, but to me it comes back to that basic argument. It is not just us on this side of the House who happen to be objecting to this particular policy deviation. I would like another quote to go on the record: `Mr Williams is on notice this cut will devastate a fundamental right of all Australians&mdash;that of access to justice, in clear breach of a coalition election commitment.' That was said on 10 February by the ACT Attorney-General, who is a political colleague of this federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole debate seems to centre around two major features, as I see it. One of them is money and this government's obsession with not spending it, no matter what. The other is the question of who&mdash;be it the Commonwealth or a state or territory&mdash;is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1363"> responsible for the costs incurred in certain legal aid matters. On the first of these matters, money: the sums used for these cuts were wrong&mdash;absolutely wrong. Those miscalculations have, I understand, been acknowledged by the Attorney&hyphen;General. When we talk about money and the question of whether state or territory governments or the federal government should be paying, let me refer briefly to a statement made, I believe, by the Attorney&hyphen;General. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present debate is not about how much should be available in total. It is simply about which government should pay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me remind the Attorney&hyphen;General of a fairly infamous case. I admit it goes back to the previous federal government, but since this government has been in power it has done nothing to attend to it. I refer to the enormous bill that was drummed up against the ACT government during the Eastman&hyphen;Winchester case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Eastman&hyphen;Winchester case, for those who may need to be reminded, was when David Eastman was convicted of the murder of AFP Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester. That occurred whilst the ACT was under Commonwealth control. David Eastman contravened a Commonwealth law and murdered a Commonwealth official. ACT taxpayers paid $1.665 million in legal assistance for his defence. The Commonwealth did not make a contribution to that defence. Nor did it make a contribution to the massive costs involved in the prosecution or the initial coronial inquest. I understand the total bill to the ACT taxpayer was in excess of $8 million. If the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) is true to his principle on this matter, before he even considers cutting funds to the ACT, let alone any other legal aid commission, surely that sort of inequity should be attended to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the second matter&mdash;who is not responsible, who is and for what&mdash;I remind the House that for over 20 years the Commonwealth has assumed responsibility for the provision of legal aid to groups of Australians traditionally acknowledged as requiring special consideration. It is very important that we mention these people. I think at the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moment there is a section of the community out there that sees a distance between themselves and this debate. They probably see this debate as being more relevant to what they consider to be the `criminal element' than to themselves. Let me remind you of the sorts of groups that the Commonwealth historically has considered it fair to apply legal aid to: the Aboriginal community, veterans, social security recipients, migrants, returned service personnel and their families, women, children, accused persons in criminal trials, domestic violence victims, the mentally ill, people suffering from a disability, refugees, and so on. There is absolutely no distance between the community out there&mdash;the Prime Minister's mainstream battling people&mdash;and the question of what we are going to do in general about legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see now, of course, is a pathetic debate about which law falls into whose backyard. This is ridiculous. It is an insult to the community. It is unfair. It is inequitable to those attempting to access the justice process in general. This government keeps telling us that it cares about families. So much of legal aid work is in the area of family law. I understand we are now even having a debate about whether domestic violence is a state or territory issue or a Commonwealth issue. For heaven's sake! Domestic violence is definitely a part of the family law area. There should be no debate at all as to where it fits in. It seems to me very evident that we are looking at a government which said to its minister, `Minister, we have got to find money. We don't care how you do it, but you do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the legal aid commissions around the country are forced to go it alone and set up their own process&mdash;as has been threatened in many jurisdictions, including the ACT&mdash;the confusion and the inequity will be massive. So many of the matters fall across Commonwealth and state and territory boundaries in a legal sense. How on earth will the client out there in suburbia know exactly where they are in that process? How on earth can the government accurately bill different jurisdictions? How are the legal aid processes in each of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1364"> them to run a proper open process with such a crossover?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects of this decision are far reaching and, frankly, terrible. Over the next three years the legal aid commissions around this country would have expected to help 200,000 people by way of duty lawyer, 15,000 people in civil proceedings, over 200,000 people seeking advice about their legal problems and 20,000 children. But what about the general question? This government is playing around with the legal aid system, yet at the same time it is paying no attention whatsoever, in my observation, to the sorts of costs the legal process generally in this country amounts to. Why doesn't this government, if it is serious, examine those legal costs across the board within the legal system instead of playing around with the disadvantaged and those who rely solely on the legal aid process to access justice when they need to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth proposal jeopardises Australia's position on a range of conventions and treaties. It promises to ensure, amongst other things, fair trials for accused people in all Australian courts, including access to legal assistance; a voice for children whose parents are fighting in the Family Court&mdash;children, I might add, of the famous Howard family&mdash;lawyers for children in the children's courts; access to lawyers for people involuntarily detained because of mental illness; equal legal capacity for women, including access to legal aid; and legal assistance to refugees, amongst others. This Commonwealth action radically shifts the balance of power in our communities. It will potentially lock out of court up to 50,000 Australians over the next three years. The Australian legal aid program is acknowledged to be one of the developed world's cheapest, yet also one of the world's best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I will refute one of the points made by the Attorney&hyphen;General in his address to the House today. He made mention I think on two occasions of the fact that 70 per cent of the dollars goes to 20 per cent of matters and how inequitable this is. I understand that one of the reasons for that sort of equation is that in some areas, particularly family law, the method of funding for each case is done on a staged basis. In other words, the first stage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the family law matter may receive legal aid to that point. An enormous proportion&mdash;60 per cent or more, I believe&mdash;of those cases are solved at that point. At stage 2 of the family law issue further funding may be made available, and so on down the line so that the most difficult, the most lengthy and therefore the most costly, which may in fact be the minority, turn out to cost a lot to the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the issue that the Attorney-General himself brought attention to in relation to that expensive case in Victoria. But all I wish to do in the case of the ACT is refer to the Eastman case when we talk about proportion of dollars spent. There is absolutely no doubt this community deserves nothing less than a Rolls Royce service and that Rolls Royce service must be available to every Australian who needs it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance being debated in the chamber today is based on a false premise. The suggestion seems to be that because of the budget decision, which will reduce the Commonwealth contribution by some $33.158 million, there will be a reduction in money available for legal aid funding across the country. This decision is all about forcing the states and territories to disgorge the moneys they should to meet their responsibilities to fund legal aid under their own laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) really ought to go and have a cold shower. He has come in and outlined a number of principles with which everyone in the House would agree. We do support equality before the law. Who on earth in this chamber would suggest that we ought not to have access to justice? Who would claim we ought not to have equality before the law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Law Council and Mr Rozenes referred to those matters but it cannot be disputed that we believe in equality before the law. We believe the Commonwealth should make its proper contribution, but the budget decision will prevent the states and territories from misappropriating Commonwealth money to state legal aid matters. There will be access to the law, there will be fairness, there will be decency and there will be an appropriate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1365"> response if the states are prepared to bear their fair share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that there has been since the budget a very clever campaign to discredit the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and this government and all of the states, regardless of their political colours, have been prepared to participate in this very devious and misleading campaign. Members opposite cite to us our election promises. This government, unlike its predecessor, places a very great store in keeping faith with the Australian people. When we make a promise we want to keep it, but I have to, once again, outline to the chamber the situation that we inherited after we attained government on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We came into office having been assured by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and by the former Prime Minister Mr Keating that the budget was in surplus. We tried over and over again to find out what the actual figures were but we were assured that the budget was in surplus. There are numerous comments on the public record where the former government told the Australian people, told us, told anyone who would listen that the budget was in surplus. Yet, interestingly enough, just a couple of days after the election we were told that the budget was not in surplus and that we inherited a $10 billion black hole. Being a responsible government we therefore had to search around to try to make sure we balanced the books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to listen to the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) when she said that this government has an obsession with not spending money. We make no apology at all for refusing to spend money that is not there. It is important to get to a situation where this country's books are run the same way as one would run one's own household accounts. One cannot go on spending more than one earns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has made very reasonable, fair changes which will ensure that the budget will be in surplus in a number of years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian people, like the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nel 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> son), have indeed supported this program. If one looks at every opinion poll published, one will see that the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government have received the full support of the Australian people through this responsible economic management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty sad when the honourable member for Banks and the honourable member for Namadgi bleat about the reduction in the Commonwealth contribution to legal aid funding. The simple fact of the matter is that if the states and territories bear their responsibility there should not be one cent reduction in legal aid funding, not one cent reduction at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the approximately 10 years of the legal aid agreement, the states have continued to allocate moneys given by the Commonwealth to legal aid for the purposes of funding state matters. The states have shifted legal aid funding from family law areas and areas of Commonwealth responsibility into areas of the criminal law. We do not believe that is appropriate. We obviously believe that people ought to have access to legal aid when they are entitled to it but in a federal system of government the government that makes the laws ought to be responsible for ensuring there is adequate provision of legal aid services so that people defending themselves under those laws are in fact able to have access to courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one listened to the diatribe by the honourable member for Namadgi, she mentioned a number of people who she deems ought to receive Commonwealth legal aid funding. She included migrants, women and those on social security. If one adds all of the categories that she included in her speech, then basically almost everyone should receive federal legal aid funding. I suspect that even the honourable member for Banks would not want that situation to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do have a federal system of government whether those people opposite like it or not and in a federal system of government we have a federal parliament that makes laws of national significance pursuant to our powers under the constitution. We also have state and territory governments that make laws under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1366"> the constitution in accordance with their rights. We are fully supportive of access to justice but we are also supportive of states and territories carrying their fair share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also had cited through the media a number of instances where the states and territories have claimed that certain individuals would not be able to receive legal aid. The suggestion is that people could be forced out of court and be unable to defend themselves because the Commonwealth has restricted legal aid. It is obvious that we have not reduced legal aid funding for the calendar year 1996&hyphen;97. What we have done in accordance with the legal aid agreement is to give more than a full 12 months notice of our intention to vary the legal aid arrangements. In the year after 30 June 1997, we would reduce legal aid funding from the Commonwealth by $33.158 billion. But we do that in the full expectation that the states and territories will meet their proportion, which they have not met until now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten years ago it might have been fair enough to say that the Commonwealth was to be responsible for 55 to 60 per cent of legal aid funding, but 10 years is a long time. What the Commonwealth has said is, `We want to re&hyphen;examine the system. We want to talk to the states and territories.' There has also been criticism of the way the Commonwealth has calculated the reduction in federal legal aid input, but the simple fact of the matter is that we have had to use the somewhat inadequate data provided to us by state legal aid commissions. If there is something wrong with the figures, the reason is that we have been given the wrong information from the states.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney&hyphen;General referred to the fact that the Western Australian government has still not provided any figures at all.</PARA>

I think, for once, the newspapers ought to be commended. The scare campaign run by those opposite is absolutely contemptible. It ought to be appreciated that the Commonwealth is continuing to provide some non&hyphen;means tested funding to war veterans, and we will continue to fund expensive criminal cases under Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, the states and territories are shameless. They have come out and opposed what the Commonwealth has done; the states and territories have taken the Commonwealth's money for far too long. Even the Labor Party complained about the way they had allocated Commonwealth funds to state legal matters but the former government did nothing. We have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 amends two acts. The main provisions of this bill amend the Airports Act 1996. Technical amendments are also proposed to the Air Navigation Act 1920 to establish a register of encumbered aircraft as well as to strengthen consumer protection provisions and streamline approval processes for international charter flights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments to the Airports Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the Airports Act 1996 will empower required regulations in relation to a number of key environment matters, as well as clarify some technical issues which are unclear. These provisions include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> Variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> Requiring airport&hyphen;lessees to seek public comment prior to submitting minor variations of master plans and major development plans to the minister for approval; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> A statutory requirement for an airport operator to use an airport site as an airport.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Enhanced environment provisions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My Department has been developing Airports (Environmental Protection) Regulations, the EP regulations, in consultation with Environment Australia. This process has highlighted a number of areas where improvements can be made to the regime originally envisaged in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these recently tabled regulations, the environment strategy is the centrepiece of a performance based regulatory regime under which each and every person carrying out an activity on an airport is responsible for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environmental impacts associated with their activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the current section 130 requires that an airport&hyphen;lessee company take all reasonable steps to comply with any final airport environment strategy, it does not require that other persons carrying out activities on an airport site do so. An amendment is proposed to allow for regulations to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EP regulations will establish a regime to identify and `manage' any pollution or sources of pollution at the leased airport sites. Soil pollution is a serious hazard, and there will be provision for remediation of pre&hyphen;existing pollution, as well as for soil pollution that occurs after the regulations come into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process is enshrined in the EP regulations but cannot be applied to pre&hyphen;existing contamination due to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 restriction on regulations with retrospective effect. To overcome this limitation, a proposed amendment will enable the Airport Environment Officer to require remediation of sites identified as polluted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In drafting the EP regulations, we have been constrained in the penalties that can be used for breaches of certain regulations. The amendment proposed to section 132 will enable appropriate variable penalties to be set in these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the EP regulations avoid a strict liability approach, we want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm. Given the seriousness of these offences, they should be addressed in the act rather than the regulations. Having surveyed state environmental legislation, drawing particularly on the South Australian and Queensland regimes, we believe a tiered approach to environmental harm is the best approach. The proposed amendments set out offences in the act to deal with persons intentionally or recklessly causing:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> serious environmental pollution;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> material environmental pollution&mdash;lesser but nevertheless serious harm; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> environmental nuisance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1368">
<PARA STYLE="Para">The amendments on environmental matters are consistent with the tougher stance being taken by states to strengthen their environment protection laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Prohibiting subleasing to trusts</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that trusts may be used to evade the ownership provisions of part 3 of the act. The amendment will prohibit a trust being declared in a sublease or a licence, and also prohibit the separation of the legal and beneficial interests of a sublessee or licensee. The regulation making powers in sections 34 and 35 have also been amended to impose or prohibit certain terms being put in the sublease or licence agreements to ensure that any future developments in this area can be dealt with by making regulations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments to the Air Navigation Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 to allow a national register of encumbered aircraft to be established pursuant to regulations to be made under the act. The register was originally proposed by the aviation industry who will benefit by providing buyers and sellers of aircraft with information on registered security interests held by lenders and creditors over aircraft, including airframes, engines and avionics. However, the register will provide no legal protection on transactions and will not deem a person who has not searched the register to have notice of its contents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is envisaged that Airservices Australia will be responsible for the development and ongoing administration of the register of security interests over encumbered aircraft. The register is to be established on a national basis and will operate on a fully cost recovered system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the states and territories have given their in-principle approval for the establishment of the register. The states, with the exception of Victoria, have complementary legislation in the form of their Air Navigation Acts which currently pick up the regulations made under the Commonwealth's Air Navigation Act 1920. Victoria has agreed to adopt similar legislation so that the register can be established as a comprehensive national register.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments in relation to charter flights</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1996 the government took a major step towards a more liberalised and flexible international air charter market in Australia with the release of updated charter guidelines. The government believes that charter operators provide competition for scheduled airlines and their growth will promote efficiency in the air transport industry, with subsequent benefits to users of air transport services and the wider economy. Charter operators also have the potential to further develop new markets and bring tourists directly to major regional centres throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments in the bill will streamline approval processes for charter applications and strengthen consumer protection mechanisms. The bill provides that applications to conduct charter flights will only be accepted from the owner of the aircraft or the operator of the aircraft. The government's intention is that persons such as tour package operators should not be allowed to apply for permission to operate charter flights. This ensures that only persons reasonably capable of completing the program of charters will be given permission to operate international non&hyphen;scheduled flights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A statutory requirement is also being introduced requiring applicants to provide evidence that fare paying passengers will be indemnified for financial loss caused by the failure of the charter operator to fulfil its obligations or complete a program of charters. The charter guidelines released by the government in June 1996 will also be revised to reflect the above amendments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of long&hyphen;term leases on federal airports, starting with Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, will improve airport investment and operations. With the selection of the successful bidders and finalisation of the sale of leases expected soon, successful bidders should commence operation of these airports in the first half of this year. To provide certainty to new airport operators and existing airport tenants, and to ensure that the Commonwealth can exercise adequate regulatory control over leased airports, it is essential that this legislation be passed in the current 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1369"> sittings to meet that timetable. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the following reports: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development of facilities for Army Logistics Training Centre and the Bandiana Logistics Group at Bandiana and Bonegilla, Victoria&mdash;3rd report for 1997</EMPHASIS> , and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60th General Report of the Committee</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the reports be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of the Army Logistics Training Centre and the Bandiana Logistics Group at Bandiana and Bonegilla, Victoria. The proposal examined by the committee involves the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provision of office accommodation, trade training and structural facilities, weapons storage and repair and upgraded engineering services. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed works is $16.081 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The army's facilities at Bandiana and Bonegilla have been developed over the past two decades. Facilities occupied by the Army Logistics Training Centre are a major investment for the training of soldiers. Activities range from initial trade and employment training to non&hyphen;commissioned officers and officer level courses. The types of courses offered include trade training, integrated logistics training, career and promotional training and equipment training. The committee concluded that there is a need to:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> upgrade several administrative facilities for the Bandiana Logistics Group;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rationalise training facilities to support the creation of the Army Logistics Training Centre;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rationalise messing in North Bandiana; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> further upgrade engineering services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The scope of the proposed work examined by the committee includes the adaptive re&hyphen;use of seven existing buildings, the construction of extensions to four buildings and the construction of three new buildings. The committee concluded that the proposed development will rectify a number of deficiencies which have arisen as a result of organisational changes and can be justified because the Bandiana&hyphen;Bonegilla area will remain as the army's major logistics training establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of organisations representing community interests strongly support the proposal. All pointed to the army having been a longstanding and significant part of the Albury&hyphen;Wodonga community and an exemplary corporate citizen. In addition, the army has integrated well within the regional community and has contributed to regional income, employment, skills and infrastructure. I compliment the army and commend these recommendations to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report I have tabled is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60th General Report of the Committee</EMPHASIS>. This is for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1370"> the last calendar year, but it must be remembered that members of the committee were appointed in May and the first reference was not received until June 1996 because of the election. The committee received 10 references during 1996 and reported on five of these. The remaining five references have either been reported on or will be reported on shortly. The cost of projects reported on during the year was $88.526 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The year in review was marked by a general agreement on public works proposals from organisations and individuals consulted by departments. The committee believes that this is due to departments being more conscious of their obligations to consult early and widely during the development of proposals before they are referred to the committee. I should add that the committee's present status and the awareness of departments of their obligations reflects well on the committee's former chairman, the member for Throsby, Mr Hollis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One positive result has been that public hearings have not been unduly protracted. Another result has been the avoidance of extraneous debate on issues of marginal relevance being introduced into the committee's deliberations. The committee recognises that public works projects often result in benefits flowing to local communities in addition to the actual buildings and services provided. This was illustrated in two of the committee's investigations during 1996. As part of the development of facilities in Townsville for the 5th Aviation Regiment and for infrastructure on the Townsville field training area, the Townsville City Council commissioned a study by the Centre for Applied Economic Research at James Cook University which illustrated the economic benefits of each proposal. The study showed that economic benefits flowing from the two Townsville projects amounted to a total of $120 million. The projects were also each predicted to create over 300 full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time jobs for members of the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth Conference of Commonwealth and State Public Works Committees was hosted by a committee of the ACT Legislative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Assembly on 5 and 6 August 1996 in Canberra. Representatives of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australian, Tasmanian, ACT and New Zealand legislatures were in attendance. The conference provides a forum for discussion on the operations of public works committees across Australia and New Zealand and compares methods of scrutiny for the funding of public works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Public Works Committee Act 1969, all public works estimated to cost $6 million or more must be referred to the committee. Medium works&mdash;those with an estimated cost of between $2 million and $6 million&mdash;may also be referred. The committee is aware that some departments may divide a single project costing more than $6 million into two or more components to avoid the need for referral to the committee. To avoid this, the committee requests information from departments on medium works. The plans and sites may be inspected by the committee to determine if further investigation is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee did not examine any new overseas works during the year. However, it did agree to a request from the Overseas Property Group to increase funding for the refurbishment of Australia House in London from $14.25 million to $21.28 million. Consultations are continuing with appropriate ministers to improve the committee's effectiveness, both in Australia and overseas, in its role as a watchdog of public capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the year, the committee discussed the merits of amending the Public Works Committee Act 1969 to reflect current construction prices and to improve the committee's administrative arrangements. Suggestions included:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increasing the statutory limit for referrals from $6 million to a figure reflecting the higher cost of construction;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> requiring that the committee be kept informed of all public works within a certain range and, if considered in the public interest, allowing the committee to conduct formal examination of any such project;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1371">
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> inserting a clause in the act to allow the committee to give approval for concurrent documentation; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> requiring a central agency to prepare an annual consolidated list of public works proposals for a given financial year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the end of 1996, the committee was continuing its consideration of these matters, especially amendments to the act and consequential arrangements. During 1996, the House of Representatives Committee Office, which administers the committee secretariat, was restructured. The result of the restructuring was the linking of the secretariat with that of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. Resources are shared and staff allocated according to each committee's workload. So far, I can report, the reorganisation has not affected the operations of the committee. I commend the reports to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;May I mention my full support for and thanks to the Public Works Committee, led by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and supported by the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I thank the member for Throsby for his continuing interest, even though it is in a different capacity, in the army establishments at Bandiana and Bonegilla in the electorate of Indi. The report signals and gives the green light to the expenditure of some $16 million on very important new buildings, upgrades and new amenities. More significantly, the works also recognise that the Australian Army has confirmed that Bandiana and Bonegilla will remain as the army's major logistical training establishments in Australia. These very significant establishments have served the nation very well for many years and will now, in their new modernised role, take on even more significance and importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention also that this year is the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Bonegilla Migrant Centre&mdash;an establishment which signalled the beginning of the migration into Australia of some 300,000 migrants from war-torn Europe. There are now more than one million descendants of those people in Australia. The army's involvement in those buildings and its new role in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bonegilla&mdash;in particular, the relationship between our migrants and the defence forces&mdash;are an important page in the history of Australia. Many migrants have joined the defence forces and have served with great distinction, and they continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish the Public Works Committee well in their deliberations. I thank them for their attention. I would also like to acknowledge the very professional presentation to the Public Works Committee by Army and by officers and support staff. Obviously that had a significant effect in influencing the committee to give a favourable report and the go&hyphen;ahead for these very significant establishments in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to lend my support to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60th General Report of the Committee</EMPHASIS> , which has just been presented by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I really think members, and indeed the general public, have very little idea about the diversity of the work carried out by the Public Works Committee. We all claim that each committee we are on works very hard, and I have absolutely no doubt that they do, but the sheer diversity of projects that come before the Public Works Committee and the amount of reading and research that members have to do, especially the chairman&mdash;I, being the former chairman, know this&mdash;are really quite phenomenal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very few committees that have such a bipartisan approach as this committee. I think that is because people do not become members and certainly do not become chairman of this committee to advance their careers. I speak from personal experience: having been chairman of the committee for eight years, I am still a backbencher. People have used other committees to further their careers. They have been chair of a committee for 12 or 18 months and suddenly they have a ministry or are in the shadow ministry. Being Chairman of the Public Works Committee brings its own rewards, so I am quite happy to have remained a backbencher, even though I was chair of that committee for eight years. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1372">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Works Committee always acts in a bipartisan way. In the eight to 10 years I have been associated with it there have been only two dissenting reports&mdash;and both of those occurred when I was chair and both were written by members of my own party. To rub salt into the wounds, not only were the dissenting reports from my own party but they were from members of my faction within my own party! That gives an indication of the bipartisan nature of the committee's work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overriding determination of that committee is always to make sure that the taxpayer's dollar is well spent. The parliament charges that committee with the responsibility of investigating and reporting back on projects. Each project, regardless of whether it is worth hundreds of millions of dollars or on the borderline at $6 million, receives the same degree of scrutiny in determining whether the taxpayer's dollar is well spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support what the chairman said about the staff. I am concerned, though, that the workload of not only the Public Works Committee but other committees will place tremendous strain and pressure on the staff, with the sharing of committee work. It is only because of the dedication of the staff that everything is going so smoothly at present. If the Public Works Committee ever has a workload like it had a couple of years ago when it brought down about 30 reports in one year, there will be a real problem for staff in trying to adequately service this committee and other committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At some point that will have to be looked at, but at the moment I compliment the staff and particularly my friend the honourable member for Wakefield for his very good leadership of the Public Works Committee. I am proud to be a member of the committee, which serves this parliament so well.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the adjournment of debate on the consideration of the Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Services Delivery Agency Bill, I referred to the fact that one of our concerns relates to the terms and conditions of employment of employees of the agency. I am pleased to say that this matter is one of the issues that have been referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another very important issue is the capacity of the agency to deliver services in rural and remote areas. On 14 February the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, issued a document detailing arrangements for the operation of the new agency. In this document she asserted that `the agency will improve the services to rural and remote Australia'. Clearly the government is concerned about perceptions, and I think they are real difficulties for the government at the moment. There is more than a perception; if anything, it is a fact out there in rural and regional Australia that this government is not doing too well in delivering services to rural and remote areas of Australia. This is not surprising, given the government's abolition of Labor's department of regional development, its slashing of funding for regional employment programs and its closure of regional CES and tax offices. It is no wonder that so many headlines are screaming `Betrayal in the bush'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why wouldn't you be concerned in the bush! For example, let us look at the unemployment figures in regional Australia at the moment. In the Richmond, Tweed and mid-north coast area it is interesting to note&mdash;and the government talks about serving rural and regional Australia&mdash;that unemployment has shot up to 15.1 per cent from 11.8 per cent at the time of the last federal election. But that is just now a consistent pattern in many areas of Australia. If we go to Rockhampton and Mackay we see that it is now 11.6 per cent, up from 9.6 per cent a month ago. In the Cairns region, and this is interesting, there are now 9,500 people looking for work. That is a figure of 8.9 per cent, up from 5.1 per cent a month ago. Finally, just by way of interest to the House, let us look at Townsville and Mount Isa. Unfortunately for those regions there are now more than 4,600 people unemployed. That represents 10.6 per cent of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1373"> local work force, up from 7.2 per cent a month ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider that this government has betrayed regional Australia. No wonder National Party figures, including today even the Western Australian Leader of the National Party, are in open revolt against the party's betrayal of rural people through its subservience to the Liberals' agenda in Canberra. That is what it is about&mdash;subservience. There is no real coalition. There is a winner and a loser. Regional Australia is losing as a result of the failure of the National Party to stand up and speak about the need for decent services in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when you look at the detail of the document that Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security, issued for this bill, you will see that there is nothing there in reality which will improve services in these regions. She only says that `possible options for future service delivery arrangements are now being examined'. You would have thought that they were concrete options, but all she can say is that they are now being considered. She then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regions where there are currently no social security offices the agency may&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">not will&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">take over some offices that are part of the . . . Commonwealth Employment Service network.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, there are no guarantees, no commitments; there is a big question. It is a con in order to ensure that the coalition locks in the National Party representatives and therefore again locks in the subservience of those representatives against the needs and aspirations of people in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing the minister promises is future advances in communication technology. We all know about them with respect to Medicare offices now. The offices and the jobs disappear from regional Australia, and what do you get? A fax machine. She goes on to say that, with respect to these matters, communication technology could lead to significant improvements in service delivery. I reject that because the truth is that services are going to get worse, not better, in rural and regional Australia. For example, just ask the people in Mareeba and in Cairns, who have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lost their local CES office, or ask the people in Townsville, who have lost their local tax office. It is really about the withdrawal of services from regional Australia and the loss of job opportunities. And it is going to get worse elsewhere in Australia, especially in areas of high unemployment and entrenched long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting that the government is setting up its one-stop shop as an agency rather than as a department of government, as the Department of Social Security's network has previously been. It is doing this in part to avoid, I suggest, proper parliamentary scrutiny of its policies in relation to the agency, the board and the employees of the agency. The government has already appointed an interim chief executive officer for the agency before the agency is established in law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about the issue of wage restraint at the moment. We often get lectures from those on the other side of the House about the need for ordinary working people&mdash;such as people on $400 or $420 per week gross wage in a child-care centre, or driving a truck or cleaning Parliament House&mdash;to exercise restraint. What do we find? The new head of this agency is to draw a salary in the order of $350,000 per year. So much for restraint when it comes to the appointment of mates of this government. I am sure that this will keep her in touch with the battlers&mdash;a $350,000 a year salary package! That is sure to keep her in touch with the battlers who have to rely on social security benefits or have to endure long-term unemployment! Whatever happened to the stated so-called concern of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about executive salaries being too high?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An interim chairperson has also been appointed to the agency before it is properly established in law. It is interesting to note that he used to be the head of Mobil Oil. Is that the right background for the person chosen to head an agency looking after the most needy in our society? I hope that in taking up this position he does not start charging fees for government services like Mobil and other oil companies set the price of petrol, as was clearly evidenced over the recent holiday 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1374"> period and exposed by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evasion of parliamentary scrutiny in this bill goes even further. This is why I think the House ought to be concerned. People responsible for these matters ought to be directly accountable to this House. Agency operations are now expected to start in effect in April, even before the proper passage of this legislation through parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From about that time the agency will be referring job seekers off to private employment agencies and the CES will start to wither on the vine. The physical transfer of all other offices will take place between then and September. A total of 600 offices need to be visited&mdash;approximately half CES and half Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that to undertake the physical transfer of all the related infrastructure will be a huge task. The government has now admitted that it will cost $37 million in 1996&hyphen;97 to set the agency up. Is this expense justified when such a minimal part of the CES is being relocated? The reality is that the CES is being dismantled. The government is not talking about putting the collocated CES and DSS offices together any more in the interests of efficiency. Because of the twisted way it has gone about these reforms, the CES offices which become part of the new Public Employment Placement Enterprise must now be distanced from the new agency. This is because they will be in conflict with the agency's functions, as just one of many other bodies to which the new agency might refer unemployed persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this government was elected on 2 March 1996, there were 320 CES offices in Australia. There were 298 DSS offices in Australia. On 28 June last year, the government announced the closure&mdash;one of their decisions on the run&mdash;of 26 of the CES offices. Unfortunately, some of those CES offices, such as in Granville in western Sydney, were closed in areas of exceptionally high unemployment, as was also the case in northern Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total number of government offices comprehensively servicing the unemployed and social security beneficiaries will now be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduced even further to less than half its pre-election number&mdash;from more than 600 to just 300. So much for core election promises and a requirement to deliver a service to all Australians, irrespective of where they live. But it is worse still for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, because you represent an area of need and high unemployment, that many job seekers frequently go to the CES office without needing to go to the DSS office if they are looking for a particular vacancy rather than going to get their benefit. Unfortunately for those people and their families, there will now be only half as many as places for them to go to for the basic public employment assistance required. While many CES and DSS offices are currently collocated, many are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the House that the reductions in office numbers will increase transport costs. I know this doesn't worry the well&hyphen;heeled representatives on the other side of the House because transport costs are not really of concern to them as they drive around in their white limousines. For ordinary working people who are unemployed, the cost of additional transport is a huge issue when you consider the benefits that they receive. Every $2 or $4 represents a huge reduction in the available benefits for unemployed people to assist their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other costs are also of concern to working people and many unemployed people. These additional costs eat into the benefits that they have available to look after their families. So will the government's new work for the dole scheme: a scheme introduced on the run to cover up other difficulties the government must now confront. It is ill-thought out, mickey mouse in nature and of no great benefit to Australia at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unemployment benefit is supposed to be there to support people while they look for real jobs. The half&hyphen;baked work for the dole proposal of the Prime Minister will not create real jobs. It is decision making on the run, decision making based on an endeavour to cover up other difficulties of the government at the time of the announcement. It is not a substitute, I suggest to the House, for proper wages, real jobs or properly structured and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1375"> paid labour market programs that guarantee that people face up to their responsibilities to the community at large and that they receive access to decent accredited labour market programs that also ensure that they accept the discipline of work and, therefore, make themselves job ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through work for the dole, the government is trying to use the unemployment benefit as a way to pull down wages, along with its industrial relations changes. That is what it is about. It is not about real jobs. It is not about looking after ordinary working people. It is about playing to the gallery and failing to deliver on what I regard as a core issue at the moment: the issue of jobs and job security. We all know that the government does not have the answers to that problem, and that is reflected in the fact that unemployment today is higher than when it was elected on 2 March last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer, for example, to some of the real problems confronting regional Australia at the moment. Regional unemployment is a major issue. That is why today we made a very significant announcement on the question of the automotive industry. In Victoria alone, 30,000 jobs are dependent on the automotive industry. They require a sense of stability and security on the basis of which they can make investment decisions to not only secure those jobs and the future of a very important industry but also tie the industry to export targets and additional jobs. It is about an industry plan, industry policy out there, driven by the government in a partnership with the states and regions and companies and the work force, a partnership to secure Australia's economic future. A partnership accepts that, if the government is prepared to provide a helping hand, we as a community, an automotive industry and a work force are prepared to face up to our responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole, I believe, is aiming to force unemployed people into unacceptably low paid work to create a new class of working poor, as in the United States and New Zealand. This government's responsibility, whether they like it or not, is to create real jobs&mdash;not to make it harder for the unemployed to find the few real jobs that are out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there because of its heartless economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading amendment that I will move seeks to counter the government's dishonest attempt to evade proper parliamentary scrutiny. That is what it is about. So much for its ministerial code of practice. It is in tatters. Now, through this bill which sets up a new agency, it is seeking to even further ignore and walk away from the requirement of parliamentary scrutiny with respect to what I consider one of the most important issues in Australia at the moment, that is, ensuring that we provide a decent service to all Australians to create opportunities for those who are unemployed to get job ready and back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also another reason why the government is setting up this new body as an agency rather than a government department. It is doing this as one of the first steps towards its long-term plan to remove government altogether from the delivery of services to the Australian people. We saw another of these steps earlier this week with Dr Kemp's announcement of some new so-called one-stop apprenticeship shops all run by private companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House of what Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton&mdash;the person John Howard appointed to head his department&mdash;said. He has made no secret of his desire to see the Australian Public Service reduced to a minimal policy body with no role in the provision of services. That was at a time when he was not only drawing a very significant salary from the Commonwealth but also relying on some additional allowances for serving on boards to which he had previously been appointed. So much for his concern as he pontificates about the needs and aspirations of ordinary working people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also said recently that the Commonwealth Public Service could be cut from the approximately 130,000 who remain there after the savage cuts this government has already made to just 50,000 by the turn of the century. You know who will be the loser again&mdash;regional Australia. Further jobs will be reduced from government employment in regional Australia which, in turn, will take 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1376"> private sector jobs out of regional Australia. Another 80,000 public sector jobs are to go, not to mention, as I said, all the private sector jobs that will also hit the wall as a consequence of this government's heartless approach to government services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But who would be surprised at this? Who will pick up the delivery of services under the coalition's plans? Will it be, by any chance, the big private banks who featured so prominently in the list of donors to the Liberal Party in the last election campaign? After all, they have already been paid off with respect to changes to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government wants to turn not only the unemployed into a source of profits for its private sector friends but also all Australians who need government assistance into an industry for corporate profits. Unfortunately, this will reward its list of donors at the last federal election. This government is not about improving services for the needy or making these services more efficient; it is about milking the needy to line the pockets of its election fund donors. This bill must be understood as a further step down that path. That is why I will be moving an amendment to this bill this afternoon. That is why the Labor Party will rigorously examine and seek to amend this bill and the even nastier related bills now before the Senate. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses grave concern about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of, and public accountability for, the use of the Minister's power to require the Board of the Agency to implement the `general policies' of the Government in relation to the Agency, the Board or the employees of  the Agency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Board's unfettered power to set the terms and conditions of the Chief Executive Officer; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the erosion of public service terms and conditions through the Agency's ability to employ staff under terms and conditions different to those specified in the Public Service Act".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment goes to the question of scrutiny. We know that the question of parliamentary scrutiny is not just a non-issue for the government but also one which they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> completely disregard. It is an issue which they completely treat with utter contempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment also goes to the board's unfettered power to set the terms and conditions of the Chief Executive Officer. Punish the unemployed, attack those in need in the community but look after one's mates. With a $350,000 salary package, I think there ought to be some accountability to this House. If there is a time for restraint, it should be shared by all in the community. Some should not line their pockets while ordinary working people suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the amendment goes to the erosion of Public Service terms and conditions of employment through the agency's ability to employ staff under terms and conditions different to those specified in the Public Service Act. There is no way that terms and conditions of the people employed by the agency will receive anywhere near the consideration that was given to the salary package of the head of the agency. It will be about driving down the terms and conditions of those people. They are already lacking a sense of job security as a means of making savings to ensure that the head of the agency receives a package way over what could be ordinarily accepted in the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask that the House seriously consider the nature of this bill. I ask that the House seriously consider whether or not we as a nation ought to provide a decent service to all Australians; a service that goes to all regions of Australia; a service that is universal in nature and that says to all Australians in times of need that the role of the Commonwealth government is to offer a helping hand, not to punish those who unfortunately find themselves in difficult circumstances at the moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill 1996. This bill will establish a new statutory authority to be formally known as the Commonwealth Services Delivery 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1377"> Agency, which will be responsible for delivering a variety of Commonwealth services. The new agency will bring together services from several different Commonwealth departments so that clients can access all the services they need in the one place. This means that the way the federal government delivers its services to the people of Australia will be vastly improved. They will be more efficient, more effective and more accessible&mdash;nothing like what the previous speaker, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), has described. He has used this debate merely for scoring cheap political shots rather than going to the heart of this bill, which is to provide services to the people of Australia such as those in my electorate of  McEwen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary focus of the new agency will be to provide excellent customer service, whether that be in person or over the telephone. The agency will initially provide all the income support and related services now provided by the Department of Social Security and farm household support and drought relief payments for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The agency will also provide the registration, assessment and referral services as well as some self-service facilities currently available through the Commonwealth Employment Service. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs student assistance centres and student payments and services will also fall under the agency's responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the start of next year the agency will deliver child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate. In future, other Commonwealth government services will be added to the agency, and customers will be able to do more government business in the one place at the one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main aim of the new agency is to offer high quality service to its customers. The agency will adopt a customer charter and have guaranteed standards of service. It will have a more streamlined and customer&hyphen;focused approach to service, targeted to individual and family needs. There will be an improved telephone service as well as a variety of other ways to do business, including face-to-face 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> office interviews by appointment, home visits and computer links.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major problems with current Commonwealth service arrangements is the complexity and duplication of dealing with government agencies. If you are a parent needing help with child-care payments, you have to tackle both the Department of Social Security and Medicare. If you are unemployed, you have to first register with the CES, then apply to Social Security for benefits, and then continually zigzag between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there are some suburbs and towns which are fortunate enough to have both of these services within close proximity of each other, sometimes even sharing the same building. In suburban areas it may just mean a short bus or train trip, or even a quick drive down the road. But in rural and regional areas, like those in my electorate of McEwen, having to deal with two or three different agencies in many cases means having to travel to three different towns, hundreds of kilometres apart. Having all these services, benefits and allowances in the one place will take much of the headache and frustration out of many of the aspects of dealing with government agencies and make life much easier for many customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To illustrate this point, let me give concrete actual examples from my electorate of McEwen&mdash;and the tragedy is that I could choose any area or town in my electorate because in the 14,500 square kilometres that make up McEwen there is not one DSS office. Therefore, Madam Deputy Speaker, I can tell you that many of the remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Batman, fall on very barren ground in my electorate of McEwen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I could pick any area, but for the purpose of this debate today I will take as an example a single father living in Broadford. Let us imagine that the father has recently been retrenched and has to travel 20 kilometres to Seymour to register with the CES. He makes an appointment with Social Security to speak to someone about unemployment benefits. Unfortunately, the nearest DSS office is 165 kilometres away at Wangaratta. He has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1378"> a daughter who is in year 12 and receives Austudy. She has to make an appointment to speak to someone about her father's change of circumstances in case it affects her payments. This means a 190&hyphen;kilometre round trip to Bendigo to the student assistance centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this example is purely hypothetical, it clearly illustrates the difficulties many of my constituents face with the current Commonwealth service delivery arrangements in the Seymour district. There are very limited and quite expensive public transport options. So, if you do not have a car or access to one, you simply cannot visit these services in person. The lack of access to Social Security is a constant cause of concern among my constituents living in the central highlands region, which takes in Kilmore, Wallan, Broadford, Seymour and surrounding areas, including the large army base at Puckapunyal. Also, these conditions apply to the Upper Yarra region in the east of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until recently the DSS office in Wangaratta had a regular outreach service which visited Seymour and operated out of the local CES office. This enabled clients from the Seymour region to speak directly to a Social Security officer about any queries or problems they might have. Unfortunately, when the CES had to move to smaller offices, the DSS visiting service was forced to look elsewhere for a base. Although there is still an ad hoc visiting service in place, it is largely inadequate to meet the growing demands of customers in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Social Security acknowledges the need for a regular service to this area, primarily on the basis of statistics alone. Its figures show that the Seymour, Kilmore, Broadford and Wallan region has a DSS customer base of more than 6,000 people. It is also an area of high population growth. I am informed by the local municipality, the Shire of Mitchell, that between 1986 and 1991 Broadford's population alone grew by 4.8 per cent. This trend is reflected across the entire region, with Seymour's population increasing by one per cent, Kilmore by two per cent, Wallan by 32 per cent, and Wandong and Heathcote Junction by 58 per cent&mdash;and no services. So I do hope the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Batman is listening. If this population growth continues, as all trends indicate, then the need for employment and social security services will increase even further over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Bureau of Statistics unemployment figures for the Goulburn&hyphen;Ovens&hyphen;Murray region, which encompasses the Seymour district, have constantly fluctuated over the past six months from a low of 5.3 per cent to eight per cent, with Broadford actually coming in at 8.9 per cent and Nagambie at 9.1 per cent. There is also a large elderly population and an increasing number of families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent months I have been inundated with concerns from individuals and community organisations in the Seymour-Kilmore area stressing the need for more social security services in Seymour. These organisations include Kilmore and District Hospital, Seymour Legacy and Goulburn Valley Family Care&mdash;groups with a direct concern in the welfare of local residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Secretary of Seymour Legacy, Mr Des Callaghan, wrote to me about the problem last month, and we have discussed the lack of services on several occasions since. One of his main concerns is that widows under the care of Seymour Legacy must first direct all their inquiries to a DSS office&mdash;and, remember, we do not have one; the nearest one is situated 145 kilometres away in Wangaratta, with very little public transport available. In his letter, Mr Callaghan wrote</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you no doubt are aware, Legacy care for War Widows and dependants. Legatees of Seymour Legacy Group have 165 widows and 10 children in their care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The widows are finding it very difficult in contacting the Wangaratta Office with the present telephone system. If and when they are able to make contact, they are then referred to the Geelong Office. Most of the Widows are elderly and this can be very confusing and frustrating for them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are many more people who live in the central highlands who share their concerns. I would have to say that the majority of inquiries to my office which come from that region are related to social security, employment or student payments. Many of these also express anger at their attempts to contact the DSS via the telecentre numbers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1379">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complaints about the teleservice are many and varied&mdash;they do not understand the verbal instructions, the contact is impersonal, they speak to a different person each time they call or they are put on hold for up to 45 minutes. For most of us this type of service would be frustrating and annoying, but for DSS customers, many of whom are elderly, have disabilities or are under some form of stress, it can be the last straw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marg Findlay, Manager of the Seymour Office of Goulburn Valley Family Care, says that a lot of the local DSS clients who visit her office are frustrated by the current service delivery arrangements. She said that many families already felt emotionally vulnerable when they contacted DSS and could not handle or understand over-the-phone advice. Marg Findlay states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Personal contact is best. Sometimes people need that face-to-face contact, particularly if people are recently separated and are distressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are talking about people who are in some degree of emotional stress, for them to have to contact Social Security in the first place. It's about people having to hear things more than once; people who don't have a phone at home and have to go down the street and use a public phone and try to contend with trucks driving past. This is rural Australia. That is the reality of living in the bush. But you should still have access to these services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the moment the Wangaratta DSS visiting service to Seymour operates on a demand basis. Currently demand is so high that DSS staff, including financial information service officers, social workers and, occasionally, disability support officers, visit Seymour at least once a fortnight&mdash;sometimes more frequently, depending on the availability of office space to operate from. Staff will also conduct home visits and make arrangements for emergency visits if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, because there is no permanent base for the service to operate from, the current ad hoc arrangements must remain in place for the time being. Clients simply cannot front up to the DSS offices on the day they are in Seymour; they have to first make appointments by dialling the general telecentre number which, as mentioned before, on many occasions can be most unsatisfactory. If customers wish to travel to Wanga 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ratta for an appointment, they face a 3&half;&hyphen; to four&hyphen;hour round trip by car, which is costly in both petrol and time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growing unrest in the Seymour region regarding lack of direct access to social security services prompted me to invite the federal Minister for Social Security, the Hon. Jocelyn Newman, to visit Broadford and Seymour in January this year to discuss this very issue. Representatives from a broad cross&hyphen;section of local community organisations were invited to speak with the minister about this lack of services and the need for better access. I am pleased to say that the meeting proved to be very productive and was successful in bringing this major local problem to the minister's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families in this region also face access problems in regard to student payments and services. With the student assistance centre for country inquiries located at Bendigo, students must travel by car to Bendigo, which in some cases is much more than an hour away, or must rely on getting that information over the telephone. One constituent contacted my office last week in sheer frustration after trying to contact a student assistance centre all day and the number being constantly engaged. While telephone contact is useful in most cases, often in urgent situations or for queries of a technical nature, being able to visit an agency personally is so much better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a clear need for a Commonwealth service delivery agency to be set up in Seymour. High unemployment, a large number of elderly people and families, substantial population growth and isolation from existing social security, CES and student assistance centres highlight this need. The government is committed to improving the standard and reach of services for people living in rural and remote areas through the new agency arrangement. This includes providing agency outlets in communities where the need for these services grows. The Seymour region is one such community. I intend to continue to strongly lobby for an agency in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among other improvements under consideration for the new agency are better mobile and visiting services, electronic lodgment of forms, providing services over the Internet, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1380"> and upgrading and extending teleservice arrangements to include more staff, more sites, new technology and training staff in advanced telephone technique. I hope that these additional improvements are examined closely and, if proved to be efficient and effective, are adopted as a matter of urgency, for there are many thousands of Australians in regional areas who will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take, for example, people living in the Upper Yarra and Healesville regions in my electorate. Unemployment is a major problem in this region, with DEETYA figures for the June 1996 quarter showing jobless rates in Healesville at 8.7 per cent and in the Upper Yarra at 9.1 per cent to 13.1 per cent. Although they are fortunate to have both CES and social security offices close by in Lilydale, they too are severely limited by a lack of access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sally Kiernan, the Centre Manager of Upper Yarra Community House, says many unemployed people and sole parents living in Healesville and the Upper Yarra region have little or no means to get to Lilydale to access the services and, even if they can get there, there is often a long wait in a queue or they need to return with more information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Kiernan says there is very limited public transport available to Lilydale and, in many cases, people have to walk up to six kilometres or more to reach their local transport service. She told me of one local youth who simply has no means whatsoever of getting to Lilydale to lodge his dole form. Ms Kiernan says, `That, coupled with a sense of disenfranchisement, means he is living on nothing. There are many more like him who do not even bother registering.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disturbing to think that people who need to access the support that Social Security and the CES provide are unable to do so due to a lack of access. Imagine what this does to their self-esteem, confidence and sense of being as an individual. If people have no access to personal service, so often they feel isolated, alone and helpless. This only serves to compound the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to consider these people who need personal service and ensure that they can access that service. This legislation will go a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> long way to ensuring that this is the case. The legacy that we have been left with after 13 years of Labor government&mdash;this isolation, this lack of service, this inefficiency, this inadequate provision of services&mdash;is stark reality of the legacy that Labor left the people living in regional areas in my electorate of McEwen, and they have to face it on a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill marks a new era in customer service for the government and, most importantly, to my constituents because it will mean better services. On behalf of the people of my electorate of McEwen, I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am sorry to say to them that they can be sure that each and every one of those towns will not be getting a branch of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for McEwen also made the point that people are waiting for extensive periods on the phone, and I could not agree with her more. The idea that this agency is going to improve this situation under this government is completely laughable. That is what the constituents of McEwen need to hear loud and clear, because what is going to happen as a result of this legislation is that thousands of people are going to lose their jobs. So the idea that the service is going to improve is just a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case, as pointed out by my colleague the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), that the Labor Party does not oppose the concept of increasing efficiency in the delivery of services&mdash;if only that were the only part of this bill. What we do oppose are clever schemes, smokescreens, designed to camouflage this government's intentions to, in fact, cut services to low income Australians. We see much in this proposal that seems to fit into the category of smokescreen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jagajaga, the electorate that I represent, is in a region of Melbourne with double-digit unemployment. Within the electorate there are pockets of unemployment, where we have very long-term unemployment and the pervading problem of high youth unemployment. To many of the people who are caught in this long-term unemployment trap, the labour market programs and the case management that were introduced by Labor did give some hope for the future. There was some break to the deadly long-term unemployment cycle. What these people want&mdash;what they wanted then and what they want now&mdash;is to be able to get a job or to retrain, if necessary. What they fear from these notions of efficient delivery, as defined by this government, is that there will not be any training programs because they have all been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are living in the north&hyphen;east of Melbourne and looking for employment via access to the services that are currently provided at the CES office&mdash;for example, in Greensborough&mdash;we are going to see this legislation, as the member for Batman said, gut the types of services available from the CES to the extent that only basic services are available. That is the issue that the constituents of McEwen need to realise. Firstly, they will not get all the services in each and every town; secondly, they will have to wait for hours on the phone because fewer people will be employed; and, thirdly, only basic services will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government also wants to see is that we move to a privatised employment service. A major problem with privatised employment services is that they only want the ones who are easy to place in jobs. What we are not going to see from these organisations is the detailed and time consuming effort that is put by the CES into the case management which gets the long-term unemployed back into work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also has this proposal for a capacity to benefit test, which I think is a further example of the path down which they want employment services to go. Under this extremely draconian proposal, anybody who is assessed as not having the capacity to benefit from a training program would simply 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fail to qualify for training or other benefits. This is an agenda for abandoning sections of the work force who become trapped in long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point of this, however, is that it is going to see a loss of quality in the delivery of basic services to the Australian community. Overall, this is what this government is about, because it only wants to save money. A very good example of this is what is going to happen to the delivery of child-care payments under this new agency. The government's proposal is that the agency will be the medium for the payment of child-care benefits&mdash;in itself a harmless enough sounding proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea was originally floated in the Economic Planning Advisory Council inquiry into the provision of child&hyphen;care services. That report recommended that all benefits&mdash;that is, those currently paid as child&hyphen;care assistance, paid at the moment directly to child&hyphen;care centres; and the child&hyphen;care cash rebate, paid as a reimbursement to parents for child&hyphen;care payments, currently paid via Medicare agencies&mdash;be replaced by a single payment made directly to parents. As that report said, the parents would then have direct control of the money to be paid to the child&hyphen;care centres, and be even more empowered with&mdash;that favourite buzz word of the government&mdash;`choice'. If parents are unhappy about the aspects of the centre they are using, they will be able to choose another and another and another. It sounds terrific&mdash;unless, of course, you are the parent or the child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is the case that parents are supposed to be happy with the change, why is it that parents and child&hyphen;care centres, including the thousands of small business, privately owned child&hyphen;care centres around Australia, are so implacably opposed to this idea? Why did they oppose it when it was first raised by the Economic Planning Advisory Council inquiry, and why do they oppose it now? They oppose it because, as people who actually deliver and use child&hyphen;care services, they understand the industry and they understand small business. They know that this measure will actually reduce efficiency and increase costs for both the consumers and the providers. There are a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1382"> number of reasons why both parents and child&hyphen;care centres are opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first place, they have come to understand that this government has a basic anti&hyphen;child&hyphen;care agenda. They realise that the best scenario for the vast majority in the government is that child care is not even necessary: that if women went back into the home, it would help solve unemployment and, of course, reduce government expenditure. But try selling that to the women of Australia. It is not the 1950s. It is the case now that lots of women and men need to work. They want to work. It is true that they would like to have more time at home with their children, but the reality of life is they have to work to maintain their standards of living. Most families do need help with child care; both with the cost of care and with regulating its provision to make sure that we have a high quality and standard of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents and the providers of child care have come to the view that this government has no commitment to working women. They see this particular measure&mdash;the move to payment of benefits directly to parents through this agency&mdash;as a backdoor attempt to cut the government's commitment to provide child care. As small businesses, the child&hyphen;care centres think the agency proposal makes a mockery of the government's assertion that it has the interests of small business at heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the agency proposal, child&hyphen;care centres will have a massive increase in paperwork. The prospect of checking and chasing payments from the parents of each child at the centre has many centre owners and managers desperately concerned. They cannot believe that this government has any conception of the amount of extra bureaucratic detail that this aspect alone will force upon them. Added to this, of course, is the problem of bad debts. The centres can see themselves being caught in the middle of a no&hyphen;win situation of chasing bad debts and slow payers. The government has made it very clear to the centre operators that the government is not going to do the chasing; it will be up to the child&hyphen;care centres themselves. The child&hyphen;care centres see their job as providing child care, not as bad&hyphen;debt collectors. It will be the business cashflow 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and administration time that will be out the window under this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Economic Planning Advisory Council report originally proposed payment to parents, they envisaged that these payments would be made via what they called a `smartcard'. Parents would be able to periodically put a credit onto the smartcard at the agency, and the centres would deduct the fee through a swipe machine. The only problem with this is that the technology has not been sufficiently developed to carry out the task. But the government obviously is not letting this mere detail get in the way before it introduces this radical change. The government wants to load onto small business some of the responsibility of managing child care. It has gone ahead with the idea anyway. The child&hyphen;care centres that will just have to cope as best they can with the extra paperwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to factor in the effect of other cuts that this government has made to child care, such as the 50&hyphen;hour cap on the hours per week for which parents can claim child&hyphen;care assistance. We will be debating this in the Senate shortly. This will compound the folly and is further demonstration of the government's failure to understand the basics of small business. The Liberal government wants centres to be paid only for the hours that children attend child care. Superficially, once again this sounds fair and reasonable. But, of course, it displays a total ignorance of how child&hyphen;care centres work. These centres have services and costs that are incurred in daily and weekly units, not hourly. You only need to think about it for a few minutes to realise that that is the case. Of course they need the guarantee of set hours of paid use of their centres in order to plan their budgets and, most importantly, to make sure that staff are available to look after children on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the privately owned centres that oppose this move. In my electorate I met recently with parents and carers at an Eltham child&hyphen;care centre&mdash;a community based centre. These parents and carers also damned the government's concept of giving parents more choice. They thought it was ridiculous and that it showed, once again, a complete lack of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1383"> understanding of the needs of children and the needs and capacities of parents, particularly working parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Eltham people made the very good point that children, especially young children, need a very settled environment. They make friends in these centres and become very accustomed to the routine at a particular centre. The children obviously also need to form regular and strong relationships with those who are caring for them. It would be quite a traumatising event for a child to be ripped out of a centre and moved around, as the government somehow envisages would happen with this payment arrangement, which of course parents will not do. Equally, it is going to be very, very difficult for the children if the staff are constantly changing to meet the hourly budget pressures&mdash;I repeat: the hourly budget pressures&mdash;of child&hyphen;care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These Eltham parents and carers were also particularly sceptical about the prospects of parents shopping around for child care. The government does not seem to understand that people who use child care actually, in the main, have full&hyphen;time jobs and that parents want to be able to choose a child&hyphen;care centre and know that the child&hyphen;care centre will be able to keep its door open for the years that the child or children are going to be there and know that the staffing of the centre will be stable both for the children's sake and of course also for the parents' peace of mind. They do not want to be worrying about the problems or difficulties that the child&hyphen;care centre might have with cash flow or that they may have to lose staff either from one day to the next or, even worse, within a particular day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in Eltham were also concerned about the possibility that parents on low incomes might be forced in a crisis situation to use the child&hyphen;care benefit for some other family necessity. That is going to leave those parents with a double dilemma of a debt to the government and a debt to the centre. The same issues apply to those using and running after school hour care programs. Once again, I have had representations from concerned parents and schools running these before and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> after school programs that of course these changes are not going to help them run their services. In fact they are going to put their very viability in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I want to stress that we have very grave concerns with the implications of this legislation and those concerns are shared by all the providers and parents who use child care. They are concerns that I know have been communicated frequently to the government but, once again, those concerns seem to have fallen on deaf ears. They were communicated to the Economic Planning Advisory Council in detailed submissions&mdash;I am sure the government has seen them&mdash;but we see, once again, this so-called family friendly, small business friendly government completely ignoring the concerns of both parents and child&hyphen;care centres. There is no doubt that these changes, as far as child care is concerned, that are contained in this bill are very serious and should be reconsidered by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise at this time because my friend the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) is otherwise engaged in the Main Committee. We heard a very genuine speech by the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), but she will regrettably find out, I fear, that the constituents in her electorate in the town of Seymour will be waiting a long time indeed before they obtain one of these service delivery agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) said, this bill is about cutting back; it is about gutting service delivery, not enhancing it. If you want to go to that point, you do not have to go any further than the explanatory memorandum to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill. This year the bill is going to cost $23.7 million, presumably as a result of redundancy payments and the like. But after that it is going to save $25.1 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $53.6 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $66.2 million by the year 2000. The member for Batman is certainly correct in saying what the government is about with this move is gutting service delivery, not enhancing it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1384">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, he is also right that the bill is playing to the gallery. It is very much a pea and thimble trick. It will do nothing at all about creating jobs. The only way people are going to get into work is to create jobs. The best it can hope&mdash;and we are going to see this strategy by the government&mdash;is to squeeze more people into less skilled jobs by pushing down wages, a sort of `McDonaldisation' of the work force; that is, reducing wages, concentrating in particular on young people because they are more easily exploited. They do not have the commitments of mortgages or medical fees to such an extent, nor do they have school fees and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of contrast to what the government should be doing, as well as looking after the genuine training needs of young people to get them into proper jobs, they should be looking at the services that can be provided to more mature Australians. I note in a recent edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Focus</EMPHASIS> magazine, a magazine for over&hyphen;50s, Odette Wander says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">do not deliver on two key election promises made by the Coalition: namely, to introduce Career Transition Centres to assist mid&hyphen;life and older persons re-enter the paid workforce; and to ensure job seekers aged 45 and over are eligible immediately on registration with CES for labour market programs and case management.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This so-called more sophisticated service delivery contained in the bill says absolutely not one thing about that form of assistance which the government had promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, this government is misdirected, in that it is not doing anything meaningful to combat unemployment. It uses catch cries such as `one&hyphen;stop shops' and gimmickry, but that is all it is. The government describes this legislation as the most significant innovation in 50 years, dealing with unemployment and social services. The second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), representing the Minister for Social Security, on the employment services bill, on the other hand, admits that the machinery which is going to be contained in these service agencies is by no means new.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to cloak these services with some form of corporatisation. This agency is going to be a new corporate structure. So what if it is a new corporate structure? Quite frankly, I just cannot understand this obsession, although corporate structure tends to suggest, I suppose, in the rhetoric of those opposite, a commercial enterprise or a profit driven enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are dealing with the unemployed, when we are dealing with the underprivileged, when we are dealing with child care, when we are dealing with aged services, we are talking about, literally, the heart of social services&mdash;social security&mdash;which is very much the security of a safety net that keeps people in need from devastation and, in many cases, the effects of poverty and from almost living on starvation rations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps a second motivation of the government in the action it is taking is revealed in a recent comment attributed to Mr Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton, the head of the Prime Minister's department, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> today. Mr Moore-Wilton is reported as having said that the Public Service over the last 20 years had moved `towards excessive equity'. What a terrible thing at this level of service delivery to contemplate providing equity to all Australians! He said in effect that that drive towards equity was stifling initiative. That is all very well. We are going back to the late 19th century American frontier and the talk of rugged individualism and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those brought up in society who, because of their circumstances, are certainly more equipped to succeed. One could say, `Well, relying on your rugged individualism, you are going to get along in life,' and more often than not those who come from the higher economic brackets of society get along okay, but we are talking about a service delivery to the very needy areas of our society and any platitudes and slogans towards rugged individualism and stifling initiative are callous, short&hyphen;sighted and, quite simply, naive. To replace a history and equality of service delivery by such concepts and introduce this obsession with corporatisation and profit motive shows the government for what it is, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1385"> and that is completely naive, completely obsessed and completely lacking in answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the government should be doing nothing in respect of this legislation until the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee reports on the bill, which I understand will be on 18 March 1997. The referral to the committee raised a number of serious questions that were being reviewed by the committee, and one would think that commonsense would dictate that the government should wait until it receives that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for McEwen spoke of the benefits of this legislation in terms of it being an enhancing service delivery. In fact, it is going to do little to enhance service delivery, with close to $200 million over the next three years being taken out of the system. One cannot forget&mdash;and, with respect to the member for McEwen, she is turning a blind eye&mdash;that, fundamentally, this agency is going to be the police gateway, if you like, before people receive their benefits. Clause 7(2)(b) confirms that the agency's functions will be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . determining a person's eligibility for, or entitlement to receive or have access to, the services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But, as the member for Batman indicated, there is virtually no parliamentary review of this legislation because of the way it has been framed and, despite a glossy brochure published by the minister, it will be almost an impossibility to obtain administrative review of the legislation. The legislation is framed in terms of corporate ethics and in terms of the objects of a corporation. For example, in clause 8(1)(d), the agency's functions include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . doing anything incidental, conducive or related to the performance of any its other functions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Can you get a broader discretion than that? How can you challenge anyone exercising such a broad and absolute discretion? Similarly, in clause 12, the board of the agency has the discretion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How could anyone sensibly challenge that exercise of discretion? The Chairman also has absolute discretion as to how he carries out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his duties as, indeed, does the Chief Executive Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The discretion is so broad that there cannot possibly be any prospect of success in challenging the decisions that will be made by this agency. We should bear in mind that these decisions literally mean whether an individual and an individual's family are going to be condemned to a life of poverty and lack of opportunity. One of the things that this agency will be determining is whether the people who come before them are capable or would benefit from employment assistance. If an 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old clerk on the desk determines that someone coming before them is incapable of benefiting from the services of this agency, they are going to be condemned to the scrap heap. It is no exaggeration to say that such decisions are going to be made by 18&hyphen; and 19-year&hyphen;old clerks on the counter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any student interested in statutory drafting should look at this bill because it is so incredibly broad in its discretion and in its powers of delegation. The power of delegation from the board down to the Chief Executive Officer is absolute. The board has the power to delegate to any member or any employee of the agency. That same power of delegation also rests with the chairman, who has the power to delegate to the Chief Executive Officer or any employee all or any of the functions or powers of the chairman. Similarly, the Chief Executive Officer&mdash;although in this case it is required to be in writing, thankfully&mdash;has the power to delegate all or any of the functions or powers of the Chief Executive Officer, including functions or powers delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, to any employee she likes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the totality of power&mdash;the power to determine someone's quality of life&mdash;can be delegated to an 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old clerk on the counter without any parliamentary review and without any prospect of administrative review. That is quite simply wrong. It is Big Brother in the extreme and it is Big Brother delegated right down the level without any overview or prospect of appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to happen to the history of public service that has literally been provided by public servants over the past 50 years to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1386"> the most needy in our society? It will be gutted. It will be gutted because the Chief Executive Officer has the power under the legislation to employ whoever she likes and to engage as consultants whoever she likes. One has to ask the question: who is going to be squeezed out of the equation? Is it going to be those longstanding public servants who are accruing leave entitlements, long service leave entitlements, superannuation entitlements and the like or is it going to be new starters that the Chief Executive Officer can engage on such terms and conditions as she likes or at least as she can negotiate? Quite clearly, it will be the traditional public servants who are squeezed out. The newcomers will be these people who are fitting the mould of the so-called private marketeers or free enterprise deliverers of agency services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole thrust of this legislation is literally to dismantle the Commonwealth Employment Service and to facilitate the contracting out of employment placement to private agents. Even then, it will be completely unsatisfactory and unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My experience with these private employment agents is that for a permanent position they charge about 10 per cent of the employee's salary. For a secretary, for instance, on $20,000 a year, the agency receives a fee of about $2,000. Even if those agencies were prepared to halve their commissions because of the source of government work, one would imagine that they would still be looking at a fee in the vicinity of $1,000 per placement. That is a five per cent commission fee for someone on a very base level salary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A $1,000 fee per placement for 800,000 unemployed persons means that, if this private placement policy were to work, the government would be looking at a bill of about $800 million. If the fee is 10 per cent, they would be looking at about $1.6 million. They are not going to find that money. There has been no suggestion that they will. Accordingly, there will be two streams of private employment. Firstly, the private employment agents will be carrying on their normal and customary employment placing positions for private customers, where they are getting 10 per cent and, secondly, there is this government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> referral situation where the fee will be much less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the long&hyphen;term unemployed who are going to be allocated to these private agents will be second&hyphen;class citizens. One can well imagine the lack of priority that they are going to receive. That is all after someone has been approved by one of these clerks on the counter as being a worthwhile recipient&mdash;that is, that they could benefit from employment placement. Once they have passed that hurdle, they are destined to compete from a position of disadvantage with the private clients of the employment agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen to many residents in my electorate of Barton where approximately 30 per cent of the population are from non-English speaking backgrounds? Will they be regarded as beyond help? Will they be people who will not benefit from assistance because of the fact that they have language difficulties? Unfortunately, I fear that that will be the case. This capacity to benefit test will be draconian in the extreme. The government says, `If they do not meet the capacity to benefit test, we will send them out to the community service providers.' The community service providers are people who advise the unemployed in this case of benefits that they can obtain from either the government or other private agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is telling people in need what benefit they can obtain from private agencies. That is something that is unheard of. Instead of the government coming in and backing up private agencies which provide assistance to those in need, the government is flick passing what it regards as the problems&mdash;that is, those people who it determines have no capacity to benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I agree wholeheartedly with the member for Batman. This bill is all about playing to the gallery; it is about gimmickry. It is nothing at all about assisting long-term unemployed, nor is it about improving the services to those people in our society who are most in need of those services.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear all of the speech of the member for Barton (Mr McClelland)&mdash;and I apologise for that&mdash;because I was detained in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1387"> another place, nor did I hear all of the speech of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). But I did hear some of the honourable member for Batman's speech. In that speech he mentioned the injunction that the government should create real jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very interesting concept. I have wondered for a long time what that really means. The government can create a job, but it costs money to do that and that job does not necessarily create wealth for the Australian community. I do say, however, that the government can create jobs by way of capital works. I favour the creation of jobs where there are important projects. Take, for example, the very important need in my own electorate for a railway linking Petrie, Kallangur and, ultimately, the top end of Redcliffe. The proposal in question involves a loop railway line that would benefit my electorate, the electorate of the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and the electorate of the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough). Those sorts of capital works projects are very important to this country&mdash;and that is just one little microcosm of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I think&mdash;for what it is worth&mdash;is that the notion that the government provide the environment where the demand for employees to work in particular occupations will be high must engender confidence. But the notion that it can somehow create jobs, per se, across-the-board is an illusory notion. It is a total package, and the package really needs, as an essential ingredient, the confidence of the community. So there was quite a deal of ideological rhetoric in the contribution of the member for Batman on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that there has been a need to improve the system of delivering services to those in need in the community. I do not think the opposition denies that; I think the opposition accepts it. I guess the opposition does not agree with the way this matter is going forward or with the proposals we have made. I recall the member for Batman saying that they were going to do something about it, but the fact is that they did not really do anything. This measure proposes a means, an avenue, of delivering improved services to those in need in the community 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> while, at the same time, streamlining the process of service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill gives effect to the budget decision to establish a Commonwealth service delivery agent that will provide an improved standard of service to the community and to individuals and increase service delivery efficiency and effectiveness. The bill ensures, as far as possible, that people will get the help they need in the one place. The agency, as part of the social security portfolio, will be responsible for the DSS and the CES. By the end of 1997, it will have taken on some  employment and student services currently administered by DEETYA. From early 1998, it will be responsible for all child-care assistance payments. There is also the potential to add a further range of services over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main problem with the system at present is that it is confusing to the public. That confusion produces anxiety and time wasting in the various fragmented offices all over the country. Where things ought to be done by the one shop, the one place, and they are being done by a fragmented group of agencies, there is confusion, annoyance and sometimes rage. At the end of the day, that is not a good system. If you get the consumer off side, that is the making of a bad system because the consumer will complain and tie up another level of government or another area of the same department with the complaint and then the productive work of seeing things go through in a reasonably efficient manner is hindered and inhibited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, effectively, the key is that the community will be able to access services at the one time. This must, it would seem, even with the opposition's criticism of it, ultimately provide a better service because staff will provide a more comprehensive service. It is the intention of the government that the agency will provide avenues for specialisation, which will lead to a more interesting and beneficial workplace, and that the staff will have greater ownership and responsibility for their jobs. Clause 12&mdash;in particular, subclause (1)(b)&mdash;of the bill details the board's functions to ensure that the agency's functions are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1388"> properly, efficiently and effectively performed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the government, in implementing this measure, is trying to ensure that the system becomes more efficient, people who have had problems with the system are treated with respect, there is greater efficiency and there is less capacity to rip off the system. Numerous constituents have made complaints to me in my electorate about people working in the DSS treating them in a quite unsatisfactory way, and I am sure that from time to time all honourable members get complaints like that. I, as a member, obviously must listen to these complaints but, whilst some of these complaints are about services&mdash;sometimes they are personality complaints&mdash;more often I think they are complaints about the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the underlying problem, and it goes both ways. One side of the coin is the consumer not being able to access the system properly, not being able to access the proper advice or the proper service. The other side of the coin is the frustration in a situation where perhaps a diligent employee has to say, `I can't help you here. You've got to go down the road,' and when the person concerned goes down the road they are then sent somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That situation occurs in my electorate. People who go to one part of the DSS may be sent down the road to the CES only to find they are sent somewhere else. That especially occurs with Austudy problems. There is no Austudy office that can deal with inquiries. This proposal will mould this fragmented service into an effective, viable and productive agency which will serve the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, a number of complaints have come through. I had one as recently as last week from a young mother who had just separated from her husband. She went through all that trauma and when she went to the DSS for assistance to complete the forms she was met with the response, `We are here to take your form and process. We are not here to help&mdash;just process your claim. You should have had the forms filled in. We have only half an hour, you know.' That is part of the problem: there is obviously pressure on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employees and there is terrible pressure on the people trying to access this service. As a result of this response, this person did not complete the form and left in tears. She just wanted help in filling out a form for the sole parent pension, which she has a right to receive under the current system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one small example. There are obviously many others. I will mention a couple of them because it is important that people realise the system is not functioning well. A constituent telephoned to advise me she had received conflicting advice about a particular situation in relation to family payment. She was told on one occasion she would not have to pay any money back because she was not in receipt of the payment when she could have been. On the next occasion she rang she spoke to a different person and was told she would have to pay back the money. No wonder frustration sets in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some dealings with the Department of Social Security as part of my legal practice. I recall one particular case where charges of imposition on the Commonwealth were involved. Assessing quantum of the amount outstanding is obviously a very important matter because, once a person owes over a certain amount, they go to gaol. Effectively the tariff is a certain amount of money. Estimates of the amount involved in this case ranged from $7,000 to $28,000, with four or five estimates in between. When the case ultimately went to court, the amount outstanding was around $9,000. I have no idea how they worked it out. I do not think they knew how to work it out, but they were prepared to settle on that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dare say that if we had gone to trial&mdash;doing that would have cost the Commonwealth an awful lot of money&mdash;they probably would not have been able to prove the amount in any event. However, the client concerned was happy to accept that amount because it meant that they would not go to prison. But the irony was that they later came back and said, `We made a mistake. We want further moneys to be repaid.' Of course, that fell on totally stone&hyphen;deaf ears, given the history of the matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1389">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that sort of inefficiency that this measure will attempt to address. It will endeavour to tighten the reins of the system so that it functions best for all concerned. I stress again that this is not intended to sound like an attack on the diligent employees in the services concerned. They have a very difficult job, but it is equally difficult for the people who have to access these services. Many of them have never walked into this type of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall meeting a gentleman in his mid&hyphen;50s who had to apply for the unemployment benefit for the first time in his life. It was a horrendous experience for him&mdash;a man who had worked all his life. He had been made redundant and so was out of work and had to apply for a benefit. He put it off, I might add, for nine months. That experience is traumatic for the people concerned. It is difficult for the person on the other side of the counter to understand their predicament. That is understood by reasonable people, but at times frustration sets in when the opposite poles of the equation meet, as it were, which frequently results in conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is designed to avoid the situation where somebody waiting in a mile&hyphen;long queue is told when they finally reach the front of the queue, `Sorry. You should be in the queue next&hyphen;door.' This measure is about addressing the inbred frustration that can arise because of those sorts of situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could mention a number of other examples but, as contributions by members on this side have been limited to 10 minutes, I conclude by saying that the complaints I have mentioned&mdash;they are only a couple of many&mdash;are all too common and this is a response to them. I think that at the end of the day we will see a new era of efficiency in the system. Nobody pretends that there will not be some difficulties along the way. I do not think it has been suggested that all of the troubles will be over, but consolidating all of these situations under the one-stop shop principle with the desire to ultimately make the system work better is a great step forward.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill, or more so 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what it will create, from two points of view. It says a great deal about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his government and it really does reflect the contradictions. As I said, I want to canvass at least two areas. The first area is the contradiction inherent in the term `radical conservative'. The second area is the title `honest John'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning first to `radical conservative': earlier today in the Main Committee, I was trying to point out in a speech on some other matters that this government is probably the most radical government for three, four or five decades. The current Prime Minister proudly boasted how he was the most conservative Liberal leader, I think, since the war&mdash;he used some such terminology. What we are seeing from this government is a series of radical measures. The people who thought that electing a coalition government would allow them to be comfortable and relaxed may still think that, and so may government members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), was telling us a tale of woe about his problems in serving his constituents. What he did not say was that part of the problem is the fact that staff numbers have been reduced and there is more work for the staff. There are fewer staff doing more work, hence members get more problems. Every single member of parliament has been getting a noticeably higher workload in the last 12 months, and no more dramatic increase than in relation to Austudy in recent weeks. It is horrendous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker suggested that putting all this functionality into one group of people will somehow make it better. What will happen is that it will make it worse. There will be absolute chaos. He has just told us how difficult it is for a specialised department with specialised staff to get things right. When the staff are covering issues such as Austudy, youth allowances, homelessness, unemployment, child care, Medicare, what hope will a person have of getting an expert? They will all be generalists. You cannot have a person at a counter who cannot answer a question, otherwise the efficiency is lost.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1390">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the perception that this is conservative&mdash;that this is a very minimal change: a one-stop shop and a very simple notion&mdash;is absolutely deceptive and false. What is happening is radical in a range of ways. It is radical because it undermines and destroys the notion of a Public Service. What this is doing, effectively, is suborning and absolutely changing the Public Service to a set of agencies that are under non-government control&mdash;a board of people who are appointed. We have just watched in recent weeks the way this government treats such boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government wants to Americanise this country: get rid of the welfare system, get rid of income support and get rid of a whole range of other things. But even more critical from its point of view is that when it becomes the government it changes all the institutions. The fact is that we had a British system where institutions went on; governments changed, but institutions were beyond the government. The Public Service gave objective, professional advice to whomever was in government and carried out the policies of the government of the day, oversighted by a minister who was responsible to the parliament. It is called the Westminster system. That is the way it works and it was what we had up until now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983 the secretary to Treasury was John Stone. There was very little love lost between John Stone and the Labor Party, but he stayed as secretary to Treasury for as long as he wanted, as did many other senior bureaucrats. Most of the agencies were untouched by the change of government, as should be the case. The institutions of this country are fundamentally important to our stability, to our depth and to our understanding. If we adopt the American system, whereby a change of government means that you change literally thousands of key institutional players, then we will become very unstable. This is where we are heading; this is the radical change that is coming through. But it sounds simple: a one-stop shop. The naivety of previous speakers, of government members, who think that somehow this will make their constituents get a better service is almost breathtaking in its ignorance. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other part I find interesting is in terms of the contradiction and what it says about the Prime Minister and&mdash;I mentioned this before&mdash;the title of `honest John'. We have seen this ability to say one thing and do the other. We have seen this wonderful capacity to say, `We're actually doing this,' when what is really happening is quite different. In this case it appears to be a simple change being sold as a simple concept&mdash;a one-stop shop. What is not being explained are all the implications on staffing, on scrutiny and on a range of other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But, then, what would one expect from a Prime Minister who, before the election, talked about higher standards for ministers? The situation goes from being one of higher standards in one month to being the same as the previous government in the next month, until recently we have the situation where unless a minister breaks the law they stay as a minister. So we have had this wonderful change!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take another example, which I think is even more dramatic. The Prime Minister is told that one of his frontbenchers is under investigation for defrauding the Commonwealth. Apparently such advice does not require consideration. It does not require saying, `If the fraud continues after I have been told, am I an accessory?' It does not require saying, `What's my responsibility to the taxpayers?' It goes in one ear and out the other. Apparently it does not warrant consideration as to whether the person should stay in his job while the investigation is taking place; whether or not the person should is another issue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that it was not even considered indicates the degree of deceptiveness and the contradiction. A truly honest John would have asked himself the question, `Should this person be suspended while being investigated for defrauding the Commonwealth?' This person is not being investigated for personal reasons or for other reasons; he is being investigated for defrauding the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The custodian of the Commonwealth's finances is the Prime Minister, at the end of the day, because he appoints all of the ministers. Therefore, as the custodian of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1391"> funds, one of his appointees is under investigation for defrauding him. Apparently it does not warrant a thought; it does not warrant consideration. In relation to that contradiction between the `honest John' in theory and the actual practice of ethics and ministerial behaviour and ministerial code, people will understand why and how the government can put forward these kinds of measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look across the landscape of the Australian government and our systems in this last 12 months, we will see wrecks all over the place. We will see DEETYA, a department for education, employment, training and youth affairs. Who designed it? The Department of Finance. That is wonderful: a department for employment designed by the Department of Finance. DEETYA did not design its own current structures or its functionality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you think that this Commonwealth service agency is being designed by itself? Of course not, it is being designed by Treasury and Finance. We have all the departmental structures being designed by the Departments of Finance and the Treasury. What is their main objective? Cutting spending. Yet we hear the pap from those opposite about there somehow being a better service. Mind you, he did use the word `efficiency'. We know what that means&mdash;money savings; cut the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this 12 months we have had a series of experiences,  some wonderful conclusions that suddenly arrived out of nowhere, like the nursing home initiatives announced with a lot of fanfare and nonsense. Whenever we try to ask how it is going to work, we get all this puzzlement. Even now, it is still being put forward that the entry fee will be $26,000. We all know that will not be the case. We all know it is going to be $80,000 to $100,000 or up to $150,000. We all know that. Yet the government still wants to pretend that the figure of $26,000 is the case. We also all know what it really is. It is camouflaging the cutting of half a billion dollars out of spending on aged services. This is not about making a better aged care system. It is about saving half a billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agency is not about giving a better service. It is about cutting staff and changing the staff contracts so the Public Service is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> totally politicised, run under an agency which can be directed by the minister and the government of the day. In years to come, on their model, every time the government changes, so will the board&mdash;a la the board of the air safety agency that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has been pushing for in recent months or the last year&mdash;he is a new minister; he is entitled to have a new board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservatives, who used to so much prize and value the institutions of this country&mdash;so many of whom are monarchists&mdash;keep saying, `If it ain't broke, don't change it'; they place such emphasis on the importance of our institutions. What are they doing? They are gutting them. They are absolutely radicalising the total structure of this country in the guise of saying, `We are conservative; we are not doing anything about it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are changing not simply the shape but the substance and the internals of how our system will function. Australia will never be the same again following these kinds of changes. We will never again have an independent Public Service because the board will be replaced; consultants will be functional within that; the terms and conditions of employment will be determined by the board and not by the government; there will not be scrutiny by the parliament of the internals. What we are creating here is a quango to beat all quangos. What is it going to be doing? Talking to people who cannot get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the one queue will be a pensioner; behind them will be someone with a disability; behind them a person looking for their child&hyphen;care payment. Just think of the kind of indignity and embarrassment that is going to be caused. Then think of the staff who are going to be saying, `I don't know' to virtually every single question. An interesting notion has been put forward in years past regarding the placement of people. This is the argument that you pay the most to the people who have the greatest effect. The theory is that you reverse the current payment systems for the teaching profession. So you pay the kindergarten teachers the most and the university lecturers the least because a kindergarten teacher has the greatest effect on the develop 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1392"> ment of the person. On that thesis, you should pay your counter staff the most because they need to know the most. What we tend to do is pay the counter staff the least. Once they learn something, they get promoted and the people who replace them have to learn anew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost by its nature, the system that we have means that the people on the counter know the least of anybody. That is bad enough in one department. We all have horror stories about that. But now we are going to have it across virtually all departments. The capacity for a person to answer a question at a counter will be zilch. And what for? Not for better services but to allow an excuse to change the structure and cut down on support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Go round the world and look at different systems and where they are going. Look at Europe, look at America and look here. We really had one of the most balanced systems. We picked the best of some of the other countries. We had the English basis of the independent public service going beyond governments. We had not fallen for the American cyclical pressure or their gridlock between the presidency and their houses of Congress. We had some flexibility and fair scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, has caused great frustration to those opposite. The idea that the Public Service is somehow independent seems to gall them and stick in their throats. After the election, six senior public servants were dismissed. No&hyphen;one has ever explained why. Six heads of departments went and we still wonder why it was done. We have all watched as offices have closed. In my own electorate, the immigration office has gone. People with immigration problems have to go to Sydney, which is two, three or four hours away. If you are not very wealthy and do not have much time that is very difficult. Mind you, there is a phone line&mdash;that is if you ever get through and, if you do, the person at the other end knows what you are talking about or can find your file. The chances are that neither will be the case because, again, that department has been twisted and torn all over the place. Its depth has been reduced and its level of staff confidence has been diminished.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across the country we are seeing these massive changes. You start trying to find out who designed them and no&hyphen;one ever seems to know the answer. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Then we hear the explanation put forward, `Well, it makes it efficient. It is a one&hyphen;stop shop. It is simple.' You start looking at what the real reason is. This is not about improving services, it is about ideology. It is about changing the nature of these institutions so they are more biddable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite used to accuse us when in government of trying to politicise the Public Service. The funny thing was that most of us felt that most public servants were fairly conservative because change was always a problem for them. So it was much easier for them to be conservative in their approach to problems. Yet now they are facing the greatest change that we have ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this year and this particular parliament are looked at in the years ahead, and when people start measuring where Australia has gone and where it has come from, I think they will understand that contradiction of the radical conservative and of Honest John. I said once before that this Prime Minister has the capacity to become the Billy McMahon of the nineties; the guy who was supposed to be a good Treasurer but who people knew behind their hands was not. I think that is what will occur here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, with a naive backbench, with a ministry which is dependent upon his goodwill, the radicalisation taking place is quite astounding. I still wonder who is designing it. I do not think it is Mr Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton. I do not think it is any of the normal bureaucrats that we know of. This is anti&hyphen;public service. These changes are not in the interests of any professional public servant. Looking beyond that to the other changes proposed to the Public Service, one can see the commonality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the concept of DEETYA designed by Finance and the concept of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency designed by Treasury and Finance seem to be much the same. Get a good idea, get the ideology right and to hell with the consequences. What people will understand in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1393"> years ahead is that this legislation has far&hyphen;reaching consequences. It will not be of benefit to people who need support. It will not be of benefit to the Commonwealth because, at some point, a future government will have to go back and rebuild what is being torn down. It will have to go back and refund some of the services that are being cut. We will have to find a way to re&hyphen;professionalise our Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I say to the community and to those affected by this is that it will require patience to outlast this change. To those in the Public Service who are being radicalised, I urge them to have the stamina to withstand the assault&mdash;the insult to their professionalism and the assault on their integrity that has taken place over the last 12 months. As I said, I think the community is much more understanding of it than perhaps the government realises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I presume the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill will get through, given what has happened in the Senate and given the other contradictions in terms of personnel. I presume the price will not be too high. Mind you, he has access through the capacity of the budget to pay any extra charge that might be required for this legislation. So I am assuming that it will be passed. However, in many ways this particular agency will become the symbol of all that will be seen as being the worst about this government. Eventually, it will be its achilles heel because people will identify with the loss of services, support, contact and professionalism. They will all attach to this government and to those who vote for this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I have a great deal of regret that this will become law, it is obviously inevitable. At the same time, I point out to the people concerned that this will be the hallmark of all that is wrong with modern conservative thinking&mdash;the idea that people do not deserve and do not warrant&mdash;and that Australia's freedoms are about the freedom to starve, the freedom not to work, the freedom to look after yourself and not about what we have previously had as a country: some sense of responsibility for each other. Our support networks and safety nets are being turned into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drag lines. I think that will come through no more so than in this inappropriately named and totally inappropriately designed agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, this legislation will clearly get through the parliament. I think those opposite who vote for it so naively will, in the years ahead, come to regret it and see it as being one of the greatest symbolic mistakes of their period in this parliament. With those words, I do not commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, it is a great pleasure to see you in the chair in the chamber tonight as we discuss the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996, because I know that you, Sir, have a very keen interest in the veterans community and have a very close association with that community not only in Tasmania but also through your father and his participation on behalf of Australia in theatres of war in years gone by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular bill in many ways is not controversial and the majority of it the opposition does not find fault with. We do, however, have one objection to it, and we will be moving at the consideration in detail stage an amendment in respect of the issue of rent assistance because we believe that that is anomalous. We believe that it is not in keeping with the view that we have on the way in which people should be treated in respect of singles living in rental accommodation. We also believe that it is not in keeping with the Labor Party's philosophy in respect of those people on some form of benefit as singles who choose to rent for no other reason than they have to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main thrust of this bill was outlined by my friend and colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is just coming into the chamber now. In his second reading speech, the minister indicated that this bill was aiming to rationalise payments between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. In that second reading speech he detailed most of those particular rationalisation proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He indicated, for example, that the bill will allow aged pensioners who also receive a disability pension to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Affairs. For veterans and their eligible partners this will mean they need deal with only one department. I think that makes a lot of sense and, once again, in this area of veterans' affairs, we find the commonality of purpose demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a clear recognition that this arrangement will not affect the eligibility for a service pension, and that there will be a continuing requirement for a veteran to have qualifying service to be paid a service pension. The new arrangement will simplify payments to and communication with veterans who do not have qualifying service and who receive an age pension and a disability pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another administrative reform to which the minister made reference in his second reading speech was the centralisation of the payments to carers. As part of these reforms announced last year, the Department of Social Security will have responsibility for all carer payments. Carers who receive Veterans' Affairs payments will be automatically transferred to the Department of Social Security's carer payment. I must also say that the minister has crafted that amendment very carefully because the small number of carers who might otherwise be disadvantaged or temporarily inconvenienced by such a transfer will continue to be paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Again, I think that is a very sensible suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did allude to the fact&mdash;and I will repeat this for the benefit of the minister, as he was coming into the chamber at that time&mdash;that we were not specifically happy with only one element of this legislation; that is, what has been described in your second reading speech as the `better targeting of income support benefits'. They particularly refer to the rental accommodation benefits applying to single people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said in this place and in RSL clubs and forums around this country, in the main the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the entitlements and benefits flowing to the veterans' community have been quarantined from many of the savings measures which this government introduced in last year's budget. However, the simple fact&mdash;and I know, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1395"> Minister, that this is not necessarily your doing&mdash;is that this particular measure is aimed, as was said here in the minister's second reading speech, at an area where the government perceives there to be an anomaly: where two people are living together in shared rented accommodation, they will now have that assistance reduced. We believe that is not entirely appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For good and valid reasons in terms of social security and our party's views on the way in which people live, we believe that single people have certain and peculiar needs and that these should not be distinguished from normal family circumstances. I do not think it is appropriate or fair to say that the fact that two people cohabit and have income support levels simply by virtue of the fact that they happen to be sharing accommodation in some way reduces their costs of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I believe that unfortunately this really is not a matter which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has had a great deal of success in convincing the Minister for Social Security about. It does represent&mdash;although, I concede, in a minor sense&mdash;a broken promise to the veterans community that benefits that were payable would not be diminished by an incoming Howard government. I suppose, to that extent, it does say something about the effect of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the information which is contained in the explanatory memorandum, this measure actually will affect only 340 people and ultimately, over four years, will save the princely sum of approximately $21,000. Somebody earlier was in here saying, `If it ain't broke, why fix it?' This is a classic example. Why play around with the security and the lives of these 340 people for a mere saving over four years of about $21,000? It is unfortunate that in this respect the Department of Social Security, once again, seems to have had its wicked way over the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This is something that, I know, the minister will continue to try to resist, and we will do what we can to give support from this side of the House in that respect also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, in passing I note that many of the amendments contained in here&mdash;which, as I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have said, will not in any way be opposed by the opposition&mdash;do bring together in a much more closely aligned way this issue of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. Both your party in government and our party when in government and certainly in opposition have always had a philosophy that there should be a separate Department of Veterans' Affairs and that it should administer the policies of that department for the veterans' community, to which Australia owes such an enormous debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that we are starting to see a gradual edging away from that, whether it be in aged care, in this one-stop shop that we have been debating in this chamber this afternoon or in superannuation. I know the minister is committed to the veterans' community. I have heard him speak on a number of occasions. We on this side of the House believe he does have that deep commitment to the veterans' community. But I do ask him to keep a very close eye on it because I would not like to see some changes. As I indicated, in the consideration in detail stage we will be moving an amendment in respect of that particular matter, but certainly not in respect of anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also did receive from the minister last week a letter in which he indicated to me that there were going to be some other changes introduced as part of this legislative package. That was in respect of the veterans' vocational rehabilitation scheme, which was announced in the 1996-97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know and as the minister indicated in his letter to me, the aim of that scheme is to assist veterans who are leaving the Australian defence forces and need assistance in making the transition to civilian employment. It assists those veterans who are presently working but are encountering difficulties and who need assistance to retain employment. It also assists those veterans who are not presently employed but wish to return to the work force following rehabilitation activities that meet their specific needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter indicates that something like $2.8 million is going to be spent on vocational rehabilitation over the coming four years. According to the minister's letter, the commit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1396"> ment to veterans of working age has been enhanced by these arrangements, which will make specific provisions for veterans leaving the ADF and provide a safety net to protect pension and associated benefits for DVA pensioners who might otherwise lack the confidence and motivation to participate in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I want to thank you for making available from your office very extensive briefing notes on this particular matter. We have looked at these very carefully, as I am sure you would expect. Once again, we find absolutely nothing to object to in the amendments you are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is worth while that the House does reflect on these occasions and start to think about some of these people&mdash;as well as young service men and women returning from areas like Somalia and so on&mdash;who need that special assistance in retraining and reskilling to take their rightful place in the civilian work force. I think the department, by making these arrangements for them, clearly shows some compassion towards them and their special needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The questions that have been posed in the briefing notes, when they talk about issues such as the working of the safety net, the protection of pensions, that there would be no penalties that would apply and the requirements for training, very carefully and very clearly spell out the way in which this part of the legislation is intended to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the minister and his department will be making this information available to people because from time to time, even in our constituency offices, people make inquiries about this sort of material. Of course, we all would be more than happy to disseminate it very widely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is non&hyphen;controversial legislation with the exception, regrettably, as I have said for the minister's benefit, of that one issue in respect of rent assistance for singles. It is a philosophical problem. We on this side of the House argued very strongly when similar provisions were included in social security legislation. I know the minister can recall that. Accordingly, we will be moving at the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consideration in detail stage an amendment in respect of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wish the rest of the bill a speedy passage. We can count in this place and we know that the bill will go through unfettered eventually, probably some time this evening&mdash;if not tomorrow morning. We look forward to the information contained in here being widely disseminated. We look forward to what the minister and the government have proposed by way of continued assistance to the veterans' community being put in place very quickly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might start my remarks on these two hearing services bills by expressing the opposition's deep dissatisfaction with the handling of this particular package of bills. It is not the first time that we have had cause, unfortunately, to express our unhappiness in the House about legislation involving this portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition first learned of the existence of this important legislation, which affects the right of many Australians to have access to hearing services, when it appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> on 5 February for introduction that day. Through someone's laziness or mismanagement or both, I believe the parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1397"> ment has been insulted by this very late provision of the legislation. It is an insult as well to the staff of Australian Hearing Services and the Australian Government Health Service&mdash;not to mention the almost 200,000 clients of AHS&mdash;to introduce this bill 10 days before the first provisions take effect. This means that discussion, scrutiny and consultation are all compromised by this gross incompetence. That is why the opposition will be seeking to refer these bills to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee to allow for thorough scrutiny to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further delays in debating this legislation mean that it is unlikely the legislation will even be introduced in the Senate before it takes effect in three days time, on Saturday, 1 March 1997. In the unhappy event that this legislation is passed unamended, we can ask whether the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) intends to retrospectively remove benefits from the young people and the Commonwealth senior health care card holders who have been cut-off from the Australian Hearing Services by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the minister's intention, then need I today remind the House of previous speeches made by Liberal Party and National Party members and senators about the evils of retrospective legislation. They are certainly very much opposed to retrospective legislation that tries to make sure that people pay the correct amounts of tax, but they do not seem to have any difficulties with retrospective legislation that might take away from young Australians and senior health care card holders who have hearing disabilities. They are quite happy to use retrospective legislation against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made a few remarks about this particular issue when we were discussing the government's unfair and retrospective legislation on provider numbers last year, which was introduced within four days of taking effect. Of course, this led to greatly reduced scrutiny of that particular piece of legislation and the attempt of exclusion of the AMA from the Senate committee hearings on that legislation. The result was that New South Wales doctors decided on a week&hyphen;long strike to protest against that retrospective and unfair legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion. So I can only hope that the handling of future bills is better than that track record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to today's two pieces of legislation. These bills will do four things. First, they will cut off 19- to 21-year-olds from access to Australian Hearing Services. Second, they will cut off Commonwealth senior health care card holders from access to AHS. Third, they will introduce a voucher system enabling AHS clients to buy top-up aids. Fourth, they will require a greater budget contribution from the Australian Government Health Service. Basically, these bills cut off certain clients from access to Australian Hearing Services and, in addition, set AHS up for privatisation. This is what the secretary to the department noted at Senate estimates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is certainly putting AHS . . . in a more competitive environment. Whether that would lead at any later stage to other changes is speculative.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well may we speculate, because we know there is already speculation that this government plans to privatise Medibank Private. We can expect that, if this legislation is passed, AHS will not be very far behind Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will damage Australian Hearing Services which, in our opinion, is a model Public Service provider. It yet again breaches the coalition's so-called election commitment from Honest John&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), I stand corrected&mdash;to preserve all pension benefits by removing the entitlements of Commonwealth senior health care card holders to Australian Hearing Services.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the parliament of the promise which the Liberal and National parties made before the last election. The coalition's social security policy contained the following sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will maintain all current Commonwealth concessions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite that promise, I think there were also statements made by John Howard, the then opposition leader, to an ACOSS conference. The Prime Minister gave his own personal guarantee that no pensioners would lose any of their existing entitlements. Yet we have already seen increases in the cost of medication for pensioners. We have seen the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who is sitting at the table, seeking to make dramatic changes to the aged care provisions for Australians.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MOYLAN" NAMEID="4V5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She describes them as important policy changes.

I am sure that we are all looking forward to the minister debating that piece of legislation in the not too distant future. But today we are talking about the government's decision to take away the entitlements of a large number of Australians to Australian Hearing Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to let the minister wriggle out of the commitments which the Prime Minister, John Howard, her leader, made during the last election campaign. You will not be able to wriggle out of this one by blaming departmental officials, as was the case with Austudy and other issues. It is never the minister. The minister cannot be expected to properly scrutinise what their departments are doing. It is always someone else's fault bar the minister who is meant to be in charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we also need to understand that these bills represent another broken promise and another attack on those in our society who most need our support. When in opposition, the Prime Minister, John Howard, said that he would govern for all of us, but he has obviously forgotten about the young and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elderly Australians who have hearing difficulties. This broken promise comes on the back of others that I have touched on before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These broken promises include increases in the cost of pharmaceuticals; cuts in Medicare rebates for psychiatric services, knee and eye operations; the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program; decisions that are going to change the contributions that are imposed on elderly Australians for access to nursing homes; and the decision to freeze GP Medicare rebates, which day by day is putting extra pressure on doctors to cease bulk-billing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before discussing the government's proposed changes, I would like to briefly place on the record a few facts and figures about Australian Hearing Services. AHS clients include children up to 21 and most pensioners. Through a network of 54 permanent and 80 visiting centres, AHS currently provides full hearing services to around 180,000 clients or 75 per cent of those Australians who need hearings aids. In recent years, around a quarter of these services have been subcontracted to private providers. The services provided by AHS include hearing loss assessments, the provision and fitting of hearing aids, necessary rehabilitation and adjustment to the use of the devices and maintenance and battery replacement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AHS provides hearing aids to its clients at an average price which is $400 lower than that of private sector  providers. This figure was calculated on a full cost basis, using accrual accounting principles, by external consultants. I make that point: a public sector provider, using the power that goes with the very large number of hearing aids that it purchases each year, is able to provide hearing aids to its clients at $400 less than the private sector providers. A recent review by the Centre for International Economics made the following comments on this very point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AHS's cost per new adult client is lower than the fee paid for private sector services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AHS kept prices down . . . well below the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The CIE report went on to explain that AHS's ability to provide such an economical service 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1399"> was due to the great economies of scale. The report noted that, due to its buying power, AHS achieved discounts of more than 33 per cent on batteries alone. AHS does even better on hearing aids, saving more than 50 per cent of the normal price&mdash;or more than $200&mdash;on the majority of its state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art electronically programmable aids with a remote control option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite these massive savings achieved by AHS, Australia achieves still further benefits through AHS's joint venture to produce these hearing aids in Australia, particularly in Queensland. Rather than importing their hearing aids, this has led to the creation of highly skilled jobs and $200 million in foreign investment and in sales and exports of high quality hearing aids and devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government's legislation succeeds in undermining the position of AHS and its joint venture, the likely result will be a loss of highly skilled jobs in Queensland, a loss of important foreign investment, a loss in export sales and a return to the importing of hearing aids, all of which is bad news for Australia. It is bad news for jobs, especially in Queensland, and bad news for investment and export markets. If some people doubt that is the case, they have to understand that AHS has been able to use that massive buying power to encourage overseas investment, particularly in Queensland. That multinational's head office realises that, if it were to seek to supply the Australian market from offshore, then of course the government would be under pressure to look for an alternative supplier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By facilitating the establishment of the joint venture, a new high&hyphen;tech industry has been developed in Queensland; one that I think is very important. It is very important that we try to ensure that that remains in Australia. On the subject of quality, the CIE report noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . client outcome surveys . . . indicate similar outcomes for AHS and private contractors services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To give you an example of just how good AHS is, private clients are asking to pay to use the service. In November last year I had a letter from a constituent of mine. I do not think he minds if I quote his name. Mr Malouf and his family were very keen for him 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to have the right to purchase some of the equipment supplied through AHS because he had lost his entitlement. Mr Malouf wrote to the minister about this. Senator Woods, on behalf of the minister, advised me that it was not possible for Mr Malouf to purchase that equipment from AHS, not even if he paid for the equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It says something about the quality of an organisation when someone is prepared to pay AHS, having lost their eligibility to go through AHS, for the good quality service. AHS is a model to be copied and learned from. It is not, in my opinion, a public service model to be dismantled. The current arrangements clearly provide a high quality service and state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art equipment at extremely low relative costs and with significant benefits for Australian jobs, Australian research and development and Australian exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that its reforms seek to improve efficiency, but this is just plain ludicrous. I would like to give you an example, from the minister's second reading speech, of the government's supposed efficiency gains. The government intends to force AHS to adopt `full commercial practices . . . including provision for taxation'. So the government is going to tax itself in the interests of efficiency. You can imagine the extra amount of paperwork that will be required between the tax office and AHS as a result. The minister is asking us to believe that it is efficient to hobble the AHS, which provides its high quality services at a cost well below the OECD average, to allow private providers which are $400 a client more expensive to compete with it. It is quite clear that the government is simply being driven by an ideological obsession with seeking to reduce the extent of the public sector in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can think of only one reason the government would be considering these reforms, and that is its slavish attachment to the report of the National Commission of Audit. This report is the government's blueprint for privatisation and the introduction of co&hyphen;payments in the health care area. In the face of blinding evidence to the contrary, we can see that the government is being driven by an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1400"> entrenched mistrust of everything in the public sector. Some might say that this is completely irrational, even though it is put forward by some of the government's drier economic rationalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The logic behind the Hearing Services Administration Bill is the same as the logic behind the government floating the idiotic idea last year of abandoning Commonwealth control of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to the states. This would have created six different systems in the six states and probably another two in the territories. The medication a person received would have depended on where they lived. I am pleased that the states&mdash;a majority of them conservative state governments&mdash;would not touch that with a barge pole. The Minister for Health and Family Services was on TV last week or the week before expressing his frustration in being unable to persuade the states to take over the pharmaceutical benefits scheme or Medicare or other areas that are currently funded by the federal government, including aged care, managed by the minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine that, if you were the Premier of Tasmania and the minister offered you the existing level of funding for those services and the onerous responsibility to continue to fund future growth of the use of medication and the provision of hospital services, it would be quite clear that the federal government was trying to pass on to you the burdens and responsibilities of providing funding for those services without sufficient revenue to maintain for future growth, especially as the population ages. I would expect you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to be just as reluctant as the current conservative Premier of Tasmania to accept such an offer. We had hoped of course that in backing away from the ridiculous idea of handing over control of the PBS to the states the government might have reconsidered its position on issues such as the measures that are before us at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to turn to the financial aspects of this proposal. Those listening to this debate today may think, having heard my 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discussion of the minister's negligence in the late introduction of this legislation or having heard about the idea of the government's plan to tax itself and about the high standards that AHS has achieved in recent years, that they would have already heard about the worst aspects of this particular legislation. But I am afraid there is more to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from attempting to hobble the Australian Hearing Services, this bill takes away access to AHS's services for 19&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and for around 30,000 holders of Commonwealth senior health cards who have hearing disabilities. In Senate estimates the opposition questioned the government about the reasons for taking away eligibility for these groups and the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, Senator Newman, replied that the decision was taken for budgetary reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition logically then requested a breakdown of the savings that will flow from the implementation of these decisions. The information we got was quite astounding. The government is taking away hearing aids from 19&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds with hearing disabilities to save a paltry half a million dollars a year. To save half a million dollars a year the government is going to force deaf young Australians to pay for their hearing aids. Many of the young Australians affected by this measure are studying and some have difficulty in obtaining secure long-term work, and it is not difficult to appreciate the impact that the loss of their eligibility for hearing services may have on their education or employment&mdash;all for a measly half a million dollars, compared to the massive size of the Commonwealth budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will be seeking to move an amendment when we get to the consideration in detail stage to restore eligibility to young Australians aged between 19 and 21, to  force the Liberal and National Party members opposite to either reverse this decision or have their names recorded as being in favour of taking away access to these hearing services from 19&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds with hearing disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is completely inconsistent with other government measures to increase 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1401"> the age of independence for young people for the purpose of government benefits. From 1 January 1997 the age of independence for tertiary students has been increased from 21 years to 25 years, while young unemployed people are not deemed to be independent until they are 21 years of age. So there is no consistency whatsoever. This government is raising the eligibility ages to force parents to look after their children when they are doing tertiary studies or if they are out of work, but when it comes to deciding who is eligible for hearing services the government is reducing eligibility for those aged from 19 to 21&mdash;all to save this paltry half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing this measure has in common with the social security and Austudy changes is that they both save money. It is another example of this government putting dollars before the rights of people with disabilities to get a reasonable level of service from the government. The figure supplied by the department for the savings to be made by denying access to Australian Hearing Services to Commonwealth senior health card holders was even more astounding. The savings were zero dollars in 1996&hyphen;97, zero dollars in 1997&hyphen;98, zero dollars in 1998&hyphen;99 and zero dollars in 1999&hyphen;2000&mdash;no savings whatsoever from denying Commonwealth senior health card holders access to AHS and a paltry half a million in savings for the changes in denying young people with disabilities between the ages of 19 and 21. Yet this government has this bill before the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We simply ask the minister&mdash;in particular, a minister for aged care, a minister who is supposed to be looking after elderly Australians&mdash;to answer this question when she sums up this debate: why are you taking away from those Commonwealth senior health card holders the right to have access to AHS services if your savings are zero for each of the four years, in the figures that have been supplied to the opposition? It will be an interesting answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government does succeed with this atrocious legislation, we can only ask that the minister guarantee a few things. We ask for a guarantee that the quality of the hearing aids will remain state of the art. We ask that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> AHS clients will never be subject to copayments, as recommended by the CIE report and the National Commission of Audit. Finally, we ask for a guarantee that the government will not further sabotage the Australian Hearing Services by attempting to privatise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not fair to senior citizens with hearing loss. It is not fair to young Australians with hearing loss. It is not fair to the dedicated staff at the Australian Hearing Services. It is not fair to the innovative and efficient Australian employees who make hearing aids in Australia. It represents yet another of the Prime Minister's broken promises. We condemn this bill and we ask that it be as hastily withdrawn as it was tardily introduced.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997. The first&mdash;the Hearing Services Administration Bill&mdash;will reform the delivery of government funding hearing services in Australia. That will be consistent with this government's broad strategy to allow greater contestability in service provision by government departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 July this year, pensioners and eligible veterans will receive vouchers for hearing services which will allow these groups to choose their provider, their services and, if appropriate, their hearing aid. More than 200,000 adults will be eligible for this scheme, with an estimated 50,000 new entrants each year. They will be able to choose between Australian Hearing Services or an accredited private sector provider. The new system will also introduce managed competition for the provision of government funded hearing services between the private sector and government. It will allow the best services to emerge naturally and lead others in the provision of the highest possible quality service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the Office of Hearing Services will accredit and regulate participating hearing service providers, which will increase self&hyphen;regulation and quality standards within the hearing services industry. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1402"> office will initially maintain the current technical standards of the AHS and will use their expertise as well as that of the private sector to review these technical standards over time. Service standards will be those currently operating between the AHS and its contracts with private sector providers and will be helped by the introduction of a professional code of conduct. The office will also provide information impartially to consumers and will investigate and resolve any complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems in the past is that Australian Hearing Services has been the regulator as well as the dominant service provider of the hearing services program. The establishment of the Office of Hearing Services will remove this regulatory function from AHS and provide greater contestability in service provision of government funded hearing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While competition will be introduced between hearing service practitioners and manufacturers to supply hearing aids, the pricing advantages that Australian Health Services has enjoyed due to its large market power will be retained by using a tender based `common use contract' which will provide hearing aids for both the AHS and the private sector. Preliminary discussions with manufacturers indicate that this process would provide prices close to those achieved by AHS at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To remain within the budgetary allocation, AHS has had to ration its services either through client queuing or rationing the referral of clients to private providers. The new system will provide flexibility by allowing people to purchase additional levels of service beyond their free entitlement. That will encourage freedom of choice and allow them to `add on' to their free entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no new charges for those eligible under this scheme. These bills will allow the scarce resources in Australian Health Services to be used more effectively and for service provision to be streamlined. By providing flexibility to the industry and a greater choice of hearing services for consumers, the consumers will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hearing Services and the AGHS Reform Bill 1997 will restructure Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hearing Services, change the eligibility for the hearing services program and restructure the Australian Government Health Service. Australian Hearing Services currently provides direct services to 90 per cent of the Australian hearing program's clients. In 1990, the Industry Commission's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities</EMPHASIS> proposed introducing contestability within the program. Australian Hearing Services already contracts out a proportion of new clients to accredited private service providers. For example, in 1995&hyphen;96, 36 per cent of new adult clients were referred to private providers. That was usually after a wait of six to eight weeks. What the vouchers will do will be to return genuine choice to those who are eligible&mdash;aged pensioners, disability pensioners and veterans&mdash;and they can decide whether to go to AHS or whether to go to a private sector provider. But at least they will have the choice. Rather than hamstringing AHS, this actually provides genuine choice to the consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last government was quite happy for Australian Hearing Services to operate as a monopoly and to let them decide which clients they would farm out to private sector providers. Consumers had no choice about the type of service they received or the provider they saw. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) mentioned the report by the Centre for International Economics. When they reviewed the program in 1995&hyphen;96, they recommended implementing a voucher system and establishing an independent agency to manage the new system, and that sounds very familiar&mdash;separating the service provision role from the regulatory role. I do not see anything wrong with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Hearing Services will now compete on equal footing with the private sector for voucher holders. Consistent with competitive neutrality principles, it will pay the equivalent&mdash;it does not actually pay tax&mdash;of Commonwealth and state tax and it will also pay out dividends. It will still retain the essential role of meeting the government community service obligations such as providing hearing services to those in remote areas, continuing with hearing and noise related 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1403"> research, hearing loss prevention activities and industrial collaboration activities. It is also important to stress that, while AHS will be competing with the private sector for voucher patients, it will not be competing with private sector providers for those who are not specified under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits will extend beyond the consumers. Having a more competitive market in hearing services will mean an invigorated commercial environment within the private sector, greater industry cooperation and involvement in self-regulation and standards monitored by the new Office of Hearing Services, greater economic activity within this industry sector, longer term savings to the taxpayer through reduction in the direct cost to government of this program and increased industry development and efficient restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those in the hearing services field can go ahead and plan for better consumer services and the structures which support those services, and the industry can have more certainty about investing in research and development services and in training staff to provide those better services. It will also retain its specialist services to children, those with high hearing rehabilitation needs and those in rural and remote areas, especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. These services will remain outside the voucher scheme and will be reviewed in two years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is targeting the hearing concessions to those whose need is greatest. There are two groups who will lose eligibility under the hearing services program&mdash;those holding a Commonwealth seniors health card and those aged between 18 and 21. In fact, those people with Commonwealth seniors health cards were only recently made eligible. Removing the eligibility of those with seniors cards, while maintaining that of the pensioners&mdash;it is important to stress that aged pensioners and disabled pensioners will still be eligible under the voucher scheme&mdash;is consistent with many other government entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) was a bit confused; he kept on referring to 19&hyphen; to 21&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">year&hyphen;olds and talking about 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;old children. It has been some time since we have had 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;old children. The eligibility of 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds for the Australian hearing program is an historic thing which relates more to an era when 21 was considered the commencement of adulthood. If you look at the pattern of hearing disabilities, you find that most hearing disabilities are picked up before 18 years of age and most of them are fully assessed and fully equipped before they are 18 years of age. To retain the eligibility of 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds because it is an historic thing no longer has a rationale. It is important to stress that those 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are no longer eligible will still have maintenance provided for their hearing aids for five years after the loss of eligibility. Four to five years is about the average length of life for a hearing aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell reminds me a bit of all those successive British governments which ignored the fact that they had a man in the English Channel waiting for Napoleon. That post was not abolished until 1948. The ALP seems reluctant to ever remove someone from the government teat, even when the original rationale is no longer there. As I have said before, the impact for 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will be minimised by providing maintenance support for their hearing aids five years from the loss of eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Government Health Service has maintained high fixed costs which have a significant effect on government expenditure since government departments are the major clients for the AGHS. For example, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs provide 70 per cent of its revenue. Corporatising the AGHS will make it more flexible and efficient. The reforms to the AGHS will place it on a commercial footing and make it compete on a level playing field with the private sector for federal government business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A review of the AGHS last year concluded that independent medical assessment and advice were important to control government expenditure. Reforming the AGHS will make its provision of services more cost effective 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1404"> and expose it to competition. The reforms will place the AGHS on a level footing with private sector providers. Consistent with the principle of competitive neutrality, the AGHS will pay to the  Commonwealth amounts equivalent to commercial tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These two bills will ultimately reduce the call on government outlays, they will provide a genuine choice for those who are eligible under the voucher scheme&mdash;the aged pensioners, the disabled pensioners and veterans&mdash;they will target hearing services to those who are most in need, they will lead to a more flexible and efficient hearing services sector and they will maintain high standards of hearing service provision through self&hyphen;regulation and accreditation by the Office of Hearing Services. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am here tonight to oppose the changes to the Australian Hearing Services that are proposed in these bills. In the first instance, they are inequitable and, secondly, they cannot be justified on efficiency grounds, which is the government's rationale for their introduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the Australian Hearing Services is a statutory authority within the Department of Health and Family Services. As others have said, it provides hearing services to all eligible Australians free of charge. These include all children and young people up to the age of 21. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott), suggested that people between the age of 18 and 21 are now adults. Have a look at some of the policies of your government, which are insisting that young people to the age of 25 remain dependent on their parents. Get a few things straight! They also include pensioners, veterans, Comcare clients, members of the Defence Force and some Commonwealth employees. It currently assists over 75 per cent of all Australians requiring hearing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills will reduce the numbers of people eligible for assistance through the Australian Hearing Services. If implemented, they will exclude all young people aged between 18 and 21, whether they are dependent on their parents or not, and all holders of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth seniors health cards. In this latter group alone it is likely that 30,000 people will be affected. On the government's estimate, minimal savings will accrue from these measures. It expects to save $1.5 million over four years on the cuts to the under&hyphen;21s alone and nothing on the cuts to the Commonwealth seniors health card holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just before the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) leaves the chamber, I wish to ask a couple of questions, because the numbers do not seem to add up to me.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MOYLAN" NAMEID="4V5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4V5">Mrs Moylan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Question time has finished.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are important questions, Minister, and do not deserve the disrespect with which you have just treated my asking them. The figure of $1.5 million in savings that I have just cited does not measure up with the figures in the budget papers, which show savings of $12&half; million over four years. Given the minister has left the chamber, because she obviously does not care about people who have hearing difficulties, maybe her staff or the members of the department who are still in the chamber could, when she comes back to consider this bill in detail, answer some questions. Could they explain the discrepancies between these two figures? What has happened to the money which would have been spent on the groups now to be excluded? You cannot exclude 30,000 people and not have a saving. If there are no savings from this measure, why is it being introduced?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills once again demonstrate this government's willingness to reduce basic services to vulnerable people&mdash;and there is no doubt that people with hearing difficulties are vulnerable&mdash;to undermine their health and quality of life in order to make minor short-term savings, on the government's estimates. These changes are both punitive and short-sighted since small savings are now likely to be offset by the costs associated with untreated hearing problems. These cuts will fall on people already bearing the brunt of other cuts and charges arising from these budget initiatives. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you have heard considerable debate and discussion about the fact that the impact of all these changes falls particularly on older people in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1405"> our community&mdash;and I suggest they will fall considerably on those people who hold Commonwealth seniors health cards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the increase in the costs of pharmaceuticals&mdash;of course, not compensated for in the pension&mdash;the complete abolition of the Commonwealth dental health scheme, increased charges for home and community care and the introduction of entry fees for nursing homes. These are just a few things that together are going to make life for people in the older generation of our community much more difficult. It seems to me that this government is anti older people. We have yet another example of it in these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to eligibility are supposed to take effect from 1 March, just a few days away. They are not even mentioned in the press release of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) of 5 February. No doubt he does not want the 30,000 card holders to know that they have lost their eligibility for help with hearing aids and other hearing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course it is the case, as my colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has said, that the government gave no notice of its intention to introduce this legislation and has allowed minimum time for its discussion. There is obviously no doubt in our minds that the 30,000 people who need support with their hearing are not going to find out about it from this government. It certainly does look like a deliberate ploy designed to minimise opportunity for debate and consideration of a measure that is certainly very unpopular in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills are going to corporatise Australian Hearing Services, separating the regulatory and service provision roles. They are going to introduce a voucher system requiring the hearing services to compete with private providers to supply hearing services. This too has become a mantra for the government. These measures are intended `to provide greater choice of service providers in hearing aids for all clients to foster a more competitive hearing services industry'&mdash;and that comes from the budget statement&mdash;and, one suspects more importantly, `to reduce costs to government'. This is code for getting the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumer to pay more&mdash;as we have seen with home and community care charges, nursing home charges and pharmaceuticals charges&mdash;whether they are deaf or need nursing home care. It does not matter how disabled you might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders how the government can justify this approach given the department's finding that `over 90 per cent of clients are satisfied with the level and quality of existing program services' and that `Australian Hearing Services' costs for a monaural fitting are estimated at $598 while an equivalent fitting for services provided by private sector program contractors is $890'. This makes it really hard to understand why the government is going down this path. That is what competition is going to bring you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ever there were an example of the government's privatisation ideology driving policy rather than what is in the best interests of the consumer this is it. Those who need hearing aids are going to have to pay more. It is not clear how, in this new competitive environment that the government is so keen on, the government will prevent a few major providers capturing the field or how it will ensure that the cost savings associated with the one major purchaser that we have now, Australian Hearing Services, will be maintained. That is another reason for keeping it public, because it keeps costs down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the voucher system is introduced and consumers are offered a choice of providers, they will require information in order to make informed choices on technical issues and to recognise overservicing. This is one of the major reasons for health services remaining public. They are very technical issues and none of us, certainly no-one that I know in this chamber, is equipped to judge which is the best service to meet our health needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Hearing Services has served us well. It has provided high quality services at reasonable cost and has, importantly, relied on predominantly Australian manufactured products. It has also supported world-class research, so that we are now world leaders in this field. All this is now at risk. Why is that? So the government can further its ideologically driven attack on public services, its support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1406"> for private provision and its encouragement of `user pays' for health and community services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I raised in this House during the adjournment debate some serious questions about this government's standards. Tonight, after receiving nothing close to a genuine answer during the day and only uncovering further cause for concern, I have come into the House to demand that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) comes clean. Through the minister's incompetence and his willingness to work outside the conventions of his portfolio, $750,000 of taxpayers' money has been tucked away, hidden, grossly delayed, and it is now up to the minister to tell us why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five one-off cheques totalling $2.75 million for flood mitigation projects in New South Wales were approved by the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some time in late January or early February this year. Against all established practice, against all convention, instead of sending the cheques to the New South Wales state government department which they were made out to, the Department for Land and Water Conservation, the minister handed them over to three Liberal MPs and two Liberal senators. The understanding was that each Liberal MP would organise their local press and have a nice photograph taken of them handing the cheques over to the local authorities responsible for carrying out the flood work. Never mind that the cheques being handed over were not made out to the local government bodies receiving them. Never mind that the MPs should not even have had them in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So who had the cheques? Well, for starters the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) had one. He had a cheque for $1 million, which he handed over to the Upper Parramatta River Catchment Trust several weeks ago. The trust was very happy to receive the funding, but they did scratch their heads as to why they had been given a cheque made out to the New South Wales state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) had a cheque. He presented one for $500,000 to the Deputy Mayor of Gosford City Council on 7 February. She, too, was a little perplexed that she had been given such a sizeable sum of money made out to the New South Wales government. We know that Senator Bill Heffernan had a cheque. The Liberal duty senator for Wollongong was down there on 17 February handing over a cheque for $100,000 to Lord Mayor David Campbell for flood mitigation in that particular city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) had a cheque&mdash;not because he fronted up with the $400,000 to Campbelltown City Council, not at all. We know because either the minister could not find a time which suited him to make his presentation or he just did not need the extra publicity. We know because he sent his cheque to the New South Wales government in one of his own person 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1407"> alised envelopes, which I found out this morning they received yesterday afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Which brings us to Fairfield. It has already been confirmed for me, most recently by the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), that the cheque approved by the minister for flood mitigation work around Prospect Creek was for the sum of $750,000. That we do know. The work on the project is to be administered by Fairfield City Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When my office asked the staff member in the parliamentary secretary's office&mdash;and I will name him tonight: Mr Stephen Galilee&mdash;who would be presenting the cheque to Fairfield City Council, he said he had no idea. He had no idea! And yet this afternoon a press release pops up from Senator Helen Coonan saying that the cheque, sent by the parliamentary secretary, was received by her office on Monday this week. Senator Coonan says she will present it to Fairfield City Council on 10 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if Senator Coonan received the cheque on Monday from the member for Ballarat's office, why didn't Fairfield City Council have any idea who had it and when it was going to get it, as I found out when I spoke to its general manager on Tuesday afternoon? Why didn't the senior adviser in the member for Ballarat's office know where the cheque was when my office spoke to him on Tuesday afternoon? Why didn't the Department of Land and Water Conservation know where the cheque was when my office contacted them as late as this afternoon? My guess is: it is obviously not the original cheque. Only two people know the real story: Mr Sharp and the Liberal MP or senator to whom the original cheque was given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today my office contacted the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party and had a pleasant conversation with a very helpful young man there. When we asked who the duty senator was for the Fairfield area, he had no hesitation in telling us: `Senator Woods, of course. Senator Bob Woods' Well, I never. Senator Woods! Out of the mouth of babes! If Minister Sharp gave the Liberal duty senator for Wollongong, Senator Bill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Heffernan, the cheque to present to their council some three or four weeks ago, surely logic dictates that he gave the duty senator for my area, Senator Bob Woods, the cheque for $750,000 to present to Fairfield City Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How has the cheque now all of a sudden, after I raised the issue in the House last night, found its way into Senator Coonan's hands? The minister has been too clever by half. He has been playing games with the people of Fairfield city. First he cut our recurrent flood mitigation funding; now he has been playing silly games with the one-off grant he has deigned to hand on. This latest twist in the story is just so transparent: Senator Woods, I believe, was given the original cheque and now, in a panic, the minister has attempted to cover his behind by either cancelling the old one and writing a new one for Senator Coonan or finally retrieving it from Senator Woods's office for Senator Coonan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this ridiculous episode has cast an even greater shadow on this government's ever declining standards. Meanwhile, the people of Fairfield wait for what they are due and they question why it has taken over five weeks for this cheque to come to light when all other areas have received their cheques, the money has been confirmed and the information has been presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I question again in this House tonight why it has taken so long&mdash;nearly five weeks; it will be received on 10 March&mdash;&mdash;for the cheque to be presented to the council? I do not question the amount of money but just where the cheque has been for five weeks. Has it been in Senator Woods's top drawer in his office, or did the fraud squad discover it?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1407"><TITLE>Moreton Bay</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October last year I rose in this chamber to speak about the needs of Moreton Bay and the University of Queensland Research Laboratory. I again rise to speak on this matter to give members of the House a progress report. For those members who may not remember, the research facility at Dunwich on North Stradbroke Island is in urgent need of repair. The laboratory facilities are out of date and the building is in danger of collapsing. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1408"> However, despite that fact our intrepid researchers continue. They are a hardy bunch. It is also a mark of the significance of their work that these and other researchers from around the world flock to North Stradbroke Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work which is being carried out at the station, particularly by Professor Jack Greenwood and Dr Ian Tibbetts, is of vital importance to the future viability of the bay. As I reported last year, the Department of Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs has kicked in $300,000 to upgrade the laboratory facilities. As generous as this offer is, it is still only the tip of the iceberg. None of this money can be used for capital works. As members can see, the researchers face a significant dilemma: what use is a $300,000 research laboratory if the building it is housed in falls down around their ears?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The School of Marine Science at the University of Queensland, to its credit, is not sitting back waiting for government handouts. Professor Greenwood and Dr Tibbetts have put together a proposal for funding which they are providing to whoever they believe would be willing to support such a project. The group received some welcome news just prior to Christmas when the university administration approved a further $100,000 towards the project. This leaves a shortfall of just over $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a positive note, Dr Tibbetts wrote to me recently to say that he was encouraged by the level of corporate and community support the project had received. In his letter he said that the research station attracted $10,000 towards the purchase of a research vessel through the University of Queensland annual appeal. In fact the funds in support of the research station boat for Dunwich exceeded those given to a number of other worthy causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot stress strongly enough the need for this research station to go ahead. To this end, I will over the next few months be organising fundraising exercises to draw the attention of the general public and industry to the needs of the Moreton Bay marine station. After all, it is the people of the bay who use the bay both for recreation and for business who will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefit from the ongoing work of the School of Marine Science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of this station continuing are many. There will be benefits to both the commercial and the recreational fishing industries through the study of fish stocks and how present activity is affecting the bay. The School of Marine Science is already conducting studies into the feeding and breeding habits of local marine life. These studies will help both government and industry officials to ensure better management of the bay's fish stocks. The school is also researching ways of minimising the impact of man&hyphen;made structures on shoreline ecology. This will be of benefit to the tourism industry, which is only just beginning to boom on North Stradbroke Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are but a few of the benefits which can be gained by the continued research in Moreton Bay. As well as seeking corporate money, I will continue to look at ways in which this government and the state government of Queensland can assist in fulfilling the funding needs of this facility. Moreton Bay is unique. It holds both ecological and economic importance for all of Australia. It is also seen as one of the most important regional and national marine monitoring sites. However, to continue this vital work the station requires immediate attention and I intend to work with both Professor Greenwood and Dr Tibbetts to ensure the station's future viability.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1408"><TITLE>Automotive Industry</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in Adelaide the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the shadow minister for industry and regional development, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), announced a plan which, if implemented, gives the automotive industry in Australia real hope for the future. This stands in stark contrast to the lack of support given to the automotive and automotive components industries by the attitudes and posturings of the government so far in its reaction to the Industry Commission's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan announced by the opposition leader calls for a freeze on tariffs on vehicles, original equipment and replacement components at 15 per cent until at least 2005. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1409"> can be achieved, the opposition believes, while still maintaining Australia's obligations under APEC. Furthermore, the plan seeks to establish a mechanism whereby the tariff and non-tariff barriers of our trading partners can be monitored. This would allow Australia to make certain that our trading partners were reducing their barriers in the automotive industry. As I have said often in debates here, free trade must also be fair trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third component of the plan is a review of the automotive industry in the year 2003 to determine which forms of assistance are most appropriate for the industry after 2005. It is especially pleasing to see that this review would also have to take into account the progress of our trading partners in removing barriers. It would mean the end of the Industry Commission disease of recommending the removal of support for an industry sector without taking into consideration what our trading partners are doing with regard to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personally I am very happy to see a commitment from the opposition to support the continuation of the very important and highly successful export facilitation scheme, amended if required to be consistent with Australia's World Trade Organisation obligations. Schemes such as the export facilitation scheme will be important to the 140 employees of Howe Leather at Thomastown in my electorate. Howe Leather was affected late last year when the United States threatened to take Australia to the WTO. Its subsequent treatment by the government was shabby, to say the least. The uncertainty continued from the time of President Clinton's visit until early January. It was hardly an appropriate or considered way for the government to treat an innovative firm which employs many people in the region that I represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the plan announced by the opposition today calls for a continuation of the duty&hyphen;free allowance to support domestic market value added and better support for industrial research and development in the automotive industry. This last aspect has become vital since the government's unwarranted and highly damaging attacks on research and development incentives last year. A proper system of support needs to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maintained to ensure that Australian automotive component manufacturers are encouraged to be innovative and at the cutting edge. The government, sadly, has failed to recognise the importance of this when it abolished syndication and cut out the R&amp;D tax concession to 125 per cent last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This plan demonstrates how important a partnership between government and industry can be. In return for the creation of a supportive environment, a Labor government would work towards commitments for export, investment and employment targets. If implemented, the opposition's plan would help to secure the jobs of about 1,000 people employed in the automotive components industry in the electorate of Scullin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether they are among the 425 employees of Goodyear Tyre and Rubber in Thomastown or one of the eight in the branch of Surdex Steel in Epping, this plan gives real hope for the security of their employment. Their jobs will be included not only in the jobs that continue, which were placed under threat by the Industry Commission's report, but also in the up to 10,000 new jobs that can be created through the adoption of this plan, which could lead to the trebling of exports of motor vehicle components to something like $3 billion. The growth in the component sector was even acknowledged in the Industry Commission report. Also, this plan could lead to the doubling of motor vehicle exports to 100,000 units per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the government, in its consideration of the Industry Commission report, given the widespread support for the freezing of the tariff levels through to the year 2005, will take on board and seriously consider the opposition's suggestions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent comments by Mr Borbidge regarding the appointment of judges raise some very important issues about the nature 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1410"> and process of selecting members of the judiciary. Until recently that process had not been seriously questioned at any time, as far I am aware, although from time to time controversies have arisen over the appointment of particular judges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some years ago in Queensland an impasse occurred over the proposal by the Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen government to appoint a relatively junior judge to the position of Chief Justice ahead of a more senior and experienced judge. Ultimately, a compromise occurred resulting in the appointment of another judge to the position. However, the then premier finally got his way in the appointment of the next Chief Justice. I recall at the time that the process divided the Queensland Supreme Court bench and most members of the bar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a federal level, some controversial appointments have been made, including the appointment of Sir Garfield Barwick, who was a minister in the Menzies government, and the appointment of Lionel Murphy, who was a serving minister in the Whitlam government. But times have changed and so too have personalities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, an increasing tendency has emerged among some members of the senior judiciary, who hitherto have adhered to the convention of being seen but not heard, to publicly express views. Thus the cult of personality has emerged at the judicial level. This is a regrettable tendency for, in my view, once judges try to become public figures and personalities they call into question community respect and, inevitably, whether they wish to or not, become perceived as being aligned with some cause or other which may ultimately be one upon which they are required to adjudicate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the law remains shrouded in much mystery, most people understand the basic concept that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done for it underpins the very fabric of society's respect for the rule of law. No matter how keen a judge is to see a right redressed or to carve a niche for himself or herself in judicial and/or contemporary history&mdash;and even judges are human enough occasionally to reflect upon their place in history&mdash;they must nevertheless be mindful of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the fact that their view of justice may not necessarily reflect the community view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Justice Kirby has been an outspoken judge for many years. No&hyphen;one questions his sincerity. But for the judge to make the reported comments that he has made implies support for some notion of social engineering by way of judicial definition. A judge making extra&hyphen;curial pronouncements on his views touching sensitive issues opens himself up for potentially greater criticism, which unfortunately can reflect on the public's perception of the court on which he ultimately sits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That gets me back to the question of judicial appointments. Judges must not only not be political; they must never be seen to be political. In this context, and in the history of the appointment of judges, it is time to review the manner and circumstances of such appointments. Judges are presently appointed by the incumbent government. I think this is a very unsatisfactory method of appointment. For a start, the inevitable issues of partiality and political patronage arise. Because of that, it is clear that the way has been opened for the appointment of judges who may not have been appointed to that position on merit and who, had a different method been adopted, may not have been appointed at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me differentiate initially between state judges and federal judges. I think state judges should be appointed by a committee that is drawn from the community and widely representative of it. This would include the appointment of a Chief Justice as well as the appointment of other judges. Such a committee should include the Chief Justice of the court except where his successor was being considered, the Attorney&hyphen;General, the President of the Bar Association and four other people drawn from the community, only one of whom would be a lawyer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as federal judges as concerned, the way is open for each appointment to be considered by a parliamentary committee if we are not going to look at the wider aspect of a committee being appointed along the lines that I have suggested for state judges. A parliamentary committee could examine the proposed appointment of every judge and then report to the government about it. That is one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1411"> way of doing it. The community committee is another way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both ways, be it the parliamentary committee or the community way, are far preferable to the present system. While it is also open to suggest that a committee may in any event be politically motivated, or at least some elements of it, it is an infinitely more preferable system than the current one. Making the community involvement an integral element of a judicial appointment will ultimately lead to a better respected judiciary, a more accountable one and perhaps one in which the community will have a greater degree of confidence and respect.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1411"><TITLE>Legal Aid</TITLE>

Quite frankly, this government is more than soft on law and order. It is absolutely irresponsible and incompetent as a result of its slashing of the legal aid contribution by some $128 million. A recent example came to light on Monday concerning a Mr Marini, who is facing trial on possession of a trafficable amount of cocaine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I am not going to comment on the merits of any allegations whatsoever against the person involved. On Monday, Mr Marini's counsel had prepared a case to apply for a permanent stay on the basis of Mr Marini's being deprived of funding for legal aid. On the Sunday night, a message came through to Mr Marini's counsel that the federal Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) was prepared to provide an application for legal aid to Mr Marini. So instead of Mr Marini's counsel applying for a permanent stay on the Monday, counsel applied for an adjournment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a farcical situation. A trial, which had been known about since September of last 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year, was organised. The judge was in court; the counsel were ready; the court reporters were ready. All the facilities of the court were ready to hear a case and it had to be adjourned because the federal Attorney&hyphen;General had not considered the application for legal aid although it had been in since September. It is quite simply an outrage. It is a situation that can not only significantly prejudice a defence but also significantly injure the interests of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If criminals cannot be brought to justice to face prosecution, there are two situations which will result. Either those people facing criminal charges will be locked in gaol for an unnecessary and lengthy periods of time if they are found to be innocent&mdash;in which case the taxpayer will have to pick up a massive bill&mdash;or the situation will occur where, following the case of Dietrich, the courts will be forced to release people facing criminal charges without those charges being heard. In other words, there is the probability that, if the government continues down this path, criminals will walk free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Mr Jeff Shaw, the Attorney-General for New South Wales, whom I know to be an entirely balanced, reasonable and intelligent man, is giving warnings to the community, people should stand up and listen. Mr Shaw said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the Commonwealth afraid of? The fact that their so-called `savings' will result in criminals walking free? They have quarantined defence from budget cuts&mdash;surely safety at home and on the streets is just as important.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My word it is. It is something that all Australians have to be very concerned about. This government likes to make sham noises of concerns for law and order, but when it comes to putting their money where their mouth is they are found wanting. They are soft on law and order. The Australian public will forever and a day hold them accountable for their inadequacies.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1411"><TITLE>University of South Australia: Whyalla Campus

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1412"> issue relating to a headline on page 5 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  entitled `Whyalla campus may go to save $18 million' under the name of Michelle Dawes. Another headline reads `A town's anger over a threat to its students' under the name of Chloe Fox. The Whyalla Campus of the University of South Australia is an integral component of my region and my electorate and particularly of the city of Whyalla. For its closure to even be contemplated is beyond belief and beyond acceptance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not yet got to the bottom of the story, but I understand that by late today reassurances were given that Whyalla's future is assured. This does not alter the fact that significant distress and uncertainty have been created, and that is very regrettable. I will await tomorrow's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> with interest to see what reassurances the education writer is able to give. Even the quoted Mr John Sloman said that Underdale may be closed and that Whyalla may be severely downsized. To say that Whyalla campus may go to save $18 million when the actual recurrent funding is equivalent to $2.9 million per year is stretching a headline beyond reasonable imagination. It is to be regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there is a very positive future for the University of South Australia in Whyalla and for regional South Australia, and I will fight to the end for this university. It is unacceptable that these headlines have even been contemplated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to another headline in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> entitled `Diggers fight for equal health rights'. I speak tonight on behalf of Mr Maurie Horton, a constituent of Tumby Bay, who has long believed that a gold card entitlement should be available to many of those men who returned from World War II. In a comment from the state president, Mr Ian Dunn, he acknowledged that, when the amendment was passed in 1987 to allow women to have the gold card, it was not seen as a precedent. I can understand why many diggers feel that they are being discriminated against at this stage. However, because the initial intention in 1987 was to remedy the disadvantage that women veterans had suf 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fered to that point, it was not seen to be a precedent for the men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, it is timely for me to speak in support of the diggers in my electorate, including Mr Houghton.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must express my thanks to the House for allowing a cognate debate on these appropriation bills. The bills are not opposed by the opposition; we will be supporting these measures. Nevertheless, I did want to make a number of points in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is on the Appropriations (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. When the new government came to power they talked about wanting to have higher standards in this place and I suppose a concern for a more parliamentary type of government rather than executive government. I think they are to be commended in those aspirations. In fact, I think all of us need to strive for that. But I think it is really sad that in Speaker Halverson's first term, one of the most significant areas of cutbacks has been in the committee system of the parliament. I understand that Speaker Halverson and the President of the Senate would have no choice in these matters; these cuts would be imposed by the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the committee system in the parliament is absolutely vital to the parliament. Perhaps the most important aspect is that it is vital to the people of Australia, because this is the way in which ordinary people are able to write in and express their views about the particular different references of the committees and have their voices heard and their views considered by members of parliament. We have seen over the years an increasing trend where committees are not ensconced in Canberra for their deliberations and do not always invite people to come to Canberra to state their point of view but they actually try to get out into the rest of Australia and open themselves up to ordinary people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For members of parliament this access to ordinary people's thoughts and wishes is very critical, but it does something else for them (members of parliament). I always describe the committees of the parliament as the universities of the parliament, because it is here that backbench members of parliament are exposed to the top bureaucrats, the top academics and the top people involved in community organisations or business. It is where you can learn and understand so much. So no&hyphen;one can run an argument that in cutting the funding for the committees we have somehow been able to continue on doing what we were doing but doing it more effectively and more efficiently. There has certainly been an element of that, but what we have done with these cutbacks is to limit the effectiveness of the committees. As we approach the new millennium, what parliamentarians need to do is to look at parliamentary committees and see how we can make them more effective and make them even more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1416"> accessible to the people of Australia to allow ordinary people the feeling and the certainty that their views are being taken into account and into consideration in these reports. Rather than reducing the staffing of parliamentary committees, we should be increasing their staffing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said in this place before that I would like to see established an internship program, if you like, where we are able to hire university graduates on a contract for twelve or eighteen months, have them work with the committees and add their youth, enthusiasm and brain power to the committees. This would allow those young people to be credentialled and put on their CV that they worked for parliamentary committees and then they could go on to the job of their choice. You would have a constant throughput in the committee system of some of the brightest of our young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, whilst I approve of the appropriation to the parliamentary departments, I think that the attack on the committee system, so recently established in the House of Representatives&mdash;the wider committee system is not even ten years old in the House of Representatives&mdash;is a regrettable step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other things we could do. I have never denied that I think there are too many committees. I would much rather have effective committees&mdash;in other words, perhaps a smaller number but committees with a greater clout. We do not have the resources to properly mull over legislation via the committee system. We just run out of resources&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SAWFORD" NAMEID="3J4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not time, resources. And that does the government no service, because you find that invariably we are putting through amendments and changes because of unintended consequences or, alternatively, something which is perhaps an even more important aspect, not allowing other people to comment on the implications of the measures that the public servants in the main are proposing in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I also want to address the area of education. I know this is an area of interest to the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). I spoke recently on the adjournment about senior high schools, and I am pleased to say that the honourable member for Port Adelaide and I participated in the production of the report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The restless years</EMPHASIS>, which looked at years 11 and 12 in schools.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SAWFORD" NAMEID="3J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr Sawford</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very good report.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An excellent report, and a unanimous report, actually. I guess that is another feature of committees: we are really not party political on committees. In 95 per cent of cases we really try to come together for solutions to different problems rather than trying to come as Labor politicians, Liberal politicians or National Party politicians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always held certain strong views about education. Firstly, when you get large states like New South Wales and Victoria, just running those states presents a huge management task, and you find far more innovation in the smaller states. To think you can prescribe uniformity throughout a state like New South Wales or Victoria and thereby maximise the realisation of the educational potential of our young Australians is very naive. So what I am saying is that I am one who encourages diversity, that is, I do not want change for change's sake. Having said I am an advocate for senior high schools&mdash;or colleges, as they are known in Canberra&mdash;I do not think we should have a college as the uniform model. In my own area, for example, where the state member for Londonderry lives, Castle Hill High is an outstanding 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1417"> comprehensive high school, performing well and serving its students well. Why change it? I seek no change to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in my own area I cannot claim that. I have mentioned the outrageous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> article on Mount Druitt High. It is a matter of history that Richard Amery, the state member, and I pushed for a senior high school in Mount Druitt back in 1987. We were supported by Ron Mulock at the time. We were unsuccessful, but my point in raising it is to talk about what sort of model we were after. There are six high schools in Mount Druitt, and the proposal was that one would be turned into a senior high school catering for all year 11 and 12 students and the other five high schools would become junior high schools, finishing at year 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were unsuccessful because the then state Labor government pulled the plug on the proposal. Whalan High was the nominated senior high school but State Labor pulled the plug. As I said in the House, it is to the credit of the incoming state government that they established a senior high school at St Marys. It was the first public senior high school in New South Wales, but it was not on the model. I was disappointed but I welcomed it. I suggested that in the future this would become an elite senior high school. When I say that it was not on the model there were no feeder junior high schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">St Marys Senior High School has gone gang busters. It may have struggled early but now it can pick and choose its students. It caters not only for people wanting to go on to tertiary education but also those who want to go on to an apprenticeship, traineeship or just enter the world of work. I think they had 23 students in the top 5,000. Ironically, this is one of the few public high schools in the state that is reversing the drift from public to private education. We are getting significant numbers of students who are doing their junior high school in the private schools but coming to St Marys Senior High School for years 11 and 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is meant that in the six high schools in Mount Druitt there has been a drift of students. There has been a drift to St Marys Senior High and a drift to other selective highs. I am not one who says, `Well, we cure this problem by denying parents and students choice.' I think that is an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alice in Wonderland</EMPHASIS> or even medieval solution to the problem. You have to allow parents and students freedom of choice about their schooling. But I do concede it has left these high schools structurally disadvantaged because they are losing a significant proportion of their students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot therefore just wring our hands and say, `Oh, isn't this terrible? We are structurally disadvantaged but we are not going to do anything about it.' The events surrounding Mount Druitt High and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> article have caused me to again launch a campaign for the classic model of a senior high school for Mount Druitt. But I do think, and I find it a pity, that a number of people, including the state member for Londonderry, Mr Gibson, do not understand the model. The<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Blacktown</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fairfax Sun</EMPHASIS> newspaper states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Londonderry State MP Paul Gibson agrees with the principals that such a school would cause more high schools to lose top students and their competitive edge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the point is that there is no competitive edge. They are already structurally disadvantaged and we need to react to it. Mr Gibson regrettably just does not understand the model, nor does Liberal councillor Allan Green. He accused me that I `couldn't see the forest for the trees' and that my plan would undermine all high schools. In fact I think it does the complete reverse. I do not mind copping criticism in public life. I think that is part of our role. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1418"> I have never been afraid to put my ideas in the public marketplace of ideas. You have to expect some criticism. But when people totally misunderstand what you are proposing and criticise you because of their lack of understanding, I have to say that I get a little frustrated about all this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say that, whilst Mount Druitt High featured in that newspaper article and the scandalous photo, Mount Druitt High was not the worst performing high school in my electorate. Indeed, there was one high school, Dunheved High, that had less than 25 students who wished to apply for a tertiary entrance rank. In fact, as I am led to believe, the TER for Dunheved High School was much lower than that for Mount Druitt. But I am not here to criticise Dunheved or Mount Druitt. I only want to say that I know, as the federal member who has been concerned about education in his electorate ever since he has been elected, other high schools in my electorate have been in a  similar situation before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the life of me, I cannot understand how you can anticipate that you are developing the full potential of students when you have a peer group of less than 25 students seeking a TER. In the case of Shalvey High School, it was 27 students. Of course these students suffer because they do not have the ability to pick their subjects. They may have an inkling to do ancient history but there is no ancient history course or they may be interested in geography but they cannot do geography. Or you can get to the ridiculous situation, as we have at Doonside Technology High, where you have two students being taught by one teacher. Is that an efficient use of resources? I am astounded. I am staggered that people would defend that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall that at the Mount Druitt Senior High School many years ago we had one ancient history teacher teaching one student ancient history. My view is this: teaching resources are a very precious commodity, a very valued commodity, in our society but we need to make sure that we are using them efficiently. As I say, if you get a peer group size of less than 25, 27 or 50, you are denying people the ability to pick and choose. You are denying the numbers in a class to ensure that there is effective competition within that class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does it mean to go home to the parents and say, `Oh, look, I've topped this subject&mdash;I came first,' and there are two people or half a dozen people in the class? This is part of the problem. Yes, all the high schools do trial HSCs and, yes, they are marked, but when you have such small numbers it is very difficult to gauge how hard they are marking them compared with the rest of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast that with the senior high school. I apologise, but I cannot remember whether the student numbers are between 800 to 1,000 students; it is about 400 in year 12 and 400 in year 11. Of course not only are you allowed subject choice but you get different classes doing the same subject; so you can pick and choose teachers, particularly if you are having a clash with a teacher, which is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always liked the system at Narrabundah College where the students are allowed to choose which teacher they want to be taught by. It is a great way of credentialling the effectiveness of the teacher. Some people might say, `Oh, the students will be irresponsible in this.' They are not. They are very good judges. It is a real indication to the principal that when one teacher is getting a lower number of students wishing to go to his or her class that maybe the teacher is not getting the message across as effectively as he or she could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not really mean to spend all that time talking about the senior high school but I do not believe the senior high school in Mount Druitt provides a solution for all the educational issues in my electorate or in any other electorate for that matter. But when you have something 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1419"> as devastating as that scandalous front page picture in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, as a community we can turn inward and try to isolate ourselves and nourish the hurt within our community. Alternatively, we can try to turn what has been a devastating blow to us into a positive. That has been my motivation in proposing that we look at a senior high school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wanted to say that the minister for education has launched an inquiry into the results of Mount Druitt High. I might say that we have had a vigorous discussion about this inquiry, but at least we agree about one thing&mdash;that is, the results and recommendations should be published and there should be wide community consultation about what those recommendations are. I think the community has a right to know. I think they should have been involved in the inquiry but, if not, we can at least have a decent process and give the community&mdash;that is, parents, students, teachers, principals or any other interested individuals&mdash;the opportunity to say what they believe should be done, what they want to see happen and what they expect to see happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, at the end of the day, a senior high school is rejected&mdash;and I do not think it will be because it was overwhelmingly supported years ago and we will mount a more effective campaign to ensure it does not get sabotaged a second time&mdash;that is a community process. I can live by that. But at least I have done something positive, I believe, in the longer term and I have got the community talking about education in a way they have not done for some time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fiscal accountability and responsibility are essential duties of government and we must see a reduction in the levels of government debt if there is any chance for future prosperity in this country. But the government cannot talk on the one hand of providing incentives for development and prosperity and the public good, and then place legislative, administrative or fiscal disincentives in the way of better productivity and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I last spoke on this government's appropriations, I warned that financial controls that make reallocations of resources or seek to raise funds to offset national debt must leave enough incentive to encourage national savings, to stimulate business and build an environment for prosperity in this country. There are many aspects of the budget which have not supported this. Time and implementation of some of these budget initiatives have revealed some serious problems which I seek to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly I would like to talk about state funding. I was very disturbed to read this morning that even in our market driven approach to the economy under the coalition, it is being proposed that states that are performing badly will receive a much higher share of Commonwealth funding in the next budget than those states that are performing well. Such an approach can be argued as giving stimulation to depressed local economies when, in reality, it is a case of supporting inefficient and less productive operations at the expense of profitable, dynamic enterprises. Why should Western Australia and Queensland once again be called upon to subsidise the poor performance and wasteful activities of the larger states? If these were private businesses, the national competition policy would not support such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my view that unless states like Western Australia are able to get better representation within the government&mdash;within the cabinet and ministry of the government&mdash;I fear that this situation will continue. I would like to point out that the absence of a Western Australian minister in the cabinet of the coalition government is deleterious for Western Australia. I know that this particular result is of a consequence of all the shenanigans 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1420"> that were going on in the Liberal Party in Western Australia back in 1995&hyphen;96 and, in some ways, may even amount to a punishment for the incompetence of one or two of those people in relation to their undertakings to the then leader, now Prime Minister John Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this is now causing Western Australia to suffer. The loss of $33&half; million, most of which will go to New South Wales and Victoria, is Western Australia's reward for greater productivity and prosperity as the state has pulled itself into a dramatic recovery from the economic mismanagement of the Burke/Lawrence/Dowding Labor governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make to perfectly clear to the government that punishing performance is not to be considered a sound economic business principle. It will not be accepted by the people of Western Australia or Queensland; it is quite simply unfair and a gross disincentive. Members in this place and senators&mdash;and I particularly mention senators from Western Australia&mdash;who ignore this, do so at their political peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to law and order. I am very concerned at the cuts and low levels of federal funding in this budget for programs which relate to the fighting and prevention of crime in Australia. Budget cuts are damaging to the morale and effectiveness of organisations such as the Australian Customs Service, the AFP and the NCA. Public order and safety is decreasing significantly as a percentage of the total Commonwealth budget. This is occurring, Mr Deputy Speaker, when the risks to the community from crime, continue to increase. The AFP is the principal law enforcement agency through which the Commonwealth pursues its law enforcement interests. This budget reduced AFP funding for 1997 by more than $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Institute of Criminology was established to conduct research, policy analysis and information dissemination on criminal and justice issues. Its budget has been cut by over 36 per cent, resulting in reduced operational capability and performance. I can imagine that the deputy whip, who is present here, would be as appalled as I am that this particular budget has seen the discontinuance of the AIC's violence against women project. I have been advised by the Attorney&hyphen;General that this project, tailored specifically to help protect slightly more than 50 per cent of the population against which the majority of crime is directed, is the only one to be dropped by the Australian Institute of Criminology and it is to be deplored, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn again to small business. I have been told that this government is creating an environment in which it is favourable to do business. My question to the Minister for Small Business is what exactly he has done, what has been funded in the coalition's range of appropriation bills to help create this environment. My colleague, the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and I have regularly questioned the government's approach in the light of its promises, especially its number one promise to the small business constituency, that it would reduce by 50 per cent, the red tape and compliance burdens by the end of the first term of its government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now know that the government has conceded that it cannot achieve this goal of cutting red tape by 50 per cent. In fact, the reality of the matter is that the government has increased red tape for compliance on small business since it has been in office in just over one year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, in the first instance, the member for Curtin and I looked at the implementation of what we consider to be one of the most admirable the government's programs, the family tax initiative, which was meant to give relief to low income earners. It is my view that this relief has already been eroded and the cost in compliance to business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1421"> which is responsible for reporting on a continual basis the essential data on which the scheme relies, is an unwarranted impost on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the environment in which small business people will need to prosper is very easily illustrated in the retail sector. The retail sector is, of course, a very significant employer of young Australians. It is the section of the employment market most heavily affected by the 13 years of Labor governments which, of course, resulted in such a high level of unemployment. Small retailers are responsible for a very large slice of the employment and retail turnover in this country. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successive coalition leaders have vowed to improve employment levels through the vehicle of `small business'. But what does a small retailer have to do to cope with making a living in today's environment? The retail tenancy agreements in the states, provide almost no protection to those who regularly risk their livelihood to make an honest living. Most small retailers do not have the luxury of taking leases over a period longer than five years. The capital cost in setting up could not possibly be amortised over the term of the lease. There is an absolute reliance on the extension of the lease to avoid bankruptcy, or to be able to sell the business to another owner. It is no surprise that these people do not hold the whip hand in any negotiation with the lease or the landlords.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, who in renting a home would accept an arrangement where they, as tenant, were required to invest an enormous sum of money into improving the home and then give monthly details of their income so that the landlord could then increase rental once the tenant begins to do well? If there is a complaint, the lease is then terminated and all investment forfeited. This would not just be unacceptable; it would be legislated against. Yet this is exactly how retail tenancy arrangements work in many parts of our country. No wonder small retail bankruptcy is at an absolute high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been done to create this `favourable' environment for small business? I would like the minister to explain that, not to me but to those small business people who voted for a change in the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of budget cuts that have become more evident is the anti&hyphen;competitive activity of public agencies or government agencies such as CSIRO, Ausmap and others, that are working against small business people&mdash;again, the core constituency of the government. In the light of serious cuts to the funding of public enterprises, they have been forced in many instances to conduct extensive routine work for industry at rates lower than the true cost. This provides a steady reliable income that does not have to be rate reflected as a budget bottom line by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where, certainly in the Western Australian context&mdash;the member for Perth would know of this&mdash;small businesses in our state involved particularly in mining and the resources sector are obliged to compete in the marketplace, offering their services against CSIRO and Ausmap, which do not pass on the true cost of their work to their clients and, as a consequence, are providing subsidised services to those consumers. They are skewing the market against the small business interests of those service providers&mdash;those consultants&mdash;who are obviously not subsidised and who are forced to pass on the true cost of their service to the clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that this work should and could be done by people in private enterprise. It is not just me who says this. The coalition's own national competition policy says this. Yet the coalition flouts its own policy and allows this to happen because these agencies are doing this in response to some of the budget cuts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1422">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs or the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) explain this to the electorate? I say this because part of the government's problem is that small business thinks it is being let down, and it is now losing faith in the coalition creed. I read today where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> small business index has reported a slump in support for the government's small business policies from 42 to 20 per cent. The percentage of those in the small business sector who think government policies are working against them has risen from six to 22 per cent. This is an indictment by the many people who believed that their future was better served by the coalition than Labor. Minister Prosser is like the emperor with new clothes, claiming that these figures do not mean anything and that two-thirds of business expects sales and profits to increase over the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find this attitude astounding. The minister is claiming credit for the economic improvement of this country, more rightly down to the actions of other ministers in the coalition as some sort of compensation for the fact that promised improvements for small business have not occurred. You cannot escape the fact that small business people are disenchanted. It is because he has not given what he promised in the government's first 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must not forget that small business is also probably the best way to reduce unemployment in this country. I note in the same article in the paper this morning that Parliamentary Library researchers now believe that the coalition holds more than half of the electorates in this country with high unemployment rates. Even as a matter of self&hyphen;preservation, I would have thought that the minister would have been prodded by all those backbenchers in marginal seats with high unemployment rates to lift his game to help small business. It begs this question: why have a minister for small business if it is not going to make an ounce of difference? It raises people's expectations unnecessarily. When they are dashed, they feel even more aggrieved towards the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has indirectly acknowledged the performance of his peers on the front bench. Perhaps it is now time that one of these good performers took over this crucial role in  cultivating small business prosperity. I know that on the back bench of the coalition there is an enormous amount of talent. It is my view that on the back bench there are people who could do the job far better than the minister. It is time that the Prime Minister took hold of the reins of office and ensured that the best performers are on the front bench. That is an attitude I am sure many on the back bench would agree with. I know that members of the opposition would probably also agree.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very kind of the member for Perth to say that, but I am interested in looking at this from the perspective of my constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One particular program I want to refer to in the context of the portfolio of another poor performer in the government, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), is the NEIS, or new enterprise incentive scheme. Another way that I believe small business has been penalised by the effects of this budget is in the reduction of funds to the new enterprise incentive scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have long had an involvement with people in the NEIS and am compelled by this government's action to stand in this place and defend what is probably one of the most effective business and employment programs in the country. I did the same when the former minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), was trying to get rid of the enterprise incentive scheme several years ago during the term of the Labor government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1423">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 June 1996, Minister Vanstone announced that the budget for NEIS had been cut nationally by one&hyphen;third but that the regional economic group, RED, and a number of the Western  Australian managing agents have actually been cut by up to 66 per cent. This has had a very significant effect on the local labour market. At the time, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new enterprise incentive scheme is one of the most successful programs. However, it is one of the most expensive. The number of potential NEIS places for 1997-98 is being considered now as the federal budget is prepared for May this year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am concerned that if the number of places made available for NEIS is not increased, it will lead to a net increase in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NEIS program is unique in that not only do the participants create their own job through the establishment of their own small business but also these businesses end up as employers as well. At the last count, eight new and additional jobs were created for every 10 NEIS businesses established. This saved the Commonwealth an estimated $65.8 million in unpaid unemployment benefits last year. The NEIS program is one of the most cost effective employment generation programs in this country. Each real and sustainable job created by NEIS costs around $2,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister clearly has not taken these figures into account when deciding to cut NEIS. Cuts to NEIS really mean a loss in jobs potentially created by small business. I will make this observation: these are jobs for young people. Once again, young people are being targeted by cuts that, in many instances, come from ministers who are endeavouring to do the opposite, which is create work or opportunities for young people. The cuts in this budget can be directly correlated to a loss of 4,500 jobs that would have been created this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also stunned by the fact that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs has not championed this program to his coalition colleagues. But he is not in cabinet, so how could he. He has all responsibility and no power. That is a problem that the Western Australians face with the fact that we do not have a cabinet minister in the coalition from Western Australia, which, in my view, is an absolute disgrace. It means that Western Australian interests are under&hyphen;represented. It also means that all those others who are either parliamentary secretaries or ministers from Western Australia are obliged to follow the cabinet line without any input. So Western Australia's interests are diluted considerably.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they say so publicly. This is the sum total of the incompetence of the Western Australian Liberal Party in its relationship with the Prime Minister. All I can say is that WA is suffering as a consequence of that incompetence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995-96, 10,000 people established new businesses as a result of taking part in the NEIS program after undergoing training with one of the 150 managing agencies throughout Australia. DEETYA's latest post&hyphen;program monitoring data indicates 84 per cent positive outcomes for NEIS participants 15 months after business commencement. I was walking through the main street of Joondalup the other day when I bumped into a chap, as we all do as members. I could not quite place the face or the environment in which I had seen him. This chap was standing next to equipment from his business. He said, `Do you remember me, Paul? You spoke to us when Labor was trying to scrap NEIS. They stopped, fortunately. Look at me now. I've been in business for four years. I'm employing people.' That was as a result of the then government and this government's most successful program. They now want to cut it. It is absolutely unbelievable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1424">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Translated to the general small business sector, such positive outcomes would represent a community saving of hundreds of millions of dollars from unemployment benefits through prevention of bankruptcies alone. The NEIS program is not only cost effective; it generates a net return for the community through its effective business program. To continue to dismantle it in the knowledge of what has been done and what can be achieved represents social vandalism by the two  ministers concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining, I want to touch on Austudy. It is a subject that is very sensitive to backbenchers in the government. It has been a serious problem because of the disastrous inability of many Australians to obtain Austudy support following changes in the management of the scheme by the government. Potentially thousands of people are unable to enrol in courses of study this year through lack of financial support. That is on top of the fact that they have seen the increase in the threshold age of independence from 22 to 25. It is slightly mind boggling for a government that is supposed to represent self-determination and self-starting to claim that people are not independent up to the age of 25. It is very hard to understand. I find explaining that to the families who come to me in my constituency office very difficult, particularly as many of them are in what I consider to be the core constituency of the coalition&mdash;that is, families raising children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In defence of the government, however, I believe that there was sufficient evidence that people were obtaining Austudy support where they should not have been entitled to it. This has been especially prevalent among families where trusts were used to limit assessable income. The government was right to act to remedy this. Unfortunately, the problem is in the way that it has been done. In order to restrict one group, a much larger group of genuinely deserving people has been prevented from gaining access to Austudy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments today about trade and industry policy. As we are dealing with Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97, one is able to make some wide&hyphen;ranging remarks in respect of general matters. There are a couple of matters contained within the bills themselves which relate to trade and industry matters that I will draw particular attention to and make some general comments about following upon that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech on Appropriation Bill (No. 4) was given by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), who most recently has started taking an interest in the car industry for various reasons. In the minister's second reading speech, he referred to a $30 million package of alternative assistance to Howe Leather following the agreement reached with the United States to remove automotive leather from eligibility under the TCF import credit scheme and the PMV export facilitation scheme. That is recorded on page 26 of the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) under the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism. Under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1425"> `Other Services' at division 917 of that department's appropriations, an amount of $30 million is recorded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dispute over Howe Leather was, in my view, a direct result of the government's misplaced notion of aggressive bilateralism, which was the hallmark of the coalition election commitments of the Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer). Shortly after the coalition won office a year ago, the United States ambassador to Australia, Mr Perkins, made the point that the notion of aggressive bilateralism means that if you punch a trading partner, they tend to punch back. The empty threats of the Minister for Trade saw the United States punch back over Howe Leather. As a consequence, we saw, in conjunction with the World Trade Organisation meeting in Singapore in December last year, an alleged agreement between the government on behalf of Australia and the United States administration whereby Howe Leather was provided with an alternative package of $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I describe it as alleged, because I notice the other day when the then acting US trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, was before the US Senate finance committee at her confirmation hearing, in the written answers she supplied to questions before the committee she made the point&mdash;which was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in recent days&mdash;that the Australian government, from the United States administration's eyes, seemed to have replaced one unfair and WTO inconsistent regime with another. This is a very far-flung point from the assertion of an agreement in respect of Howe Leather. Those employees at Howe Leather who may have seen that reference from the now trade representative Barshefsky can be legitimately entitled to wonder about the implications for their jobs and future if what was trumpeted loudly by the government, the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) as a done deal with the United States is now a done deal which is apparently at risk. We await with interest any further developments as far as the Howe Leather compensation package is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second particular area that I want to refer to arising out of the bills themselves is found in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) at page 53. Again, it is to do with the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism where reference is made to changed appropriations so far as bounty and subsidy assistance is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relevant acts that that particular appropriation refers to are the Bounty (Books) Act, the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act and the Bounty (Ships) Act. This is a reference to the decision by the government in last year's budget to effectively terminate a range of bounties&mdash;the shipbuilding bounty, the computer bounty and the book bounty&mdash;and its decision, again towards the end of last year, to make some changes in the timing of the termination of those arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one which is of particular interest to me is the shipbuilding bounty, and that arises largely as a consequence of Australia's shipbuilding industry being now exclusively an export industry and Australia's shipbuilding industry being now found almost exclusively in sheds in Henderson, south of Fremantle, and in Tasmania. None of our Tasmanian colleagues are here, so I will not raise the question as to which state performs better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point to make is that at a point in the cycle where Australia's shipbuilding industry had turned itself exclusively into an export industry in fierce competition with European nations, particularly northern Europe&mdash;building new fast ferries, aluminium fast ferries and catamarans&mdash;and at precisely the point in the cycle where some European nations increased their subsidies, the government took the step of abolishing the shipbuilding bounty. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1426"> subsidies which are given to our competitors in northern Europe far outweigh the original subsidies provided by the shipbuilding bounty in any event. Those decisions, in particular in respect of the shipbuilding bounty, reflect a more general approach to trade, industry and export enhancement policy which the government has adopted since it came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude on the shipbuilding bounty, I noticed in the last couple of weeks that the chairman of the Australian Shipbuilding Association, who is also the managing director of Austel Ships in Henderson in Western Australia, issued a press release making the point that, as a direct consequence of the government's decision in this area, they had not been able to win any further contracts in the shipbuilding area and they were proposing to put 300 of their workers on notice that they would lose their jobs as a direct consequence of the government's changed arrangements so far as the shipbuilding bounty is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could not get a better example of the government's trade, industry and export policy taking the nation in precisely the wrong direction. In the end, trade and industry are about economic growth and about jobs and we need to do everything we can to enhance economic growth and to enhance jobs. With the prospect of 300 workers losing their jobs in Henderson in Fremantle, there is no better illustration of the wrong direction in which the government is taking us so far as trade and industry enhancement policy is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of clear points of contrast between the government and the opposition in this area. The first point of contrast is in the trade and export enhancement area. In express breach of election commitments, we saw in the last budget the government make its decision either to abolish or massively gut a range of export enhancement programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In express breach of an election commitment, the government cut Austrade appropriations by $90 million per year and cut EMDG appropriations by $426 million over four years. That was an express breach of an election promise which had the effect that the maximum cut of appropriations from Austrade and EMDG combined would be $58.6 million. There was an express breach of a personnel commitment that the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister gave to the book publishers association that there would be no tinkering in any substantial way with the export market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in the area of export facilitation, in the main program to help small and medium sized exporters to enhance their export activity, we have seen a massive slashing of funds allocated to the EMDG scheme and a cap of $150 million placed on that scheme by the government. That $150 million cap includes the cost of administration, which is calculated by the department to be in the order of up to $7.5 million. So the maximum amount that the government is prepared to allocate to assist small and medium sized companies for export enhancement under that scheme is effectively going to be $142.5 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is despite the government's own documentation in the budget papers showing that, for every dollar spent under the EMDG scheme, there is an export ratio return of anywhere between eight to one and 24 or 25 to one, depending upon whether the exporter is a new exporter or an exporter that has been exporting for a number of years. So there is a massive export ratio benefit and the government cuts off Australia's nose to spite its face by simply looking at a penny pinching, rationalist bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That approach, that method, is being reflected in a range of other areas in industry enhancement&mdash;gutting $2 billion out of research and development and cutting the support by way of industry bounties or subsidies, which I have referred to. The whole thematic policy approach of the government in its industry, trade and export enhancement policies to date has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1427"> been to remove or massively reduce the incentives and programs that assist Australian exporters and Australian companies in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point of contrast in the government's approach to trade, industry and export enhancement and the approach of those on this side of the House is found in the government's trade outcomes and objectives statement, which the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister tabled in the House on 5 February. There are a number of points that are worth making about that particular statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the statement contains no reference or mention of any jobs target or any employment target, and this stands in stark contrast to the last trade outcomes and outlooks statement of the previous government, when the then senator, now member for Canberra, Bob McMullan, was Minister for Trade. Labor's last trade outlook statement contained an express commitment to reduce unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000. We find lots of mantra chanting about jobs in Mr Fischer's document but no objectives in real terms, no jobs or unemployment targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that we find in Mr Fischer's statement, despite the fact that we find all this mantra chanting about jobs, is weasel words about exports making a contribution to growth in the economy. But when we look at the government's budget papers&mdash;firstly, the budget papers of last year and, secondly, the mid-year review released by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the course of this year&mdash;we find the government's own budget papers forecast that exports will make a negative contribution to growth in GDP in the 1996-97 financial year and the 1997-98 financial year. That is a drop from a plus one per cent contribution to growth in GDP by net exports in the course of 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So under the approach of those on this side of the House, enhancing trade, enhancing economic growth, enhancing the array of incentives to Australian companies to export, we find in 1995-96&mdash;our effective last full year in office&mdash;a one per cent contribution and the government's own forecasts are a negative contribution for 1996-97 and 1997-98. At precisely that point in the cycle, we find this massive gutting of export and trade enhancement programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next key point we find in the minister's statement is an almost obsessive focus on the notion of bilateralism. This was the hallmark of the coalition's trade policy in the run-up to the last election. Whilst there are some concessions made to regionalism and to multilateralism, the focus is essentially on bilateral arrangements. In an era of multilateral trade obligations, it is clear that you need to be able to push bilateral arrangements, regional arrangements and multilateral arrangements but not focus exclusively and solely on bilateral arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arising out of that, in the course of the statement tabled by the Minister for Trade, we find about 10 countries listed in his statement as the key markets for the next two years. There is a consistent thread which flows through the key sectoral markets and the key sectoral industries, which the minister's statement draws attention to as priorities. We not only find a focus on bilateralism but also a focus on agricultural and mineral raw commodities exports. This is despite the outlook statement's own analysis that the great shift in international trade over the last 15 years and into the future is into manufactures, services and value added exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on the one hand we find the government's own statement talking about growth and jobs coming from trade and export. We find the government's own budget papers and mid-year review talking about, under their policies, that being a net negative contribution to growth. We find the government's own analysis in the trade document referring to the shift in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1428"> international trade into manufactures, value addeds and services&mdash;and that is matched with the government's sectoral priorities being in the minerals and agricultural raw commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is the case that our traditional commodities remain of vital importance to Australia, we have to follow that shift in international trade. We follow that shift in international trade by doing what we can to maximise our effort so far as small and medium sized companies are concerned in the value adding, in the manufactures and in the services areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, I had the opportunity to go to Ballarat. In the course of my time in Ballarat, I spent time with a quite differing array of exporting companies. One was a company exporting computer software services, another was a group of potato growers trying to get into value added activity and exporting to Japan and another was a group of automotive exporters to the United States. All of these exporters in Ballarat reflect the diversity and the mix of Australia's export basket. All in their own way emphasise the need to be putting our policy focus on value adding, on manufactures, on services and on products to follow that shift in international trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other disappointing feature in the trade outlook statement is that we find no notion of aggressive multilateralism contained in the government's policy. In the course of Ambassador Barshefsky's appearance before the Senate finance committee at her confirmation, she enhanced what she had previously articulated as a United States strategic enforcement strategy so far as World Trade Organisation obligations are concerned. Before the Senate committee at the end of January, Ambassador Barshefsky had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our willingness to enforce trade laws and existing agreements is crucial to our support at home and our credibility abroad. The Administration has brought a record number of enforcement actions by using all the trade tools at our disposal&mdash;48 actions in the past year. And we have reinvigorated efforts to ensure compliance with all of our trade agreements whether negotiated by us or previous administrations. We have aggressively fought against the market closing practises of competitors using the leverage provided in Section 301&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, section 301 of their trade act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to open foreign markets and ensure fair treatment for our goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have filed 21 cases to enforce U.S. rights under the new dispute settlements procedures of the World Trade Organization&mdash;having filed 15 complaints in the last year alone. This caseload is absolutely unprecedented in the history of the GATT and WTO, and we have already begun to see the benefits our enforcement efforts have yielded for U.S. firms and workers. Of the 21 cases brought by us, we reached settlements in six cases and we have prevailed in two cases so far that were referred to panel. The real successes are the settlements that we reach . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new WTO dispute settlement rules often make it possible for us to enforce WTO agreements without ever having to reach a panel decision. The fact that the WTO can and will authorize us to retaliate enables us to reach earlier settlements, opening markets for more of our exports.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is precisely the mechanism used against us by the United States in the Howe Leather case, and the Minister for Trade announced earlier this year that we were pursuing a similar mechanism against Hungary in respect of some of Hungary's agricultural subsidies. The great disappointment in the trade outlook statement is that our action against Hungary is not the tip of the iceberg, but it is the iceberg itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to maximise Australia's opportunity for exports, and in an era of multilateral trade liberalisation, you have to do two things: you have to run an aggressive industry development policy to ensure that your export mix can follow the shift of international trade, but you also need to run an aggressive multilateral trade policy. That means you have to use 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1429"> the enforcement mechanisms of the WTO to ensure that our trading partners are up to the mark so far as WTO obligations are concerned and to ensure that the world is not tilted against us. The great disappointment, so far as multilateral obligations are concerned in the minister's document is that it is clear that we are not following the model of the Barshefsky's strategic enforcement strategy to maximise our WTO obligations and to maximise the benefit which will come from trade to Australian jobs and to Australian workers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in this appropriation debate dealing with appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4. Given the tradition of having a wide ranging debate, I will range widely over a number of government departments. At the outset, looking at the appropriation for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, let me express my disappointment as I have expressed before with the cut through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to international organisations dealing with family planning programs. There was a lot of lobbying about this. I felt that the cut to the United Nations program was nothing short of an absolute disaster and, as usual under this government, has sent all the wrong messages about Australia's standing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In overall terms the amount of money we were giving was not huge but it was very important to those programs, especially programs in our part of the world. When I was in Samoa earlier this year, people were asking what was likely to be in the budget and whether their family planning programs were likely to be cut. I said I could not give any guarantees. I was no longer a member of the government party. I was a member of the opposition. I did not have access to any knowledge. But even I did not realise the savageness of the cuts that would be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to say that religion played a part in this but, like everyone else, no way would I agree to some of the arguments that have been pushed about coercion and forced family planning. But you just have to go to those countries of the South Pacific or in our parts of the world and see the very necessary programs that are there. I will continue to say it is a great pity that they were cut. I do hope that the funding to those programs dealing with family planning can be restored at the first opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Only last week I had a group of young people come to see me complaining that they had been ripped off over a music training scheme&mdash;one of these programs that, under the former government, allowed these young people to be given training in the music industry. I was very careful to find out that the Commonwealth had met all its responsibilities. These people had got their training; they had got their payment; and at the end of their training they were picked up by a private enterprise. It is always being paraded how wonderful private enterprise is. However, it was when private enterprise stepped in employing the young people that the sorry saga commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These young people had not received their proper pay or working conditions. I had a look at the contract that they had signed; that was not being met. Being one of those dreadful people that the government points to as a trade unionist, of which I am very proud, my first question to these young people was: `Have you discussed this with your union?  You are obviously being ripped off. You're not being paid the correct amount of money. They're not abiding by the conditions that you were employed under.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These young people&mdash;and this is coming from the centre of trade unionism, the Illawarra&mdash;looked at me in some amazement and they pointed out to me, rightly, that this was their very first job and that they were not in a union. In fact, I got the impression that they did not know 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1430"> very much about unions. I explained to them the role of the union, how important it was and how the union could step in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I contacted the union myself and, although these young people were not members of the union, the union agreed to become involved in the case to see what they could do to get these young people their proper entitlements&mdash;which is now happening. This for me is not an isolated case. Time and time again people come to see me about ripped off. I know they come to see all members of parliament when they are being ripped off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I had a boat builder, who had been employed for some 18 months, come to see me because at no time had he been paid the correct wage. I come from an area of very high unemployment. It is easy for people like me who are in a well paid job to say, `Why did you accept that?' But I have not got a big mortgage; I do not have a couple of kids that I have to feed. These people are frightened of losing their jobs. We say, `They should not take this; they should know better.' It is easy from our position to pass judgment. As I say, this person had been employed by a boat builder for some 18 months and had at no time been paid the proper wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had another case of a firm in Wollongong called Death by Chocolate&mdash;a wonderful name&mdash;who had ripped off the young people working there when their establishments closed. Another example is U.F.I. Pools. The bosses were supposed to be paying the employees' contributions into a super fund but they were not. When the firm closed these people were left high and dry. The young people&mdash;be it the boat builder or those working for this firm called Death by Chocolate&mdash;are receiving no entitlements such as annual leave and superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that people do not realise the importance of unions until they run into problems. We hear from those on the other side ad nauseam about the freedom to join a union, freedom of choice, the right to be in a union or not in a union. I have never in my life seen a non-union member, who is so proud of being a non-union member, refuse to take the pay increase or refuse to accept the better working conditions fought for and gained by unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is the basic hypocrisy of it: if these people who feel so strongly about the right not to be in a union, then for consistency's sake they should not take the benefits gained by the unions. They should not take the pay increase that the union gets. They should not take the better conditions that the union obtains for them, because they do not want to be in a union and they are exercising their democratic right not to be in a union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are told by this government that we are moving into a period of free enterprise. This is really great if you have the power and ability to negotiate your wages and conditions, but what about the young or those without a bargaining base; what about their conditions? It is great if you come from an industry where there is a demand for your skills. Of course you are going to get a good deal. But the idea of bargaining assumes that there is a degree of equality, that they are equals who are bargaining. But how can there be equality when, say, a 16- or 18-year-old school leaver is bargaining their pay and conditions for their first job with a management team or someone who has had a lot of experience in bargaining?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the trade union movement that has gained the proper wages and conditions for workers throughout this century. Those opposite make much of the decline in union membership but, like so many things, people never realise what they have until they need it. Time and time 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1431"> again people come to my office complaining about lack of conditions, about being exploited over their wages. These are always non-union members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my 14 years in this parliament, I cannot recall a union member coming to me with any of these complaints&mdash;not once. Every so often those opposite trot out the union membership of those on this side of the chamber. In an adjournment debate one day, I heard one of the members of the government stand up and list all the trade union affiliations of the members on our side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that I am proud to be a trade unionist. I still retain my union membership and, in my own way, play an active part in the union. I would continue to press very strongly the importance of unionism and the benefits of the union. So often people do not realise the real benefits of a union until they come to need that benefit. That is when they realise the importance of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People assume that the bosses are always the well-meaning, benevolent, caring individuals that they like to portray themselves as. In the vast majority of cases&mdash;I dare not say that they are rogues&mdash;they are out to get the very best. If that means exploiting the worker and the conditions, they will still do it. It is no different in 1997 from what it was in 1897. They would still screw the workers into the ground if they could, and it is only the union that stops them doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On another issue, but one that is equally important to me, people sometimes wonder and indeed ask us how much power an individual has. What is the point of attending a rally, writing a letter to a paper or indeed coming to see the MP when it seems that the omnipotent power of government and bureaucracy overrules all protests. I should like to outline to the chamber an example of where people power has had a tremendous victory in my own area. It shows that the might of the ordinary people, when they are united, can overcome obstinacy and bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This example involves Vodafone&mdash;one of these mobile phone groups that many people have heard about&mdash;who had decided, without consultation with anyone, to erect a 30-metre telecommunications tower at Dapto Showground which, I might say, is the gem of my electorate. What they had overlooked or ignored was the fact that it was to be erected within 300 metres of a primary school and also a child-care centre. When the local residents became aware of this, naturally they were outraged. They formed themselves into a committee, held public meetings and demanded answers from Vodafone&mdash;all of which they could not get. They involved both the local state member, the member for Illawarra, Terry Rumble, and me in the issue. We both wrote numerous letters to Vodafone which they refused to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, after a number of telephone calls just before Christmas, I eventually contacted someone at Vodafone and I was given to understand that work was to commence within days at the showground site. When we communicated this information to the locals, without hesitation the local residents rallied. On the morning that work was to commence, a crowd was at the gates of Dapto Showground from 6 a.m.&mdash;which is also the Dapto greyhound racing club; so we also had a lot of greyhound owners coming in there with their dogs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people there at that meeting resolved, with the support of the South Coast Labour Council and the local politicians, that a picket line would be maintained. The picket line was set up and was maintained over Christmas. Indeed, each of us was rostered there to work over Christmas Day. As it was, it was only when Vodafone agreed to a meeting with the residents and gave a written guarantee that no work would commence until after this meeting, that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1432"> picket line was somewhat downgraded. It was not necessary for me and a couple of others to spend our Christmas day on the picket line, although we had intended to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But throughout this whole period, right up until a week ago, the locals had been maintaining a presence at Dapto Showground. So determined were the local people that they were prepared to picket over Christmas. For many of the people there, this was their first active protest. It was the first time many of them had ever been on a picket line and, naturally, a lot of people were quite concerned and apprehensive about what would happen. But they so believed in what they were doing that they were determined to overcome their apprehension and go on that picket line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> A meeting took place in my office with Vodafone on 17 February this year, and Vodafone agreed to consider alternative sites. The fact we told them that no way were we going to have the tower there and that, if necessary, we would see that no dog meeting took place there while ever they were proposing to put that tower up might have hastened their decision. They said that, while not categorically ruling out Dapto Showground, alternative sites would be investigated and no work would commence until they had reported back, which I hope will be next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What we are seeing here is an illustration that, when people believe passionately about an issue and are prepared to be united, they can achieve many things. It is always difficult when you single out people for mention because you inevitably miss many people, although I must say I have never seen the people of Dapto so united on any issue as they were on this issue. It is the strongest community feeling I have received on any issue in all the 14 years I have represented Dapto; it is the one issue that really united the people. Special mention should go to Yoke Berry, Barney Fittler, Tom Fitzgibbon, Noreen Hay and Neil Hicking who all took a leadership role in this picket line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would also like to take this opportunity to outline my concern about plans by the government to provide an additional period for telephone companies to be exempt from local and state planning laws. As you know, these companies&mdash;these cowboys with the mobile phones&mdash;are exempt from local government planning laws. At the moment, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) is planning to allow the telephone companies an additional two months past the 1 July deadline this year to be exempt from the planning power. I think this is something we should resist wholeheartedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that meeting in my office, Wollongong City Council came along with a map on which they had outlined various alternative sites. I must say that the Vodafone people, to give them their credit&mdash;although they should have done it six months earlier&mdash;did listen to the complaints of the people and did agree to look at alternative sites. They were quite surprised when Wollongong City Council produced this map. Wollongong City Council had a coloured map of the whole area, and on that they had identified alternative sites. On that map, the Vodafone people outlined the difficulties with the line which has to be there with no blockages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is becoming an increasing problem for local government areas because these mobile phone people just go willy-nilly all over the place. They are sticking towers up; they are not coordinating with each other; and they are just putting them up often in the most sensitive areas. I guess most of us here have got a mobile phone. I read in a newspaper yesterday that, after Finland, Australia is the second largest mobile phone user in the world. This is all in the space of 10 years. So, in many respects, we ourselves are part of the problem because we all insist on having these mobile phones.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1433">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is going to be an increasing problem for local government areas. The local governments do not have the power to impose restrictions&mdash;as they do in every other area&mdash;on these mobile phone people. It is very important that they get their acts together. I think many councils could take a lead from Wollongong City Council which has gone to the trouble of identifying these various areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the couple of minutes that is left to me, I want to turn to another issue dealing with these appropriations. At the six elections that I have had the honour to fight and win&mdash;with an increased majority, I would like my colleagues to know, and the same will be with the seventh&mdash;the local small business associations always come out and campaign vigorously against me. They were always telling me how good the then opposition, now the government, would be. It is interesting to read an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> headed `Howard's honeymoon is over':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business has grown disenchanted with the Howard Government, with 80 per cent saying policies were either working against them or had not helped at all.</PARA>

There we are from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in the 41 seconds left to me, let me support the member for Moore (Mr Filing) in his comments about Austudy and the disaster that this has caused. It was difficult enough under us. Austudy was never easy. There has been some abuse of it and it should be cleaned up. No-one supports abuse. But this government has taken a sledgehammer to Austudy and has disadvantaged so many people.

These appropriation bills are the hidy holes, where the coalition had attempted to bury the administrative errors and mistakes they made in the August budget papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, a debate has two sides&mdash;or at least I thought so until I heard the debate on these appropriation bills. Where is the other side in this debate? Apart from the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, who introduced these bills, there are, to my reckoning, no coalition speakers. The government members, all bright&hyphen;eyed and bushy&hyphen;tailed little bunnies that they were, lined up last year to speak on the budget, but in this debate they are conspicuous by their absence&mdash;their total lack of enthusiasm to debate us on these bills. Where are they now? They have deserted the field. They have gone into hiding; they have gone to ground in their burrows. Why? Are they under instruction from the government whip not to speak, are they still shell&hyphen;shocked by community reaction to the coalition's budget's measures, or do they think that these appropriation bills are an outbreak of calicivirus?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1434">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, we've got the ferrets out! We are going to whack them down those holes, work them down to those cosy little burrows and drive those cowering little coalition bunnies out of their burrows, out of the shadowlands and into the sharp glare of the sunlight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While speaking on the budget, coalition members condemned us for the budget black hole. They praised their leaders for the great advances made in controlling government expenditure and gazed reverently on the budget papers as if they were tomes of great importance and substantial import. They utterly and absolutely endorsed without condition everything in those August budget papers. Members on the other side said that the changes such as those made to the Austudy means test would ensure that the system would not be rorted as they claimed it had been under the Labor government. Now they are silent on those changes. If they do speak about it, it is within their party room to complain bitterly about the effects on their constituents, who gave them a great whack over the ears during the Christmas break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Welcome to government! Welcome to having to answer for the things that were done in the budget papers. Those constituents&mdash;those who voted so handsomely for the coalition on 2 March&mdash;have been slowly becoming aware of the pettiness and meanness of this government, and are realising that the swingeing ideologically&hyphen;driven cuts in the August budget really do hurt real people, who are now having a good hard think about this lot opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we are in a position to see a little more of the confusion, the deceit or the simple lack of knowledge that was evident in the budget papers delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in August. In those papers he made large cuts across many portfolios without due and careful thought or reason; he cut useful and beneficial programs. They were penny&hyphen;pinching measures by a government that has an ideological obsession with cutting without due thought or reason. I stated then, in my response to the budget, that I believed that the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and a number of other ministers really did not know what they were cutting when they were cutting into those programs. I said that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) did not know what the effects were going to be in her portfolio because, when pressed to answer questions in the House, she was utterly unable to provide any coherent arguments or answers&mdash;she just did not know. The Prime Minister has a recollection problem. The Minister for Family Services, so it seems, has a collection problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget, the Department of Health and Family Services received an overall increase in allocation. That did not mean that all the programs were given increases. Some programs were cut quite harshly in that budget. An example of this is the program for assistance for people with disabilities. It received a cut, as did the housing and crisis accommodation program. These are programs that are not high profile; nor are they subject to the type of intense scrutiny that has often been given to other programs. They are programs that provide assistance to people with disabilities and those in dire need due to extreme personal circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we see that in these appropriation bills these two programs are receiving extra funds of the order of $17 million after $20 million was cut. So the government has saved $3 million for the time being and brought disruption to the lives of those in the community who can least afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Appropriation Bill(No. 4) I find that, for assistance for people with disabilities, the 1995&hyphen;96 program provided in the order of $59 million. That was cut in the Treasurer's 1996&hyphen;97 budget to $52 million. Yet in these bills there is $1.25 million for transition payments to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1435"> states over the Commonwealth&hyphen;State Disability Agreement. One would think that in the preparation of the budget the department and the minister could have made allocation for those transfer payments. Surely that is not something that has come out of the wind, or come up quickly without being able to be predicted fully. Therefore I think it should have been incorporated in the budget papers in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, there is a sum of more than $8 million for paying transfers to the states under the Commonwealth&hyphen;State Disability Agreement. That $8 million brings the level of funding up even further than in the budget papers last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the housing and crisis accommodation area, the supported accommodation assistance program has been increased by $12 million. The argument put forward in the short notes presented by the Minister for Administrative Services argued that there was more work being done more quickly in this program. Surely the distance between last August and now is not so great that that could not have been predicted and incorporated into the original budget program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, in the budget papers last year, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) attempted to show an awful underlying structural deficit instead of using the headline deficit that we would normally use through most years. He used that as an argument to undertake cuts that he claimed were necessary and entirely in line with coalition philosophy. The great argument he put was based on the substantial notion that they knew the public at large would not wear the kind of cuts they were going to get without a substantial reason. He put up what he thought was a substantial reason, bodgie though it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government claims that there was a huge deficit that needed urgent attention. The reality is that they switched the headline and the underlying structural deficit and they switched Labor programs for $7 billion worth of coalition programs. But, in their ERC, they cut and hacked and slashed and burnt in an attempt to drive everything down so that they could have the kind of government they dream of and the kind of government they think is a model for efficiency and openness. This has meant that many people have been forced to suffer entirely unnecessarily in the process. That includes not only individual people and those who could least afford to suffer; major programs were cut on an ideological basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those programs related to the bounty legislation, or the books, boats and bits part of the budget. The government saw the bounty legislation as a typical waste of government money under Labor. They said that it was a waste whilst Labor was in government and that they were not going to continue the program. Unfortunately for them, the business sector did not entirely hold the same views. Industry and business, particularly those who were affected, saw these programs as a way to promote export business and to assist businesses to break into a difficult export area. These programs gave small and medium businesses the opportunity and incentives to compete overseas. It also showed the world that the Australian government had a serious and export oriented industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are companies in this country that have made advances into difficult markets, often in very difficult situations with opposition firms circling like vultures over contracts. With so much against them and with very limited resources available, the bounties provided by the Labor government were the incentive needed by many to make the leap into exporting. More importantly for this country, it enabled them to win those contracts and gain valuable earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the Labor Party's strong and insistent argument in the House of Representatives and the Senate, the government has had to backtrack on the bounty legislation. We think they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1436"> have not gone far enough. They have not supported the book industry, the boat industry or the robotics industry sufficiently. Those industries demonstrated that, with the bounties, they could do good business here and particularly do good business in exporting. They have had to backtrack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A multitude of Labor initiatives have been discarded by this government. The coalition have claimed that many of them were directed at special interest groups and were not needed by the vast majority of the population, especially the conservative heartland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one policy born from the Labor Party that you would think would not come under that rationale. The policy that has been completely discarded is regional development. We know the actuality; every time that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) gets up to answer a question in the House, there is a catcall from the opposition saying, `No. Just transport.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LN6">Mr HATTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is utterly true and apt. Why? Because, with the responsibilities he has in the regional development area, the budget in 1996-97 cut the funding for regional development. He was left with about $5 million to assist with the running of what, we do not know. Maybe it is running the office. It could let those people involved have something to do and to take their time with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this program of regional development was created by the former Labor government in the One Nation and Working Nation programs. Regional development became a way for areas of the country isolated from the mainstream of development to utilise their assets and promote themselves. It gave regions a focus and the support they needed to build some sort of framework to develop and grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome of that government budget cut last year can be readily seen at the federal level when the federal minister responsible met with the states to speak about regional development. There is an enlightening article by David Humphries in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 25 February, from which I wish to quote. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Little wonder, then, that regional development, the old political backburner, is beginning to generate a little heat. The problem for its advocates is that it's mostly disappearing out the spout of political expediency and gobbledegook.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Take a high farce acted out in Canberra on February 7 at the aptly titled "Commonwealth&hyphen;State&hyphen;Territory ministerial meeting on regional development". I say aptly titled because about all the ministers did was meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hendy Cowan, the Western Australian Deputy Premier who plays politics in the bullocking manner he once employed as a handy bush footballer, was so unimpressed he questioned whether it was sensible spending taxpayer dollars resuming such meetings if they were to be just "exchanges of information".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">NSW's Michael Egan questioned the prudence of issuing a post-meeting communique, given that it would reveal the ministers had achieved nothing and attended for no good reason. The communique went ahead, mouthing platitudes about the need for greater co-operation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He finishes with this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument used to be about how money for regional development was spent. Now it's about whether there is any to spend. The Federal Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development, Michael Ronaldson, had a simple answer. "Everything is gone," he told the meeting. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1437">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ronaldson was referring to the $150 million cut from the Federal Government's regional development budget last year, leaving a jokingly paltry $5 million a year for just the next two years. This helps employ what is left of the Federal Department of Regional Development, a rump of six staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal spending on regional development is now less than a dollar a person a year in regional Australia. And this from a Federal Government swept to power on a swing registered most profoundly in the bush. The Feds' explanation is they have no constitutional role in regional development.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to argue that, despite that and what they have said to the states and despite the fact that there was an entirely farcical meeting between the responsible state ministers and the federal minister&mdash;and they really were there about nothing because there was simply no funding&mdash;a couple of ministers in the government, such as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, have a slush fund that they work up and which they are responsible for. There is no oversight of it. They do not have to give any credit to anyone in the parliament as to how those funds are spent. It is somewhat anomalous that, while they have cut the federal Department of Transport and Regional Development, effectively the slush funds for regional development have been handed to two coalition ministers to spend as they wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August, the Treasurer said that he was going to make the government more efficient and streamline government  programs. Of course, his primer of economic efficiency was something he initiated himself, the National Commission of Audit. I have labelled that document Fightback mark III. It is Fightback without the GST, at least not yet. In that August budget, inefficient and wasteful programs were to be either eliminated or reduced in their allocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these bills and in recent events, we see what has really happened behind those cuts. In Fightback, the argument was that if there was any cross between the federal government and the states, in any area where there was an overlap the federal government should get out of the game and hand those responsibilities back to the states. In handing them back to the states, they should give them those programs at a 10 per cent discount because there would not be as much administrative work to do. That is pretty mean and spiteful and pretty much in line with what they have done to the Australian people at large. The great federalists have given the states some of their new corner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that in the legal aid area the states have responded to the coalition bringing in their philosophy full bore. The federal Attorney-General (Mr Williams) yesterday, according to a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by Jodie Brough, ruled out increasing legal aid funding after a state counterpart ridiculed a desperate attempt to persuade the states to contract their services to the Commonwealth. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan was revealed in an extraordinary leaked letter by the West Australian Attorney-General, Mr Peter Foss&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">a coalition person&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who labelled Budget cuts to legal aid of $120 million as "reprehensible" and Mr Williams's peace proposal as "quite offensive".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are harsh words from one coalition state minister to a federal minister. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Williams's proposal followed States' threats to walk out of the national legal aid network and set up their own services for cases under State law, in response to Mr Williams's decision not to fund State cases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The core of this problem for the coalition is that they knew and understood what they wanted to do and they went ahead and did it. The states are arguing very strongly that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1438"> Commonwealth should take up its responsibilities. If Mr Williams got his way, the states would pull out of funding those cases and it would cost the federal government much more to run their own program. We see in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) the coalition emerging from the shadowlands and into a bit of sunlight. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the election last year, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when asked about his vision of Australia and his role for Australians, used the words `comfortable and relaxed' about our present, our past and our future. He was giving the impression that, if the coalition were elected, people could be relaxed and comfortable. That is quite fascinating, because this government is probably the most radical government that we have seen in this century. That may sound contradictory, because the impression they would try to give is that they are somehow for no change. The impression given at the election was that the only two points of difference between the coalition and Labor were on industrial relations and Telstra. It was a `me too' election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In actual practice, the government is really quite radical. I want to go through some of those radical areas so that people can fully understand the degree of difference. I am actually quite convinced that members of the government themselves do not even understand how radical the government is. There is always a danger in public office of believing your own propaganda. At times, I think government members are victims of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I want to talk about the supposed budget deficit. We had an awful lot of hype in the lead&hyphen;up to the budget or immediately after the election about the state of the nation's accounts and affairs. We had projections of  various levels, such as $6 billion, $8 billion and now $10 billion, of a supposed deficit. The implication from that was that somehow the previous government had overspent, wasted all this money and were leaving a debt in dollars to be passed on. We all know, as did all the economists, that the differences being talked about were differences between projections and forecasts and actual events. As we know, if growth increases by more or less than one per cent per year, it will probably cost the budget, at the bottom line, one or two billion dollars. We all know that. That whole charade was basically about forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In January, the revised budget showed that the forecasts were out by $3 billion. That then makes a very interesting concept. We now have this whole new radical approach. Governments no longer budget on projections, make forecasts and then adjust them. Every time there is a variation to the forecast, it will be due to government mismanagement or waste or government expenditure. So there is no way that the current government can now escape the radical notion that the forecasts they made in August are their mistakes due to their incompetence and misspending. That is the impression they gave and that is the impression the Australian people now have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But an even more radical approach has come forward in recent days from the Bureau of Statistics which, incidentally, will find life difficult with reduced budgets. They are, therefore, looking at ways of saving money. More importantly, they are suggesting a new method to measure the CPI or inflation which would actually discount a range of factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expectations are that that will reduce the CPI effect by a minimum of one per cent per year and possibly greater. That may or may not be more accurate, who knows, but it is a radical change in the notion of how we treat our society, given that a whole range of activities are actually linked to the CPI. The amount pensioners can claim as income and the amount of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1439"> assets they can have before being effected&mdash;all those payments and benefits&mdash;are linked to the CPI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this radical new government is now going to change the CPI and actually change the linkages. On one hand they will pretend this is no change. All they are doing really is adopting the figures of the Bureau of Statistics, but we actually know that what is being done is quite deliberate and simply radical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go through various sections of Australia and see what being comfortable and relaxed actually means to Australians now. Looking at older Australians, there have been radical changes to superannuation whereby people who have been retrenched over the age of 55 are now facing a very real problem: having to deem their rollover&mdash;and in many cases it is quite a small amount&mdash;for up to nine years post&hyphen;retrenchment. These people are looking for work and would rather be in a job, would rather have a decent income, but they do not have a choice. Now the government is seeing them as fair prey for revenue raising. That is a very radical shift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the nursing home system, there has been a cut in budget expenditure of $500 million over four years&mdash;half a billion dollars is being ripped out of the expenditure budgets and the appropriations for residential aged care. Of course, there is talk of an up-front fee. Notionally the figure that has been talked about is $26,000. Anybody who talks to the industry knows that figure does not work. The cost of providing a nursing home bed varies between $50,000 and $75,000, not $26,000. There is no way the industry can provide new beds on an up-front fee of $26,000, given the supposed notional maximum deduction from that of $13,000 over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the fact is there has been a radical change to residential aged care, which has been in place in Australia for a very long time. Previous conservative governments put up capital grants and support for people in residential aged care facilities. This new government, the one that is comfortable and relaxed and the one the people should feel comfortable about, has changed decades and decades of practice in the support of aged Australians. That is a radical change and it has enormous implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the opposition members know just yet how serious it is. They will find out eventually when they find the up&hyphen;front fees being asked for are $80,000, $100,000 or $120,000 and that, out of those people who are seeking accommodation, the ones with the most money will get the access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will put pressure on families in terms of having their parents not going into a nursing home, on finding the money to put their parents into a nursing home. How do they raise it? Do they mortgage their own houses so their parents can get in when they do not have assets? The idea that somehow people with no money will get in is a nonsense. How can they? Who is going to pay? Who is going to provide the capital?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the figures that have been provided, on the charges that are involved, there is no way a nursing home can have extra funds to provide beds for people who cannot make a contribution. So the idea of equity, which has been a longstanding Australian principle, will be gone. That is a radical change. As I said, it will be some time before those opposite understand it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, there are proposals for home and community care. Take, for example, neighbour A, where people in the community volunteer to visit people who are living at home by themselves, who are frail, who are aged, who have a disability, who are housebound or who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1440"> are isolated. We have volunteers who go and visit them to give them company or who may take them out for a picnic, for a drive, to visit a shopping centre or anything at all. It gives them some social experience and a bit more depth to their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal now for home and community care is that user pays&mdash;there will be a charge of 20 per cent. This means that a person who requires those services is going to have to pay to get a volunteer to come and talk to them. What a nonsense. What a radical change. The whole idea of volunteering is that people come because they want to, the people they are visiting are being visited because people want to visit them, not because they are being paid to. The nature of the whole home and community care program, the future of how we treat our people who are more isolated, is being transformed&mdash;again, in ignorance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing the changes as well in the health system, which is going to have a profound effect on older Australians. So those older Australians who felt the election of a coalition government would give them some comfort, some relaxation and some stability, if you like, are experiencing a very rude shock because, as I said earlier, they really have the most radical government in many decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the other end of the spectrum at young Australians. Many young Australians voted for the coalition government in 1996. What have they found? Are there any reasons for them to be comfortable and relaxed? There are not many at all. If you look at what they are experiencing, there is the absolute debacle in Austudy. I and all members of the parliament&mdash;both in opposition and in government&mdash;have been besieged by young people either in university or in full-time education or by those about to enter it suddenly being told that they will not be entitled to income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had young women in my office in tears in the last week absolutely desperate to try to be educated but cannot be because of their family circumstances&mdash;a family breakdown, income, relationships or emotional dysfunctionality between their parents. One young woman in particular is absolutely distressed and will not be able to enrol in full-time education. She will have to change her whole life direction, a radical change for her. Why? She has to change it because of a radical change to the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was entitled to support. She needs support to become a productive and worthwhile member of our community. She requires support to become educated. She will not get it. So she will be forced to sink back into working in a position for which she is overendowed with both intellect and ability. She will not be able to develop her skills because this government is saying, `You don't deserve the support.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, we are looking at $3&half; billion worth of cuts to higher education in the next four years. It is important to understand in amongst this that the growth rate of higher education was an important factor in the previous decade. The introduction of higher education charges and fees was to allow it to grow faster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the HECS system, there is currently over $3 billion of accumulated contributions that have been paid off by people as they reached a reasonable income level. In other words, they were paying towards their education. So the idea that somehow it was taxpayers who were funding this, as we heard in the parliament yesterday from the Prime Minister, was always a lie. It was always untrue because the introduction of HECS allowed a faster rate of growth for higher education than other forms of expenditure because the people who were benefiting were contributing to it in a major way. That was a constructive and positive change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1441">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia we will see Australian universities costing more than full&hyphen;fee paying universities in America. We will see the idea of access to education as a matter for the elite or for the privileged. Within five or six years, we are looking at being desperately short of science teachers. What a nonsense! For a country of our educational standards, for a country of our expectations and living standards, to be able to sit and predict a shortage of science teachers in our high schools is an appalling indictment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been part of the cause for it? Part of it was a grab for money, a lifting in HECS charges on the grounds that science would be a higher paying occupation. That never was true and never will be true, but it told young Australians a very clear message: do not go to science. So they are not. Universities around Australia are seeing dropping enrolments across the board, but particularly in areas where the higher education charge increases have been most affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are seeing $3&half; billion worth of cuts across the higher education sector. Who is carrying it? The young people are carrying it, like that woman in my office last Friday afternoon who was in tears and back there again on Monday morning in tears asking me desperately, `What can I do?' I said, `I'm sorry. I can't help. The government's made a decision. It's been through the parliament and the rules are being applied. There is no answer.' That is who is paying for it. That is where the savings are coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you hear the government boasting about its savings, it is important to think of whose savings they are. They are the savings of people who have nothing. They are the savings of people who now do not get support, but these short-term savings will provide very long-term costs, and that is the radical change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a new definition of families for people on benefits of any form. We understand that people who rent get some rent support in various circumstances, but we now have a new system. If two single people share accommodation and pay the same amount as they would pay if they were renting singularly, they now get a different rent allowance. They are now seen as being a new kind of family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We suddenly have this new notion that, because they pay the same money whether it be $50 a week each in a unit by themselves or in accommodation which they share, somehow they are a family and have lower costs. This is a whole new radical change to how we see families. I can see a new thing in the future for taxation or other benefits for people who share accommodation and are treated as a new family unit, an economic family. It is a pretty radical notion, but it has actually been done. It is happening right now. Rent assistance has been reduced right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We look also then at the changes to families in terms of this new government. We look at things like housing, access to public housing. The enormous changes being proposed there will rip away completely the capital program so that the state housing departments will rely solely on rent and some kind of market relationship. It is an enormous change but, at the same time, they are also removing the Commonwealth's role in planning and direction. So access to housing for young people will disappear. Forget it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen to the subprogram supported accommodation, which has been part of the housing portfolio? In this new world the Commonwealth abdicates responsibility, all those special programs where the Commonwealth has put in tied funds and special funds in the housing programs will disappear. What is more, there will be a transfer to the states of a range 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1442"> of other services. This is not about federalism; this is about abdication. So we are seeing the most radical shifts in responsibility ever imagined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transfer to the state governments of all health, education, aged care and disabilities is across the board and the Commonwealth will then ignore them. A good example of this was the Star program&mdash;the students at risk program&mdash;which was a Commonwealth initiative. It was an extra program where extra funds were provided to education departments to help young people from dysfunctional families who were at risk of homelessness to stay in education, to give them a chance in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program ran for some years. It was a very small program in money terms and its review was done towards the end of 1995. It was a very good review. It was a very good program with enormous potential. Where has it gone? It has been mainstreamed, broadbanded. It has gone. Now around Australia those teachers who taught in those programs and who taught those young people are saying, `We ain't got nothing to help them with.' Schools no longer have the resources to give the special needs and special support to the young people whose chances in life are so much affected by the fact that their family is dysfunctional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marriage breakdowns, sexual abuse and domestic violence all impact so much on young people. We were trying to give support to them because they needed special support, but that is going. So when we start talking about youth suicides in the future, when we start talking about greater family breakdowns, make no mistake: it does not happen by accident. These things happen in a society where other things are happening. If you rip away the support of people who need help, you get some damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure, there may be a lower budget deficit; there may be a lower national debt in three, four and five years time in dollars; but let me tell you the debt of damaged people we are going to carry into the next generation is going to be enormous. It is growing every day. In our offices we are seeing the anger, the rage, the frustration and the alienation day in and day out. Every day I am getting phone calls and receiving letters. It is going to lead to a huge cost. If one wants to look at what it eventually amounts to, one should look at America where there is so little support for people with difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are heading for is the Americanisation of Australia. That is a radical change because we have never had their notions of social justice; we have had a much more European notion. We are seeing Australia being radicalised and transformed to an American system whereby it is every man, woman and kid for yourselves. If you are big and strong, bright and clever, and come from a wealthy family then you will probably do pretty well. But if you are not that is life, folks, because that is the American model. The right to fail for those who are less able; the right to suffer for those who are less strong; and the right to starve for those who are less wealthy&mdash;that is the American model. For us it is a radical shift. The idea of us being comfortable and relaxed about that is disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just a few examples. I have many more examples in all the other areas of budget expenditure which are equally applicable. This government is the most radical government in decades, and those opposite will eventually come to understand that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add my felicitations to the honourable gentleman from Kiribati. I rise to speak on the additional appropriation bills that are before the Main Committee today and, predictably enough, I wish to wish to turn my attention to the transport and regional development sections of the additional appropriations. The additional amount to be appropriated with respect to the Department of Transport and Regional Development is in the vicinity of $367 million, and all but about $3 million of that relates to the proposed privatisation and associated rearrangements of Australian National.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with some pleasure that I am able to get up here and speak about Australian National because, unfortunately, we have not as yet had an opportunity in this parliament to debate the government's plans with respect to Australian National. It is opportune today to consider the proposals that are, in part, dealt with in these appropriation bills with respect to the future of our national rail line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) announced on 24 November on Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that the government proposed to seek to privatise Australian National either in toto or in bits. It is rather ironic that the minister, after having criticised the former government&mdash;he attacked the former Keating government in June last year during a ministerial statement debate on aviation safety for not coming to the House with major policy statements but rather making major announcements through press conferences or statements on TV&mdash;for this sort of behaviour, then went ahead and did exactly that himself. He chose not to use the forms of the House to make an announcement of the magnitude that is involved with the Australian National privatisation but, rather, sought to make the announcement on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has made three ministerial statements with respect to aviation safety but none with respect to the future of the Australian rail industry. It is long overdue that he come into the House and justify the position that he is adopting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On 15 April last year, the Chairman of Australian National wrote to the minister indicating that the proposed deficit for Australian National for the 1995-96 year, instead of being a projected $26 million, would end up being as high as $106 million. As a result, the minister established the Brew inquiry into the finances and general situation of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to point out that substantial losses or deficits are not uncommon at Australian National. In fact, in the last year of conservative government under Malcolm Fraser, Australian National lost $106 million, which is $192 million in today's dollars; and in the preceding year&mdash;given that 1982-83 was affected by the drought&mdash;the loss was $72 million or $146 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1444"> million in today's figures. So there have been substantial losses in the past, including under conservative governments with National Party transport ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that community service obligations are built into Australian National's obligations. Therefore, some losses will be inevitable, because governments impose on Australian National certain requirements that may not necessarily be capable of being profitable. Labor introduced a range of reforms into Australia's rail system. As the minister has pointed out, the number of workers in Australian National dropped from 13,000 in 1978 to a little under 3,000 now. But what he fails to point out is that the same thing happened across all the state systems as massive changes in work practices and technology reduced the need for labour in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The former government also introduced National Rail as a stand&hyphen;alone interstate rail freight operator. It was effectively forced by the states to separate that out of Australian National in order to get the state involvement and the state track involvement with National Rail. This left Australian National with something of a rump with three major passenger operations&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS>; two major workshop facilities; and a range of other facilities including Tasrail and intrastate freight in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian National had a bad year in 1992-93, largely due to the recession, but in 1993-94 it had its best year for a long time. 1994-95 was not quite so good but, nonetheless, it was still much better than 1991-92 and 1992-93. So the criticisms made of the former minister, Laurie Brereton, that he was fiddling while Rome burned and that Australian National was going out backwards financially at the time of his administration are simply untrue and totally unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Australian National's finances have deteriorated&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;although there is debate about the magnitude. We managed to obtain an executive summary of the Brew report, courtesy of a return to order motion in the Senate. The minister still has not been formally tabled the report of the Brew inquiry in the parliament but it has been provided to the Senate inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Brew found that the losses for 1995-96 would be of the magnitude of $130 million to $148 million and that National Rail's creation had `made it almost impossible for Australian National to operate profitably'. He found that Australian National had a total debt of over $800 million and described Australian National as overstaffed and overcapitalised. He recommended that the government proceed with the former government's plan to establish a separate track infrastructure body to own and operate the rail track; that National Rail should be set up on a purely commercial basis, which it was due to be anyway; and that Australian National's operations and infrastructure be sold off either to state governments or private operators, potentially in bits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On 12 September, a press release from Australian National came to light, which indicated that it was already in the process of starting to sell off some of its businesses. The minister went through a rather convoluted explanation for this saying that this was all as a result of actions of the former government, so do not blame him. But at the same time he was alleging that the former government had done nothing to stem the flow of financial problems at AN. Both of those comments were entirely contradictory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On 26 September it was revealed by the opposition that Mr Brew, shortly after having presented his report, had in some way become entangled with a consortium called the Great Southern Railway which was promoted by Macquarie Bank. Although it is not clear exactly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1445"> what the nature of his relationship was there, he was very quickly disowned by the government in regard to that connection. What is obvious is that, during the course of developing his report and his analysis, Mr Brew was contemplating his future and the possibilities of further work associated with a private operator who may acquire AN. So it is no great surprise that he recommended the privatisation of AN, and obviously he saw that as a possible means of profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you actually read the Brew report itself, you see that it is a very narrow exercise. It is essentially an accounting exercise only. It takes no consideration of the broader factors involved in operating the rail system that AN is charged with operating. It is something that has only recently become obvious because we have only just got hold of a copy of the Brew report. But it certainly does not do anything beyond look at the balance sheet and the profit and loss account of all of the individual sections of AN. It does not look at the bigger picture of how they fit together, what purposes they are there for and how they function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I have indicated, on 24 November the minister announced his privatisation strategy and that he would sell AN either in bits or as a single entity. He stated that AN's total losses were $250 million for 1995-96. This had gone up from $26 million, to $106 million, to between $135 million and $148 million, and now to $250 million. He also announced a so-called $2 billion package to save AN. Both of these figures were entirely fictitious. The $250 million included a figure of $140 million for one-off abnormal items, about $116 million of which related to asset revaluations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, a decline in the value of AN's assets is not a trivial issue, but it is a world apart from an operating loss which can be expected to continue unless something is done. So $140 million was for one-off abnormals and $40 million was an ongoing Commonwealth subsidy to AN which, in effect, is a community service obligation component. It is there as a recognition that AN is effectively obliged to continue operating certain services which are unprofitable and unlikely to become profitable. The actual operating loss for 1995-96 was $69 million&mdash;only $14 million higher than the equivalent loss for the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is not good. Clearly, it needs to be improved. But the minister grossly exaggerated the problems and grossly exaggerated the extent of the financial difficulties of AN in order to justify selling it off. It is important to recognise that rail is subsidised virtually throughout the world, in most cases directly by government. In the case of the United States, the main long&hyphen;haul passenger rail system there, Amtrak, is subsidised to the tune of over $1 billion a year by the public sector. So that is the context in which we need to see this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The $2 billion package was also largely fictitious. An amount of $200&hyphen;odd million of this $2 billion consisted of funds already allocated in the budget, including for things such as Track Australia&mdash;as it was originally called and then subsequently was changed to the National Rail Infrastructure Authority&mdash;which is to own and operate the track. The new government had actually cut the funding proposed for that body which was presented in the previous federal budget under the Keating government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An amount of $50 million was allocated notionally for environmental clean-up and I notice that surfaced again in the additional appropriations. The basis of this assessment was a notional examination of all Australian National sites to determine how much it would cost to do an environmental clean-up of all sites if they had to be sold. No matter what the minister is proposing to do, I think it is fairly unlikely we will see a situation in the immediate future where all sites will cease to be used for railway purposes. Therefore, in my view, the notion that this $50 million has to be paid soon is essentially fictitious.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1446">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Roughly $800 million of the $2 billion package refers to Australian National's debt. This is ludicrous because that debt is already an obligation of the Commonwealth. We are talking here about a pure accounting exercise where the Commonwealth is saying, `We will assume direct responsibility for it.' The Commonwealth as the sole owner of Australian National already had direct responsibility for it in effect. It has simply shifted it from one heading to another. To suggest that some big, marvellous thing has been done here is ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And similarly with superannuation where there is an amount of $580 million for superannuation liabilities. What has happened over many years is that Australian National fully funds its super obligations by paying that into consolidated revenue, and the super obligations are paid on an ongoing basis by the Commonwealth out of consolidated revenue. Because of the fact that privatisation may produce a bunching of superannuation payment obligations by making all the workers redundant&mdash;that is a choice the minister has made&mdash;the Commonwealth has to bear that superannuation obligation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point is that AN has already paid for it. It has already contributed the funds for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no mention of AN's assets in this so-called $2 billion package, which at the last count were valued at over $1 billion. We are supposed to be spending all this money, but the government is not spending it. There is no recognition that, if they are going to privatise and do it properly, they should reap substantial income. There are very few real expenditures in the proposals other than things like the rather paltry amount of $20 million for regional adjustment, which will only be a drop in the ocean in terms of the problems that are likely to be caused for places such as Port Augusta, other parts of South Australia and Tasmania as a result of the changes that will flow from AN's privatisation. It is interesting to see the comments of some of the local figures and representative bodies on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this all demonstrates is that the crisis at AN is three&hyphen;quarters phoney. There is a set of problems. Clearly, a strategy needs to be put in place to get it a bit more back on track. But it has been grossly exaggerated in order to justify the government's desire, for ideological reasons, to get it off the budget and to get rid of any Commonwealth commitment to rail in the budget. That is why it is occurring. This phoney crisis is being beaten up in order to justify it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best illustration of this is the government's proposal to sell its share of National Rail. National Rail has reduced the interstate freight deficit from $350 million to $50 million within the space of four or five years. So, even though AN has deteriorated, the total Commonwealth rail picture looked at as a whole has improved significantly over that time because National Rail has done what it intended to do, which was massively improve interstate freight operations. That is the evidence given by the department of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to a Senate committee in September last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This illustrates the hypocrisy of the government's position. Their only justification for selling AN is that its finances are bleeding it. Yet National Rail, which is broadly on track to commercial viability, as it was intended to be after five years, is going to be sold with no justification. The real reason is to get the rail system out of government, to get rid of community service obligations and government involvement and to take money away from budget obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting that the Grants Commission has provided evidence to the Senate inquiry about the likely consequences of the privatisation of Australian National for grants to the states. Senator Abetz said that Tasmania would get $10 million per year in additional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1447"> grants. The maximum possible that the Grants Commission estimates is $5 million. For South Australia, it estimates a range which starts at minus $0.4 million&mdash;that is, minus $400,000&mdash;up to $16 million per year. So there has been a bit of shifting and slipping on that front as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The potential consequences arising from the privatisation of Australian National are these. About 2,600-odd jobs are under threat. It is very difficult to suggest that all those jobs will remain. In fact, it is reasonable to predict that a lot of them will disappear. The three passenger services&mdash;the Ghan, the Overlander and the Indian Pacific&mdash;are under threat. The current route that the Indian Pacific takes is also under threat, which should be a matter of some interest to the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who is affected by it. If it is re&hyphen;routed through Melbourne, clearly many of the areas that he represents will be disadvantaged as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grain lines in South Australia are under threat, which potentially impacts on wheat farmers in those areas. Tasrail, which is not far short of break even, is clearly under threat. Many of the economic entities that use Tasrail&mdash;the industries in Tasmania that make use of those services&mdash;will potentially have their transport costs increased, which may threaten their viability. The Fingal Valley coalmines are a classic example of relatively marginal operations that may be put out of business if the government is not careful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics that $15 million per year would need to be spent on Tasmanian roads if Tasrail is closed down. Yet the Tasrail deficit is currently only about $6 or $7 million per year. So that shows the economic logic behind privatising or closing down Tasrail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN could be sold in bits, which is a serious problem, because that may involve cherry picking and competitors for things such as buying the workshops, asset stripping them and closing them down and diminishing competition. There may be no further subsidies to things such as passenger services, which places, as I have indicated, the Indian Pacific under threat. There is also the loss of integration benefits and economies of scope that come from having a unified railway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key theme in all this, and the one I will turn to in conclusion, is that there is no overall strategy for rail. We have a fire sale and that is it. All this government is doing is flogging off things. It does not matter whether it is in bits or who will buy it and what they will do with it. They want to get rid of it, get it off the balance sheet and the budget and not worry about what will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We oppose the privatisation of Australian National. Most importantly, our strongest objection to the government's policy is that there is no broad strategic vision for the future of rail. There is no vision about the future of the passenger services or the future of Tasrail and the services it provides to important industries in Tasmania. There is no vision for the role that the grain lines play for farmers in South Australia. There is no vision for the future of Port Augusta as an important regional centre and a rail infrastructure centre in South Australia. There is no vision for the strategic framework in transport and the relationship and balance between road and rail. There is no vision for the intermodal connections between road, rail and shipping. There is none of that; there is simply a fire sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the key issues. What we need in this country is a comprehensive national transport strategy that looks at the total task and the total role of transport. It is important to note, as I noted in the Main Committee on another matter last night, that this government sees transport as a cost. It does not see it as anything else. It is a cost. It does not recognise that the transport industry is a major exporter, particularly through aviation and shipping, that the transport 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1448"> industry is a creator and provider of thousands and thousands of skilled and mostly well&hyphen;paid jobs and that it is, in essence, the arteries of our national economy. It plays a critical role, yet for the narrow&hyphen;minded, short-sighted and ignorant view of the government and the minister it is simply a cost to the people they see as their core constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who will suffer as a result of this view are particularly the workers in Australian National and the direct users of the services of Australian National. In Tasmania, it will be the users of the Tasrail freight services. There are also the grain growers in South Australia and the passengers using the interstate passenger services. More broadly, it will affect the Australian community generally. The rail services that Australian National provides are an important part of the total transport picture. Australian National needs reform and improvement, but it should not be just broken up, sold off and flogged off, with the government pulling right out of any direct involvement in rail or having any strategic vision for the future of rail. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on a number of areas of the government's performance in discussing these appropriation bills before the committee today. I would particularly like to talk about higher education, the government's proposed work for the dole scheme, the proposed abolition of the Commonwealth Employment Service, the government's scheme to increase costs in nursing homes, the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program and the ridiculous delays that the government is causing in getting a solution to the problem of Sydney airport. These are all major issues that affect my electorate of Watson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has certainly stuffed up on higher education charges. Rather than striving to improve the level of education, the government is making access to higher education more difficult with its cuts to university funding and increases in HECS charges. We have already seen the outcome of this in my electorate, with the axing of courses at the St George campus of the University of New South Wales. Because of the government's funding cuts, the University of New South Wales intends closing down that campus. The state minister for education, the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) and I have been lobbying actively to try to get the University of New South Wales or the University of Wollongong to keep this campus open. Neither of them can do it without additional funds from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This campus fulfilled a vital need for the population of south-west Sydney. That is demonstrated by the fact that 70 per cent of the students in the primary education course at that campus came from the St George and Sutherland region. Now those students will have to travel further afield to complete their courses. The state minister, the member for Barton and I are hopeful that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) might see some way of ensuring that this campus does not close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects of the government's policies on higher education will mean that, by the year 2000, each institution will have had a 15 per cent funding cut across the board. Increases to HECS charges will also have a detrimental effect on the number of students from my electorate studying science and engineering due to the government's differential charging system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Labor Party was in government, we invested heavily in creating a high quality education system. We saw the number of students in higher education rise over the 13-year period of our office from approximately 340,000 people in higher education when we came into government to 600,000 when we went out. That is nearly a 50 per cent increase in the number of Australians who were able to access higher education.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1449">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the Liberal Government's present measures, we will see less incentive for students from working class areas to go to university. We will be going back to the 1950s and 1960s. Maybe that is where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) felt comfortable and relaxed, but it certainly is not the place for Australia in the 1990s. By the year 2000, when we will host the Olympics, we hope to be able to say that Australia is the clever country. How will we do that if the government is being so stupid as to make access to higher education as difficult as possible?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also put another disincentive in the way of students with its monumental mistake by Minister Vanstone over the means test for Austudy. This has denied funding to thousands of students. It is a joke that the government says it prides itself on administrative ability while it cannot even get a simple piece of paperwork right. All the minister can do is think up phoney examples of bludgers in the system, as she called them, such as the Wright family. She could not even get that right, because that was a fiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For most of her work, the Prime Minister seemed to reward this minister with a bottle of champagne. I think the reward she got the other day from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) of a bottle of vinegar was more appropriate to the approach that this minister has taken with higher education and the ability of young people to go to university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With universities going back to work next week, it will be a sad commentary on the system to know that it took so long for Senator Vanstone to recognise the obvious deficiencies in the Austudy means test. She says that she is sorry. She might be sorry, but it is a pretty sorry state for those young people who did not pursue a career through university because they could not afford to go when they had been stripped of Austudy. It is a bit too late for them to find out now that they can get Austudy, because the universities have accepted other people to fill the places that these young people would have been able to take. A number of parents in my electorate have complained to my office and me personally about the problems that this has created for their families. This is particularly so for migrant parents, who put a very high price and regard on education as a method for their children to get out of the low income jobs that many of them had. Senator Vanstone's approach to this has been deplorable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many areas, the government has been deplorable. What they want to do with employment is another example of their failure to come to grips with the problems in Australian society. Their idea of a quick fix for unemployment by their scheme of making some people work for the dole is really bankrupt. What sort of a solution is this to getting the long-termed unemployed back to work? The long-term unemployed need to acquire skills. When the Labor government was in office, we had programs that helped&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the interruption of the division in the House of Representatives, I was saying how important it is that people who are the long-term unemployed are provided with skills to help them get back into employment. One of the programs the government cut was Skillshare, which was a very important program for giving unemployed people the ability to find work. An analysis was done by the government's favourite economics gurus, Access Economics, and that showed that Skillshare was successful as it made a net contribution to the federal budget. In fact, each year's operation of the Skillshare network created an average net gain to the budget over three years of about $500 per participant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1450">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, one would think, has an obligation to make sure the unemployed have access to schemes which guarantee not just something to take them off the unemployment roles but the acquisition of skills and training which will help them keep jobs. It is clear that the Howard government offers no solution to address unemployment, and the work for the dole scheme is just a very inefficient method of making some people work for the dole and other people not. There is no universality, no reciprocal obligation. It really is a scheme like the Prime Minister decried in the election campaign of a program to have people painting rocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding for job programs that have been redirected from the soon to be abolished CES to private and public sector case managers will also mean a potential rise in unemployment and discrimination of migrants and Aboriginal groups who fear they will be avoided by private job agencies. There is a great concern in my electorate, especially in the city of Canterbury, about this change in the way unemployed people find work, particularly as in the city of Canterbury there are people from over 132 different nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canterbury Skillshare has had its budget cut dramatically causing courses to be cut by half and redundancies within the organisations. This has resulted in decreasing staff morale as people do not know if they have a job after June. It also means that they are going to turn clients away because of the uncertainty that this will cause in that organisation. So much for the Prime Minister's offer to make people feel relaxed and comfortable. He certainly has not made the unemployed people in my electorate, or those trying to provide a service to them, feel relaxed and comfortable at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who have been the hardest hit and the most disadvantaged are those wanting to undertake English language classes. It is cruel of the government to deny people the opportunity to learn the language of their new country. Surely this is a deterrent to new settlers as `learning a common language', according to the government, is the glue to a cohesive nation. If we cannot allow people to take up that glue, how do they become part of the nation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the impact of the new changes with the one stop shop in the welfare area may not take into account the different cultural mixes of some areas. Surely a service needs to be tailored to the clientele. One of the offices that stands to be affected by this in my electorate is the Campsie office of the Department of Social Security. This office is much overworked and understaffed and, according to the 1991 census, 50 per cent of those who use the office come from a non-English speaking background. This means they have very different needs from the people in areas such as the Prime Minister's electorate of Bennelong. Often interpreters have to be used with these clients which means that each service takes longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, most of the clients like to be dealt with face to face because they have problems understanding some of the administrative procedures and their lower language skills make it difficult to understand conversations over the telephone. With the establishment of a one stop shop, the staff at the Campsie Department of Social Security will have to become, unfortunately, jacks of all trades, and that means they will become masters of none. We will find there will be a lot of misunderstanding and confusion, not to mention the lowering once again of the morale of the staff servicing both the CES and the Department of Social Security in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area which also concerns my constituents is the government's disgraceful attack on people wanting to go into nursing homes. The electorate of Watson has the fifth highest number of pensioners over the age of 65 in the Sydney metropolitan area. These people rely on government services and the Labor government provided services for those people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1451">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first years of the Howard government, increases in the costs for the home and community care scheme and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are hitting these pensioners hard. The government is treating senior citizens as second-class citizens, and these are the people who went through the Depression, who fought for this country and who thought that they could at least rely upon the government to help them in their old age. The entry fee to nursing homes is really putting these people's lives at great risk. It is clear that the government has a lack of concern for the wellbeing of older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate office has received many phone calls and letters from the aged in my electorate regarding the changes to the nursing home arrangements. One elderly woman in particular who lives with her husband and unmarried son was very worried about what the nursing home entry charges will mean and asked for it all to be explained in plain English but, if you try to ring up the office of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and ask them, they have no idea. Indeed, when the opposition spokesperson asked the minister to explain this in the House, once again, the minister had no idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if the minister herself only goes on with platitudes, how can we put at rest the worries of older Australians in their 70s and 80s who may need to go into a nursing home? Unfortunately, the government has a very bad record of taking an interest in older Australians, particularly older Australians who do not have very many assets of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of the concerns of my electorate was the way the government axed the Commonwealth dental program. This was a good program introduced by the Labor government in 1993 to help low income earners and pensioners receive better dental care. Before that program was introduced, the only dental care that pensioners and health card holders received was teeth extraction. We wanted to have a better program that allowed people to get dental care that they could not afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, while the Prime Minister is not really interested in this, some people on the government side are. The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Penrith Sun News </EMPHASIS>pictorial some time ago as admitting that `governments sometimes made the wrong decisions', when talking about the Commonwealth dental program. He knows it was wrong to get rid of this program. It is unfortunate that the government wants to ensure that those 500,000 pensioners and unemployed people who were receiving dental care under this program no longer get it. The people who went to the Canterbury Dental Clinic in my electorate will now have to wait up to three years for treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bishop Michael Challen from the Brotherhood of St Laurence wrote to me expressing his concern at the cessation of this program. He said that, because we live in an age where appearance is becoming more and more important, we are also condemning disadvantaged Australians to a second-class existence in terms of other opportunities for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to know what the government says to these people now. What it says, as we all know, is that under this government there are not any real opportunities for disadvantaged people to have employment opportunities. The government is axing programs that provided skills for these disadvantaged and is axing programs that gave them access to employment services. The government is coming up with nothing more than the Prime Minister's crisis management approach of saying, `We're under a lot of attack about what was happening to Senator Woods. We better try to deflect people and the news. So we will come up with a work for the dole scheme.' It is cheap, populist stuff driven by polls; but it does nothing at all to help the unemployed. As Minister Vanstone said, if the government cannot solve the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1452"> unemployed problem, if it does not have a solution to the unemployed problem; where are they?  Where they are is in a lot of trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final issue I would like to raise is the question of Sydney airport. This is another example of this government coming out with platitudes&mdash;not being able to put their money where their mouth is, not being to make a final decision on Sydney airport and not being able to give some certainty to the people who live around Sydney about what is going to happen with this monstrosity in their backyards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the Prime Minister once again saying that people ought to feel relaxed and comfortable, but I can tell you that the three quarters of a million people who are affected by Sydney airport do not feel relaxed and comfortable at all. They felt particularly unrelaxed and uncomfortable when everybody thought the Sydney airport issue had been settled: the previous Labor government had decided that we were going to build an airport at Badgerys Creek; an EIS had been done; and everything seemed to be settled there. But then after the election the government comes up with a proposal for an airport at Holsworthy. So much for bringing the Australian people into their confidence prior to the election, because that would have done the coalition harm in the electorate of Hughes and in that part of south-west Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the election the government comes up with this proposition to have an airport at Holsworthy. Twelve months out we still have not seen that proposition put to bed; we still have not seen the government recognise the stupidity of building an airport on what was a field firing range and an area that has gullies and hills in it. Maybe the government has some piece of new science that allows them to press a button and all the old bombs on the range will explode, the hills will implode and all of a sudden we will have this flat area that will allow them to build an airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat like the naive dreams of previous Liberal governments in the 1950s and 1960s of creating dams using nuclear weapons. That might have been the sort of level of stupidity that has this government thinking about turning the field firing range at Holsworthy into an airport site. Like many of the other answers that this government has to important issues in Australian society, it is a quick fix that will not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that these appropriation bills are an opportunity for members to seriously look at the shortcomings of this government and to seriously look at what needs to happen in Australia. As we come up to the turn of the century, we should be a country that is able to look outward; we should be a country that has great wealth; and we should be able to share that wealth with the people who live here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the response of the government is to wind back government services. This government tries to blame it all on the opposition for the sins of the previous government. They say it was pretty terrible of us to leave a hole in the budget, but now they have managed to have their own $2.7 billion black hole&mdash;a black hole that Treasurer Costello cannot blame on the previous government. It is his own little black hole. He is going to ensure in the next budget that is due later this year that there is further winding back of government services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that Australians are happy to pay taxes if they get value for their money. We must realise in a country the size of this that, if we do not have government providing infrastructure and services in a country as sparse as Australia, the first people to lose will be those in the country. And when the country suffers, the city suffers. We have to approach this in a national perspective. The government's current policies of turning everything back are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1453"> just wasted. They are mean spirited; they are short-sighted; and they are not in the best interests of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the discussion of the two appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4, the views I want to put are views that relate to the harshness of the government's policies and the impact that they have upon the regions which I represent, the Hunter and the Central Coast. Overall, one can see across the matrix of government policies an attack on regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very first action by the government was the abolition of the Department of Housing and Regional Development. Housing particularly is of extreme importance to regional Australia. The availability of low cost housing, the quality of the amenities available, and the movement of people to those lower cost areas are an important part of the function of regional economies; but, more than that, they are an important part of the lifestyle of Australians who live in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional development section of the Department of Housing and Regional Development was amalgamated with the Department of Transport and then abolished so fast that one could almost not comprehend that it could be achieved so quickly. I have never seen a department of government or a division of a department abolished so quickly as happened with regional development. It went from 226 people to three people, almost in a matter of days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the abolition of regional development went the hopes of the 40 regional development organisations that had been established, or were in the process of being established, right around Australia. The regional development organisations, to the areas that did not have them, brought the prospect of a say in government decision making and the hope that there would be some equity in the allocation of federal funds that were available. But, more important than that, they brought the prospect of the development of economic strategies for their particular regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one issue that has angered country Australia so much, it has been the abolition of the Department of Housing and Regional Development and, subsequently, the regional development division of the Department of Transport and Regional Development. The promises that were made about helping regional Australia were thrown to the wind. We have to remember that the now government, during their period in opposition, denigrated the whole concept of regional development. They denigrated the development of regional development organisations. Despite the promises of a change and the tempering of their rhetoric as the election came closer, when they came into government they simply abolished that division and reneged on the undertakings given at election time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it goes much further than that. I hear members of the government talking about the money being spent on the black spots program under road expenditure. The black spots program is a relatively minor one as a component of total roads expenditure. The reality is that this government, in its first budget, chopped some $600 million from the national highway program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is poor solace to come back and say, as I heard the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) say this morning, `But we've got the black spots program back there.' Well, big deal! It is a few million dollars that is simply a fragment of the $600 million that was taken from the national highway program. The point is that 75 per cent of national highway expenditure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1454"> is in country Australia. It has to be, because they are connecting roads outside the capital cities. So it is $600 million out and a few million dollars in&mdash;a betrayal of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we turn to the programs and services that are available to regional Australia, I will talk specifically about the Hunter and the Central Coast of New South Wales&mdash;areas that I represent. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs office in Newcastle is closed. All service has to come from Sydney. That causes enormous inconvenience to people from right up through the Hunter region to the north coast who need the services of the department. The office at Newcastle, which had some 10 people, served not only the vicinity of Newcastle, but everywhere from the Hawkesbury virtually right through to the Tweed&mdash;to the Queensland border.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For country people, for regional Australia, simply having that service available is vastly different to a phone call or a fax to Sydney and then waiting until somebody gets around to responding. The department now says, `Yes, but we send out visiting teams.' Again, you wait for a visiting team of persons to come around, but they cannot make decisions. Newcastle had the ability to make decisions. That is the difference in the quality of service that was available to regional and that is no longer available. In the castigation of the former Labor government that goes on, in parrot fashion, from members of the government, what they cannot move away from is that they have damaged and attacked, or attacked and damaged, regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great credits of the former Labor government was that we regionalised federal government services. We took offices out to where the people who use those services were located. So we had a department of immigration office at Newcastle. The area office for the Department of Employment, Education and Training was in Newcastle, servicing an area from the Hawkesbury up to the Hastings River and west towards the Blue Mountains and, in some parts, beyond the Blue Mountains. It gave a regional service and it managed the Department of Employment, Education and Training offices, and all the CES offices, within the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The jobs that brings into regional Australia helps make up the greatest deficiency of all in regional Australia&mdash;the lack of tertiary employment, and this the boffins in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne do not comprehend. There is a world beyond Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not see it, because he is ensconced on the North Shore, at Kirribilli. He has no conception of what it means to be north of the Harbour Bridge in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retraction of services&mdash;closing CES offices, such as the Belmont office in my electorate, closing Medicare offices, closing the department of immigration office, further reducing the Australian Customs Service to what is really a token level in our region of New South Wales&mdash;impacts upon the people who most need those services. It impacts upon women, because the job opportunities that come from the regionalisation of those services mostly go to women in country Australia. The quality of service impacts upon the people who attend the Department of Social Security, where there is less quality, fewer people, poorer service and longer delays. Similarly, with CES offices closing and fewer people in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, there is poorer service and longer delays, more discomfort and more trouble for people who have to use the services of that department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also now have, as I have said, a token Customs Service. Mr Deputy Chair, you are close to the coastline, in southern Queensland. You know how important the Customs Service is and how important the drug interdiction barrier is. We have 12 Customs officers guarding the New South Wales coastline from the Hawkesbury to the Tweed. At best, it is a token service. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1455"> They get a bit of intelligence sometimes; they can make some recoveries. But in Newcastle, we have 695 foreign vessels coming into the port. There are about 1,450 vessel visits a year. When you take out the domestics&mdash;the local coastal visits&mdash;there are several hundred overseas ships coming in and out of that port, mostly from ports of north Asia, each year. So there are grand opportunities for disposal of contraband or any other products, be they drugs or whatever, because those vessels move up and down the coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear from government members in the Hunter region what a wonderful job the government is doing for the Hunter, how they are really pushing forward with regional development. I have instanced some of the withdrawals, closures and damages that they have created in the Hunter. Let me add one more to the list: the building better cities program, stage 2. That was going to benefit Lake Macquarie City Council in my electorate. But $70 million was provided for Newcastle city under Stage 1 and that has meant the refurbishment of much of the foreshore of Newcastle and the old Honeysuckle rail goods yard. It is revitalising the city of Newcastle&mdash;and when you revitalise the city of Newcastle, you revitalise the surrounding regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who work in the cities are not necessarily the people who live in the cities. Newcastle is the workplace for thousands of people who live in the surrounding region, and vice versa. It is part of a regional economy, so it is $70 million going into that regional economy to upgrade infrastructure, to upgrade public amenity, to open up the foreshore, to construct new buildings and promote a rebirth of the dead heart of a city&mdash;a doughnut city, as we so often see in Western cities. Generating regrowth in the heart of the city throws a spreading benefit out to all the surrounding region, including the Central Coast, because it is all one economy. So the government, with great play, abolishes stage 2 of the building better cities program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same government, when in opposition, panned that program, ridiculed it. What they do not realise, because they have been captivated by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Treasury&hyphen;speak of the Department of the Treasury, is that the building better cities program was really not about helping capital cities&mdash;though some of it was&mdash;but it was extending out into regional Australia. I am tired of this place hearing the kind of rhetoric coming out of ministers who are really picking up the doctrinaire Treasury line of economic rationalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to invest in regional Australia. The greatest investment in regional Australia is the national highway program. It links all of the capital cities, but also all of the regional locations, all the regional towns and centres, along the national grid, enabling Australians to get together, to trade together and share in the economic benefits that are available and the trade and commerce that has developed around it. The attack of the government on regional Australia has been very deeply felt in the region that I represent. That makes it all the more ludicrous to hear members of the government claiming what a wonderful government it is for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interest rates have come down. But for small business they have come down less than half the amount that they have for home borrowers. As far as small businesses are concerned&mdash;it is one of the reasons behind the survey results that came out today&mdash;they do not have the muscle to negotiate with banks to get the kind of reductions that the banks are giving to other clients. Small businesses in regional Australia are getting a minuscule benefit and they do not have any muscle or bargaining power.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1456">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about small business in regional Australia is that 48 per cent of small business does not employ anybody. I say to government members, `Where do you think this massive growth in employment is coming from when, say, 50 per cent of small businesses, in round figures, do not employ anybody?' They are just self&hyphen;traders. They are self&hyphen;employed people&mdash;an electrician, plumber, TV technician or whatever. They are trades people in some sort of service activity. So that means the other 50 per cent have to provide this massive explosion. But on what&mdash;on the basis of 1&half; per pent reduction in interest rates, and in the context of contracting retail demand?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To appreciate what is happening one has only to talk to people in the large shopping centres who are being exploited unbelievably. But when we put a motion, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has done, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> seeking to introduce a bill to amend the Trade Practices Act to strengthen the provisions in respect of unconscionable conduct by landlords in major shopping centres, the government just stands with its hands behind its back and says, `Oh, but that's really a matter for negotiation and developing a code of practice'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not help my constituents in the shopping centres located in my electorate. It certainly does not help them pay the bills when they are captive tenants and are being utterly exploited by landlords. Those tenants have sunk their redundancy package into a small business centre; they cannot get out and they cannot get any help from government. We are the opposition. We cannot pass laws. It is the government members opposite who have got the numbers and they have the power.  When is government going to stop the rhetoric about small business and actually do something to help people in small business? I am tired of hearing tales of suffering from small retailers who have been driven to the wall by rapacious landlords in major shopping centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to what is happening with Medicare and with health services. One can see as clear as crystal in the utterances coming from the government and the arrogance of the current Minister for Health and Family Services that this government is on the same strategy as the Fraser government when they lambasted what was then Medibank. They took the view that Medibank would be the ruination of fee for service and of the private hospital system. They built up expectations in the community's mind that something had to be done about Medibank, even though they had promised they would maintain it. They implicitly said, `We will maintain Medibank', as last year the coalition said, `We will maintain Medicare'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time I speak in this House on this issue I am going to say this over and over and I will watch the faces opposite. Bit by bit, this government is seeking to pull away the pieces of Medicare in a strategy&mdash;on the same lines as were adopted by the Fraser government&mdash;that is designed to bring the Medicare system into disrepute to justify a privatised system of health care. Obviously the government wants our system to finish up along American lines where you have a two class system divided into those who can afford health care and those who cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make one point, and this is where the health funds at the moment have got caught. When those opposite were running that campaign about why you needed to be in a private health insurance fund, according to them it was because the quality of care in public hospitals was supposed to be abysmal. The message was that you could not possibly contemplate suddenly becoming ill and going into a public hospital with enormous wards containing 25 or 50 beds. We were told that a woman who is sick needed privacy and here she was lined up in a ward with 25 beds on one side and 25 beds on the other side. She would have no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1457"> doctor of choice, would hear pans clanging, bottles banging, people coming and going. The message those opposite put out was that a person could not possibly cope with that standard of care in a public ward, and that was what Medibank was about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private health insurance funds built up their empires around the great media campaigns they conducted and linked to that was that you had to have a doctor of choice. Well, when you have a heart attack, you do not suddenly rush out first and get the phone book and say, `Who can I ring and what's the best deal I can get?' You cannot say, `I know my doctor will be there because he has been waiting for me to have a heart attack'. The same argument applies if I am in a car crash or any other emergency&mdash;and most health care arises from an emergency; the other planned care is different. But in the intervening period when the funds have run all of those ads&mdash;and they do not run them much today&mdash;what has happened in our regions is that the standard of public hospital care has vastly improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I go into John Hunter Hospital, one of our top technology hospitals in the Hunter region which is servicing the area almost up to the Queensland border, I am aware that about 20 per cent of its patients come from outside the region because it is a centre of excellence. The wards are designed for four or six persons. It is a dignified, high quality hospital and with a high standard of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health insurance funds cannot run the line now that it is a terrible situation to be placed into care in a public ward of a public hospital; what a disgraceful situation to be placed in. The quality of care is so much better. And they cannot really run that line now about not having a doctor of choice. You notice that that is not on there so much. Now they are running the other story saying, `We will go broke! Fewer than one in three persons in this country contributes to private health insurance.' Why? Because they are not fools; they realise they are not getting value. More people have been in the public hospital for treatment and care. I get this repeatedly in my electorate, I hear people on the radio, I see letters to the editor and I meet people at functions. They have such compliments to make about the standard of care, how good it was and how good the specialists were at John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is different. It has become tougher and tougher for the health insurance funds to sell that bag of goods that they have gotten away with for so long, with the result that more people leave and fewer people are left to pay the costs that have to be paid out in respect of health care. The solution is not to try and force people into private health insurance companies or funds; the solution is to further improve the public hospital system. But looking at these bills and looking at the budget overall, for this government and the Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge) to be out there carrying on the way they do and criticising the system; lambasting people who have exercised their discretion in making a tough decision, with the income that they have available to them, to opt out of voluntary health insurance funds; criticising them when they realise that there is no value for them, I think it is odious and dishonest. They are pretending to aged people that they need to be in a private health insurance fund. No matter what their level of income is, to go on with that line is a total misrepresentation and an act of dishonesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I conclude in these few seconds, Madam Deputy Speaker, let may say that that debate has yet to be run and we will do everything possible to ensure that this government does not dismantle Medicare as, I am sure, it is intent upon doing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity today, particularly given that there are changes to funding for the arts, to outline what might be a stocktake of the Howard government's performance to date in the area of the arts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to recognise that during the election campaign, the Liberal Party's arts policy statement was very clear. It was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">For Art's Sake&mdash;A Fair Go</EMPHASIS> and released by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in February of 1996. It clearly promised, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will not only maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the arts, but it is committed to new spending initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the press release that accompanied the Prime Minister's statement he pledged, and I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to maintain the existing level of Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and, furthermore, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to provide $60 million over three years for initiatives which will provide greater public access to the arts and encourage young and emerging artists.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, they will maintain the existing level and add a further $60 million&mdash;a very generous offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But by any measure, the Liberals have broken this core promise to the arts community&mdash;both elements of it. If you look at the 1996&hyphen;97 budget for the arts and culture through the Department of Communications and the Arts, excluding departmental running costs, which were also reduced I might say, that amounts to $393.4 million. This is down from $451.73 million, a reduction of 13 per cent or $58 million overall. So much for maintaining the level of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take the additional coalition pledge of more&mdash;$60 million over three years factored in&mdash;then funding this financial year is $78 million short of the pre&hyphen;election undertakings. There have been a couple of changes&mdash;I might say they are arbitrary ones&mdash;to that budget but that, by and large, is the position today. That is without taking into account the undoubted impact on arts and culture of cuts to the ABC and to ATSIC, and the added pressure on running costs for performing arts organisations of imminent award improvements for entertainment industry employees which the minister knew were in the pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the coalition has broken a series of promises and abolished a number of arts initiatives of the former government&mdash;it appears simply because they were from the former government&mdash;and it has implemented some of its more modest arts promises, but their value falls well short of the cuts and broken promises that have been part of the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to touch on a couple of these cuts before going into some detail on one of the meanest of them all and that is the cuts to public lending rights and education lending rights. The Liberals, when in opposition, promised to continue to recognise and support the Australia Council as a primary administrator of Commonwealth arts funding. But, regrettably, this recognition and support which, for the moment, does not even extend to getting a new chairperson for the Australia Council, did not extend to funding which has actually been cut by $16.4 million over four years. So, it is supported, but with a lot of the stays pulled out from underneath it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is despite Senator Alston's claim or challenge that, while on paper it might look as though the Australia Council is losing money, in fact it is not, as he said it was losing responsibility commensurate with the amount going elsewhere. For a while, the arts community swallowed that line, but they are now very clear about it, as they find that their allocations 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1459"> are actually having to be reduced by&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;pretty much the amount indicated by that loss of base funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take, for instance, the Major Organisations Board, which comes under the aegis of the Australia Council and provides triennial funding for 17 major arts companies. Again, the Liberals, when in opposition, claimed that a coalition government would at least maintain the existing level of financial support for the Major Organisations Board. But that board is now experiencing cuts of about $250,000 in this financial year, and this again clearly breaks the coalition's promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the four state opera companies&mdash;now reduced to three, courtesy of Jeff Kennett in Victoria&mdash;were encouraged to join the Major Organisations Board, but not at the expense of existing funding arrangements. In the budget we have just seen, there are no additional funds for these companies to join the Major Organisations Board, and the government has clearly failed to deliver on the promise to the state opera companies in terms of funding, as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, when in opposition, also claimed to be strong supporters of the idea of triennial funding, and said that the coalition `has for many years been a supporter of triennial funding for major arts organisations', and that the coalition has `long recognised the need for greater security in arts funding to enable major organisations to plan with certainty.' I agree with both of those sentiments; but, in slashing the Australia Council's budget part way through the triennium&mdash;which is what has happened, taking $16.4 million out&mdash;the coalition has actually abandoned the key principle of benefit in triennial funding; that is, certainty. There is no certainty at all now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition also promised to examine the need to extend triennial funding to major arts education institutions, such as the National Institution of Dramatic Art, the Australian Ballet School and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. That is not being delivered, either. Indeed, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School had its funding cut by nearly five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been a number of cuts to our major national institutions, such as the National Museum of Australia. The government is still fiddling around with funding for a new museum. It has made a commitment, but that does not appear anywhere in either the previous budget documents or the revised estimates. We are yet to know where the $100 million is coming from or whether, indeed, it will be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been cuts to the National Gallery, the National Maritime Museum, the National Library, and the National Film and Sound Archive, which has particular reason for complaint. There was a plan to construct a new, purpose built facility for the National Film and Sound Archive, and those who have not been to have a look at the existing facility should do so, because they would be ashamed that the proposal budgeted for in 1995&hyphen;96 has actually been scrapped, despite considerable expenditure already on planning and design work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Film and Sound Archive is not actually a safe place to work, let alone a safe place to store the very important material that it stocks. No allocation has been made for alternatives to the construction project, and the staff will have to continue to endure some very appalling working conditions. The Australian Archives also experienced reduction, as did the other agencies; but, in their case, the cuts have been compounded by fixed property expenses and the fact that the remainder of the budget is principally salaries, and so they have very little discretion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1460">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk briefly, too, about the film and television area because, as well as having cuts in the budget, we have had the Gonski review&mdash;which, once people had a good look at it, produced a considerable level of alarm in the film and television area. Again, we had a pledge being made by the then opposition and now government to maintain the existing level of Commonwealth funding for Australia's film industry and industry bodies&mdash;a very clear statement. But that promise, too, has been broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Film industry bodies, including the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, Film Australia, the Australian Film Commission and the Film Finance Corporation, received $90.2 million in 1995&hyphen;96, and that is excluding the commercial television production fund. Under this current budget, funding for the industry fell to $84 million, a cut of seven per cent. The specific cuts included 4.9 per cent from the Australian Film and Television School, three per cent from the Film Finance Corporation, three per cent from the commercial television production fund, and a whacking 20 per cent from the Australian Film Commission. Hardest hit under the Australian Film Commission was the special production fund to develop new projects. Cutting off the lifeblood of new work does not seem like a very smart way to treat the arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gonski's review, while it reassured people to the extent that he said that there should be no further reductions in funding for film and television, had a series of recommendations which would again see that creative spark of the young film producer nipped in the bud because he recommended that screen culture funding be reduced from $3 million to $1 million and that those savings be transferred to a special production fund. Why this should be the case is anyone's guess. The argument in Gonski is very shoddy I would have to say and the cuts to screen culture funding will result in defunding the screen culture resource organisations like Open Channel, Metro Television, the Film and Television Institute in my own state, Brisbane Independent Filmmakers, the Media Resource Centre. These are all organisations that cultivate new workers in the field, whether they are scriptwriters, directors and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very shortsighted if the government accepts that recommendation and I hope that they will not, especially given the cuts to the ABC and the recommendations by Mansfield that there be outsourcing of ABC drama and documentary work which will have a devastating effect on the development of new workers in the field&mdash;a role that the ABC often does thanklessly&mdash;its workers then being pinched (if I can use that term) by the commercial television producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak in the time left available to me about, as I said, one of the really miserable acts of this government. It cannot be justified on the grounds of the so-called black hole&mdash;this furphy that we have been asked to believe in&mdash;because no-one is actually clear how much money it really saves but the abolition of education lending rights and the windback of public lending rights, I think, deserves special condemnation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the pleasure earlier this year of speaking during the Sydney Festival&mdash;the Sydney Writers Festival&mdash;and I can tell you the writers throughout Australia are up in arms about this measure. I want to begin by on this issue quoting former New South Wales Liberal Senator Peter Baume, someone I don't quote as a rule I would have to say. He once said in a parliamentary debate that `one of the marks of a civilised society is surely the extent to which it is involved in the arts and values its culture and cultural activity'. I would have to say that the Howard government's changes to the public lending rights scheme and its abandonment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1461"> of education lending rights is indeed, as Senator Baume said, a very clear measure of the value it places on cultural activity&mdash;in other words, practically zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am sure most members know, public lending rights were introduced to compensate authors and publishers for income lost for the public benefit of their books being available on loan through public libraries. In other words, they recognised that it benefited the community but the authors were getting no recompense financially because their books were not being purchased. I am sure we all agree that it is necessary that Australians, no matter what their means, have access to books in this way&mdash;no-one is complaining about that. But it is also necessary to recognise that authors should be compensated, albeit modestly as the program did, for their loss of potential income. Compensation schemes of this kind were first introduced into Scandinavia in the 1940s. In the English speaking world the scheme was pioneered by New Zealand in 1973, followed by Australia under Whitlam in 1974 and the United Kingdom in 1979 and it has subsequently spread throughout much of the world. As I indicated, it was Gough Whitlam who implemented the public lending rights scheme in 1974 following recommendations by the Literature Board of the then Australia Council for the Arts. The board had undertaken a study of the concept at the direction of the new Prime Minister after he had received representations from a great many authors and publishers, and there was a very strong concerted campaign initiated by the Australian Society of Authors as far back as 1963, so it has a long and honourable history. In 1975 a bill was drafted to give the scheme a statutory base. The sacking of the Whitlam government and the dissolution of parliament saw the bill lapse but it did finally get into law when we got back into government in 1983, having limped along in the interregnum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Susan Ryan announced at Sydney's Nimrod Theatre that Labor would introduce legislation to entrench public lending rights&mdash;something that was actually achieved in 1985&mdash;and  at the time the coalition actually supported it. Interestingly, one of the coalition's reservations about the bill was that it gave the minister power to alter the scheme, including payment rates, by way of a notice in the government gazette and without the opportunity for parliamentary review. In fact, David Connolly told parliament at that time that the provision raised the prospect of steps by any future minister of any future government effectively to emasculate this program without going anywhere near parliament&mdash;something the minister has just done! He was very prescient, indeed, because Senator Alston used that device to change the scheme without consulting authors, without consulting the public lending rights advisory committee or the parliament&mdash;unilateral action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had further announced in 1994 in Creative Nation that we would extend the public lending rights scheme to education libraries and actually set aside $750,000 for that purpose for this last financial year which was to be its first year of operation. That was also cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to public lending rights are particularly miserable. Authors were informed about the changes to the public lending rights scheme in a most unsatisfactory way. They were told more than a week after the budget was brought down at a time of much trumpeting by the minister about the government's allocation for the arts. He was saying how wonderfully they had done yet, meanwhile, he slipped this very nasty decision through in a bureaucratic letter. There was no announcement by the minister of the changes, just a four-paragraph, highly political and fatuous letter from a bureaucrat who said, amongst other things, and with masterful understatement, that `tight fiscal constraints' necessitated `changes' to education lending rights. That is the most interesting way of saying that the scheme had been killed stone dead! There was nothing left of it. `Changes' is right.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1462">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter also said that the changes to public lending rights were to `update and streamline its operation' and to `maintain the integrity of public lending rights'. The authors around Australia were really angry at the tone of the letter and the fact that it did not come from the minister. I guess they felt a great sense of relief to be reassured that it was something to `maintain the integrity' and `update and streamline' the scheme when what it looked like was a very ill-conceived and poorly executed cost cutting measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know&mdash;I hope members know&mdash;there were payments available across the board no matter how much you got from the public lending rights scheme. What the minister did was to cease payments of less than $50 per book because, in Senator Alston's words during the estimates committee debate on this, `the administrative costs might outweigh the benefit'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the recipients do not share that view. They are often on very low incomes, indeed. Fifty dollars is $50; $45 is $45. While the minister's office sought to suggest that only a handful of people would be affected by the changes, when we questioned him in estimates it was made very clear that some 646 payments in the last year were for less than $50. Interestingly, even if that is an inefficient way of making payments&mdash;small cheque by small cheque&mdash;the government, at the same time, also ruled out accumulating amounts of less than $50 over more than one financial year to the point where it is cost effective to process the cheque. So the argument about cost effectiveness has to be seen as purely disingenuous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also pretty hard to see any rationale, other than the ideologically driven cost cutting, for the decision to scrap payments for books which have been out of print for more than 25 years. In other words, if you are an author who happens to have written a book 25 years ago and it is still being borrowed&mdash;in other words, it is popular, well read and well regarded&mdash;suddenly you do not get any more from the scheme. As the Australian Society of Authors points out, this is like a punishment for success. It is particularly harsh on the older writers for whom this is the closest thing to superannuation that they have. They may well have stopped writing. They may not be producing more material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final element was the scrapping of payments to estates, to descendants and spouses of deceased authors. That is clearly unjust, particularly in the case of a spouse where this may be the only source of superannuation or income that they have from the person who is now deceased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It so incensed the writers of Australia that they had a special discussion of this during the Sydney Writers' Festival and in their press release they said very clearly what they thought of it. It is headed, `You can't eat an Order of Australia'. In other words, a lot of these authors are so well regarded that they have gongs of various descriptions but no money from the government to go with it. They issued this declaration&mdash;the lending right declaration. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the introduction of public lending rights in 1975 the Australian government recognised the right of book creators to be recompensed for the use of their books in the public library system. This recognition was extended in 1994 to cover educational libraries through the Educational Lending Rights Scheme. Over recent months, lending rights have been seriously jeopardised. In the 1996 budget, the federal government stopped the Educational Lending Rights Scheme before any payments were made. At the same time, changes to the Public Lending Rights Scheme reduced the number of eligible books and the number of eligible creators. These changes undermined the very nature of the Public Lending Rights Scheme. We, the undersigned, affirm that lending right is not a grant or a form of literary alms giving, it is a legitimate entitlement that should not be taken away.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As an aside, I indicate that I very strongly endorse that point of view. They went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1463">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call upon the Australian government to reinstate both the Educational Lending Rights Scheme and those areas of the Public Lending Rights Scheme which have recently been cut.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those writers were chosen because they are all writers affected by the 25&hyphen;year rule. They are all writers still being read and borrowed from our public libraries. They are all writers mortally offended, and rightly so, by the actions of the arts minister and this government. These writers, I think, are quite within their rights to now regard the government as one whose word cannot be trusted and which has, in former Senator Baume's words, no interest in the arts or in the value of the arts to our culture. Otherwise, why would you treat these authors in this way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme itself is very modest, even at the stage that these cuts were made. From recollection, you are only talking about $4.5 to $5 million, and the minister was not even able to tell the Senate estimates committee what savings would result from these measures that he had introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the approach that the minister and the government have taken to the whole area of the arts, I think it is very clear indeed that they have no regard for these things, whether it is through the Australia Council, the public lending rights cuts, the cuts to films, the cuts to the ABC and further cuts contemplated in the ABC's television production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said to the Sydney writers when I spoke to them in January that they would be asked to believe in the 1996 B&hyphen;grade movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Black Hole is Going to Get You</EMPHASIS> as a justification for these cuts. And they have been. As I say, there is no such justification in this case and indeed not in others either. This black hole has been proffered as the reason for many of the coalition budget cuts, including those to education and public lending rights, but it has been pretty selective. This black hole has been pretty selective in its consumption patterns. It consumed the ABC, it consumed ATSIC and it consumed the Australia Council. It consumed Australian authors, but it did not consume the defence budget or the diesel fuel rebate, and it did not consume Tasmania's Axemen's Hall of Fame. It also has not consumed the AFL Hall of Fame, which has been given a million dollars recently. So it is a very selective black hole, and I think the authors of Australia have every right to be mortally offended by the attitude of this government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is an omnibus bill which makes a number of uncontroversial amendments to various pieces of legislation. The acts affected are set out in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated with the bill. The amendments really are of a minor policy nature to legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1464"> primarily within the Attorney&hyphen;General's portfolio and related amendments to other legislation, and there are corrections to minor drafting errors and repeal of some spent provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports the bill before the House. I do not propose to take a long time in outlining a few of the amendments that are being put before the House, but I do want to say that amendments have been circulated, to be moved on behalf of the government, and I can indicate that, whilst we will not be opposing the amendments to be moved on behalf of the government, we will be giving consideration to referring those matters to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee for further consideration. Those amendments relate to allowing judges to make rules and to refer matters to judicial registrars for hearing. The initial concern is about the scope of the matters that could be referred and that the courts should not be forced to refer matters to judicial registrars because of resource limitations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter relates to compulsory mediation. It is the opposition's view that that must not be used in cases of power imbalance between the parties, but we trust that the court would apply its discretion appropriately. I just repeat: the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice, Senator Bolkus, may explore those matters further in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the bill before us amends the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 to establish a small taxation claims tribunal and to provide for the reconstitution of the tribunal. It amends the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. It amends the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. It amends the Crimes Act 1914 to correct an incorrect cross&hyphen;reference. There is an amendment to the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to repeal a spent provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an amendment to the Evidence Act 1995 to clarify the admissibility of evidence that relates only to the credibility of a person whose prior statement has been admitted under a hearsay exception and who has not been called to give evidence. It also gives effect to certificates in relation to self&hyphen;incriminating evidence under the New South Wales Evidence Act in proceedings in federal and ACT courts and in prosecutions for Commonwealth and ACT offences. It also makes other amendments, including amendments to correct minor errors in the act and, it notes, to achieve consistency in drafting expression with the New South Wales Evidence Act, and includes further explanatory notes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The omnibus bill also amends the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, as well as the Judiciary Act 1903 to provide the Federal Court with jurisdiction under sections 75 and 76 of the constitution. There are amendments to the Foreign Judgments Act 1991, the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, and the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross&hyphen;vesting) Act 1987. There are amendments to the Privacy Act 1988, the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992, the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe they are all non&hyphen;controversial amendments. It is appropriate&mdash;and it was also a practice of the former government&mdash;to bring them in in terms of an omnibus bill. This is a process which shows that there is an evolution over time with some of these acts. Some of them arise out of particular experiences in courts that are occurring throughout the country and which require a further requirement of legislation. They are non&hyphen;controversial, the opposition supports them and we do not believe there is anything that is sinister in any of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Evidence Act, the explanatory memorandum says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New section 108A restores the generally understood meaning of section 107, namely that evidence relevant only to the credibility of such a person is admissible only to the extent that he or she could have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1465"> been cross&hyphen;examined on a matter relevant only to credit if he or she had given evidence as a witness. It achieves this result by providing that evidence relevant to his or her credibility is not admissible unless it has substantial probative value.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments are not being driven by the government, they are not party&hyphen;political driven, they are driven by conscientious bureaucrats within the various public service departments who are continually monitoring legislation, continually monitoring court cases, and continually on the lookout to improve the legislation that governs Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often, the bureaucrats within the various departments do not receive the credit they deserve. Before I came into parliament, after a short stint in private practice as a private solicitor, I went to work with the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, and after that I was a public defender and a legal aid barrister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a commitment to public service and I was surrounded by a raft of people who had a genuine commitment to public service and who were providing professional advice to people charged with serious criminal offences. Too often I think we do not give full recognition to the professionalism of the support structure that we as a parliament receive. If we as politicians in many instances were half as good as those who serve us then we would have a better parliament all around&mdash;and that applies to both sides of the House. But I do have a commitment to public service. I believe that there are professional public servants throughout the system who are serving us well, and this is another classic example: we sometimes get up here to speak and the reality is that if it were not for the advice that we are given we would not know what we are talking about. And that advice is delivered in a professional, non&hyphen;partisan way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I applaud omnibus legislation like this that is continually improving the legislation that is on the statute books. That is not to say that there are not instances, frankly, where those in the Public Service could do with a little bit of on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground experience, because it is one thing to be operating solely within the Public Service but there needs to be an interaction with practitioners on the ground. I commend the bill to the House and say that it does have the support of the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is a real mouthful and as a new member I am interested to hear the reference to it being omnibus legislation. That is a nice, neat, succinct way of describing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as an aside, I checked a dictionary meaning of `law'. It describes the meaning of that word as `a rule of conduct or action prescribed by the supreme governing authority and enforced by a sanction as an edict, decree, order, ordinance, statute or judicial decision.' Of course, the concept of law has spawned a whole array of subcategories: statute law, common law, civil law, canon law, natural law and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was a student at university studying law I had to do jurisprudence, which is the theory of law. I learnt as a result of that course that the prevailing law was supposed to be a reflection of the morals of society. But in the ensuing years I found that jurisprudential 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1466"> theory was just that&mdash;theory&mdash;and that law is often the result of influences that have little to do with morals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the lawyer, `justice' is often partnered, or interchangeable, with the word `equity', but means variously `rightfulness, just dealing of men with each other and women with each other&mdash;and interchangeably, I guess&mdash;the principle of rectitude, of integrity.' It is also one of the cardinal virtues. The great radical English judge Lord Denning once said, `I would rather search for justice than search for certainty.' Throughout history there has certainly been a divergence of views about that quest on the part of judges. Some judges, the late Sir Owen Dixon being one of them, have been very much black&hyphen;letter judges and Lord Denning was of the other variety, but all have been contributing magnificently to our common law and to our jurisprudence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interconnection of the words `law' and `justice' is an aside I mention just to show that the bill does not really have the highfalutin meaning that is given to it, but rather it is directing a practical look at about 16 acts which are said to be in need of amendment. I do not demur from the proposition that they are rightfully being amended in accordance with trends both in the judicial system and the needs and aspirations of society generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am only going to deal with a few of the particular acts in question. Initially I will look at the amendment to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. Advances in technology have brought click&hyphen;on access to a range of viewing options in some films accessed in the home and classification is consequently very difficult. The amendment will place the onus on the applicant to inform the Classification Board of the presence of any aberrant material. The penalty for failure to declare contentious material prior to classification will be automatic de-classification, providing the offending material would have resulted in the film being allocated a different classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also amend the criterion under which the Classification Board must refuse to approve an advertisement for a publication, film or computer game on the grounds that it contains child pornography with the amended criterion in the National Classification Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Administrative Appeals Act 1975 is being amended to establish a small taxation claims tribunal, the purpose of which will be to provide taxpayers who have a tax dispute involving less than $5,000 with the option of a cheaper and more informal mechanism for the resolution of disputes with the ATO. The amount of $5,000 being set by regulation can be varied in the future when it is appropriate to do so, and many bills have that discretion in them as time passes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be a cheaper, more informal and more accessible means of resolving disputes between the commissioner and the ordinary taxpayer and, in my view, it will be a very welcome reform. I am very much in favour of bringing justice as close as possible to the community, particularly in these areas. While the claims are frequently quite small, the anxiousness that they provoke amongst individuals in society is frequently out of all proportion to the size of the claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it is interesting that in my practice as a lawyer, I have noticed that some of the worst cases involved the lowest amounts of money. Many people often get angry over very small amounts of money. This is a means of assisting the resolution of disputes, along with alternative dispute resolution. The latter form of mediation will be an integral part of the process, and that is very much to be applauded. I think it is a useful tool, although I must 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1467"> admit I was initially sceptical of some of the benefits of ADR. I think it has become a useful tool with the passing of time and is certainly not a fad; it is something that is here to stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new tribunal will be under the umbrella of the AAT and, consequently, all of the powers of the AAT and the taxation appeals division will be exercisable by the tribunal. A non-refundable filing fee of $50 will be payable. Those fees have my support. The legislation even gives power to waive those fees in cases of hardship, which I think is commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I do support the establishment of this tribunal. The name is a little odd. I find it does not run trippingly off the tongue and the juxtaposition of the words is a little odd. Perhaps the `taxation small claims tribunal' or the `small claims taxation tribunal' might have been a better way to word it, but that is just a personal view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Family Law Act 1975 is concerned, the bill to amend that act will make a number of drafting and technical amendments which are the consequence of amendments made by the Family Law Reform Act 1995. The amendments will facilitate parents entering into enforceable agreements in relation to all aspects of parental responsibility, including child support, in the one document. Previously, parties contracting out of the Child Support (Assessment) Act had to enter into a child support agreement which could then be registered with the Child Support Agency. If they wanted to deal with parenting issues, they could also enter into a separate agreement, known as a parenting plan, which they could register with the Family Court. The effect of the bill will be to reduce the costs of parties to a marriage breakdown. Instead of a child support agreement and a parenting plan, a single document incorporating the provisions of both will now be capable of registration in both the Family Court and the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further cost saving measure will be brought into effect by the bill. Courts of summary jurisdiction will be able to hear defended child maintenance applications&mdash;so&hyphen;called stage 1 matters&mdash;without the consent of both parties. This represents a reversion to the situation which existed prior to the enactment of the Family Law Reform Act 1995. This is a very good measure. But, if I may say so with the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) present, over a period of time it is going to become even more important for the courts of summary jurisdiction to look carefully at child support matters and to be able to make determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, we have a review process under the Child Support (Assessment) Act which is totally and utterly unsatisfactory, where unsworn evidence is presented. Frequently in the course of my dealings since I have been a member, I have seen fraudulent documents put up to these review processes. The reviewing officer does not have the power to make determinations about those particular documents or the evidence that is presented, and is determining the matters at the review on the basis of material like that. It is totally unsatisfactory. In my view, it is about time we looked at the courts of summary jurisdiction, perhaps establishing a child support tribunal in the future that will be able to determine these things very cheaply, but on oath, so that we do not get these particular situations arising and both parties going away very unhappy and unsatisfied people. At least if they have their day in a cheap court, similar to the Small Claims Tribunal, they will be happier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I applaud the movement to courts of summary jurisdiction in relation to defended child maintenance applications at the stage 1 stage. I can think of a case in my own electorate where, as a result of this bill, a particular party who was denied jurisdiction&mdash;denied access to the courts&mdash;will be able to come back and seek out a recalcitrant non&hyphen;payer. I support these measures, I applaud the trend in the bill and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks mentioned the judicial registrars in the Federal Court and raised the issue of whether there should be any necessity for jurisdiction in matters involving up to $100,000 to be referred to them. I have not discussed this with the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, nor sought particular advice on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding of the way it would work in the Federal Court is that a case would be started in the Federal Court. They have introduced a new system which they refer to as the docket system under which the case will be assigned to a judge. The judge will have sole responsibility for that case except that when this legislation is through the judge will be able to refer a case within the relevant limits to a judicial registrar to be dealing with. On that basis there is no sort of compulsory conferring of jurisdiction at the expense of judges on judicial registrars; it will still be under the control of the judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to mediation he raised not surprisingly the question of why, given the consensual nature of mediation, it should be seen to be the subject of coercion, the subject of an order. I think if you put it into context it is not quite so bad. Often mediation can be seen to be a process that involves consensus in participation and consensus in outcome but there is, so long as there is consensus in outcome, no reason why people should not be compelled to at least sit around the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Federal Court we are mainly dealing with cases of a commercial nature and cases where often the parties will have equal bargaining power. On that basis I think the court would soon be able to determine whether a case is appropriate for an order for mediation and the parties would in any event, the mediation process being consensual in nature, control both the process and the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question has been raised in the past. The Law Council of Australia in a submission some three years ago in relation to court annex mediation suggested the inclusion of a power for a judge to be able to refer matters to mediation without the consent of the parties. The Law Council view was that although the traditional model promotes mediation as a voluntary process, experience in jurisdictions where mediations can be compulsory suggests that satisfactory outcomes can be achieved, notwithstanding that parties have been directed to mediation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sought the views of the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council, NADRAC, specifically on the proposed amendment. The Council advised that mandatory referral to mediation is acceptable in some circumstances despite the parties' initial unwillingness to participate in the process. In some cases the unwillingness of the parties to mediate is not necessarily a good indicator of their capacity to be helped by the process. For example, they may believe that they cannot resolve the dispute themselves but NADRAC's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1469"> view is that with the assistance of a skilled mediator they may be able to achieve a resolution despite their initial misgivings. In this particular area the Chief Justice of the Federal Court has advised me that the court does not anticipate forcing unwilling parties to continue in mediation if the initial reference was unproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) raised some jurisprudential issues at the outset which I will save for another day. He then referred specifically to the small taxation claims tribunal and questioned the appropriateness of the name in particular. I think like most organs of government it will quickly acquire a nickname or an acronym and whether it is called the small taxation claims tribunal, the small claims in taxation tribunal or some other variant will not really matter much. Everyone will know what we are talking about. The name is, in fact despite its length and clumsiness in speech, an accurate description of its function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson also mentioned child support and welcomed a move towards the involvement of courts of summary jurisdiction in the assessment of child support. The child support agency is in fact an agency for which the assistant treasurer is responsible. The review to which the member referred that takes place within the child support agency of an assessment is not the subject of this bill and is not the subject of legislation for which my portfolio has responsibility and therefore that also can be reserved for another day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the circumstances, all the other parts of the bill appear to have the support of both sides of the House and I will cease further comment. I simply commend the bill to the House and, as indicated, I anticipate that there will be government amendments moved in the consideration of detail stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this legislation. It puts into place the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement signed by the New Zealand government and the COAG ministers in mid&hyphen;1996 and it follows a process which was begun by the Labor government back in 1992. It has the effect of providing for mutual recognition of regulatory standards and occupations in both Australia and New Zealand, and it enables enactment of legislation applying uniformly throughout Australia so that two important areas are picked up.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to support the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996. It is a bill all about facilitating free trade by harmonising the regulatory standards that apply to the exchange of goods and workers between Australia and New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is an extension of the Mutual Recognition Act 1992 which enabled the free movement of goods and the recognition of occupations across state and territory borders in Australia. This means that, with specific exceptions, states and territories, and now also New Zealand, recognise each other's regulatory standards with respect to both goods and occupations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill implements the trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement which was signed by the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, premiers and chief ministers at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments held on 14 June 1996. The arrangement was then signed by the Prime Minister of New Zealand in July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill recognises that the trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement was finalised after the release of a discussion paper in April 1995 by the Council of Australian Governments and the government of New Zealand. Like all good legislation, it sought and took into account very extensive feedback, in the form of industry views and the views of different professional organisations representing their workers. This bill therefore represents a great deal of cooperative and commonsense outcomes and, as you have already heard, it is supported by both sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia enjoys an extremely close relationship with New Zealand. For our producers and manufacturers, New Zealand is geographically and culturally close. We have no language barriers and we share a common British colonial heritage which means that our food, our clothing and much of our technology is in common. It can cost less to transfer goods, and indeed even people, between Australia and New Zealand than it costs to transport the same product and people from one side of Australia to the other. The New Zealand market is generally not oversupplied with new products and there are opportunities arising in most segments for Australia and vice versa. This is a bill which is of mutual economic advantage to New Zealand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1472">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealand has a population of 3.64 million, which provides it with a market in Australia roughly six times that of its own domestic market. It is our third largest trading partner and this trans&hyphen;Tasman food trade is now worth more than $1 billion annually. In 1994, Australia was New Zealand's largest export destination. However, Australia was New Zealand's major import source and it has been increasing this lead from its nearest competitor, the European Union, over the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition bill builds on the cooperative and mutually beneficial economic and trade framework which was developed under the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Closer Economic Relations trade agreement. It is a logical extension of that agreement and we expect that the outcomes of this bill will provide a model of cooperation and free trade that others can look at and perhaps emulate throughout the region and then, perhaps, throughout the rest of the world. The Closer Economic Relations trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand has already eliminated tariff barriers to trade between the two countries and it has led to the creation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will specifically allow a person registered to practise an occupation, a profession or a trade in Australia to seek automatic registration to practise the equivalent occupation in New Zealand, or vice versa. An Australian or a New Zealander will simply need to give notice to the relevant registration authority, as well as evidence of their home registration in their own jurisdiction, to be entitled to commence work in an equivalent occupation in the new place. This process should be quite quick and simple. If the activities carried out by practitioners registered in their own jurisdiction are not substantially the same in the other country, a registration authority will impose conditions upon the person's registration in order to achieve some equivalence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medical practitioners are specifically exempt from the operation of this legislation. This is in recognition of the fact that vocational registration in Australia has federal government financial implications through practitioner reimbursement through the Medicare system. The exemption of medical practitioners under this act will not affect existing arrangements relating to the registration rights of New Zealanders and Australian medical practitioners. Under these existing arrangements doctors who are graduates of New Zealand or Australian medical schools are accredited by the Australian Medical Council and they are able to seek registration in any Australian jurisdiction and in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medical practitioners registered in New Zealand but trained in a third country will also continue to be required to sit and pass the Australian Medical Council exams for overseas trained doctors before they can be registered in an Australian jurisdiction. And the reverse applies. Australian registered but third country trained medical practitioners will continue to be required to pass the exams of the Medical Council of New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the sale of goods under the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill, a good that can be legally sold in an Australian jurisdiction will also be able to be sold in New Zealand, and vice versa. This is as long as the goods meet the regulatory requirements for their sale in their home jurisdiction, in other words, where they were manufactured or first imported. This means that producers in Australia will only have to ensure that their products comply with the laws for their sale in Australia. They will then be free to distribute and sell their products in New Zealand without any further testing or assessments&mdash;a great saving in costs and time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1473">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are exclusions to mutual recognition which will safeguard communities on both sides of the Tasman. Laws not covered by the arrangements include customs controls on prohibited goods, tariff measures and anti&hyphen;dumping, intellectual property, non&hyphen;discriminatory taxation and business franchise laws, and relevant international obligations such as wildlife protection and hazard waste disposal issues. Exemptions will cover quarantine laws, laws on endangered species, laws on firearms and indecent material, agricultural and veterinary chemicals, fireworks and gaming machines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banning of products subject to quarantine restrictions exported between Australia and New Zealand is an obvious example of one of the exemption categories in the bill. Australia currently bans the importation of fresh pome fruit such as apples and pears from New Zealand, for example. This is because of the risk of importing the deadly pome fruit disease, apple and pear fire blight. While New Zealand orchards are infected with the fire blight, Australia has so far remained fire blight free. The current quarantine bans which stop the importation of fresh New Zealand apples and pears into this country will remain as long as that quarantine ban remains in place, but there is no restriction on processed apple or pear exported from New Zealand. There the mutuality is complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special exemption would also apply to a number of areas of health and safety regulations where it was considered that mutual recognition would not be appropriate. In these areas the arrangement establishes so&hyphen;called cooperative programs whereby Australia and New Zealand will develop harmonised standards. Special exemptions will apply to therapeutic goods, electromagnetic compatibility standards and radiocommunications equipment, motor vehicles, gas appliances, hazardous substances, industrial chemicals and dangerous goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill opens up opportunities for greater export opportunity for so many sectors in Australia. For example, confectionery and dairy manufacturing should stand to gain substantially. Mutual recognition will permit the sale of Australian low fat ice&hyphen;creams and those containing artificial sweeteners in New Zealand. New Zealand currently has different standards of food solid levels and sweeteners in such products. In Australia the low fat, low energy ice&hyphen;creams, desserts and so on are some of the fastest growing sectors in our markets, and one would expect a similar growth in market share when consumers in New Zealand can also purchase such products, initially from Australia but also when their own domestic production of these products grows. Thus the harmonisation of food standards between Australia and New Zealand opens up greater opportunities for New Zealanders, who will also have access to larger markets, and for Australians, who will have access to market share growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of product safety, where the New Zealand and Australian product safety standards are different these standards will initially be made subject to a temporary exemption. This act provides a mechanism for the temporary exemption of a good or a law relating to a good from the operation of the scheme for a period of 12 months. During this time the relevant ministerial council would determine whether a standard should apply to the goods and, if so, what standard. The Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs will then work towards developing appropriate harmonisation arrangements. If no agreement can be reached on product standards for safety, the product or class of goods can be exempted permanently from the operation of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As already noted, the scheme does not affect laws relating to quarantine, firearms, endangered species and other prohibited imports, nor will the scheme affect Australia's or New 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1474"> Zealand's intellectual property laws, taxation laws or tariff regimes. So it is a win&hyphen;win circumstance all round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of labelling&mdash;another area of considerable concern to both countries as they exchange their goods and services&mdash;the trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement will reduce costs but will not reduce in any way the current protection in relation to false or misleading labelling. The Commonwealth Trade Practices Act 1974 and the New Zealand Fair Trading Act 1986 both prohibit the sale of goods that make a false or misleading representation concerning the origin of the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement, goods must be classified as legally able to be sold in New Zealand, for example, before they can be sold in the other country&mdash;in this case, Australia. A good falsely claiming New Zealand origin would be in breach of the New Zealand Fair Trading Act and hence could not be legally sold in New Zealand. In these circumstances, mutual recognition would simply not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, legislation was passed forming the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. This allowed for a joint food standards setting system for Australia and New Zealand and also provided for the harmonisation of food standards and consumer information on the ingredients for food between the two countries. Thus we have long cooperated in these matters and will continue to reap the mutual benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill should eliminate much of the costs associated with the different requirements in the labelling of such things as poisons, chemicals, solvent or resin labelling requirements. The Food Industry Council of Australia has said that there are substantial economic benefits arising from doing away with the need to relabel Australian goods before they can be exported to, and sold in, New Zealand. The Food Industry Council argues that the New Zealand market is very important to the Australian food industry, and the harmonisation now possible under this bill will substantially assist New Zealand and Australia to better compete in third markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The country of origin labelling laws in both Australia and New Zealand adhere to WTO rules which, in respect of food, require the countries to have in place requirements that are consistent with the international Codex standard. This is made under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. While both countries have WTO consistent arrangements in place, country of origin labelling requirements for food products are to be harmonised by the recently established Australian and New Zealand Food Authority. Thus we will also be consistent with our international obligations under this new arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the government is committed to reviewing the way it regulates Australian industry, to reduce delays and impediments to competition and to enhance commercial prospects for industry. We want to minimise costs and maximise opportunities for our industry to compete and succeed in overseas markets. At the same time, we are determined to maintain a high standard of consumer protection. The bill offers all of those advantages and, as I said before, is a model for what can be achieved both in our region and beyond, in the Northern Hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme reflects the high degree of confidence which exists between Australia and New Zealand in respect of each other's regulations, regulatory systems and decision making processes. It will help to remove regulatory barriers to the movement of goods and services providers across the Tasman. It will enhance our international competitiveness and reduce compliance costs. Therefore, I very strongly support the bill before the House and recommend its swift passage through the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I convey Minister Downer's regrets at not being able to attend to sum up the debate on the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996. Happily, it is a debate that has been free of a lot of contention&mdash;as I understand the previous bill has been, from the words the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) offered in his summing up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) indicated the opposition's support for the bill. He noted exemptions made to the scheme, such as those for medical practitioners, quarantine, endangered species, firearms, dangerous goods and certain other categories, such that those who might have some concerns about a new stage in the free flow of goods and services in the practice of occupations between Australia and New Zealand should have their concerns laid at rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) began by describing the bill and the scheme within it as one that is both cooperative and of great commonsense. She raised a few concerns about labelling and country of origin but noted, with some satisfaction I think, that the protections available under both New Zealand's Fair Trading Act and Australia's Trade Practices Act remain in place within this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, it is obvious that the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill will produce a number of significant benefits for both sides in the agreement. These benefits include a greater choice for consumers, reduced compliance costs for manufacturers, and greater cooperation between the regulatory authorities on both sides. Our two economies are already closely integrated, with extensive trade and a largely unrestricted flow of people, so this sort of agreement should suit that reality very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that a new acronym is going to enter the Australian political lexicon&mdash;I would have thought we had enough already. TTMRA&mdash;I am not sure exactly how that will be pronounced by people within officialdom who have something to do with it, but it may be `titmra' or something like that&mdash;represents a natural extension of our existing close ties with New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said in the past that there are few things more unpleasant within this place than the old salad bar in the members' dining room and debating tax bills. With the salad bar having been changed to something much better, and with fewer tax bills before us, some of the better things within this place now are debating bills and resolutions that pertain to our relations with our cousins in New Zealand and anything to do with free trade. Both those things bring a warm glow to my heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth adding that, in population terms, this scheme will increase the coverage of existing Australian mutual recognition agreements by about 20 per cent. The market of both countries combined will be over 21 million people. This will be very important, not only for the people within both markets, but for our Pacific neighbours&mdash;island states such as Vanuatu, Fiji and Kiribati.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the outset, I should say that I have no objection in principle to the concept of a one&hyphen;stop shop. I am not opposed to the combining of the resources of the current social services offices and the resources of CES offices. But resources are not just the physical offices that we are talking about. They are the human resources, the body of experience, the body of knowledge, the body of caring that has been built up within these Public Service agencies over the years in dealing with what is Australia's major social problem. I refer, of course, to the unacceptably high levels of unemployment in this country which stand at 9.3 per cent nationally and 9.3 per cent in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter what government has been in power, in my electorate, particularly in the area of St Kilda which attracts many younger people who have left home and have often come from dysfunctional backgrounds, the figure is always higher in that portion of my electorate than it is nationally. What is wrong with the minister's second reading speech, and with the bill itself, is not what it purports to say, but what it does not purport to say, because the minister's speech is long on rhetoric but very short on detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it that members supporting the government and this legislation who talk about the need to provide service to their constituents are ignorant of the fact that it is the intention of the government to dismember the CES as we know it? Are they ignorant of the intention to fire, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1477"> without discrimination and across the board, people with long experience in dealing face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face with the range of human and social problems of the young unemployed, and the old unemployed, in order to refer&mdash;as a result of their ideological position&mdash;this very important social question to private employment agencies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not opposed to private employment agencies per se. They are what the large companies use in the headhunting business, and many of them are very successful in that. But when it comes to dealing with many people, particularly young people, who have been unemployed for two years and who have got tired of applying for jobs and writing letters, day after day, I do not believe that any member of this House can have confidence in saying, `That is something that is going to be really looked after by someone who is experienced in finding employment or headhunting people with professional qualifications to service the large corporate sector.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect of this legislation which worries me greatly. I am a firm believer in this parliamentary institution and I am a firm believer in the Westminster system, with all its demerits. I have always believed that it is the best system which currently operates throughout the democratic world. An intrinsic part of that system is that the minister when he takes his oath of office is there to exercise responsibility for the implementation of government policy and he is examinable by any member of the parliament on aspects of his policy in the functioning of his department. We are dealing now with a massive problem of unemployment, one of the biggest social problems in Australia which has all kinds of ramifications. And what are we going to do? We are going to off&hyphen;load years of experience, but more importantly we are going to off&hyphen;load the role and responsibility of the minister. Here is a concept of ministerial responsibility that I have never met before. We are going to create a board. Nothing wrong with that, except that&mdash;listen to this&mdash;in designing the framework for the agency the government has taken into account the need for ministerial involvement. Involvement? I always understood that the central concept of our parliamentary experience was not involvement&mdash;it was the minister taking responsibility for the implementation of government policy. It was being prepared to accept the responsibility and, if necessary, facing resignation if he failed to implement that policy. We have seen raging in our parliament now for almost a fortnight the problems of a minister who has no confidence in a board, and who is trying to adopt the political position, but they are not prepared to go. But now what we are saying in respect of this very important issue of unemployment is, `Oh well, we have got a totally new concept. We are going to appoint a board'&mdash;two from the private sector, two presumably the choice of the minister. But are they subject to the day-to-day control of the minister? Does the minister accept accountability as he is bound to by his oath of office to the parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. This is an ideologically driven government that deep in its heart believes that anything that is performed by the public sector can be performed more adequately by the private sector. They are entitled to that belief, but it is not supportable in many areas of government. We see failures besetting Great Britain; we see the failures now operating in New Zealand, where there is now in existence a permanent underclass. The way you produce an underclass is to see that there are not useful and meaningful and productive jobs for our citizens. It is not an easy problem but it is one which the government must face up to. But what do they say? `We have got a minister but don't ask him to have a hands-on approach. Don't ask him to line up his public servants and say "I am not happy with the way this particular problem is operating in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1478"> a particular electorate; I have been besieged by members of my own party and members of the opposition who say it is not working on the ground, what is your answer?"'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer from this minister is to say, `I've got a board. I'm a bit involved. I rang up the chairman the other day. The chairman was not too polite. He said, "Yes, Minister" and "No, Minister", but it is really their responsibility. Do not let the honourable member who is going to follow me in this debate come into my office and ask me, "Now look, Minister, what does this one&hyphen;stop shop mean in my electorate?"'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a social service structure and several unemployment agencies in my electorate. There is a problem with public transport. If you are unemployed in St Kilda&mdash;and mine is a comparatively tight electorate&mdash;are you going to put your one&hyphen;stop shop in St Kilda or in South Melbourne or in Caulfield, or are you going to have a series of one&hyphen;stop shops? Mine is a metropolitan electorate. Where do you put your one&hyphen;stop shop in Kalgoorlie or in a rural electorate? Are we going to have a series of them? There is nothing wrong with that, but that is not explained in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, what you are creating is the very thing which the Minister for Transport has been arguing about for two years. What you are creating is a board with a couple of high&hyphen;fliers, the chairman of which is getting a salary which, I believe, exceeds that of the Prime Minister&mdash;but he is only the Prime Minister; he only has to come in here and answer questions. That salary is higher than that of any ministers, but they are only parliamentarians and, after all, if you are creating a structure where you do not really have to answer to the parliament, the workload is less onerous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this legislation, the minister can write them a letter. He actually will sit down and write to them and say, `These are the things I want you to do.' Contemplate a situation where they have been meeting. Two of the members are part time&mdash;we would not want them to spend too much time dealing with the problems of the unemployed! They will formulate policy. They may choose to tell the minister about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the board is going to be the Trojan Horse which accepts the role and responsibility when unemployment grows, even if the minister is unsatisfactory. We are going to have a replay of some of the problems of a minister who puts himself at arms length from the structure. There will be a further problem for every member of parliament when the minister is operating at arms length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had occasion to contact departmental officers over a period of time to deal with the problems of their structures within my electorate, dealing with complaints about service and the range of problems that go with running these sorts of social welfare structures. Once able to deal directly, because they are public servants, with the people who work in those structures, if they are confronted with the problem of a lack of resources, they will refer you into the department. On every occasion I have been treated with courtesy, concern and always, within the ambit of the huge range of problems they confront, with a resolve to try and deal with the problems that I, as the local member, have raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we seriously believe in this glib document whose real agenda is to wreak havoc within the Commonwealth Employment Service, to downsize it&mdash;that is the fashionable term for giving people the sack&mdash;because we have got a board? The members of this board will have to be pretty talented, because they are going to be given the problems. The minister is going to write them a letter, and as a result of getting that letter they are going to solve these problems. Who is kidding who?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1479">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the second reading speech and with the bill itself is that it is not honest: it has not dealt with this parliament honestly and frankly. I would prefer it if the minister and the Prime Minister came in and said, as they often do, `We won the election and our agenda is essentially to destroy the CES. Because of our ideological fixation, we honestly believe that all these private employment agencies could do it just so much better. And your role as the local member? Oh well, you can write me a letter.' I suppose the minister can write another letter. He might even pick up the phone, if the highly paid chief executive officer chooses to speak to him&mdash;after all, she gets more money than he does!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill ought to be condemned because it does not deal honestly with the problems of those who rely on social services to live. It does not deal with integrity with the problems that face the young unemployed. It is a glib document, because it is about the destruction of existing services, but not on the basis of coming into the parliament and saying that they are totally inefficient and they do not do the job that they were set up to do. It is about all the publicity gimmicks in the world&mdash;a one&hyphen;stop shop. As I have said, we do not have a problem with the merger: what we do have a problem with is the hidden agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the minister say there will not be a downsizing in the CES? Does he say that those essential structures and that experience are going to be maintained? Does he say how many one&hyphen;stop shops he is going to need in rural electorates and how many one&hyphen;stop shops he is going to need in inner urban electorates? Not a bit of it. Does he deny that, as a result of his ideological commitment and the ideological commitment of this government to their belief&mdash;and I think that in many cases it is a genuine belief&mdash;and despite all the evidence that is now accumulating throughout the world where other governments have tried to use this system, we have now got a permanent underclass, a group of people who live not within the system but under it. This leads to dysfunctional families and it leads not to solving our social problems but to increasing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now return to the point I was concerned to make as a member of this parliament. I listened with interest to all the new members on the government side say how proud they were to be in this institution and how proud they were to represent their constituents. There was a flush of pride as we learnt of their family history. I can understand all that: I was once a new member of parliament and I can feel their enthusiasm.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a long time ago. But let me say, as one who values this institution and puts a high priority on its role, that I do not believe that in these essential public policy areas there is any substitute for a minister who is prepared to take responsibility, politically and socially, and take responsibility to this parliament when they are asked about unemployment figures, when they are asked by a member on notice or one who calls around to his or her office and says, `These problems are there. Will you please as minister move on these problems?'. That is the way the system was designed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and other previous speakers on this Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill, such as the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), have eloquently outlined many of its shortcomings and I do not wish to canvass much of the territory that they have already covered. But I do want to say a few things about one aspect of this legislation, which is the way in which it is part of the gutting of the Commonwealth Employment Service, the CES, that publicly funded employment service which has served this nation well for the past 50 years, and the way in which this legislation is part of the Howard government's desire to make the unemployed bear the burden of its drive for cost cutting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition made no mention of plans to abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service in the 1996 election campaign. Indeed, in a letter to the Community and Public Sector Union it promised to support the CES as a public employment service. It was, however, for those of us with longer memories, an explicit commitment in the extremist Fightback program, the Liberal and National parties' plan to rebuild and reward Australia, launched back in November 1991, on page 218. That plan was rejected by voters at the 1993 election. It said, `Most of the job placement activities of the CES will be privatised or contracted out.' So what we have here is a bill which is another flagrant example of reintroducing the Fightback agenda without the government having any mandate to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a long&hyphen;term campaign against the CES from some right&hyphen;wing academics, such as Judith Sloane, ideologically opposed to any public sector involvement in the labour market, and I guess it is likely that Prime Minister Howard was influenced by that kind of comment during his period as shadow industrial relations minister. But reports prepared by the department of employment under the Labor government demonstrated unequivocally, I think, that the CES has been absolutely crucial in cutting the numbers of unemployed, and particularly long&hyphen;term unemployed, since the recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that nearly two million Australians use the CES each year for one reason or another and its employees are dedicated people who take on the difficult task of matching up the unemployed, the job seekers&mdash;not just the better off ones, the better qualified ones&mdash;with available vacancies. I think something ought to be said in defence of their contribution and their role. As a member of the federal parliament, and indeed previously as a member of the Victorian state parliament, I have often had occasion to make contact with officers of the Coburg CES, Glenroy CES, Brunswick CES and so on. In each case I found their commitment and dedication to their task to be first class and of immense benefit to people without jobs in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we will have as a result of this bill is the CES starting to wither on the vine from April as the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency commences operations and picks up responsibility for the referral of job seekers, although the CES is apparently not to be formally closed or rebadged as the Public Employment Placement Enterprise until about September. What we have, in effect, is the disappearance of that 50-year&hyphen;old comprehensive public employment service&mdash;something that taxpayers, in my view, have a right to expect that they and their kids can get assistance from when it is needed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1481">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to lament&mdash;as well as lamenting the passing of that comprehensive public employment service&mdash;the fact that the PEPE has been excluded from this legislation and, indeed, from other legislation coming before the parliament so that it is not going to be scrutinised by the parliament in contradiction to earlier assurances that we had from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Employment Placement Enterprise will not operate to fill in the gaps in service to the unemployed from commercial and other providers. Instead, as Senator Vanstone informed us on 10 December last year, the Public Employment Placement Enterprise will be incorporated as a company under the Corporations Law and a company structure will ensure it has a `commercial focus' as soon as possible. In my book that means that the Public Employment Placement Enterprise will not be able to effectively look after the unemployed who the new private, profit&hyphen;driven employment placement agencies and enterprises do not cater for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has correctly pointed out that Labor first introduced competition from private providers to the traditional dominance of the CES and that this, and particularly in cases of one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one case management, has worked quite well. But what the new legislation fails to recognise is that the CES needs to continue to play a central role in the provision of employment service to ensure that all those who need case management receive it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation involved the strengthening of the CES as well as the introduction of competition and it is that balanced combination of public, community and private sector which has got the results in terms of cutting the numbers of long&hyphen;term unemployed to a five&hyphen;year low. Under this arrangement, under this bill, we will not have a public employment service provider having the resources to adequately compete. Therefore, you will not get true competition and freedom of choice for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public sector employment enterprise will not be able to compete with Drake and the other private employment agencies, and many of the smaller and more community&hyphen;based providers will also find it difficult to get through the tender process and survive in the medium term as employment placement enterprises in comparison with larger commercial enterprises such as Drake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, indeed, a number of unanswered questions about the role of the private employment agencies in bringing about these changes and the money that they are going to make out of unemployment under the new arrangements. I would suggest to the parliament that there is a strong potential for fraud under the proposed arrangements. One of the companies which has been involved here is Drake International. They made a donation to the Liberal Party, and no other party, back in the 1993 election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the government has formally advertised that it will not conduct a nationwide tender process until late March, we already see brand new Drake Job Seek Offices appearing in some areas, presumably in the expectation that they are going to get funding. The government also announced in January that finders' fees would start to be paid to private job placement agencies from February. We can also go back to the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> from John Short in August last year that it was Prime Minister Howard who personally urged Senator Vanstone at a Cabinet meeting on 9 April last year to undertake the privatisation of the CES.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another private employment agency which is active in preparation for the new regime is Bensons Hospitality. There have been pretty strong reports that Bensons has been going around 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1482"> headhunting case managers with access to confidential data from the department on how local labour markets operate and the success rates of various case managers and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that thousands of public sector jobs will be lost as a result of this legislation and the related legislation. I am also concerned that it will be very difficult for unemployed people to have adequate redress against comparatively powerful profit driven, employment driven placement enterprises under the new arrangements. What we have got here is a bill which is going to abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service and fundamentally change the arrangements for the delivery of employment assistance in Australia, essentially privatising most of this assistance and denying assistance previously available to many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many things to be concerned about. It is the case that the government announced some changes to its original proposals back on 10 December, an indication I think that they recognise that they got it seriously wrong in the first place, and they altered the capacity to benefit test. They talked about having a community support program for the many disadvantaged job seekers who will be excluded from mainstream government employment assistance. But the point is those job seekers are still going to be excluded from this assistance, which until now they have had as a basic right. Despite the changes on 10 December, I am most concerned at how this will operate in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where the transferring of staff from the CES will start happening in April and go on apparently through May until the end of the year. The CES will lose its functions in the meantime and I am concerned that if the staff are transferred from the CES to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency you will have a CES which is unable to provide a universal service in the meantime. It will only provide a service to people who are on unemployment benefits and that will have a number of other adverse effects as well. In the area of staff conditions I understand that while staff being transferred to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency will stay under public service conditions, the chief executive officer is going to be given the power of hire and fire to take on new staff under the Australian workplace agreements. It is my view that the introduction of these kinds of contracts will weaken staff conditions throughout the Commonwealth services delivery agency in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned that it will have an adverse effect on service quality and service standards. Presently the people who are looking for work are able to access the touch screen. In most cases they are referred of course to the CES officers who are able to assist them. If, under the new arrangements, they are not a client of the particular employment placement agency which is matched with the job, they are unlikely to get the job, because the employment placement agency gets paid for placing its own clients. It seems to me that the unemployed are likely to miss out under this arrangement, but also that employers will miss out, because they may find that the pool of people being referred to them is diminished through these restrictions, and that they will not get the best possible applicant for the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned, as I mentioned earlier, about the possibility of fraud in these circumstances. We will have a situation where employers link up with employment placement enterprises, and indeed are encouraged to do so. Their job will be to provide that employer with clients. We already have some abuses where employers take on people simply in order to take advantage of the job subsidy which applies to particular people and then knock them off at the end of that job subsidy. We have a situation where there is a $10,000 payment for employment placement agencies for difficult to place clients. Now $10,000 is a lot of money, and the incentives for fraud involving employers or even employees in particular arrangements 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1483"> are certainly there. I am concerned that there is not proper monitoring of this arrangement and I am concerned that the establishment of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency is the first step along this path towards the new private sector employment placement enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would seek from the government more information and better responses than it has given us so far, concerning how the community support program will work; whether employers will be in fact worse off through getting in some cases a more limited pool of prospective employees to choose from; and what guarantees we have against fraudulent arrangements. For those reasons I support the amendment moved by the member for Batman, which I think would go a long way towards improving this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In September of last year I indicated that I did not question the notion of a one&hyphen;stop shop agency or set&hyphen;up, but that I did have concerns about the way in which the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency had been announced and about the lack of detail at that stage. Some six months after the budget announcement about the Services Delivery Agency I am still in the same quandary, because I do not think, even with the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill before us that sufficient detail has been revealed about the way in which the agency is to be conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the budget, a pamphlet was released as part of the budget kit of the Department of Social Security. It was a glossy, colourful pamphlet entitled `A new era in customer service'. I put a question on notice about it and discovered that this type of pamphlet cost about $30,000 to print. It and a like pamphlet were distributed to targeted community organisations to advise them of the creation of the agency, and another one was targeted at departmental customers. The answer to my question on notice said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This product also aimed to reassure customers that there would be no interruptions to current payments with the transfer to the new agency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is all well and good, and it is important that those who are clients of the departments and other bodies that are to be amalgamated into the agencies should have that assurance. However, I have seen no sign of the type of community consultation it was suggested there would be about the agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am even told that we are still at the stage where various marketing entities for the agency are being market tested to see how people react to them. I have a real problem with the way in which we are going about setting up this agency. I also said in September that one of my grave concerns about the notion of the SDA, the Services Delivery Agency, is that it is the first step towards privatisation/outsourcing of something that has always been part of government services. That is one of the real concerns we need to be aware of. I am also concerned that there appear to be no parameters set as to what the agency will do and how it will go about it. For instance, there has been no discussion about where to locate these agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I have no problem with trying to put together important arms of government service delivery. In fact, back in 1986 when I was first elected I was surprised that in all the suburbs in the electorate of Scullin, we had a CES in one suburb and the DSS down in the next suburb. As a local member I tried to ensure that, wherever it could be achieved, these services were co&hyphen;located. I think the co&hyphen;location led to a greater degree of cooperation between the different departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we to see here? There are no guidelines about how many agencies there will be or on what criteria decisions will be made about the siting of the agencies. This is a real

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) Negative gearing deductions arise for all taxpayers, including companies, in situations where the interest on money borrowed to fund a project is greater than the initial returns of that project. Negative gearing deductions often arise in cases where a rental property has been purchased as the interest cost in the initial years of ownership is high.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where a rental property is not producing income but is ready to do so, for example suitable tenants may take some time to find, negative gearing deductions will continue to be allowable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(b) A company that has been deregistered by the Australian Securities Commission will cease to be a legal entity for taxation purposes and will, therefore, not be required to lodge income tax returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A taxpayer, including a company taxpayer, claiming negative gearing deductions is treated, for taxation purposes, no differently from any other taxpayer and the full range of taxation law penalties can be applied where circumstances are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers are sometimes required to substantiate claims for deductions shown in tax returns. Where a company can demonstrate it has a proper entitlement to a claim for negative gearing deductions, no taxation penalties will be imposed.</PARA>
