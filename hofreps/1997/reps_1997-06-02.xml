<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In four weeks time, on 1 July 1997, at the end of one and a half decade's negotiation, Hong Kong will be transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty. For Hong Kong it brings to the end 150 years of British rule. Hong Kong is in a unique position. It is to be decolonised by having its sovereignty handed not to itself but to the power from which it was first severed. The transition involves a nation and a fellow former colony of the United Kingdom, both of great importance to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia&hyphen;China relationship is expanding and multifaceted, highlighted by last week's visit of the Chinese Vice Premier, Mr Zhu Rongji. It is a relationship in which there is enormous scope for growth but a need for understanding of respective national interests and attitudes. The Australia&hyphen;Hong Kong relationship is equally long standing and productive, but with our common language base it has been somewhat closer. Australia's relationship with Hong Kong has enhanced its
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entry into China. It is to be hoped that the change of sovereignty will improve and not lessen that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was because of the importance of both Hong Kong and China to Australia that the committee decided to embark on this inquiry. It seemed important to set out for the members of the Australian Parliament the nature of the agreement that had been reached between Britain and China, not only because some doubts and uncertainties had been raised about the implementation of the joint declaration and the basic law but also because an understanding of the detail would be helpful in shaping the best policy towards the new Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry was advertised on 7 September 1996. It received 36 submissions and a large number of exhibits. It took evidence at public hearings in Australia and most valuably visited Hong Kong in late January where the committee was able to hold discussions with a very wide range of people right across the political spectrum, including Governor Chris Patten, and from both government and non&hyphen;government organisations. Visits were made to the border and to inspect the new infrastructure projects, the airport at Chek Lap Kok and the bridges and linking road and rail systems that have been built to connect them to Hong Kong, and the Lantau link. These projects are impressive in their scale, in the engineering skill that makes them possible and in the confidence in the future they assert. The committee is most grateful to the Australian government officials who worked on the organisation of the visit to Hong Kong and most appreciative of the hospitality and time given by all those who briefed us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was able to return to Hong Kong in April this year and then meet the chief executive designate, Mr Tung Chee Hwa. He gave very clear assurances about his intentions to preserve Hong Kong's way of life and to govern Hong Kong with the interests of the people of Hong Kong very much in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The period of transition, 1984 to 1997, has not always been smooth or optimistic. In 1989 the dramatic events in Tiananmen Square shook Hong Kong's confidence to its core and in the last five years arguments over changes
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4530"> to the legal and political systems still create grave doubts and even the events over the last weekend highlighted that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The views put to the committee ranged from cautious optimism to apprehension and these are reflected in the report. Optimism about the future of Hong Kong rests, we were told, on the rational and pragmatic nature of the Chinese government and its recognition of the value of Hong Kong to China. It also rests on the agreement of the Chinese to a novel treaty that guarantees one country, two systems and Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong. This week Mr Zhu Rongji emphatically reiterated these promises when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">China would unswervingly implement the principle of one country, two systems . . . we have the ability and the confidence to ensure long&hyphen;term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Optimism is encouraged by the robust state of the territory's economy, the autonomous representation of Hong Kong on a number of international economic bodies, such as the WTO and APEC, its maintenance of a separate currency and its own stock exchange, and its status as a separate customs territory. There is a depth of skill in the financial and legal institutions which should provide the basis for continuity. Hong Kong has a sophisticated common law system, an independent judiciary, a vigorous Chinese and English language media and an impartial and apparently honest public service and police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many apprehensions raised by people in Hong Kong and in Australia are detailed in the report. These relate to the vulnerability of pivotal legal and political institutions. Whereas the legal institutions are well established, the political institutions, especially of the democratic kind, are new and fragile. Of concern are the creation of a second legislature, the Provisional Legislative Council, without constitutional basis; the intention to repeal laws which protected basic freedoms of speech and assembly; the broad and vague definitions of subversion in article 23 of the Basic Law; the uncertainty about the timing and nature of electoral laws to be set in place by the Provisional Legislature; and the capacity of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to intervene in Hong
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kong's government under the auspices of article 158 of the Basic Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are classic ways to undermine democratic accountability and as such encourage corruption not only of the political process but ultimately of the economy as well. Hong Kong's prosperity and stability are at issue and of interest to the region and the world. While cautiously optimistic, the committee has recommended an annual report for the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to compliment Mr Peter Nugent, the chair of the subcommittee, and in particular Margaret Swieringa, Jon Merrill and other staff of the committee for the excellent work they did in the preparation of this report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the tabling of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty&mdash;an event which will be one of the defining moments at the end of the twentieth century. No&hyphen;one should underestimate the practical and symbolic significance of the transfer of power on 1 July. Fundamentally it is about China's re&hyphen;emergence onto the world stage as an absolute front&hyphen;rank player. Hong Kong has been one of the most powerful symbols of the unequal treaties between China and the European colonial powers. But in less than a month the Union Jack&mdash;for Chinese nationalists the symbol of a hated colonial past&mdash;will quietly flutter down. At the same time, China will incorporate what is perhaps the greatest symbol of Chinese success and prosperity, doing so at a time when its own economic progress continues to move ahead in leaps and bounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That economic performance is undeniably impressive. China's economy has been growing at around 10 per cent a year for the past 15 years. From July, with Hong Kong, China will be the sixth largest trading nation in the world. Soon after the year 2000, China's trade with Japan will overtake the volume of trade between Japan and the United States. With the reforms under way, China is likely to sustain this growth well into the next century, with commentators agreeing that by 2020 China
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4531"> will have the biggest economy in the world: according to one World Bank study, some 25 per cent larger than second placed United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implications for Australia in these broad trends are profound. Almost all of the things we take for granted in our current external environment will no longer hold. Our region and indeed the world will be changed, and the biggest geopolitical force in that transformation will be the rise of China. We do not know precisely how these changes will unfold but the fate of Hong Kong will certainly be a critical element in determining how China interacts both with our region and with the wider world, and how we and our friends and neighbours engage with China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reality, together with our substantial commercial and consular interests in Hong Kong, illustrates Australia's profoundly important stake in a smooth and successful transfer to Chinese sovereignty. Central to this outcome lies the maintenance of a high degree of autonomy and the freedom guaranteed to Hong Kong under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, continuation of the rule of law, the maintenance of democratic institutions and processes, an independent judiciary, a free media and the continuation of Hong Kong's open economic system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole world will be studying very closely the process of transition in the months and years after 1 July. The stakes for China, Hong Kong and the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region are high indeed. The challenge for the international community, and for Australia in particular, is to draw all we can to support a smooth and successful transition. Our response to developments will need to be balanced and constructive, based on mature consideration of the underlying political dynamics both in Hong Kong and in China itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, the committee's report provides some very useful benchmarks with which to evaluate the success of the one country, two systems formula. As the report states, the transfer of Hong Kong represents a profound challenge to Australian diplomacy. It is likely to test Australia's commitment to support and promote two of our absolute core values: democratic processes and human
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights. In the debate on this subject on 14 October I said there should be no weakening of Australia's support for democratic processes and human rights in Hong Kong. I remain absolutely convinced of that. Australia should be prepared to use all appropriate means, both public and private, and leave China and the world in no doubt about our strong support for these fundamental principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since last October, however, we have seen the Howard government take a very different path with its decision to relegate the issue of human rights to a private, behind&hyphen;closed&hyphen;doors dialogue with China. Regrettably, the government has already chosen this course on human rights. Foreign Minister Downer once spoke of consistency and principle in respect of these issues, but the government will now hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil. For this compliance we are told that the Howard government is in China's good books&mdash;for the moment at least. But the Australian message to the people of Hong Kong and to campaigners for democratic institutions, such as Martin Lee, could hardly be worse. They now know that they cannot rely on Australia to speak up. The lesson for China is also very clear: wave a stick&mdash;in this case, wave a big stick&mdash;and offer the carrot, and the Howard government will do as it is told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be thought that silence on human rights issues will bring Australia diplomatic and economic benefit. That is certainly the government's view. But no other country has ever advanced its long&hyphen;term national interest through the expedient abandonment of principle and democratic values. The fundamental challenge for Australia in the next century is to maintain our core values and our commitment to protect and promote human rights in a profoundly different international environment. Hong Kong should provide a clear demonstration of our preparedness to so this. The Howard government will profoundly fail our national interest if it fails this test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with the Chairman of the joint standing committee, Mr Sinclair, in thanking the members of the Human Rights Subcommittee, particularly the Chairman of the committee, Mr Peter Nugent, for the work they have done
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4532"> in preparing this report. I commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has already been mentioned, less than a month from today the sovereignty of Hong Kong will be transferred from the United Kingdom to China. For Britain it marks the end of the colonial era. It is a unique transfer of sovereignty from one power to another, but not to independence or to self&hyphen;government as we have become so used to these days. For China, the return of Hong Kong is the reclamation of a significant part of its territory. For the people of Hong Kong the change and the nature of the central power probably could not be greater.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">China and Hong Kong have a natural connection in geography, culture, heritage and language. The return of Hong Kong to China will create and encourage a very important synergy. But it also raises some interesting questions and some concerns. Those concerns range from the democratic process, the repeal of some of the human rights ordinances, media self&hyphen;censorship&mdash;or, as it was put to us by a number of people in Hong Kong, commercial decisions&mdash;control of the judicial process, the status of refugees, the regional human rights dimension and whether the Hong Kong people can take their destiny and independence into their own hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's interests in Hong Kong are substantial. We have pragmatic concerns for investments in trade, political concerns for regional stability, and humanitarian concerns for the continued wellbeing of a neighbouring people and for the preservation of democratic and liberal values&mdash;something which Australians consider to be of intrinsic worth. There are 30,000 Australians in Hong Kong. In 1995 Hong Kong was our 10th largest trading partner. With its merger with China it will become even more important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inquiry was not about whether the transfer of sovereignty should take place. The inquiry was very much directed at the process of transition and informing the members of this parliament about a highly significant event in our region, with possible implications for our vital interests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I echo the comments of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) about the number of submissions, our public hearings, our visit and the range of people we saw in Hong Kong. We are appreciative of the efforts all those involved made in that connection. We saw a broad range of people in Hong Kong, and that was very important. As chair of the sub committee, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their assistance. I would particularly like to thank the secretary, Margaret Swieringa, assisted so ably by Jon Merrill and Peter Ratas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the House to the conclusion sections of the report and the 26 recommendations. One of the key findings was that we concluded that the reforms Governor Patten had proposed&mdash;somewhat belatedly&mdash;were in the spirit and the strict letter of the agreement made between Britain and China, although the PRC has made it very clear that they have a different view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the phrases that is used frequently in connection with Hong Kong and the changeover is `the through train', describing what was in place before 1 July and what will be there afterwards. Quite clearly, the political through train was derailed by the installation of the new legislative council and the doing away with the old one, but the administrative, economic and judicial through trains appear to be on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to say that, having considered the legal and institutional assurances provided by the Chinese government through the basic law, the robust state of the territory's economy and trade relations and, perhaps most importantly, its increasingly lucrative role as a trade intermediary to China, it is difficult not to approach the central question of Hong Kong's economic future from a confident perspective. However, in the light of the civil, legal and political issues that have occupied much of this report, it is equally difficult not to be cautious about the economic implications of Chinese political control over Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, it is that political control which is going to be the key thing. It is essential to recognise that China is the new sovereign
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4533"> power and that Hong Kong will be affected&mdash;and its fate governed&mdash;by the changing political and economic landscape of China. Our interests in Hong Kong will, therefore, be influenced by developments in China and our relationship with China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that we have got a lot to do with China in the future. We are very concerned about how the Chinese authorities and the new Hong Kong authorities will react after 1 January. We have been assured at the highest level in China that things will be governed according to the promises that were made, and it is very much hoped that those promises are stuck to. On behalf of the committee, I can say that it is very much hoped that Hong Kong will continue to prosper in the future, for the benefit of the people of Hong Kong, of China, of the region and, in particular, of this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hong Kong will be seen by many as the challenge of the future. In an age when we are familiar with colonies obtaining their independence from a colonial master, Hong Kong&mdash;I think uniquely&mdash;has, in effect, exchanged one colonial master for another. Many would argue that, as the lease entered into by Britain some 99 years ago has expired, China is merely reasserting its sovereignty&mdash;a sovereignty that has, in one way or another, been under challenge since the first unequal treaty of 1842. Some are disappointed that Hong Kong was not permitted to become a separate independent state in the international community, but that is speculation about what might have been rather than the reality of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report tabled shows that Hong Kong is important to Australia for trade and investment and because of the many people from Hong Kong who have made Australia their home. As a parliament and as a nation, we have had a long and historic link with Hong Kong. We must always have genuine concerns about the human rights of its citizens but, I must say, our credibility when pontificating on human rights has been somewhat diminished by some of the decisions taken by Australia over recent months. I do not think
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we sent any reassuring messages of support for human rights or gave much comfort to those concerned with human rights in Hong Kong by our recent vote at the Human Rights Committee, regardless of what the reasons were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hong Kong will be in the situation of being a country within a country. There will be strict border controls, passage of people will be controlled and it will, in many respects, be more difficult after the transfer of sovereignty for someone living in Shanghai or Beijing to visit Hong Kong than it is today. Will human rights be protected? I suspect that human rights may be different in interpretation. It seems to me inevitable that there will be some readjustment regarding the rights of people. For example, the press at the moment is engaging in a form of self&hyphen;censorship, and this will continue. Chinese officials will argue that they have not imposed restrictions, but a newspaper proprietor or editor will know, without being told, about certain things they can publish and other things they cannot publish.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The same will probably occur with dissent. During our visit to Hong Kong, many suggested the Singapore model as an appropriate model for Hong Kong. Everyone knows what a vibrant, enthusiastic and dynamic opposition there is in Singapore! Yet commercial activity flourishes in Singapore, and that is the key to Hong Kong. The economic activity in Hong Kong is staggering. The economy is one that is the envy of much of the world. It is in everyone's interests for this to continue. I suspect that Beijing will not impose too heavy a hand on Hong Kong, but there will be a hand imposed. It will indeed be one nation, two systems. The people of Hong Kong will have more freedom than is currently enjoyed by citizens in other parts of China, but whether they have total freedom, as we understand it, will again be a matter of interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Life for most Hong Kong citizens will go on much as it does today. The British have been making much of the denial of human rights in Hong Kong&mdash;and especially of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4534"> abolition of the elected legislative assembly. As part of China, Hong Kong will have more freedom than its people have had for many years under British rule. China has rightly pointed out that the system under the basic law is more democratic than the British offered. The British were very late in giving the Hong Kong Chinese any say in the running of the colony, were quick to stamp out any form of dissent and did not show too much concern about imprisoning critical editors when it suited them. Had Britain been a more benevolent overlord and involved the Chinese more, then the criticism that Britain makes today&mdash;or at least that it made under the Tories&mdash;would be much more valid. As it is, they appear to many of us to be somewhat hypocritical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure everyone in parliament wishes Hong Kong every success as it embarks on the uncharted course of having a different system within an overall sovereign state. I would like to compliment the chairman of the committee, Peter Nugent, and the staff&mdash;Margaret Swieringa, Jon Merrill and Peter Ratas&mdash;for the work they did. I would like to particularly compliment Margaret Swieringa for the dedication she has shown to the compiling of this report. We will watch Hong Kong's future with great interest.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the report I have just tabled deals with one of the most tragic events experienced by our young people in Australia today. The number of young Australians, especially young men, who commit suicide has risen rapidly over the past 20 years to the extent where it is now one of the highest rates in the industrialised world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, in acknowledging the severity of this trend and in order to express their concern and the concern of the federal parliament, undertook to conduct a seminar at Parliament House to promote the necessity for direct action at the national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A measure of the commitment of the federal parliament to the conduct of this seminar and the committee's report was attested to by the presence of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who opened the seminar and who has strongly supported a national response to the tragedy of youth suicide. The committee was also fortunate to have the expertise and cooperation of four eminent practitioners in the field who provided presentations to seminar participants on the demographics of youth suicide, social and psychiatric factors involved and the provision of support services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to place on the public record my appreciation, and that of the committee, to Dr James Harrison, the Director of the National Injury Surveillance Unit at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Associate Professor Pierre Baume, who is the Director of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention, Professor Robert Kosky, the Director of the Department of Psychiatry at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital, and last but by no means least, Dr Meg Smith, the Chairman of the Youth Suicide Prevention Advisory Group for assisting in the conduct of the seminar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an attempt to involve a cross&hyphen;section of organisations and individuals working directly with youth suicide prevention, invitations
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4535"> were also extended to participants representing peak health and community groups and local organisations and youth workers, academics and professionals who all had an opportunity to make a personal contribution to the day's proceedings. As well as committee members, 14 other members and senators attended the seminar. It is important to recognise that no-one has a monopoly on good ideas and commonsense, and it was wonderful not only to have a contribution from the parliament but also to have input from the community, particularly those who have been fighting this problem at the coalface.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Committee members considered that the information provided at the seminar should be disseminated as widely as possible and, for this reason, resolved to produce a summary report which would further focus discussion. The report also contains a series of recommendations designed to improve the current delivery of services and provide a national structure to refine prevention programs based on more reliable evidence based research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major recommendation of the committee is that a national advisory council on youth suicide prevention be established to provide strategic advice to the Minister for Health and Family Services on youth suicide prevention and related matters. While a Youth Suicide Prevention Advisory Group currently exists, the committee does not consider that this organisation has sufficient direct input into policy making at a high enough level to achieve the results required. For this reason, the committee has recommended that the new advisory council on youth suicide prevention be administratively resourced by the Department of Health and Family Services, reporting directly to the minister, and that it be chaired by an expert person with a high profile in the field and have its membership determined personally by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the proposed council should produce a comprehensive work plan within six months of its establishment and revise and update this plan annually. The council should also be responsible for creating appropriate arrangements for consultation and cooperation among governments and the community at all levels. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendation for the establishment of the council is the most important step in increasing the government's responsibility and effectiveness and for this reason is listed as priority No. 1. It underpins the other recommendations and applies an overarching structure to engineer and further develop appropriate responses to the urgent need for direct action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequent upon this is the recommendation to establish a research advisory committee to assist and advise the National Health and Medical Research Council on the management of research projects and grants and ensure consistency with national research priorities. This recommendation gives emphasis to the current fragmented and inconsistent approach to national data collection and provides a mechanism to improve research administration and funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as a third priority, the committee has made specific reference to several strategies to increase public awareness, to assist the medical system to identify young people at risk of suicide and to improve data collection. These would all be achieved by the establishment of the bodies referred to earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I hope that all members of this House will read the committee's report and urge the government to act on its recommendations. This tragedy, which is increasing daily, will not diminish by itself, and we do not have the luxury of waiting for someone else to act for us. This is truly a national responsibility and must be accorded the highest national priority. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), am pleased to be able to speak briefly on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> . The seminar organised in February this year provided not only all of us in this House but also those intimately involved in this tragic area&mdash;the peak health and community groups, the local organisations, youth and street workers and professionals and academics&mdash;with an invaluable opportunity to gain some up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date evidence on this very
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4536"> pressing issue&mdash;and what an issue it is. I am sure all members in this place can tell this House of first&hyphen;hand stories of the tragedy that is youth suicide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me, over the last couple of weeks I have been touched by, first of all, a mother asking for my assistance in bringing her 16-year-old daughter home from Western Australia, who had just hung herself after having an argument with her 17-year-old boyfriend. One of my staffers' male friends, a 24-year-old, could not see a way out of his many problems so he drove deep into the bush, into part of the electorate close to my office, and used the old tried and true method of attaching a rubber hose to the exhaust pipe to end his life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia as a nation has an absolutely appalling record when it comes to the tragic death of our youngsters, those between the ages of 15 and 24. Excluding several Baltic countries, Australia, New Zealand and Norway have the highest death rates per hundred thousand young people when it comes to suicide&mdash;Australian males at 25 per 100,000 and females at just over five per 100,000. They are bland statistics to some; to others it means that, for 1995, the most recent year for which data has been collected, of the total deaths of young males between the ages of 15 and 24, 25 per cent can be attributed to suicide and for females, 17 per cent. In evidence to the seminar, Dr James Harrison from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said, the deaths themselves are in some sense the tip of an iceberg. We do not have anywhere near such a good sense of the other parts of the iceberg. We do have some sense of those cases which resulted in hospital admission for apparently self&hyphen;destructive or suicide attempting behaviour. Overall, there are about 10 times as many hospital admissions for this sort of problem as there are deaths . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If you look at our report, just glance at the females, those who have tried and were unsuccessful, and read the report when it comes to what they are going to do the next time or the next time. The problem facing us is: what can we do about this upward spiralling social problem?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One problem highlighted during the seminar was that youth suicide research needs to be coordinated at a national level. Those of us who can remember when our national road toll reached epidemic proportions will remember that we as a nation reacted with the introduction of national requirements relating to seat belts, alcohol levels in drivers, speed limits and modifications in the way the cars were manufactured. The time has come for such a national strategy to be put in place for our young people to ensure that the loss of hundreds of young Australian lives will soon be properly addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations that the honourable member for Fisher mentioned must be addressed immediately by all of us in a multipartisan way so that the many hundreds of young people who tragically lose their lives can leave at least some memorial in that the hope they thought was not there is there and we can put in place ways of addressing this absolutely appalling and tragic situation. I recommend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every day in this place we speak on a range of issues of national importance, but I do not believe there is a single issue of greater importance to each of us, or to us collectively as a nation, than the welfare of our young people, which is why the report tabled today and the government's increasing focus on youth suicide is such an important step forward in recognising this growing problem and finding ways to deal with it as a community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, there were 350 young male suicides and 84 young female suicides. These represented about a quarter of all young male deaths and 17 per cent of our young female deaths. Since the 1960s, rates of suicide among young men have almost trebled; in women they have doubled. It is sobering to remember that for every suicide there are many attempted suicides. Literally thousands of young Australians are attempting to take their lives every year. This is surely every bit as tragic and as urgent as many of the other problems we have discussed in this House in recent weeks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4537">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report tabled today does not, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in the opening of the youth suicide seminar held here in Parliament House, pretend to `have all the magical solutions', but it does outline some priorities to ensure that, firstly, the government has a working plan to tackle this problem and regularly reviews its progress in meeting the objectives of that plan; secondly, research into this problem is properly coordinated; and, thirdly, the government takes immediate action in the following ways: establishing a depression awareness campaign, adopting standard procedures for treating a young person who has attempted suicide, reviewing current funding and redirecting some of that funding to more appropriate programs and ensuring consistency and data collection at all government levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the last point is important. The committee, and certainly I personally, found it very difficult to get up-to-date figures in order to fully gauge the extent of this problem. I believe that three essential priorities outlined in this report provide a commonsense approach to the problems in both the long and the short term. All the members of the committee agree that it is important to take both long&hyphen; and short&hyphen;term approaches if we are to properly address this issue, which is why I think it is instructive to look at the three major factors influencing young suicidal people, outlined in points 25 to 34 of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various sociological factors have been identified in countries with high suicide rates, and they include a high divorce rate, high youth unemployment, high female employment, extremely high alcohol consumption, a high number of unwanted pregnancies and low church or religious participation. Some of these factors are obviously beyond the direct control of government, but there are many ways we can play a role in helping alleviate problems such as youth unemployment and family breakdown. The report's conclusion, paragraph 50, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the seminar, the family was raised as a major influence on young people's lives. For many young suicidal people, depression combined with chronic family discord was stated to create overwhelming distress.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Perhaps it is not surprising that, while successive governments have placed less emphasis on the welfare of the family unit, suicide rates have soared over the past 30 years. I am certainly pleased to be part of a government which is committed to restoring the value of the family rather than regarding it as old fashioned or passe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policies are aimed at rewarding parents who take on the crucial role of raising children, recognising the important job they are doing and helping them to build and maintain family ties by relieving financial pressures. That does not mean getting caught up on definitions of families. It means delivering real assistance to ease so many of the pressures that modern day families face. I believe this approach is crucial as part of the long-term solution to youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We owe it to our children to ease the pressures on them. There is a mountain of evidence which suggests that the best place this can be achieved is in a nurturing and happy family unit. Of course, that is not the whole answer either and I do not pretend the problem is that simple. As Professor Kolsky told the suicide forum, the mystery of suicide is hidden and buried in the minds of a young person, beyond words in many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to consider very carefully the main priorities outlined in this report and to take urgent action on them. They provide an important first step forward in helping unravel the mystery of youth suicide, hopefully to save some of the young lives that are tragically lost in our community each year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to this report today. In our community we see many tragic ways by which people can die, but it seems to me that suicide, particularly among our younger people, has to be one of the most tragic&mdash;the tragic loss of a young life, the loss of the potential, the loss of a loved one, the loss of a young person possibly tormented by mental illness and the devastation left for the loved ones to cope with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government, through its Here for Life program, had committed $13 million over four years, from 1995-96 through to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4538"> 1998-99, in an attempt to seriously begin to tackle this awful social problem. We should note that we are just over halfway through that particular program and it is continuing. Commendably, the current government, in its 1996-97 budget, committed $19 million over three years through its national youth suicide strategy&mdash;in total, $32 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend both this government and the former government for making these commitments; however, I must admit to a slight disappointment, or in fact frustration, that during our committee briefings and meetings it became evident that there was little if any apparent serious connection between those two programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During our one-day seminar, we heard many people from the community and from government and non-government sectors explaining and commenting on a large number of programs, projects and pilots at all levels around the country but with little if any apparent coordination overall. The whole of the committee tended to continually note this as we progressed through our inquiry. It is fair to say that some of the people at the seminar knew of the work of some others, but the whole subject seemed to be screaming out for coordination, for a central focus, for guidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of data collection was one of the most frustrating aspects of this whole inquiry for me. As the member for Forde (Mrs Elson) said just a moment ago, the lack of comprehensive data seemed to frustrate not only us but more so the people who were trying to deliver some of the services on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I must agree to a certain extent with the comments of the member for Forde regarding family breakdown, we must also remember that with the lack of that comprehensive data we have no way really of knowing whether these young people are coming from the most loving, together families or from the families with the most discord&mdash;whether they are from families who go to church every Sunday or whether they are from families who are unemployed. That is the problem we have as a community. One of the most important things this whole new
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coordinated approach should take on immediately is a comprehensive collection of that data so that we actually do know what we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A statistic that I found most alarming and which I think illustrates how careful targeting is needed is that 60 per cent of successful or completed suicides have a known record of a previous attempt. This begs the question: are we doing enough in the follow-up, the post&hyphen;incident counselling, the family counselling? It seems not, although we must note that in the Here for Life program there is a pilot under way looking at that very aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommended establishment of a national advisory council on youth suicide prevention, along with a research advisory committee, is essential if we as a community&mdash;not as a government, but as a community&mdash;are serious about this matter. All the work, research and knowledge already there through the Here for Life initiative, the youth suicide prevention advisory group and all of the people we met at the seminar must be used, built on and added to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much look forward to the ongoing commitment of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in the work that I know he and his department are going to be required to undertake when, hopefully, this government takes on the recommendations or priorities of this summary report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a fairly new member to this place I must say that the work of a committee like this is the real work of a parliament. I would like very much on behalf of my colleagues on the committee to thank Bjarne Nordin from the secretariat and his colleagues Bronwen Jaggers and Kate DaDeppo, who really made our work so much easier and made certain that we had all of the information we required during the deliberations. I, too, join my colleagues in commending this summary report to the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs I think it is worth reminding ourselves that the health and well-being of young people and the extent to which we protect and nurture the vulnerable and care for their ideals are critical
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4539"> measures of any society. In returning to what the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) said, in relation to youth suicide we are now where we were with road trauma in the early 1970s. What is most important now is for the parliament and the incumbent government to realise that we need a nationally focused coordinated program which brings together all of those strands which contribute to the causes, prevention and treatment of youth suicide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst all of the things that might be attributed to it, I think we need to stop and ask ourselves whether our society is failing because, more than anything else, what we have done over the last 20 years is create a culture in which young people feel they have nothing more than themselves in which to believe. The mesh of values which holds this country together unfortunately in recent years has fallen apart. I can think of no issue of greater importance to the parliament than that of trying to protect the health, sense of belonging and meaningful purpose of young Australians. I commend the report most enthusiastically to the parliament and to the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some members may be aware that I chaired a committee which reported in November 1994 and which looked at the child support scheme.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> With the passage of time, a couple of things have become clearer to me. Firstly, the individual committee members who served on that committee have been inadequately recognised for the contribution they made&mdash;in fact, for the bipartisan way committee members tackled what is a very difficult issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it never occurred to me that nearly three years would have elapsed and that only the easiest of the recommendations&mdash;53 in all&mdash;would be tackled by my government and the present government and that the remaining more difficult policy issues would be and continue to be unresponded to. It is with a degree of frustration that I have brought this private member's bill forward, the Child Support Assessment Amendment Bill 1997. I suppose I am a little embarrassed that it picks up only the formula changes recommended by the committee. I emphasise that this is a private member's bill; it has not been endorsed by my party. In fact, if I reflect on the three years, I am a little surprised that the caucus has never really had an opportunity to vote on these measures or any of the other recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The formula changes recommended in the report are quite modest. They are the very minimum that needed to be changed in the committee's eyes in the absence of decent research. Let me run through them. For the non-custodial parent, it is an increase of 20 per cent in the living allowance. The cap has been reduced from 2&half; times average weekly earnings to twice times average weekly earnings, consistent with the necessity no longer to go to the Family Court for a variation of the assessment. The disregarded income of the custodial parent is reduced from average weekly earnings to the pension free area, but with a softening of the withdrawal rate from dollar for dollar to 50c in the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, there is a minimum child support assessment for every person, whether they are employed, unemployed or self&hyphen;employed, of $260 per annum. Some may take issue that this is going to cost more to collect than it is worth, but it is a matter of principle that every parent should contribute towards
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4540"> the upbringing of their children. Hence, that is why that provision is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it ironic that, three years after the report was tabled, we as parliamentarians still cannot agree about some of the principles in the report. That is, the scheme should really be about children and not about how much money can be clawed back to the Department of Social Security. The ever increasing staff numbers in the agency&mdash;some might say the explosive staffing increase in the agency&mdash;are unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a child support scheme that is a safety net&mdash;that is, that interferes in a minimal way in the lives of people and only when necessary and that the private arrangements people can come to are the best arrangements but that when things break down the agency is needed. Most particularly, we need to change this scheme from one about salary and wage earners to one that encompasses everyone, thereby repairing the income base, ensuring that the professionals and the self&hyphen;employed also pay child support and the draconian enforcement measures in the bill are implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely hope as a member of parliament that I can stand up in this parliament and support a government&mdash;any government&mdash;that produces legislative changes to the child support scheme. I have waited for three years. I have to confess that I do not think the government will give this bill precedence, but the need for reform is urgent.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I am very thankful for the degree of support from all quarters within this parliament and both houses. The essential detail of this motion is to deplore the continued harassment, torture, imprisonment, confiscation of property and other actions against the Baha'i minority within Iran. The core of the motion is in its final point, which calls on the Australian government to continue our long-term support for religious freedom and to take `further bilateral and multilateral diplomatic measures to support the religious freedoms of the Baha'is and religious freedom generally'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list of acts against the Baha'is, particularly against democratic opposition, in Iran since 1979 is well known internationally. Amongst those actions are: the execution of at least 200 practising Baha'is; the current threat to a number of them that they also will be executed; the confiscation of their property; action by the government to deprive them of their right to inheritance; the closure of their educational institutions; their ban from government run educational institutions; the recent seizure of the statistical student records of the free university they established in an attempt to give members of their community education; the throwing out of 10,000 public servants because of their religious beliefs; the destruction of the 1844 site of the House of Bab, the establishment point of the religion, and its replacement by a road and car park; the sale of the original home of the founder of the religious group, the Baha'u'llah; and a series of measures that have been taken against the religion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is noteworthy that at the 53rd session of the Commission on Human Rights the Australian government at Geneva did indicate that it was disturbed by `continuing evidence of religious intolerance in Iran and strongly protests against the recent confirmation by the Supreme Court of Iran of death sentences for apostasy against two members of the Baha'i faith.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of Iran attempts to put on another face to its theocratic&hyphen;run persecution of minorities. It is worth noting that Gholam Hoseyn Raubarpour, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts&mdash;saying that, rather than people being prosecuted and threatened with death for religious practices, they were actually supposedly being tried for spying for Zionism in Israel&mdash;said that since August 1983 `no-one will be prosecuted or punished for having a specific ideology or view'. That, unfortunately, is in sharp contrast to part of the verdict on Dhabihullah Mahrami, one of the people currently facing death, when it was stated by the Revolutionary Court in Yazd:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerning the charges against Mr Dhabihullah Mahrami . . . ie denouncing the blessed religion of Islam and accepting the beliefs of the wayward Baha'i sect. . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was facing conviction for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having committed the most grievous sin, he remains firm in his baseless beliefs, he has, on three consecutive meetings, while being of sound body and mind and in absolute control, announced his allegiance to the principles of Baha'ism . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Essentially, despite the public rhetoric and the international attempt by the government at some stages to say that they have abandoned these decisions and that they reversed them, fundamentally, the reality by the Iranian regime is a systematic persecution of religious minorities. As we have seen recently in the German court system, despite the fact that Germany is the main economic supporter of the Iranian regime, the court has indicated the degree of connection between the current regime and the terrorist measures conducted against the Kurdish minority as well. There are also systematic examples of persecution of the Sunnis and the Christians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this private members motion does call for resolute continuing action by the Australian government on a multilateral and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4542"> bilateral front to ensure that this issue does not disappear. It is in conformity with resolutions in the US Congress and a number of United Nations human rights committees. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. Like the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), I would like to bring to the attention of this House the extent to which Iranian adherence of the Baha'i faith continues to be subject to the most appalling violations of their most basic human rights and liberties. Since the Islamic revolution, the government of Iran has carried out a systematic and organised attempt to destroy the Baha'i faith and demoralise its followers. At least 10,000 Baha'is are believed to have fled Iran since the late 1970s. Of the approximate 300,000 Baha'is who remained in Iran, over 200 have been killed, 15 others have disappeared and are presumed dead, hundreds have been imprisoned and tens of thousands have been deprived of real and personal property, jobs and educational opportunities. Baha'i holy places and cemeteries have been desecrated. Followers of the Baha'i in Iran today are forced to bury their dead in unmarked graves at a wasteland reserved for so-called infidels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I had the opportunity to meet with certain members of the Baha'i faith who live in my electorate. I heard many appalling stories of persecution and discrimination of Baha'is by Iranian clerical and civil authorities. One story that particularly moved me was that of Kiarash Firouzi, a 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Iranian Baha'i now living in Australia. Kiarash's experience is unfortunately not an atypical one for an Iranian follower of the Baha'i faith. When Kiarash was five years old his father was arrested solely on the grounds of being a Baha'i. Shortly thereafter Iranian officials also sent Kiarash's grandfather to prison, again solely on the basis of being a Baha'i. Tragically, both men were executed within nine months of each other in the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, Kiarash's family business and certain family properties were confiscated.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> After spending 10 months in prison, Kiarash's mother and uncle gathered family members and fled by motorcycle from Iran. Kiarash now resides in Sydney with his sister. They await their mother, who will be joining them soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Baha'is in Iran seek no special privileges. Rather, they desire only the most basic civil, social, cultural and economic rights that we in Australia take for granted&mdash;rights to which all persons, irrespective of their religious beliefs, are entitled under the international covenants of human rights to which Iran is a party. Continued external pressure through resolutions such as those passed by the Australian parliament and other nation states and international bodies since the 1980s has been absolutely critical in stemming the worst of the persecution of Iran's Islamic regime towards the Baha'is and other minority groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, in the past several months there has been a deterioration of the situation of the Baha'is in Iran. As of March 1997, the Australian Baha'i community was aware of 14 Baha'is who are imprisoned because of their religious beliefs, of whom four have been sentenced to death. It is therefore critical at this time that Australia use all available communications channels in a systemic and organised fashion to urge the government of Iran to cease immediately its continuing flagrant and appalling mistreatment of followers of the Baha'i faith as well as other minority groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of Iran's appalling human rights record is not a partisan one in this parliament. I know that my views on this matter are shared by the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn), the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) in particular as well as the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). I am confident that we can all agree here to condemn the Islamic Republic of Iran's failure to respond to the recommendations of Mr Abdelfattah Amor, UN Special Rapporteur for Religious Intolerance, regarding the violations of religious freedom in Iran and urge the government of Iran to take immediate steps to implement all those recommendations, particularly as they relate to the Baha'is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am hopeful that condemnation from Australia and others in the international community will make it impossible for Iran's new government to continue the country's flagrant disregard of international norms and its commitment under the various international conventions to which it is a party.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> affirms its support for untimed local calls for Internet users.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are approximately a million Internet users in Australia, and this figure is growing weekly. The people who use the Internet are not necessarily university boffins or computer whizzes but ordinary people&mdash;mums, dads and kids. As the great benefits of the Internet are becoming known, small business is starting to use it just as big business has already discovered its value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Internet is an outstanding resource for every user&mdash;whether they want information on how to roast coffee beans, as I did recently for a colleague, or a virtual tour of the Louvre in Paris or real-time pictures of sunrise over Las Vegas. Why anyone would want to see that is beyond me, but it is there. My speeches, my press releases and my newsletters are all on the Internet&mdash;and some on the other side might say the same about that. I am proud to know that every one of my constituents with access to the Internet can access my home page so they can know what I am doing, what I am up to, and can judge me accordingly, and they can e-mail me to let me know how they feel&mdash;which they are doing in increasing numbers, I am happy to report. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also access home pages of individual parliamentarians of the United States and Britain and keep in touch with them via e-mail. My staff also keep in touch with their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a brave new world of information and technology. Through Internet chat channels new friendships are being forged the world over. The globe is truly becoming a global village when a nurse in Washington, North Carolina, a dentist in Brescia, Italy, a writer in Perth, Australia, and a designer in Ottawa, Canada, can all get together and discuss family and day-to-day matters in a chat channel called CasinoBar&mdash;trivial stuff mostly but nevertheless stuff of good friendship and good fellowship. And that is just one of thousands of chat channels covering the full gamut of human interest topics the world over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a cost to access the Internet. The user must have a computer and the associated software. The user must then access an Internet service provider at the cost of a local telephone call and, once connected, can then communicate with the world. Internet service providers charge either on a `duration of link' basis or by monthly, quarterly or annual fees. Competition among service providers has kept fees low and, combined with cost of a local call access, affordable for all consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Affordability is one of the great things about the Internet and, for as long as users continue to have access to untimed local calls, this remarkable and exciting world bank of knowledge will continue to be accessed by mums, dads and kids throughout our community. I remain very concerned about the spectre of B-Party charging; that is, the charging of Internet service providers for receiving data calls. Such costs could do the same damage as timed local calls, for increased costs by ISPs would no doubt be charged back to the user.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to use an example provided by my constituent Peter Carnall of how the Internet is already economically beneficial to Australia. Peter's quarterly phone bill prior to being connected to the Internet was around $90. Twelve months later, after the installation of a second line, that bill is now $375 because
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4544"> of the phone calls to the many new friends around the world that he has made on the Net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The multiplier effect is staggering. He now mails postcards and letters to his friends which he would not have done normally. He mails packages that would not normally have been sent. He has sent CDs, books and souvenirs of Australia. He has travelled throughout Australia to meet his new friends. He has purchased many Internet publications and annual subscriptions. And Peter is just one user out of almost a million. He is `on the net' only because of the current low cost. Higher charges either on an untimed basis or increased fees by his ISP will give him only one option: to go off-line completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australia to remain a traveller on the information superhighway, Internet access must remain affordable to everyone and, whilst untimed local calls for Internet users must continue, imposts on service providers to provide their services as economically as possible must not become a potential extra cost for the user.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that the government has tackled the issue of untimed local calls positively and in the interests of the average Internet user. I would, however, be most alarmed if backdoor costs such as timed charges on Internet service providers meant that consumers would have to pay more for Internet access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are renowned for accepting and incorporating new technology in their daily lives. It is an unfortunate prospect that only the well off in our community may end up with access to the World Wide Web when it is a resource that must be available to everybody.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to rise to support this motion about the Internet. Few generations have the opportunity that we have to preside
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over a major transition point in the affairs of the human race. In the developed First World countries like Australia, the industrial revolution is, on the time scale we usually associate with these things, rapidly giving way to the information age. Soon, electronic mail will exceed the more traditional `snail mail'&mdash;no disrespect to Australia Post intended. Data transmissions will exceed voice over our telephone lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transition to a society dominated by digital information has been a sudden, almost brutal process as old ways of doing things have been swept aside in a few short decades since the introduction of the computer. The typewriter, the telex, carbon paper, vinyl records&mdash;all things most members of this parliament, even the younger members, grew up with&mdash;are now historic relics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The telephone companies have also been caught in this rapid transformation of the economy and social context of society which has accompanied the headlong rush into digital technology in the developed world. They have been left with a network built at massive cost. The value of the Australian network alone is in the order of $20 billion. But this network was quite reasonably constructed to work best with phones when used in the traditional manner. This means that, say, if 10 per cent of users want to make a phone call at any given time, under those circumstances they will all get dial tone. The average call lasts less than five minutes and all the customers are satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the digital age and the introduction of the Internet and the universal graphical web browser interface we use today. Now the World Wide Web dominates the telephone networks that were once designed for another purpose entirely. The consequences have been substantial. Telecommunications companies are now faced with a dilemma. Networks are expensive to build and maintain, but the marginal cost of a data transmission is falling fast as bandwidth increases. This explains the rush to add value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra and Optus are both investing massively in broadband services which deliver new content and hopefully generate new streams of revenue. But the issue of Internet
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4545"> use remains. The telecom companies assert that the networks are in danger of being swamped by calls which are held open for hours at a time and that more users now want access to lines at the same time. The spectre of picking up the phone and not getting any dial tone is raised. Is this threat real? That question has been pursued in the US of late and the answer seems to be that it is not. Internet users counter with the statistics of new second phone lines which have been installed for on-line access alone. These are a massive new revenue stream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the issue remains that the network was not built to cope with this deluge of data. In the recent major reform of telecommunications law, the government left open the option of timed local calls in this context. But the solution here is not timed local calls. That would act as a real and substantial disincentive for people to move to an on-line future. Rather, the network must grow and evolve. New transmission systems such as ATM and ISDN must become the norm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has done some great research. My recent visit to the TRL labs at Clayton showed me that Telstra in particular is at the leading edge of innovation when it comes to the Internet age. Its cable modems are a thing of joy and beauty to a person who started out on-line with a 300&hyphen;baud modem from Dick Smith. The prospect of megabytes per second leaves me straining at the leash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But timed local calls are a response of yesteryear. That answer looks backward, not forward. The real solution is to move from a plain, old telephone system to a communications system which is digital from end to end. If Australia is to be a major player in the international on-line economy, then this is a backdoor which should have been firmly slammed in the face of any telco that wants to exploit it. The prospect of timed local calls would kill the industry dead in its tracks and ensure that Australia is left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution lies in the evolution of the network to technology which is indeed already available. Telstra unfortunately missed the bus on ISDN, and even the new On-Ramp access costs are way too high. That, however, must be the way of the future. I urge the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government to reject the notion of timed local calls. That is a `back to the future' solution. The digital superhighway will brook no U-turns.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently the Internet resource is doubling in size every 12 to 15 months. The last survey by Network Wizards was in January 1997. At that time it found 514,760 sites with the top level domain name `au', which users will know indicates an Australian site. Worldwide, it found over 16,000,000 hosts in total. The `au' top level domain name was the 10th most commonly used name. By country, Australia ranks sixth in the world in the use of the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many faces of the Internet, including those covering public policy matters such as censorship, ownership, security, terrorism and charging practices. If we accept the growing evidence that the Internet, as an electronic `world library', will largely replace the presently used information system, then the major issues that arise are access and cost of access. To use a conventional library in Townsville, there is a cost to get to the door. But, once inside, usage is unlimited and free. Good public policy would be best served with a similar philosophy for the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly back Senator Alston's decision to prevent the introduction of timed local data calls. The view of Townsville Internet users, such as Tim Van Lint and Cathy Grainger, is that timed calls, whether charged to the originator or to the receiver, would seriously impact on the Internet usage of average people. Last week Jens Didriksen sent me a thoughtful e&hyphen;mail. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If timed local calls were ever introduced, many current users of the Internet could not afford continuing access and would likely disconnect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's becoming more and more important for Townsville families, especially with school age kids, to be able to stay connected to the Net. The kids must get the opportunity to grow up with this rapidly changing technology. It gives them a head start.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Considerable fears have been expressed to me via e-mail that the introduction of timed local data calls would force some Internet service providers out of the market. The Internet does create jobs. At a time when we are working to lower unemployment, it would seem short&hyphen;sighted to stifle what is a rapidly growing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days the Web is everywhere. Earlier this year, I was aboard the USS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independence</EMPHASIS> about 200 kilometres off the coast of Queensland. Every office on the warship had access to the Net. I was able to send mail back to Townsville instantaneously and electronically from the Pacific Ocean. With the Internet you can look in on a space shuttle mission orbiting the Earth or browse through the pages of history in libraries located in Europe and America. Transcripts of speeches made by Presidents and Prime Ministers can be accessed and analysed minutes after they have been presented. This year's budget, of course, was available entirely and immediately on budget night. A few short years ago, we could only dream of these sorts of possibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of interest in and awareness of the Internet is growing rapidly in Australia, and the home and family market is one of the fastest growing areas of all. The cost of the basic hardware and software needed to access e-mail and the Internet is now within the reach of the vast majority of Australians, and that cost is constantly falling. Each week and each month more and more Australians are discovering the Internet&mdash;discovering what it can do, where it can take them and what the boundaries are, and then pushing beyond them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a personal level, I find the Internet and electronic mail to be an increasingly important tool in my representation of the people of Townsville. I certainly want to see the benefits of the Net made available as widely as possible in an affordable way. I certainly thank the honourable member for Stirling (Mr

It is also an office located very much in the heart of the most ethnically diverse part of Melbourne. It is an office, however, which does not have the most elementary service of all to many aged and invalid people in particular and that is a toilet or access to a toilet.

I refer, in doing so, to a decision of the Senate last Friday afternoon to reject the government's mean&hyphen;fisted attempt to restrict the availability of employment services on a free basis to all Australians. The problem is that in the lead&hyphen;up to the debate the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, in a bull&hyphen;in&hyphen;a&hyphen;china&hyphen;shop approach, threatened to withdraw the Reform of Employment Services Bill from debate in the Senate. We are not talking about mickey mouse expenditure items being covered by this bill; we are talking about expenditure of the order of $1 billion per year. Yet, in the lead&hyphen;up to the debate last Friday, the senator suggested to all who would listen that, so far as she was concerned, she was not going to allow accountability and, if need be, she would withdraw the bill before the Senate and seek to implement her changes to employment services by regulatory action.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for the demonstration across the road was that the 14 workers who were sponsored by the Mandir Society to come out here from India and build the thing were not paid. Rather, they were paid but they were paid at the appalling rate of 51c an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workers were accommodated in outrageous circumstances: an old hall with inadequate&mdash;or no proper&mdash;cooking facilities and washing facilities. They shared three rooms amongst the 14 of them. They were not paid superannuation and they were not paid living away from home allowance. They had no protective clothing, there was inadequate scaffolding during the construction of the building, there was no fall protection and there was no first aid kit on site. The list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These workers who were brought out from India to build the temple were treated in the most appalling way. I believe&mdash;and I believe the majority of Australians would agree&mdash;that 51c an hour in Australian society is unacceptable.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point about that is that it is treating the symptom not the cause.

The 10&hyphen;point plan is designed to do exactly that. The 10&hyphen;point plan respects native title. It also respects the need to deliver that certainty and that consistency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General said that he is going to have to consider some fairly substantial changes to it at this stage whether he likes it or not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of some media reports in relation to the Kruger case and I can inform the House a little about the nature of it. The Kruger case began in 1995. It is a High Court case where a number of plaintiffs have claimed that the Commonwealth is legally liable for past practices of removal of Aboriginal children from their families and that the Commonwealth is liable for compensation. The Kruger case and the Bray case were both heard by the full court of the High Court in February 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government finalised its submission in relation to that matter in November 1995. At issue we saw the same questions that have been raised in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that is, the report of the national inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their parents and their families. Those issues are that the practices of past territory and state governments in removing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families were unconstitutional, were illegal, were a genocide and a cultural genocide, and were a restriction on freedom of association; and that compensation should be paid to those people who were subject to these practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly the issues were the same. Since the government tabled that report last week, the Labor opposition have claimed that the government should immediately admit liability and pay compensation for those past practices of various governments. But, if we look at the former government's response to the Kruger and Bray cases, we see that the issues were exactly the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see is that, in 1995, the Keating Labor government formally adopted a position where it denied any liability and denied calls for compensation. It is important to look at the report because, page by page, chapter by chapter, it takes up each of those issues. In chapter 1 it says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth pleads that . . . the Ordinance was in any event valid in that it was enacted for the purpose of the protection and preservation of persons of the Aboriginal race and was capable of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being reasonably considered to be (or alternatively was) appropriate and adapted to the achievement of that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth denies that it is liable in damages for a breach of the Constitution and pleads that the claims are statute barred or otherwise time barred.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In Chapter 9, it went on and said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that the Commonwealth is found to have been in breach of any constitutional rights, guarantees, immunities, freedoms or provisions of the Constitution as alleged Plaintiffs, the Commonwealth denies that any such breach gives rise to a personal right of action for damages in the Plaintiffs independent of any common law action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A further quote, if you look at it, can be found in relation to the genocide question. I found that one particularly pointed. In paragraphs 7 and 8, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear from the definition of the term genocide in the Genocide Convention, that before genocide will be committed, one or other of the acts listed in the article must have been carried out with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group as such. It is not sufficient to show that a law authorises certain acts in order for it to authorise genocide. It is necessary to show that the intent of the law, or acts authorised under the law, was the destruction of a racial group as such. The effect or likely effect of the act is not determinative, nor is its objective purpose. What must be shown is criminal intent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is interesting that, when questioned upon these matters, what we hear from members of the opposition now trying to defend their role in relation to this comes from people like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this morning, where he said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening is that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues wound themselves up last week, and they threw away any attempt at a bipartisan response to this report. They shamefully politicised the whole process. They tried to wrap themselves in a cloak of moral unction, which is their wont on so many of these issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I requested the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate the way in which each of the major banks passed on a 0.35 per cent reduction in their lead housing standard variable
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4556"> mortgage rate. The commission sought information from the four major banks about the timing of the decision to reduce rates, the basis for the decision not to pass on the 4.5 per cent cut, the terms and conditions for the reduction and the involvement of senior executives in any discussions about their decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of the banks has now replied. In essence, the banks have stated to the commission that the decision by each to reduce its rate by 0.35 per cent was made independently. That was made after an assessment of the effect the reduction in the rate would have on the cost of funds. The ANZ also indicated it took into account competitor activity when considering the reduction. The National Australia Bank decided to reduce its business rate by 0.5 per cent on 23 May, to be effected from 30 June. Of course, the most significant event of last week was the decision by the ANZ Bank, which reconsidered the issue, on 27 May to cut its mortgage rates by 0.56 per cent, a move I welcomed last week because it made the ANZ Bank the most competitive of the major banks in the home mortgage market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACCC will continue to be, and be requested to be by the government, a vigilant regulator and enforcer of the Trade Practices Act. The banking sector should have no doubt at all that, as far as this government is concerned, it wants to see the most competitive financial sector in Australia that is possible. There are a number of recommendations contained in the Wallis report which are aimed at injecting and infusing greater competition into the financial sector such as opening up the payment system and creating regulators which will allow deposit taking institutions to grow and compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be responding to the Wallis report in due course, but I wish to underline again that, as far as this government is concerned, we believe that interest rate reductions are for the benefit of borrowers and not for the benefit of banks. The best way to pass on to borrowers the full advantage of lower interest rates is to ensure that there is heightened competition in the sector, the kind of competition that will ensure that those
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits are delivered to consumers and delivered expeditiously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the other element in relation to this. It is not just the quantum of the amount of the interest rate reduction which is to be passed on but the timeliness with which it is to be passed on. I would again say to consumers that the best way to get the best deal out of a financial institution is to shop around. Make sure that competition works for you and  that those banks or other financial institutions that offer the most competitive outcome are seen to achieve the kind of custom which rewards efficiency and competitiveness in the financial sector.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were in there in November 1995 saying, `No compensation.' You were arguing against the proposition of intergenerational responsibility. You were justifying these practices on the grounds that they were sanctioned by law and that they were designed at the time to assist the people whom they affected. That is the very argument that I have used. That is the very argument which is relevant to so much of what has gone on in relation to this issue over the past few days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take the opportunity to say in relation to the government's response to the report that the government will respond very speedily to this report. I have read all of the recommendations and I have read very substantial sections of the report. Let me say, without in any way pre-empting the response, that there are many things contained in the recommendations in that report that I believe all members of this parliament will want to implement and will want to implement very speedily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already expressed, as many others have, my deep sorrow about injustices suffered by Aboriginal Australians under the policies and practices of earlier generations. I know that these feelings of sorrow, regret and, indeed, sadness are shared by most Australians. My government does not support a formal national apology. It believes that to do so is to indicate in some way that present generations of Australians are responsible and can be held accountable for the errors, wrongs and misdeeds of earlier generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apologising for something clearly implies some direct personal responsibility. An unwillingness to deliver a formal apology in no way connotes insensitivity or lack of sympathy. Rather, it is a statement of the obvious. Present generations of Australians are not responsible for the errors of earlier generations, particularly when the act involved was sanctioned by law and believed at the time to be for the benefit of the people affected. Indeed&mdash;and this is relevant to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;that was the basis of the Keating government's submission in November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the very basis, the cornerstone, the essence of the submission of the Keating
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4560"> government in November 1995; a submission that the Leader of the Opposition was perfectly happy, along with his deputy, to embrace when they were in government. Now for cheap, opportunistic political purposes in opposition they are taking a difference stance. They argued then that the practices which were the subject of that case had been for the protection and preservation of the persons of the Aboriginal race and must be considered by the standards and perceptions of that time, not by reference to contemporary standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were not my words; they were the words of Beazley, Keating and Evans in November 1995, and no amount of verbal gyration and gymnastics by the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who pretends that he was not at the crucial cabinet meeting, can alter the fact that you have been utterly inconsistent, utterly hypocritical and 100 per cent caught out for your duplicity on this issue.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Last week I drew to the attention of the House that the Labor Party in opposition had decided to oppose the sale of AN and to try to block it through its passage in the parliament. In the process last week I drew to the attention of the House the views of workers at AN's workshop at Port Augusta. I read from a letter that was written by those AN workers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with many Australians and, I believe, many in this House, I am deeply saddened and distressed by the very high rate of suicide amongst our young people in Australia today. It is a rate that is the fifth highest in comparable industrialised countries today and there has sadly been a trend of increasing rates of youth suicide in Australia from 1984 to 1992. This is particularly marked for young men, and particularly for young men in rural communities. The deaths of young men from suicide have increased in the 15 to 24 age group from 258 in 1985 to 350 in 1995. It is indeed a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must continue to ask questions as to why this is happening in our country today and explore the best way we can help our young people and support the families and communities whose lives are touched by this tragedy. We are committed to addressing the issue because of the tragic consequences in people's lives. It is not a single issue problem; a series of complex questions that needs to be asked in relation to this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government, since taking office, has already taken a leadership role in addressing and trying to prevent the problem of youth suicide in our community. We have allocated $31 million in total to prevention programs, and this goes to very practical support programs such as the kids help line and the Lifeline programs. We know that many young people, when they are contemplating suicide, telephone those agencies as their first point of contact because they can remain anonymous in so doing. I was pleased to launch the new Lifeline youth line service, which is available to young people wherever they are in Australia for the cost of a local calling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to improving funding for the help lines and the lifelines, we have also enhanced youth counselling services in recognition of the particular problem in rural Australia. We have also put into place support programs that will guide and assist parents to recognise the symptoms in their young people and to support and help them with their grief after someone in their family has committed suicide. We have placed a great deal of emphasis on putting in place protocols to help our health professionals, including our medical profession and indeed hospitals, so that they understand more about the problem in the community, the symptoms and how they can assist. In addition to that, we are working with the media to develop a media code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have continued to place some emphasis on research, particularly research into childhood mental health, with a focus on identifying and addressing long-term causal factors which lead to adolescent suicide and attempted suicide. I believe that the money we have allocated to support these initiatives and that particularly target young people at risk of suicide will go some of the way towards addressing the problem. As I said, the causes of youth suicide are complex and it is a problem that we need to work together on as a whole community with government if we are to reduce the rate of suicide in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge young people all over Australia, if they are feeling lonely and they are feeling distressed, to please pick up the phone and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4565"> access the services that are available.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He is quite right to point to, as he did in his prefatory remarks, the lack of cooperation and the division that used to rack these Labour Ministers Council meetings under the previous administration. I suppose the high point of that was when the former Labor government ratified the unfair dismissal convention and used that as a means of overriding the state schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, the ministers responsible for industrial relations, otherwise known as the labour ministers, did attend the meeting on Friday, including the relevant minister from New South Wales. It was well attended. The meeting was marked by a particularly cooperative attitude to some of the very important issues that we are approaching. There are a number of those. Firstly, we have agreed to really push on with this concept of harmonising the systems, and that is basically to make the systems easier for people to operate. By making them easier to operate, you can lower the cost for business and that gives business the wherewithal to improve its productivity to ultimately give more people jobs. So lowering the costs of the system is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also agreed to take steps towards a national approach in respect of industrial relations practices in the building and construction industry. This is also especially important because, as most honourable members would be aware, we do have some practices in the building industry which are in breach of good standards. For example, too often still on building sites today we see instances of compulsory unionism. That is in breach of freedom of association provisions in federal law and in various state laws and we now have a means by which we can deal with that on a cooperative basis nationally. The industrial relations elements of a national building construction code will be incorporated in a code at the construction council ministers meeting in August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also came to a common view about certain aspects of workers compensation. For example, we are looking at and encouraging the idea of mutual recognition which, for big national companies operating in more than one jurisdiction, holds out the prospect of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4566"> simplifying the system, ultimately thereby lowering costs and also paving the way to more jobs through higher efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, we had a general and agreed view in respect of the conduct of wages policy and in this instance the ministers were speaking on behalf of their respective governments as important employers in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compared with the days of division and lack of cooperation, I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that we had a very constructive meeting and we are working on a lot of practical benefits for the business community which, ultimately, will provide benefits to small business, big business and, most importantly, to employees.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for McEwen for her question because the truth of the matter is that one of the really important things we have had to deal with in industrial relations reform is trying to modernise the system to make it relevant to people who are in the system today. I think it is a fair generalisation to say that the trouble with the system which we inherited is that, basically, it was a system run by blokes for blokes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for the casualisation of the work force, particularly as it impacted on women, was that people were essentially offering only casual work to women because of the unfair dismissal system. Another one of the reasons why we have seen an explosion in casual employment is that the opportunities for regular part-time work were in effect barred in so many awards. That is why we legislated to remove those bars&mdash;so that people have a real choice as to whether or not they have regular part-time work or casual work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing some positive developments. We actually put in as an objective of this legislation that it assist families to better match their work and family responsibilities. If you look at the legislation, in addition to the part-time provisions I have just referred to, we have also made the agreement making processes much easier. The reason that is important in a practical way, particularly for women, is that it gives them a chance to actually have an agreement that suits their own circumstances, trying to pick up and match their time requirements, particularly in terms of dealing with children. So we have got the objects in the act and we have got a series of changes in the act, all of which are aimed to modernise the system to make it easier for people to balance work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have gone one step further. We have a series of practical measures in addition to the legislation aimed at reinforcing the point. So, for example, we have these work and family awards, which I was recently associated with. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> did a very

I have been in this place long enough not to rely on explanations of cases put by members at question time. I remind the honourable member that none of the proposals in relation to the unfair dismissal law that are being put forward by me or by the Minister for Industrial Relations in any way takes out of the act prohibitions against certain unlawful terminations.

So the bloke who you think is all right on this subject thinks that what you are trying to knock off is the jewel in the crown of our proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me continue. The Workplace Relations Act retains, despite any changes that might be made in the unfair dismissal law, a widespread number of prohibitions on such things as temporary absence from work because of illness or injury, union membership or non&hyphen;membership, seeking office or acting as a representative employee, filing of a complaint of participation, alleged violation of laws in recourse to competent administrative authorities, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibility, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that there will remain in the legislation&mdash;even if the unfair dismissal exemption is extended&mdash;a widespread number of prohibitions on unlawful termination.

Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.

Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate.

Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument.

The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus on environmental awareness for people, especially children to learn that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses.

<PARA STYLE="Para">In October 1995 the ecstasy induced death of Sydney teenager, Anna Wood, drew an outpouring of public grief the likes of which is rarely seen in our society. Anna Wood was just 15. She was not by any definition of the term a drug addict, nor was she a veteran in the use of hard drugs. Barely a kilometre outside the boundary of my electorate in the suburb of Cabramatta, children as young as 11 and 12 are daily sitting in the frigid stairwells of car parks and the putrid stalls of public toilet blocks sticking used, dirty needles into their arms and injecting themselves with $30 hits of heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These children, unlike Anna Wood, are addicts. The track marks in their arms indicate habitual heroin use. But where is the communal outcry that surrounded Anna Wood's tragic death? People are aware that Cabramatta is the centre of a thriving drug culture, but they are inured to the depth and the wretchedness of the tragedy that is being played out in these streets every day of the week. Meanwhile, the kids there just keep shooting up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite obviously society, governments at all levels and of all political persuasions, parents and families have failed these children. At the same time it is quite obvious that, as far as drug availability is concerned, our war against drugs has been an equally disappointing fail
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ure. Heroin is more widely available now for the young people living in the electorates of Prospect, Fowler, Blaxland and Werriwa, just to name a few, than it has ever been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well known that lying at the root of heroin abuse in south&hyphen;western Sydney in particular is the region's endemic unemployment problem. It is unemployment which leads to the family breakdown and social dislocation which pushes people towards seeking solace in drugs. It is unemployment which leads to the boredom and apathy among our young people which fosters their interest in experimenting with heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reducing unemployment would be a terrific start in combating south&hyphen;west Sydney's heroin plague, but what else can be done? It depends on whom you ask, and I think there lies our problem. As long as we remain so hopelessly divided in regard to reaching a solution on heroin, then improving our current circumstances will remain outside our grasp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I want to again alert the national parliament, especially our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the members of his government, to the grave extent of the heroin trade in south&hyphen;western Sydney and, in particular, my area of Fairfield and Cabramatta. I do so with the hope that by raising my voice I will encourage a rethink from all levels of government and from both sides of politics about more effective ways of combating what has become an enormously devastating social problem in my area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a cancer growing in south&hyphen;western Sydney. It is a cancer which is devouring the young and the innocent so rapidly and is causing such untold hardship and distress for hundreds of families that I believe it should be labelled a national emergency. It is definitely a disaster which is crying out for a solution from the highest level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people most often highlighted as driving Cabramatta's drug trade are those said to come from outside the area: young people making the trip into our community by rail on the now infamous `Cabramatta express'. But these people do not, by any means, provide the trade's driving force. About 50 per cent of the clients who use the needle syringe exchange program at Cabramatta Community
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4574"> Centre and the Outreach bus actually live in the Fairfield local government area. This is increasing as more local young people are caught up in the cycle of heroin abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Lisa Maher from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre&mdash;NDARC&mdash;is a person whose experience I have drawn on and mentioned in this House before. As part of her research activities, in May last year Dr Maher interviewed 120 kids about their heroin use. Seventy-five per cent of these young people lived in south&hyphen;western Sydney, 33 per cent in Cabramatta itself. Outsiders they are not. Dr Maher has made another terrifying find about the heroin users in the area. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youngest I know of are 11 and 12. They're definitely the youngest addicts I've ever seen. But what really concerns me is the number of them. There must be several hundred.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These kids live in my electorate and in the electorates of other speakers in today's debate: the member for Fowler (Mr Grace), the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton). Indeed, a recent survey of one of our local high schools revealed that 11 per cent of 13&hyphen;year&hyphen;old students had tried heroin. What a damning statistic to be recorded in our national parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The spin-off effects of such a deep-seated heroin problem in our area is clear. We have a crime rate in south-western Sydney which is growing faster than we can allocate resources to fight it. The improper disposal of used syringes throughout my community is causing parents to tear their hair out in fear and frustration as their children pick their way to school across areas littered with hundreds of bloody syringes. Again I ask: what is to be done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first step towards nearing a solution is admitting to ourselves that our previous policies aimed at combating the heroin trade have quite obviously failed. Such an admission hurts but the fact is that, as long as there exists a demand for heroin in our community, it will be supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority concluded as far back as 1988:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the evidence shows, however, not only that our law enforcement agencies have not succeeded in preventing the supply of illicit drugs to Australian markets, but that it is unrealistic to expect them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has been estimated that in New South Wales alone there are currently 61,000 people who regularly inject heroin. Death rates due to illicit drugs are increasing. It is also estimated that only 17 per cent of the heroin illegally entering this country of ours is seized. The cost to our economy of illicit drugs has been stated to be of the order of 0.5 per cent of the GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But an admission of past failure does not mean we cannot make an improvement, perhaps a vast improvement, in the future. What is obvious is that we need new ideas. Is the most effective way of combating the heroin trade prescribing the drug to addicts? Or is it throwing even greater money and resources at the problem and escalating our war on drugs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time is against me dissecting the legalisation question in any great depth, but I would say that whatever new directions we take in relation to the trade of heroin and other illicit drugs we should decide upon them at a national level. That is why I call on the Prime Minister here today to convene a national drug summit featuring federal, state and territory health ministers, attorneys-general, police, judicial authorities, experts in the field of drug and heroin dependency and representatives from local government, social welfare and religious groups in order to discuss new approaches to illegal drugs and, in particular, to obtain a national solution to the heroin problem. It is only by taking a national approach on this issue that we can hope to bridge the divisions which exist on the different approaches open to us in combating illegal drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can organise summits of premiers, chief ministers and police ministers to discuss national gun laws in the wake of the 35 people who lost their lives so tragically at Port Arthur then surely we can do the same, only on a larger scale, in order to develop new approaches for illegal drugs and for the heroin which is killing hundreds of people around this country each year. Of course, new
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4575"> directions are currently being sought by various state and territory governments and health authorities in relation to heroin and I acknowledge that. I congratulate the South West Sydney Area Health Service for establishing a needle disposal hotline which will enable residents to call a toll-free number and have health department staff pick up improperly disposed needles within 48 hours of them being reported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, I suggest state public health authorities pick up the recent suggestion of the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) in this House regarding the provision of syringes, which are manufactured by the Victorian company Uni-Ject Australia, as part of their needle exchange programs. These particular syringes allow the needle point to be sucked back inside the syringe casing after use, thereby drastically reducing any chance of a needle stick injury. These are small but valuable steps towards alleviating the burdens of heroin abuse on our communities. But there are big steps yet to be taken and that is why I believe a national drug summit is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to say again to our Prime Minister and to the government: it is not an overdramatisation to label the situation that we face in south&hyphen;western Sydney as a national emergency. A national emergency requires a national solution. The old ways of fighting the heroin trade and heroin abuse have largely failed. Let us convene a national drug summit and let us take some new approaches towards combating heroin and other illegal drugs. To the Prime Minister and government and all members of this House I say that the young people and the families in my area are looking to you all for the leadership required to help remove the cancer which lies at our community's heart. Please do not let them down.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of drugs affects the users, in terms of hepatitis C&mdash;and the numerous other forms of hepatitis that are being discovered every day&mdash;HIV, overdose, loss of employment, loss of self&hyphen;esteem, the breakdown of families, social isolation, dropping out of school and, ultimately, the stress and possible suicides that result from low self&hyphen;esteem from drug use. Then there is the harm to our community: the needles on the streets&mdash;already mentioned by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio)&mdash;drug related crime, children dropping out of families, the pressure on the parents, siblings and children of users, the assaults that are drug related, the break and enters and the acquisitive crimes. The costs to the community and the harm done to the community are enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is government expenditure on policing, court action, legal aid, incarceration, Customs, the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority, ambulance services, social welfare services, absenteeism from places of employment, health and public campaigns on HIV and hep C.

With that came a number of education programs in New South Wales. Drug action teams were formed. Premier amongst those is the Fairfield drug action team. They are trying a number of strategies for the local area. They are looking at the local problem, the local suppliers and the local community&mdash;what works in that community. They are having a number of successes in that area. They have put in television surveillance in the area. They are still having minor problems in responding to incidents that are detected, but they are on the way down the path to something that may combat the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been the Model Criminal Code. Again, that is a recent innovation. It was
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4576"> announced on Friday, and it is open for submissions until 31 August this year. We are trying to coordinate all the major drug offences nationally and come up with a national criminal code on this issue. It is important to target the suppliers of the drugs. It is a commercial activity, and each user relies on further users to supply his or her habit. Therefore, you have a recruitment program running. Our young people are targeted because the business relies on new users, so it is the very commercial aspect of this organised crime which needs to be combated. Often it seems bigger penalties for the user simply end at greater costs in prison and social welfare systems. We are moving in the right direction with the Model Criminal Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the Health Insurance Commission. Over the next 3&half; years $5.25 million will be spent to establish a number of specialist staff to address the issue of doctor shopping and, especially in the Cabramatta&hyphen;Fairfield areas, that has been targeted and statistics are being gathered. People who are seen to be visiting more than 15 doctors a year are being encouraged to change their behaviour. There is prosecution of people who are illegally using prescription drugs or abusing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Furthermore, professional bodies are being encouraged to take action against any of the professional traders in the area who are abusing the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1996, we also had a conference in Hobart on the reduction of drug related harm. There was a group from this Australian parliament interested in drug law reform, and a number of interesting recommendations came out of that. We are looking at success rates in the Netherlands and Switzerland, at what is happening in the Bronx, New York and around the world. We are monitoring what is happening in other parts of the world, and looking at possible avenues down which government in Australia can go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, we are also looking at a further detox unit for Fairfield hospital. It is important that those sorts of measures are supported by the community. Quite frequently, when methadone clinics are inserted into a community, it is done in such a way that the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drug related harm is even more extensive. You have a drop off in business and small businesses in an area, you have higher exposure to discarded syringes and a number of other social spin&hyphen;offs from that. We have to look at the way we are providing alternative support systems for drug users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy to throw the book at people and throw more money at a problem, but it is important&mdash;before we legislate for further money and a national summit to discuss the problem yet again&mdash;to get out into the small parts of the community and find out what is at issue. If unemployment is causing the drug problem, then perhaps work for the dole will be successful in those areas. Perhaps it is worth trialling a pilot program in that area. If it is drug use that is causing the unemployment, then we are back at the state we are in now of combating drug misuse problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drug action teams are going a long way to dealing with the problem. They are involving the local social work teams, the local methadone suppliers, the local police, the local councillors. You are getting an organised, humane community response to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an enormous problem facing society. By and large, government can put legislation in place and provide finance. I would stop short of saying any previous attempts by government have failed. It is a recognised problem. This is not a problem that appeared in Fairfield and Cabramatta on 2 March 1996; it has been there since 1980.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard to say whether $30 a cap or $390 a gram for the current street value of heroin indicates that there is a growth market. When I was working in probation and parole in 1986, that was about the street value of heroin at that time. It is probably keeping up with CPI. It also gives an indication as to supply and potential demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we need to look at education and family support, at keeping the drug user within a family system, within a social system and within employment, and putting a lot of measures in place to support them through the lifetime of their habit. Most habits have a lifetime of about 10 years. If the drug addict survives&mdash;does not overdose or kill them
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4577"> selves&mdash;generally they seek to leave the habit themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drug addiction is not like work. You cannot take Saturdays and Sundays off. You cannot take a sickie. It does not matter if you have the flu. You must score. It is a full-time, seven&hyphen;days&hyphen;a&hyphen;week, 366&hyphen;days&hyphen;a&hyphen;year addiction. Generally, most people come to the conclusion over time that they will voluntarily remove themselves from that addiction or will take enormous strides to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is that, when they reach that point in their personal life where they want to make that decision, they have the support networks in place to help them make it. It is probably a matter of carrying the addicts, doing further research, further refining programs already in place and making a very sympathetic and well&hyphen;funded contribution to this problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes allowed for me to speak, I first would like to support the remarks of my colleague the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) calling for a national conference. While some of the remarks made by the previous speaker, the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), were no doubt of value, some of the things that she said were being done at present have been a complete failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to rush ahead and tell you of an hour I spent in my electorate of Fowler, which Cabramatta is part of, on Saturday. Assume that I am a new member and you have never heard me speak before. You heard the previous member refer to the price of a cap. I have with me a cap, which has probably never been seen in parliament before. Anybody who is interested in seeing one may come to my office. It has been fumigated so it is quite safe. Caps are sold on the market now for between $30 and $70.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stupid thing about these caps and the law&mdash;I know my speech will get a bit convoluted because I have only five minutes to get about 80 hours of talk in&mdash;is that a person can carry 47 of these caps, which roughly contains 2.8 grams of heroin, and cannot be convicted of trading. That is how ridiculous our laws are. Just mark what I am saying to you: unless a person is caught in the act of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exchanging money, they cannot be gaoled for trading in heroin, and they can carry just under three grams. That is how stupid it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Saturday, in the company of two very prominent businessmen who demanded of me that I not name them here&mdash;that will tell you how serious it is&mdash;we visited an area in one block of flats. In the stairwell of two blocks of flats we counted 180 caps. I will not tell you how many needles we counted which obviously had been used within that morning, because you would not believe me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 17 May, which is only a fortnight ago, a collection of these businessmen and community leaders met in Cabramatta in secret because they were afraid to have their names divulged. They met as a result of the New South Wales Premier's statement, which was quoted by the member for Prospect, about heroin trading, particularly in Cabramatta, being a national disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Cabramatta alone, 97 deaths have occurred since 1993, which is not a very great number of years ago. On one patrol, I had the very distasteful job of pulling out one of those drug addicts from under a stairwell. I go down there regularly. I want you to listen to what I am telling you as if you have never heard me speak about this before. The walk that I went on last Saturday was no more than 100 yards across two streets. That is the disgraceful situation that exists there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to say that we need money, but we need money for undercover police. It is no good dressing police up and putting them out on the street. It is completely useless. All these characters see them and they behave like normal human beings; cops go around the corner and they are back in business again. We need undercover police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good saying that we cannot afford them&mdash;we could afford 350 police to protect the `Oxleymoron' last Friday night. But we cannot send another 50 police under cover to Cabramatta. Our priorities are wrong. The law has to be wrong if you can carry these items with you and not be convicted as a dealer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I respectfully take exception to the remarks of the member for Lindsay about 2 March. We are not blaming the present government
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4578"> at all. Forget about that. We are asking you to do something now. If I have to say that nobody else has done it, I will say it. We want your Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to immediately convene a national conference. That is all. All you can do is win. You cannot lose. We need it, and we need it urgently. I am here to plead on behalf of the business people and the community of Cabramatta. You mentioned the cost to the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find a great deal with which I can concur in the motion of the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). Certainly, the problems now being experienced in Cabramatta represent something that never before has been seen in a local Australian community. It is arguably one of our most spectacular failures in social, health and criminal law policy in the country. I think it is something approaching a national emergency. It probably would benefit from the direction of some national resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect and, likewise, the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) have talked about some of the local impacts, as did my colleague the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly). In south&hyphen;west Sydney, there were 44 deaths by heroin overdose in 1995, which was an increase of 120 per cent on the figure for 1992, which gives you some feeling for the escalation of the problem. Some 59 per cent of those fatalities took place in Cabramatta. Of those, 71 per cent occurred in public places, including 92 per cent of those who died in Cabramatta. Currently, there are about 35 cases a week of ambulance officers reviving and, hopefully, resuscitating those suffering from drug overdoses. So the drug overdose rate has increased by about 180 per cent since 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give you some idea of the grim realities, 50 per cent died in the street, nine per cent died in a public toilet and seven per cent died at a railway station. It is a situation that is accelerating at a grave rate and one in which, I think it is fair to say, our responses to date, whatever their logic, whatever their mix, are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clearly not working or not working satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the member's motion calls for `more effective ways of combating what has become one of Australia's most serious social problems'. That, of course, is the great challenge. I personally have some reservations about the logic and practice of some aspects of harm minimisation, but I note, to be fair to my colleagues in the Labor Party both here and at the state level, harm minimisation is not an electorally popular course of action and it involves some political risk. There are many of my colleagues on this side of the House who would support it, such as the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who is more expert than I and former head of the Australian Medical Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns are largely mirrored by the Mayor of Fairfield, who has raised some deep concerns about the impact, for example, of needle distribution services. I note that one of the local child-care centres, the Fisher Street child&hyphen;care centre, has had to be shut down because needles have just been left around the place, out in playgrounds, and have exposed children to serious risk. I accept that that is part of the logic of a much more intensive needle distribution service on the basis that drug users can inject on site and dispose of needles without actually leaving the premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have to say that I still retain this, some might say, reactionary reflex which is reluctant to see governments give some form of sanction to a form of behaviour which has lethal consequences. So while I do not come to this motion in a sort of tub thumping, rhetorical way, I do, nonetheless, express this concern: I am reluctant to see governments give a sanction to what is a lethal habit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay mentioned what was happening in New York. There 1,200 officers have been dedicated to a key area. The member for Prospect talked about the focus on users and needing to move away to suppliers in the major drug rings. That is what they have done under Mayor Giuliani in New York. They have had a 20 per cent reduction in narcotics related offences. In my view, we need to continue a war on drugs. We ought not just give up, we ought not just accept that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4579"> it is impossible and that it is here to stay, but we ought, as the member for Lindsay said, to seek to mobilise the whole community in an educational campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I salute the efforts of Father Chris Riley from Youth Off the Streets, who is now running a basketball clinic in the heart of Cabramatta, and he is running a TAFE program to encourage literacy and numeracy skills. We have to take a whole of life approach to this. I believe that important steps are being taken in that direction. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) in relation to this motion on heroin trade. This is not a new problem. This is not a problem that has arisen on its own or sui generis in Cabramatta and in Fairfield. The problem of the use and abuse of heroin within Australia and the south&hyphen;west and western suburbs of Sydney is a very old one. This drug is devastating. It does not just go back to 1980. It was there in the 1970s. It was there in the 1960s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen person after person kill themselves through overdosing on heroin or electrocuting themselves after a period of five, 10 or more years using and abusing heroin and other substances. In the 1970s in my suburb of Bankstown, heroin use was in plague proportions. I have seen people that I went to school with die as a result of using heroin. I have seen people that I went to school with and know well go to gaol for 14 years as a result of being caught doing armed hold ups and robberies, and I have seen them spend those years in gaol, some to die there and others to come out and be rehabilitated. I have seen a state government attempt to grapple with the problems of heroin abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was directly involved a number of years ago in getting a tripling of funding for the methadone program in New South Wales at a time when a number of people thought that methadone use was almost as bad as the use of heroin, but it has proven over time to be one valid and sensible recourse to get people off heroin and its misuse and to bring them back into the community so that they do not all have to go to gaol, they do not all have to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continue to destroy their very families and destroy their friends and acquaintances by bringing them into the circle of use. One individual basically needs 10 to 12 of their friends to support their habit. I have seen clusters of individuals destroy their lives and destroy the lives of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the situation in Cabramatta, Fairfield and Bankstown in my electorate has become worse because of the increasingly ready availability of much purer heroin. We read in recent reports that the drug cartels in South America, having filled themselves up to capacity with the production of cocaine, have now moved to grow opium in Latin America and that opium is being sold in the United States. As a result of that, the South&hyphen;East Asian marketeers of opium and refined heroin are being locked out of the United States market, by and large, and are flooding Australia with relatively cheap product, product that is more powerful than what was available previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think this is an easy problem to solve. It never has been and it never will be. It does not just go to the legislative constraints on people; it goes to the very question of people's behaviour and intent. I have seen generation after generation of young people in Bankstown falling into the use of illicit drugs, imperilling their lives and the lives, safety and health of their entire families and, in fact, destroying them utterly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect is quite right&mdash;particularly in relation to the misuse of heroin in the last few years and its now much greater availability, greater strength and greater attraction for even larger numbers of school children in the south-west of Sydney&mdash;it is important now that we not just leave this matter to the states, that we not just leave it to the national drug offensive that we ran for a number of years but that we do call for a national summit to try to solve this problem on a national basis and look at overseas experience, as we have in the past, to drive towards a better, stronger and more sensible solution to a social problem that has ripped apart the fabric of this society for generations now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) for raising this important social issue in this House. The problem of the supply of heroin, particularly in the Cabramatta area, has much to do with a code of silence instilled through fear upon the respectable Cabramatta community by gangs of young males whose only fear is deportation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Detection of large-scale suppliers is extremely difficult. Rather than give in to the criminal element and encourage other Cabramattas elsewhere, we must use every means at our disposal to develop more sophisticated techniques of detection. Why not introduce more police into the area and continually harass and arrest street dealers? We should move dealers away from the usual points of sale and make it more difficult for users to find their sellers. This worked in Sweden, and the cost factor must be far less than the suggested alternative of shooting up houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the suggestion of establishing shooting up houses, an extension of the needle exchange program has also been suggested. However, 80 per cent of the users come from other areas and such initiatives must cause addicts to remain in, not depart, the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That used syringes are being discarded recklessly illustrates that addicts are not exchanging them. Further, a serious hepatitis C virus infection problem amongst intravenous drug users alone, about 6,000 new chronic infections per year, illustrates that addicts are still sharing needles, despite the needle exchange. It is recommended that intravenous drug users be encouraged not to use needles. The needle exchange program does the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Internationally, many countries are turning to rapid opioid detoxification as an answer to addiction. A pure opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or naltrexone, is administered while the addict is anaesthetised, thus avoiding painful withdrawal. The patient is then maintained on naltrexone which, together with psychotherapy, has yielded lengthy abstinence rates&mdash;for example, 80 per cent for six months and 67 per cent for nine months. It
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provides rapid, effective and painless detoxification which addicts do not have to fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States, general anaesthesia can be carried out in a doctor's office or outpatient clinic. In the United States, the cost is about $2,500 per patient. Further post&hyphen;operative maintenance with naltrexone is much cheaper than methadone and is in tablet form. It is not a drug of abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rapid opioid detoxification is much cheaper than the estimated ongoing annual cost of $10,000 per addict per annum to supply legal heroin. The proposal to supply legal heroin to addicts in the ACT is not necessary and is itself fraught with danger. It has never been successful internationally. There are those addicts who wish to maintain their lifestyle and who will use as much as they can get. Legal supply must supplement illegal supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that we have 59,000 to 110,000 heroin addicts. If this program has any merit, we must look at maintaining a large proportion of that number. Of this we must add a continuing increasing population of addicts moving through from casual use. The cost factor will be prohibitive, as it was in Britain once the number of addicts exceeded 1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could well look to successful international programs such as in Sweden, where cannabis is regarded as a recruitment drug and massive education of its harms has resulted in reducing the population of heavy drug users. Rehabilitation programs can include rapid opioid detoxification. Addicts could be coerced into it through court direction or it could be provided as an alternative to serving out a sentence or as a condition of parole. The Cabramatta area, being the draw card it is because of the purity of heroin, could be targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harm reduction was introduced as our national policy at the national drug summit in 1985. It is a policy that promotes toleration of use by using responsible needle exchange and legal heroin programs. This has been shown to be a failure. It is highly promoted by the international legalisation movement and it is said by international drug experts to be one of the major reasons for permissive use. It is time we discarded it as a failure and in its
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4581"> stead devise a policy that gives a message of hope to the community and a loud warning that our governments will not tolerate drug use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that since the adoption of harm reduction our problems have worsened; hence, the increased use of drugs. It is time that we shed them and adopted sensible and cost effective programs that will reduce use and help addicts shed their addiction, not maintain it, and assist, not hamper, our law enforcement policies to make effective their deterrent. It is time that we got fair dinkum in fighting drugs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) for bringing this motion before the House. She is bringing parliamentary attention to one of the leading public issues in her electorate&mdash;indeed, a leading issue throughout the Sydney metropolitan area. This is not an issue, however, that can be judged through racial stereotypes. The problem of drug trafficking affects all parts of our community. The victims and criminals alike, sadly enough, cross all forms of social and economic diversity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the community debate there is, naturally enough, a call for ever tougher laws and tougher penalties. Australians perceive few more heinous crimes than trafficking in heavy drugs, especially peddling them to our youth. Fair minded, decent citizens&mdash;parents who fear for the wellbeing of their children&mdash;want law enforcement which matches the scale of law violation. They want social penalties which match the scale of the crime against society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important debate and these are important points to make, but so too is our responsibility as parliamentarians to address the causes of crime. Without young Australians feeling the need to turn to drugs, there can be no drug trafficking. The social cancer of heroin trade, outlined by the member for Prospect, tells us that something has gone terribly wrong in our society. It tells us that our cohesiveness and strength as a society have eroded much too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence of the recent New South Wales royal commission tells us that our
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> social trust is diminished to the point where some of those employed to police our laws are more the law breakers than law enforcers. The sound, honest police now working in Cabramatta and Fairfield carry an even greater weight of public responsibility and social trust. Governments must find new ways to rebuild our basic sense of community and social connectedness. There is no more effective way for dealing with the causes of crime than this approach. So too we need to offer better pathways of trust and security for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often said that this is an era of uncertainty and insecurity; a time when uncertainty abounds. The public debate about insecurity is too frequently directed away from young Australians and towards those of other generations. Yet now more than ever young Australians face the remorseless challenge of insecurity, the uncertainty of not knowing where changes to the education system are headed, the uncertainty of not knowing whether they will be able to find a job at the end of their time at school or training. We need to work on these things as parliamentarians to address the core causes of insecurity for our youth and to try to rebuild social trust and connectedness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a good thing for our parliament to be exploring new penalties and new approaches to the problem of heavy drugs in our society. I understand in the United States there is a special penalty that applies under their laws for those who are caught trafficking heavy drugs in and around schools. I am advised that under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Australia is party, there could be a head of responsibility for the federal parliament to enact such laws&mdash;that is, to send a very clear message to drug traffickers that there is no more heinous and unacceptable crime in our society than the trafficking of drugs in and around schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are legitimate matters for our parliament to debate. The member for Prospect is to be commended for bringing them to our attention. As I hear from the speeches of the members for Hughes (Ms Vale), Blaxland (Mr Hatton) and Fowler (Mr Grace), this is an issue that spreads right throughout the south&hyphen;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4582"> west of Sydney. Our constituents want us to address these concerns in the national parliament, to explore means by which we address the causes of crime through new forms of social capital and trust and to explore the things we can do as parliamentarians to find an even more acute expression of the penalties that are needed to deter crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is acting on the Convention on the Rights of Children, whether it is following the precedent in the United States for enacting special laws on drug trafficking in and around schools or whether it is the call&mdash;as many members have made&mdash;for state and territory governments to enact even stronger penalties in this area, I believe we do good service to the parliament, as the member for Prospect does good service to her electorate, by raising this particular matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

I know that the focus is on the south&hyphen;western suburbs of Sydney in this debate, but it is a national problem and it is one that extends into regional Australia as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I want to highlight a very sad story of one of my constituents, Mrs Margaret McKay of Port Macquarie, who fought a long-running battle to save her son, David, who was addicted to heroin. It was a battle that she lost on 3 March this year when David died at the age of just 29 from a cocktail of legally prescribed drugs. While David's battle was lost, the war continues for Margaret and many others like her to try to find better alternatives for the rehabilitation of heroin users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David McKay was born in Gundagai on 12 July 1967. At age six, David and his family moved to Port Macquarie, where he grew up and went to school. His mother, Margaret,

David started smoking marijuana when he was 12, and from there he was on a downward spiral to drug abuse and misuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David was on the methadone program three times. Each time his mother, Margaret, tried to get him off it. She describes the methadone program as a joke. This is a lady who has had first-hand experience over a number of years with all these programs to try to rehabilitate her son, and what she did achieve she did pretty well single&hyphen;handedly. She describes the methadone program as a joke, a commodity for addicts in what she says is a legal drug trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first time David started on the methadone program, he was prescribed 40 millilitres per day. By the third and final time, he was up to 150 millilitres of methadone per day&mdash;this is a prescribed drug&mdash;plus up to 90 pills per day of various other prescription drugs such as Rohypnol, Rivotrel and Serepax. It was this lethal combination of drugs, not the heroin, that Margaret believes really killed her son and many other addicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is highly critical of the ease with which her son was able to obtain prescriptions for a host of different drugs, sometimes with just a simple phone call to a doctor. At one stage she even wrote to every doctor in the town begging them not to write David any more prescriptions. She lobbied the AMA and State Health to stop the so-called legal trade of prescription drugs, which simply replaces a dependency on heroin with a dependency on other synthetic and potentially more lethal cocktails of prescribed drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the solution? There are differing views on tackling the heroin crisis. Margaret McKay has advocated the trial of a heroin program because she believes that the current system does not work&mdash;in fact, it makes things worse for drug addicts. Others, such as retired chemist and anti&hyphen;drug use campaigner John Malouf, points to the failures of such
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4583"> heroin trials overseas. Mr Malouf stated in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on 23 May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If heroin is legalised . . . it will only clarify the status of one drug and do nothing to prevent illegal dealing in amphetamines, ecstasy, cocaine and whatever designer drugs are around the corner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also turn governments into drug pushers.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree that the current system failed David McKay and continues to fail many others like him. I agree that more needs to be done and that alternative solutions need to be found. I agree that methadone and other drugs are just bandaid solutions. But I do stop short of endorsing heroin trials or legalising so-called `shooting galleries', as has been recommended in some reports that have been published recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that we can reach a middle ground. Heroin could and should only be used under controlled rehabilitation conditions&mdash;only in circumstances where an addict's dependency can be managed and brought down without recourse to other more harmful but legal drugs. The aim should be to get the addicts to kick the habit, but not by using harsher alternatives to heroin, such as methadone and other prescription drugs, as David McKay's 17&hyphen;year struggle with drugs would indicate. There must be a better way than what we have in this country at the moment. We must as a nation look at resolving this problem and reviewing the practices that are currently in place.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I seek to establish a select committee to inquire into the sinking of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS> on 19 November 1941. I am a late arrival to this issue. My interest in it was sparked in November 1994 when the first Western Australian 1945-95 Australia Remembers commemorative service was conducted. That was in waters between Fremantle and Rottnest and it commemorated well the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> . It seemed, however, to be regrettable to me at the time that nationally we were unable to find any geographically more correct location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I subsequently became a trustee of the Perth based HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS>foundation trust, established to encourage community support in a national effort to search for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the late Senator Panizza have all lent their office and support to this same endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS>was Australia's greatest naval tragedy, with the loss of 645 men. There has never been a truly national effort to publicly appreciate the reasons for the loss, to seek to find the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS>and to properly commemorate and protect the final resting place of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and her crew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On its own admission, the Australian Archives document search lacks two vital pieces of evidence&mdash;the naval inquiry report of 1946 and relevant ships logs and signals logs. The Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) has today, as previously, indicated that he will place no obstacle in the way of this search. Time, of course, is of the essence. Our time today will not see the adoption of a select committee. I will not be precipitous in the conduct that I take in this House, but I propose to pursue this motion to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that all my colleag ues would agree that the need to resolve co nflict with war is anathema to modern civilisation within the First World and, for that matter, in any of the world's cultures. How ever, just over 50 years ago Australia was embroiled in a world war&mdash;a conflict which de cimated many countries and many cultures and destroyed many societies. The Second World War placed enormous anguish within  many Australian families. Over 60,000 Aus tralians never returned home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the majority of these tragic casualties t he families knew how and where their love d one was lost to them. Although not happy  with the news, I am sure most families were able to grieve more easily because of the ce rtainty of the information they had received about their lost family member. This was n ot so for the families of service personnel st ationed on the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. These families remain unsure as to the fate of their loved o ne, due to the many theories of how the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS>was sunk with all personnel on board&mdash;personnel totalling some 645, repres enting all major cities and towns in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS>off the coast of  Western Australia is clouded in uncertainty as to who was responsible. Was it the German raider <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS>? Was it a Japanese submarine engaging in an act of war prior to the Pearl Harbour bombing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The fact remains that there is mystery su rrounding the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. I wholeheartedly support the motion of the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and seconded  by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), both

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in support of this motion, I want to remind members that just 50 years ago Australia suffered its worst naval tragedy ever. Just off our western coast one of our most famous and powerful warships to that time was sunk with the loss of the entire war complement of 645 men and boys. No-one survived. We still have not resolved this loss to the satisfaction of their relatives nor of the Australian community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information that is available all points to a series of errors. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran's </EMPHASIS>survivors testified that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney's</EMPHASIS> captain came too close to the German raider and that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney's</EMPHASIS> gunnery staff was apparently unprepared to be able to fire the first shots. This is compounded by controversy over the search for survivors and the fact that over 300 Germans survived but no-one from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The government and Navy appeared to have been less than candid in the release of information, which is confirmed by that information available after the 30-year secrecy conditions lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue that is not going to go aw ay. The fact that we were not able to achiev e a satisfactory result then has served to increase demands for a full inquiry rather th an to reduce them. Because there has never been any compulsion to provide a full satisf actory answer to the people of Australia, th e government and the Department of Defen ce, particularly the Navy office, have not been forced to be accountable for what has happened at sea or afterwards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been speculation that a full inquiry did take place in what must have been absolute secrecy. Archival notes of a war cabinet meeting refer to an inquiry. Details, however, have never been publicised and may even have been destroyed since. I am convinced that the people of Australia deserve a chance to find out why this tragedy occurred and why the relevant authorities are being forthright in finding out what has happened and making it public. I wish to commend the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) for his dedication to the task in pursuing the creation of a select committee of inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Archives acknowledge there may be information that has not yet been found that pertains to the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The Archives' paper holding is the equivalent of 500 shelf kilometres. The cha nce of finding material wrongly or obscurely filed without a concerted effort is very small. There were 200 shelf metres of documents related to just naval signal relevant messages. Not all of the relevant material is held by the Archives. Some is still held by departments but without document or file details cited to the Archives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Archives has given examples of official documents which were removed from or ne ver placed in the official record. These even include interrogation reports from the crew of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> and logs from HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS>, thought to have been the only establishment monitoring ship to shore communications at the time. Did <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> send any distress message?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need is a wide ranging opportunity to establish an inquiry which can get the relevant information together to deal with the mystery surrounding the loss of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and its crew. It needs to be able to establish not only what happened in that battle at sea but what happened since <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> was last seen steaming off to the south south-east, down at the bow and burning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the Commonwealth has a duty to those who were lost and to their surviving relatives, but it is not that simple. We must find what documentary evidence may exist and gain access to it. Most of these records will be official Commonwealth records, and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4586">   clearly there is a leadership and coordination role that must be played. If we cannot discover exactly what happened to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> through the examination of records, we must find the remains of the ship. Only Commonwealth support and involvement will allow the volunteer and commercial organisations who are willing to continue to search for HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, too, commend this motion. I congratulate the member for Perth on his initiative as well, and also would like to thank the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) for his comments and support for what is, in my view, probably one of the greatest calls for an inquiry in this place for some time, given its historical significance and given that the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> bears the name of the city which will be hosting the Olympics in two or three years time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for the one million plus  real unemployed in this country. I grieve al so for a government which on budget night, in acknowledgment of this national tragedy, could mention unemployment or employment but once. It is a national shame that reflects very poorly on the government. For a government to treat this evil, chronic and endemic unemployment problem in this nation with j ust one mention is mind numbing to the ext reme. Prior to the budget, 70 per cent of A ustralians considered the government's first task was to seriously tackle unemployment and implement strategies other than just eco nomic levers to create jobs, and the government's response to that call from the Australian electorate was just one sentence &mdash;just one mention of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are creative and indeed commonsense solutions to break the back of unemployme
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nt. Some are known, and I will mention a c ouple of them later in this speech. But some are, as yet, unknown&mdash;the legacy of an inad equate commitment in this country to solve unemployment. Why has this commitment t o solve the unemployment problem gone mi ssing? Why is there an apparent lack of will , a lack of urgency, a lack of real empathy t o the unemployed by government, by bureaucracy, by academia, by business, by industry, by unions, by welfare and by the media?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After spending the last nine years on the House of Representatives standing committe e and Labor caucus committees on employ ment, education and training, I have had the  opportunity to hear first&hyphen;hand the views of many Australians on the vexed problem of unemployment. One theme that haunts me and is often repeated comes from people who h ave leadership power and influence in this c ountry. It is quite obvious that most of today's leaders have been largely untouched  by unemployment. They completed their education, chose their occupation and progressed through their chosen fields. They grew up when unemployment was one or t wo per cent. Among these people, personal experience, whether in families or extended families, of unemployment would be minimal. Perhaps that explains in one way at least th e lack of urgency so necessary in tackling t he unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current situation is in stark contrast t o the leaders who influenced Australia in th e postwar period, who experienced the Depression and a world war. Postwar reconstruction in the free democratic world included a  social contract with the workers that today all over the world governments are running away from at a thousand kilometres an hour. Many people on the government side point to the apparent low unemployment rates in countries like the United States. But if you add to tha t base figure of six or seven per cent unemployment, four per cent in prison, up to per manently four per cent in crime and up to f our per cent on the streets or who have just  given up, that is not perhaps an unemployment rate that we should emulate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And let us not be too precious in this cou ntry either. I am yet to be convinced that  the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4587"> real unemployment rate is at the current official rate of 8.75 per cent. It is more like 13 per cent plus if you take into account those who have given up and those who are seriously underemployed. Yet when ideas are put up in this country to create jobs, even in a very modest way, the idea is often given the run&hyphen;around by those who advise government. And major political parties wonder why an increasing sum of people in this country are seriously looking at what are mad and very dangerous alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the modest example put up by the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Solar Energy Society. The study demonstrated that an increase in the use of solar energy for hot water, for example, from the current six per cent of Queensland households to 25 per cent would create 1,500 new and direct jobs. If you apply that across Australia, you would get 15,000 new real jobs. But why hasn't that idea seen the light of day? It would use Australian sourced raw materials in glass, plastic, insulation, copper piping and so on. It would apply to industries working below capacity and to disappearing occupations like pipe fitters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do we allow a situation in Australian shipping where we carry only 7&half; per cent of our trading products and in international containerisation only 3&half; per cent? Why do we export billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in freight and insurance costs? Why isn't Darwin a major port in Australia? Why isn' t it linked by a north&hyphen;south rail land bridge to the rest of Australia? Why do we have ineffectual urban transport policies in so many of our cities? And why have we in Australia failed to get the right balance and attitude to investment and subsidy to roads and rail? Why don't we, out of limited government investment, maximise rather than minimise the number of jobs that may result?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A German study I came across demonstrated that, if you spend a billion deutschmarks&mdash;about a billion Australian dollars&mdash;on road construction, you get considerably fewer jobs than if you spend the same amount on heavy or light rail: about 14,000 jobs for roads, 22,000 for heavy rail and about 23,000 for light rail. Australia spends about $6 billion on roads each year. But, in so doing, we fail to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> acknowledge the huge associated cost. There is at least $6 billion in road deaths and trauma and perhaps up to $10 billion in compensation payments. That is one hell of a subsidy for such a negative return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us compare the reaction, though, to public transport or a railway line that `loses' a few million dollars. If we mention `subsidy for road transport' in this country, no-one blinks, no-one turns a hair. If we mention `subsidy for rail', some in this country in powerful positions become positively feral. It is not very honest, it is not employment sensitive and it is not in the best interests of Australians or our infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The developed world has created a chronic and endemic unemployment problem that, if not addressed, will lead to civil disorder in many countries. Current economic orthodoxies and past economic orthodoxies appear incapable of solving the problem. Economic growth alone, although important, will not solve the problem of unemployment. The fundamental role of a nation's economy is to provide job opportunities to all those who want them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Patricia Hewitt, the Deputy Director of the Institute of Public Policy Research in London and the author of a widely commentated paper at the European job summit in October 1993, argued that a reduction in working time cannot solve the problem of unemployment on its own but, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No analysis of unemployment and employment will be adequate unless it takes account of the rapid changes in the structure of working time and working lifetimes; and no employment debate will be complete if it omits working time reorganisations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have not really had that debate in this country. In the Australian context, John Moorhouse, from the University of South A ustralia, has pointed out that, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 20 million hours of overtime are worked in Australia. Since 1978, a time when unemployment started to grow, overtime for males has increased by 70 per cent and that for females has increased by over 100 per cent. Simplistically, 20 million hours are equivalent to  500,000, 40-hour-a-week jobs. It is under
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4588"> stood that not all of those hours are paid overtime. Nevertheless, serious consideration would lead to the release of between 100,000 and 200,000 jobs. Even if it were just a minimal 50,000, it would be worth the effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate on the reduction of hours is vigorously criticised by some academics and financial writers. However, they take little or no account of the social costs of unemployment with increased crime and suicide&mdash;nor do they mention an inefficient economy with high unemployment, occupational health and safety problems, lost productivity caused by boredom and fatigue, increased compensation claims and redundancies. Repetitive strain injuries and post&hyphen;traumatic stress syndrome seem to be the diseases of the 1980s and 1990s. Why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The criticisms of some economists are that proposals to reduce working hours suffer from a `lump of output fallacy'&mdash;that is, the total amount of work to be done is fixed and, therefore, the only way to employ more people is to share the work more frequently, but that is in and out of employment. But surely the `lump of output fallacy' is itself fallacious because of the productivity gains throughout the 20th century. Between 1881 and 1981 the lifetime hours worked by British men fell by nearly half&mdash;from 154,000 hours over 56 years to 88,000 hours over 48 years. That downward trend over a century is being reversed, dooming at least 10 per cent and probably 20 per cent of our community to intermittent employment, if any, for all their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reducing working hours schemes will not on their own solve the unemployment problem. However, they must be analysed and given serious consideration in the debate to tackle unemployment. The three examples I have mentioned will create jobs and reduce unemployment. They are, of course, only part of the answer, but they are a beginning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given that the Howard government holds two-thirds of the total seats in the House of Representatives, my turns at speaking in the grievance debate are far&hyphen;between. Therefore, the selection of a topic for this brief and fleeting opportunity usually requires a difficult choice to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, the choice has been made for me by two events that occurred last week: firstly, the release of the March quarter `visitor arrival figures' and the coincidental publication of three independently&hyphen;conducted surveys of international tourism, and, secondly, the release of the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members may well wonder how these two apparently poles&hyphen;apart topics may relate to the one subject and some may think that, as a member representing a Gold Coast electorate, I should concentrate on the former and leave the latter to the time when it will be specifically under consideration by the House of Representatives. In fact, both are dimensions of an issue which I feel conscience&hyphen;bound to address now, namely, the expression of racism in Australia and the hurt it is causing our country&mdash;both internally and externally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the March quarter visitor arrival figures show a welcome overall increase, an analysis of 1997 tourism statistics&mdash;as distinct from visitor arrivals, which includes non-tourist visitors&mdash;shows an ominous underlying problem. It is being referred to in the tourism industry (and press reports) as the `Pauline Hanson effect'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A comparison of the March 1996 quarter figures with the March 1997 quarter figures shows a drop in international tourist arrivals from four of our significant sources of Asian tourists. Thailand's figures declined by 900 tourists; Singapore by 2,300, Japan by 10,500  and Taiwan by 14,900. Malaysia appears to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4589"> continue to show an increase, but a comparison of the rate of increase of tourists from that country shows a decline from nine per cent growth in January and February to five per cent by the end of the three months of the March quarter. Nobody in the tourism industry believes that this is just a `temporary' blip in the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experts point to the fact that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her maiden speech in the House of Representatives in September 1996, and to the many reports in Asian newspapers which followed it. These newspapers continue to report her constant claims that on the subject of Asians in Australia she speaks for the `vast majority' of Australians. The fact&mdash;a word the member for Oxley dislikes unless she is applying it to her quite idiosyncratic `facts'&mdash;is that, given the normal lead time of several months for people booking overseas holidays, 1997 figures are beginning to demonstrate the real effect of her wild assertions and her attempts to play on what she apparently perceives as widespread anti-Asian sentiment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect in my electorate has been a drop in international tourism growth rates and the cancellation of bookings by international tour-group clients. Australian tourism industry executives have been stating for some time that these cancellations are frequently accompanied by statements from tourism marketers in our major Asian sources of visitors, that their clients do not want to visit a country in which they believe they are not welcome because of their race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House of the words the member for Oxley chose to state her position when she made her maiden speech&mdash;words which have resonated in Asia, and which have also been widely reported in North America, to my personal knowledge. On 10 September 1996, she told us&mdash;and the world:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate . . .
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> A truly multicultural country can never be strong or united.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She then quoted the 50&hyphen;year&hyphen;old words of Arthur Calwell:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japan, India, Burma, Ceylon and every new African nation are fiercely anti-white and anti one another. Do we want or need any of these people here? I am one red-blooded Australian who says no and who speaks for 90 per cent of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no hesitation in echoing the words of Arthur Calwell.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In adopting that posture, she appears to claim to speak for 90 per cent of Australians!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pause for a moment and apply a bit of logic to her statement. If 40 per cent of our migrants are Asian, then 60 per cent&mdash;the majority&mdash;are not. Of our current population, a little under 5 per cent are Asian. That is, the 95 per cent non-Asian population is being boosted annually by 60 per cent&mdash;a majority&mdash;of migrant arrivals. Far from being `swamped by Asians', her own figures indicate the gap between Asians and non-Asians would actually be widening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact&mdash;that word again!&mdash;even if every new migrant to Australia were Asian, it would still take 200 years before they became 50 per cent of our population. The member for Oxley usually brushes these facts aside by saying others are telling `lies'. Her own facts, on this occasion, bring her argument undone. I note that she was reported at the weekend as being opposed only to&mdash;and the quote in the paper was&mdash;`massive immigration and that was on environmental grounds'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here a copy of her speech in Ipswich on 11 April this year, made at the event in which she launched her One Nation Party, and which I shall seek leave to table at the conclusion of my speech. In that speech she said that one of the five `immediate goals' of the party would be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To stop all immigration except that related to investment that will</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lead to employment, and for this to continue until Australia's unemployment is solved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not in her entire speech&mdash;and certainly not in her statement of goals&mdash;is there a single mention of the environment in any context whatsoever. Her speech reeks of anti-Asian
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4590"> sentiment. It can be no coincidence that in making points on her perceived negatives about Australia today, she refers disparagingly to Asian countries. For example, on the decline of jobs in manufacturing industry, she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The jobs are going to countries like Indonesia, where the pay is 39 cents an hour.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must not allow our country to be taken from within.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> immigration policy now? Who knows? And if we think we know what it is today&mdash;a fashionable (in some quarters) concern for the environment&mdash;who is to say what it will be next month, or next year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trying to pin down the views of the member for Oxley is as frustrating as trying to catch a grasshopper. Just when you think you can get a grip on it and dispose of it appropriately, it shifts&mdash;takes off at a tangent&mdash;out of your immediate reach. You pursue it to its new position and when it realises it is in trouble again, it shifts once more. And so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some may think this a trivial comparison, but I remind them that large species of grasshoppers are known as locusts. We may have spent a lot of time over past months explaining to Asian members of parliament, to investors and other business people from our Asian trading partners, and to the world's press that the views of one independent member of parliament are not the nation's views&mdash;that she is, like the grasshopper in the garden, fairly insignificant in the scheme of things. Unfortunately her rallies, reported to the world, appear more to portend the ominous dark cloud of an approaching swarm of locusts&mdash;a dark hint of nascent racism in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the link between this and the report on the `stolen children'&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them Home</EMPHASIS> report? Last weekend, I heard on radio the words of the member for Oxley about this report. After saying the stories in it were terrible, she immediately denied the report's statistics to justify the practice! She used words to the effect, `Well, a number of those children would now otherwise be dead'. It is a case of don't worry her with the comparative mortality and health figures in the report&mdash;the facts, again&mdash;because to do so would undo all her anti `Aboriginal Australian' rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake, the world is watching how we handle this report. It will measure us against the image the member for Oxley has so successfully given Australia of being a racist country. If, as a nation, we appear to react to this report as she has, they will do so with some justification.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gri eve this afternoon for the many residents in  the beautiful suburbs of Chelsea Heights, Aspendale Gardens, Mordialloc and Parkdale whose otherwise peaceful lives are continually disrupted by the excessive traffic volumes t hat are forced to use these pleasant outer south&hyphen;east suburban Melbourne suburbs as major traffic thoroughfares between Wells Road and Boundary Road through to the Ne pean Highway. In summary, the quality of life enjoyed by the several thousand residents li ving in the aforementioned areas is greatly diminished by the failure of the Victorian st ate government to fund the construction of a section of freeway of approximately 10 kilometres in length known as the Dingley Bypass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Dingley Bypass has been planned for  a number of years to link the Mornington Peninsula Freeway at Chelsea Heights ultimately with South Road, Moorabbin at War rigal Road via Wells Road and Boundary Road. The proposal was developed by the t hen state Labor government in 1992 and was fully supported by the then five surrounding municipal councils which comprised the are a. In fact, the councils were prepared to forgo all other roadworks to get this project funded, such was the importance they placed on it f rom a local perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall cost of the project in 1992 do llars was estimated to be $23 million over e ight years, which is approximately $3.5 mill ion per year. Half of this funding was at tha t time to have been provided from the coun cils' arterial road allocation fund. Therefore , costs directly to the Victorian government would have been perhaps as little as only $ 2 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The residents of Chelsea Heights living in  the vicinity of the intersection of Thames Promenade and Wells Road know that the Mornington Peninsula Freeway traffic exits that freeway at this particular point to avoid
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  one set of traffic lights at the terminus of t he freeway one kilometre further north at Springvale Road. Chelsea Heights residents living around Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Avenues and those in Amaroo Drive and Enterprize Avenue areas know that it is extremely difficult and equally dangerous to try to acc ess Wells Road or even Thames Promenade  given the excessive volumes of traffic on t hese roads during peak periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A local resident, Mr Ian Baldock, has put  a detailed submission to the City of Kingst on and has organised meetings of residents t o highlight the inadequacies of the Wells Road/Enterprize Avenue intersections used i ncreasingly by local families, most of whom are young and who now have children approaching kindergarten and pre&hyphen;school age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some two kilometres further north, the re sidents of the 1,600 homes comprising what  should equally be a peaceful suburb, that o f Aspendale Gardens, are plagued by the excessive volumes of high speed traffic usin g Wells Road, which north of its intersectio n and terminus at Springvale Road becomes a divided four&hyphen;lane road. The Mornington Peninsula Freeway terminates abruptly at Springvale Road, causing traffic to exit ont o Wells Road right through the middle of A spendale Gardens, often travelling at excessi ve speeds and not only meriting the construction of the Dingley Bypass some two or three kilometres further east but also necessitating  locals to mount a campaign for the construction of a pedestrian crossing which is indee d supervised to ensure that local school chil dren who use that crossing are not involved in a serious accident with an oncoming speeding car. If the freeway were extended between the terminus at Springvale Road on to South Road, it would then access the Ne pean Highway at South Road and do this th rough a light industrial area and not through  residential streets, as it does today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few hundred metres further north, Wells Road, Aspendale Gardens becomes Boundary Road, Mordialloc. The ultimate destination of much of this traffic is the Nepean Highway, where it proceeds on to inner Melbourne and areas further north. There are some three roads in this area that traffic uses to access
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4592"> the Nepean Highway. The first of these is  Governor Road. Mr Mark Heath, Secretary of the Governor Road Safety Committee, noted two years ago that there had been a massive increase in the volume of traffic using Governor Road, much of which was heavy vehicles, and that much of that traffic, of both heavy and smaller vehicle nature, attained unlawfully high speeds. Mr Heath and his neighbours in this area are legitimately concerned for not only their safety but also of course the safety of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The roundabout at the intersection of Boundary and Governor Roads is also extremely dangerous. Aspendale Gardens resident Mrs Maria Fabbiano contacted me recently about having been run off the road by a truck while she was attempting to negotiate this roundabout. Were the state government to construct the required section of freeway to be known as the Dingley Bypass between Springvale and South Roads, then trucks of the kind that ran Mrs Fabbiano off this Boundary Road roundabout would not even have cause to be on it in the first instance. Nor would they use White Street in Mordialloc, the second major access road between Boundary Road and the Nepean Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young Maria Coutsis is a White Street resident who has recently written a passionate letter to me detailing her personal experiences in witnessing accidents in White Street&mdash;a narrow two&hyphen;lane road carrying excessive traffic and a significant number of heavy vehicles. I urge the state government to hear the pleas of concerned residents like Maria Coutsis and to construct this 10&hyphen;kilometre stretch of freeway and so get traffic off streets like White Street. Similar pleas emanate from residents living on either side of and along lower Dandenong Road, the third major route through to the Nepean Highway from Boundary Road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mornington Peninsula Freeway&mdash;a ro ad into which much of the north bound traffic from the Mornington Peninsula itself and indeed from Melbourne's south-east growth corridor ultimately funnels&mdash;simply comes to an end at Springvale Road. All of the traffic on it simply filters through residential streets
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to get to the nearest major road travelling in the same direction, that being the Nepean Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian government has indicated that the construction of this short stretch of freeway known as the Dingley Bypass&mdash;which is only 10 kilometres long and which, in my view and the view of all local residents, would ameliorate the problems of Ian Baldock, Maria Coutsis, Maria Fabbiano and many thousands of their neighbours&mdash;is not in its 10-year funding program. I have urged in writing in times past and I implore again in this place this afternoon for the Victorian government&mdash;in the interests of those people who deserve to live in safe, clean and peaceful neighbourhoods&mdash;to reconsider its decision not to fund the construction of this freeway within the foreseeable 10-year period. I urge the government to act as a matter of urgency to ensure that residents of this beautiful bayside neighbourhood can have their place of living returned to one where peace, clean air, solitude and safety prevail.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4592"><TITLE>People with Disabilities</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for the forgotten band of Australians who are among us in the community, the group of Australians numbering almost 18 per cent of the total population. Today I grieve for the disabled Australians, in particular intellectually disabled Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Picture this if you will. A room full of people, people who are not your average ordinary Australians; rather people with very special and certainly very defined needs. One woman seems cheerful enough. She wears a shirt made of flour sack material because it is the only thing she has not yet managed to tear off. A teenager sits in a wheelchair, his body twisted, muscles atrophied. He operates his wheelchair using a lever. Despite his outward appearance, his eyes show a certain comprehension of all that is going on around him. A young woman who talks in screeches and looks no bigger than a two-year&hyphen;old walks by assisted by two staff. I was told she was 20 years of age. Outside in the garden lying on mattresses are several people who are letting
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4593"> their twisted limbs succumb to gentle physiotherapy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, as all of us here are aware, this scene is not a dream. It is in fact reality. This scene was what greeted me when I visited an organisation called Valued Independent People&mdash;or VIP House&mdash;in the suburb of Girrawheen, which is in the heart of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This facility plays an important part in the care and long-term welfare of the intellectually disabled residents of Cowan. In Cowan there are two schools that cater for students who have special needs within the disabled community&mdash;Burbridge and Gladys Newton, which I have had the pleasure to visit from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Burbridge earlier this year had a multisensory environment room installed as a way of promoting levels of concentration, interest and excitement in the children. A research team from the University of Western Australia is also studying the students' reaction to the multisensory environment and recording their progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still, it was a sobering sight to be at VIP House and witness the daily living demands of people who have disabilities and the people who care for them. VIP House aims to provide a flexible home and neighbourhood, daytime occupation, community access and a participation service to people with a disability according to their needs. Occasional respite is also provided. The service is directed to people with high support needs, as an alternative to employment, and is restricted to persons residing in the northern metropolitan corridor of Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">VIP House is now providing recreational services to school leavers who are living at home or in hostels under the post&hyphen;school options funding. It receives basic funding from the Disability Services Commission and clients pay a minimal fee for service, plus a token transport fee. A board oversees the operation and staff are responsible for the day-to-day running of the operation. Despite what must be limited funding, the staff have transformed this house into a multipurpose caring centre for people with all kinds of disabilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be honest with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and admit it was a challenging sight to come face to face with many of the clients who use the facility, but I was struck by the unswerving enthusiasm of the management, the board, the carers&mdash;who prefer to be known as facilitators&mdash;and the parents, some of whom I met during my visit. The unstinting love and care offered to the clients and children in what must be at times highly demanding and emotionally exhausting work never ceased to amaze me. It can be quite jarring, especially as a parent who has three healthy children, to observe the daily hardships many of these parents face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My visit raised some important issues&mdash;issues that really never should confront this service area of our community, issues which governments should never debate; rather they should just tick off funding approvals. It seems to me that our priorities when it comes to care for the disabled have hit the wall. They have hit the wall of apathy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have lost the focus that our country should always have towards our less advantaged, towards those who remain the forgotten within our community. I think it is most important for those of us who do not have relatives with disabilities to appreciate how hard the daily task can be for those who do. People with disabilities and their families may suffer hardships, but in most cases all action is undertaken with such an enormous degree of selflessness. They have accepted that their lot in life is somewhat different to the average Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, I met a couple who immigrated to Australia from Portugal about 10 years ago. They adopted a blind, severely intellectually disabled teenager who was 15&mdash;and they had him for about three years&mdash;who had been abandoned by his natural parents at birth. What humane values these people must have applied. They truly are great Australian heroes in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that we need to reassess our priorities with funding in this very imp ortant area. The staff, board and parents at VIP House conveyed to me other issues that were of concern to them&mdash;specifically in th e area of the disability services sector. In th
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4594"> e issue of health, there is the question of responsibility: who is responsible for whom?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, the disability services area has worked long and hard to change th e public's perceptions of people with disabilities. We no longer have the Spastic Welfare  Society and the Slow Learning Children's Group. We now have the Cerebral Palsy Association and Activ Foundation. These na me changes have had an important impact o n public perception. The emphasis is not on  disabled people but on people with a disability. They are putting people first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a concern raised by some parents I spoke to was the issue of sterilisation for intellectually disabled females. They would like to have the right to give consent for their daughters to have a hysterectomy. Before all the civil rights people start jumping up and down, let us just think about this for a moment. An intellectually disabled woman who is confined to a wheelchair or the young person I met who is in calipers would not be able to adequately care for themselves even if they were more mobile. During menstruation, I am told, hygiene problems can occur, especially when they cannot adequately care for themselves. Yet parents, certainly in Western Australia, have no right to determine the welfare of their daughter in this regard. I spoke to a father who has two daughters who are intellectually disabled and he is very passionate on this issue. This particular issue does seem to be of great concern to parents who feel it would simply be one less thing to be concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue raised with me is the one of carers and the need for respite care. It is my clear view that the unheralded in the community are those who work as carers. More work needs to be done in this policy area. In particular, it is considered there is not enough quality respite care within our community, and I wholeheartedly agree with that. The latest budget addresses carers with a welcome increase both in financial assistance and also funding over four years for the national respite for carers program. However, more needs to be done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another inequity within the disability field is the one of home and community care&mdash;or HACC, as it is commonly called&mdash;with its funding emphasis on service for the aged. It would be very useful if this were extended to include people with disabilities. The fact is that 18 per cent of the population are disabled. If we transfer that figure to the amount of people who are required to care for them and the agencies that provide services for them, it translates into a fairly sizeable proportion of our population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> refers to the disability group as `the forgotten band'. We recently heard from a parent, Mr Bob Primose, who wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> about his son. He said that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of services has not kept pace with the rising level of community needs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to refer to his son, Gregory, who had died 30 months previously:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we miss him greatly, his passing released us from the stress of worrying what the future held&mdash;what would happen to him when we were no longer there to monitor his well&hyphen;being.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not so much a case of increasing spending; rather a case of getting our priorities right. We need to think very carefully about where we spend taxpayers' funds. This group of people find life hard and this needs to be recognised. We do not need to make their lives even harder by cutting funds to services provided to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government's efficiency dividend will ensure that administrative operations are accountable for the amount of funding the states and territories receive. It remains an imperative to ensure carers receive adequate respite, especially elderly carers. I met a woman who is 72 years of age and she has bathed her 38&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter every day for the last 38 years. You can imagine what a task that would be. Her greatest concern is what will happen if she dies. Who will look after her daughter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I grieve today for this particular part of our community. I think it is very important that we address it in a financial sense and also in a policy sense. We need to consider our intellectually disabled people in particular withi
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4595"> n our community with greater funding emphasis.

I have absolutely no doubt that there were terrible injustices done and that children were taken from loving parents. I have no doubt that this was done with malice on occasions, but more often it was done with the interests of the children in mind. The children we are talking about were half&hyphen;caste or even less Aboriginal. It may have been a racist view, but it was deemed that, because these children were at least half&hyphen;white, they should have a chance. With the clear vision afforded by hindsight this was extreme folly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, judgment should be made by the standards of time. What must also be considered is that Judge Wilson predominantly interviewed those cases presented to him by the Aboriginal Legal Service. There were many cases elsewhere where people did not respond because they knew it was the fact of being made wards of the states that saved their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides being very selective, Sir Ronald's report is fatally flawed in other ways. He says that it is not an intellectual report; it is from the heart. This means, of course, it is not bound by fact. Indeed, the evidence he has collected is beyond confirmation. Sir Ronald said in an interview in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 30 May that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I didn't stop, as a judge would have stopped, to ask where's the corroboration. How could you doubt the authenticity of a story when tears are running down the faces of the storytellers?
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Had Sir Ronald witnessed the tears shed in this parliament by posturing politicians, he would perhaps have been a little more cautious. As it is, he has offered a licence to every con man in the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just such an example is on page 7 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 29 May. There is a picture of Patrick Dodson giving his closing speech at the reconciliation convention. Mr Dodson is giving a eulogy about Robert Riley who, it is claimed, committed suicide last year after a long struggle to come to grips with the enforced removal from his family. Let it be understood that Robert Riley was not forcibly removed from his family. His mother asked Sister Kate to take him because she was in a relationship with a man who could not stand Robert and whose bashings would probably have killed Robert. It may be true that Robert Riley was traumatised at being rejected by his mother, but it had nothing at all to do with whitey. I would be very surprised if Patrick Dodson did not know that and Ronald Wilson should have known it because he was on the board of Sister Kate's at the time. While it may be a good tear&hyphen;jerker and a guilt reinforcing performance, it just was not true. Such is the level of evidence regularly used by the doyens of the guilt industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ron Caston and Robert Manne are good examples: both pillars of the Jewish community who like to flagellate us with guilt. Yet they are strangely silent on land rights or compensation for thousands of dispossessed Palestinians. It is always easy in an issue to trot out the highly emotional example, as the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) did in his predictably sanctimonious contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the words of Isabella Lynott, who is now 95 years old. She, along with her sister, were the first children taken to Beagle Bay, a catholic mission, in 1909. Isabella's father was white and when he died her mother implored the local police officer to take her children as they would otherwise surely die. Isabella remembers Beagle Bay very warmly. She said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">She had only gratitude for her deliverance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another hero of mine is Pearl Hamaguchi, a woman who, being an Aboriginal&hyphen;Asian, endured a far harder life than white half&hyphen;caste children. Being half&hyphen;Asian, she was not  considered worth saving, although she was institutionalised for a short time later. Pearl remembers all that she endured, but she does not dwell on it. She has made a name for herself. Both she, her husband and her family are highly respected members of the community. Her comment to me recently was that she had always thought that, we, the Gudea, were a bit silly but, with Mabo, native title and Ronald Wilson, she now thinks we are far more stupid than even she had imagined. Pearl Hamaguchi is an inspiration to me and a great role model for the whole of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know many stories that tell of triumph over adversity. After all, I represent more Aboriginal people than any other politician. Unlike the members who spoke on the MPI or the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), I and my staff are involved daily with the problems of a large constituency and we get a good insight into the real problems and disadvantages that Aboriginal people suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well looking back through the misty eyes of political correctness. Given the guilt&hyphen;ridden apology of our Governor&hyphen;General, he&mdash;on his fat salary paid out of the public purse&mdash;can see our unspeakable shame and, because he can see it, is somehow aloof from it. The Governor&hyphen;General has no private capacity. While it is true that he was appointed by Keating to further the craven cause of republicanism, until that great day comes he would do well to remember that he is a representative of the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the standards of the time, the decision to remove children was considered a compassionate move. Of course there was some abuse of the system, but there was considerably more sensitivity and compassion than present day critics would concede or even understand. I have spoken to police officers who have told me that, where children were being looked after, they did not enforce their removal. Many of the children were taken for their own protection.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Sir Ronald should have done is to have compared the plight of those who were not afforded the protection of the state. I suspect that if an apology is owed or compensation due it is to those people, but for the most part they are dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were cases where Aboriginal custodial fathers would encourage their young, lighter coloured girls into prostitution. I wonder what the ranks of the politically correct would have had the government of the day do under those circumstances. In many other cases, half&hyphen;caste children were simply not wanted by the tribe, regardless of how the mother felt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real tragedy and shame is that, because of all this emotional nonsense, there are many Aboriginal children today who should be made wards of the state, and the authorities know that their failure to do so will inevitably lead to their death. I recall phoning a doctor in a large Aboriginal town last Boxing Day. She confided to me how angry she was, patching up neglected children, putting them into hospital, knowing that in six weeks they would go home and, inevitably, be readmitted a few months later&mdash;defenceless children on an inevitable downward plane. They are entitled to the protection of the state but are denied it because of our political correctness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to set the record straight about the referendum in 1967. I believe I have always been politically aware. The truth is that I and the overwhelming majority of the Australian population thought we were voting to give Aboriginals equality. We were not. We were voting to give the Commonwealth special powers, which have, by and large, been abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talked in his contribution of the benefits that flowed from the referendum. He listed in his speech what he saw as the priorities. Interestingly enough, in those priorities he quoted me exactly, except he missed out one of them. If you miss out one, the wheels fall off the lot. The Prime Minister failed to mention the need for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He mentioned many bureaucratic services. From experience, I can tell the House that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4597"> these vaunted initiatives were part of the problem. Education and health, despite large amounts of money thrown at them, are going backwards. I spend a disproportionate amount of my time trying to protect Aboriginals from ATSIC itself. I want to take Aboriginals forward with us into the future. I want for  them the material benefits I want for my children and for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Sir Ronald, Mick Dodson et al want a board set up to administer compensation. Of course they do. They see it as just another carriage on the gravy train they are so used to riding. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) wants the government to spend $1 billion on compensation when the government has earmarked that money for the benefit of all Australians. If there is to be any compensation at all, it should come from savings made by the abolition of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>, the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children From Their Families, is a report that ought to be read by every member of the parliament. The nation stum
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bled last week, both in terms of the premature public release of the report and the way in which its subsequent tabling in the parliament was handled here by both sides of parliament. Attempts at point scoring, not only in this place but also by sections of the media, diminished not only the pain which is the almost 700 pages of this report but also us in this parliament, and the ease with which we retreat into the all too familiar ideological posturing and personal invective that characterises much of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those wanting to rediscover in themselves their own humanity need read only a few pages of the testimonies. I found myself in tears on more than one occasion, as I was struck not only by what these people had endured but by their courage in being able to tell it. Like so many things done in the past, it was done in some cases with the best of intentions. Governments, churches and non&hyphen;government organisations believed that seemingly impoverished children would have a better life in a white, superior, modern culture. There was also a belief that those who were half&hyphen;caste were in some way set free from the rest of society, and their only hope was to be incorporated into the dominant culture. For others, though, the intent was to subsume Aboriginal culture into that of the dominant Anglo&hyphen;Saxon one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That many Aboriginal children forcibly removed, or coerced under duress, did not even have the chance to say goodbye and, in some cases, endured years of maltreatment and abuse should be a source of national shame. The report and its wrenching stories will evoke in each of us different emotions. Many, including the member for Kalgoorlie, have spoken of guilt and the assignment of it to our generation and to those who will come after us. To do so is wrong. But those who do not feel a sense of shame, which is quite a different emotion from guilt, whilst celebrating the extraordinary achievements of the 220 years since European settlement, risk building a future which alienates a significant section of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The entire process of the inquiry has been of therapeutic value to many of those who
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4598"> testified to it. In a number of cases, it was the first time in which, with palpable anguish and thin pain, the stories had been told. I would like to read a couple of those stories. One, which was not related directly to the inquiry but which was reported in the book by Stuart Ritoul of 1993 called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wailing</EMPHASIS>, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1902 the chief protector of Aborigines in Western Australia, Henry Charles Princep, said he believed that it was the government's duty to place children of mixed dissent in missions to be trained to become useful workers and humble labourers. He complained in his annual report that the natural affections of the mothers stood much in his way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A father who wrote a letter to the department in 1903 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am afraid that my wife will commit suicide if the boy is not back soon for she is good for nothing&mdash;only cry day and night. I have as much love for my dear wife and children as you have for yours. So if you have any feeling at all please send the boy back as quick as you can. It did not take long for him to go but it takes a long time for him to come back.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Evidence No. 821, on page 6 of the report, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was at the post office with my Mum and Auntie [and cousin]. They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [about ten miles] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were screaming in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock&hyphen;up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock&hyphen;up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whatever the motive, as a nation we need to understand our past if there is to be any hope at all of embracing a confident future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I addressed a meeting about Aboriginal health a couple of months ago in the New South Wales parliament, a very conservative young Liberal approached me and said, `I thought all this Aboriginal affairs stuff was a load of nonsense until I was listening to the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program last week and I heard a little bit of a woman telling her story.' He said, `I had to pull over to the side of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> road, and I cried uncontrollably for 10 minutes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radical though it may be, I respectfully suggest to the House that an Aboriginal man and an Aboriginal woman be invited to a joint sitting of this parliament to tell their stories of unimaginable pain and anguish that too few Australians have heard and even fewer understand. The reason I suggest that is that, like that young member of the Liberal Party who told me that he thought this was all a load of nonsense until he actually heard it, I think there are many people in this place who actually have to hear these stories told, not through the prism of some of the activists in the reconciliation movement but by the very people who lived this pain. The symbolism would be powerful, and it might just play a catalytic role in healing wounds deeper than the current national psyche can allow to easily heal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not support compensation. I ask myself, `What good would it do? How can a cheque compensate you for losing your inner-self?' Also, I suggest it would light a fire under the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that we have not yet seen and would further divide an already divided country&mdash;divided in sections at least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also found over the years in dealing with those who are seeking litigation against doctors for medical misadventure that what they wanted much more than any financial compensation was for the doctor to understand their grief, to understand what they had been through and to apologise for what he or she had done. Let us not be blind to injustice nor deaf to despair. This report demands a measured, thoughtful and detailed response, not the kind of precipitant response that the opposition has sought of the government over the last week. It should rise above the behaviour which all too often typifies our day-to-day political debates in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my colleagues said to me that he felt that over the last week and the last few months reconciliation had faltered. In fact, I think reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians has a much greater chance of success. Up until recently I had felt
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4599"> that it was nothing more than badges, glossy posters and a whole lot of platitudes which meant very little to the everyday Australian. What has happened with the release of this report&mdash;hopefully, they will be able to repeat their testimonies in this place&mdash;is a forcing of the everyday Australian to ask themselves the question which ought to start here and cascade throughout the rest of the country, that  is, `How would I feel if this were done to me?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a question of our generation or subsequent ones carrying guilt. Rather, it is about carrying an understanding of what was done, why it was done and its consequences on those people and their families, if not on the rest of the nation. Financial compensation will do nothing to address that. I would suggest to you that it would make it worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need overall is a deficit reduction strategy on existential Aboriginal despair, intolerance, prejudice and living standards that no Australians should condone. I commend to the House and to the parliament the suggestion that we do something extraordinary for a group of people who suffered extraordinary injustice and that we ask a couple of them to repeat their stories.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4599"><TITLE>Tasmania</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two issues that I would like to bring to the House's attention today in this grievance debate. The first is an exciting new initiative happening in Tasmania. Previously, Tasmania's clean green image has been to do with air and water and, supposedly, its farming. However, just like the rest of Australia, Tasmanian farms use chemicals and have lots of chemical inputs in their production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new company, Green Life Tasmania, will see this `clean green' image restored to the state. The company is in the process of trialling a totally organic rain farm and dairy in the state's far north-west corner, where the world's purest rainwater is proven to drench the soil. Green Life Tasmania intends to collect the water and milk and market them worldwide. They are involved in teaching how to use natural resources to bring life back into the soils.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line of making things green and clean is to go totally organic, otherwise you have no credence whatsoever. The Liberal government in Tasmania has made `clean green' their policy over the last few weeks, with a total lack of direction. They cannot possibly label products `clean green' when they have been saturated to the heavens with chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Green Life Tasmania will use the organic fertiliser Vitec and use previously unfarmed soils for its farms. It will be the first truly chemically free, large scale clean green farm, teaching the government to practice what it preaches. This was brought to my attention by Sari Schmidt, a Mount Carmel student from Hobart, who is in the parliament today. I thank her for giving me the opportunity to make those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to raise another matter, a very serious issue, and draw it to the House's attention&mdash;that is, the plight that Tasmania finds itself in. I believe it is because of the withdrawal of considerable amounts of federal funds, the fact that the marketplace has failed in Tasmania and the fact that the current Tasmanian Liberal government does not have a clue about how to stimulate any growth in our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the headlines in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS> newspaper on Tuesday, 27 May was that Tasmanians are in peril. The state's population forecast is to drop 11 per cent in the next 50 years. We currently have a population of fewer than half a million, and this means a decline in the number of people in Tasmania by 55,000. Those who remain will have an average age far greater than the national average. This is of particular concern to me in Lyons because the loss of population is most likely to affect the people in the smaller towns. They are the ones who are desperately seeking work. Young people are leaving in droves for interstate because there is nothing happening in our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the state government has come up with is a scheme to try to attract people to come and live in the state. When a number of people have approached the government to see what it has to offer, the reply has been a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4600"> lovely glossy brochure with all sorts of pretty pictures and a prize of an odd piece of land should their names be pulled out of a hat at some point in the future. The government added to this some technological dream the Premier had of providing a technological centre based on something happening in New Brunswick in Canada. The idea is basically okay, but it is not the saviour for the state of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast this with what South Australia is offering, which is an all expenses paid removal plus some subsidised accommodation until people settle themselves in; and, if people were serious about changing states for just lifestyle, it would be more of a conducive offer. I think Jim Bacon, the new opposition leader in Tasmania, hit the nail on the head when he recently responded to this government's flights of fantasy by saying that piecemeal population drives and a focus on one emerging industry would not halt the population decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bells, whistles and pretty pictures do not provide jobs, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker. The government has come up with some incentives. The federal government has given Tasmania away and our federal government members are just letting it. They are not saying anything to stop what this federal government is doing to Tasmania. The state government is no better. All they can do is blame Pauline Hanson. This argument is going to wear thin. She is not responsible for the economic ills of Tasmania; she is merely another symptom of the discontent and disillusionment of the Tasmanian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Money has to be invested in industry plans, in infrastructure and in regional development if the Tasmanian economy is to survive. We need a proper transport system, which includes rail. The present minister is selling the whole caboodle of it without really understanding or fitting it into any sort of planning situation for the Tasmanian transport system. We need to have a transport system which includes rail, sea and air. We need the freight equalisation scheme to remain, which is under challenge by this government, which is gradually being pulled away. We need a second ship to transport goods and tourists.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We need to stop mucking around with the councils, with our local municipalities, and help them organise themselves with an economic base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has a lot to offer, but it cannot compete with the rest of Australia without the same sorts of initiatives that other states enjoy. The state government really has to analyse the true nature of the problems in Tasmania. We thought we had a bit of an opportunity for this to occur with the Nixon report. Mr Peter Nixon, who was a long-term member of this House and served in coalition governments, is doing a report or updating our previous economic statement, the Callaghan report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier's direction statement came out without reference, as far as we know, to the Nixon report. So we are left with a few tired politicians chasing pipedreams that cannot possibly come to anything, the latest being Tasmania's belated push to have the Antarctic treaty nation secretariat established in Hobart, against the federal government's better judgment. What about some new ideas, folks? How about assisting the industries we already have? There are plenty of ideas there. With a little constructive help and support from such bodies as Tasmanian Development and Resources, some emerging resources could actually take off and make jobs for the state. Incat has done it. Others can too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jobs will strengthen the economy and then there will be some incentives for people. Young people need those incentives to remain in Tasmania and we need incentives to attract others also. You know what they say about rats deserting a sinking ship? The state is sinking and the federal government has scuttled the lifeboats. Tasmania does need a rescue mission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent changes to the upper house in Tasmania, we at last have two women in that formerly male bastion. I believe this is the beginning of change in Tasmania. Silvia Smith, once the federal Labor member for Bass, now has another victory under her belt, and I congratulate her on her election to the Tasmanian upper house last weekend. Mike Aird, another ALP member, retained his seat
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4601"> of Derwent, which is part of the federal electorate of Lyons, with an increased majority of the Labor vote. Sue Smith has also been elected to the upper house after a distinguished career in local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania is ripe for change and the Labor Party's new leader, Jim Bacon, will lead a young and energetic party to victory whenever the next state election is held. They will be looking for a future for Tasmania that will seek to help the people who have a vision for  the state&mdash;help them and their enterprises become the backbone to encourage new things to happen and entice people to settle in our state. We do not need any more tinkering around the edges. We need some decisions to be made to get our state back on track.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Irrigation uses more than 73 per cent of Australia's commanded water resources to grow nearly $6 billion worth of produce. This figure multiplies significantly when activities outside the farm gate, supported by this production, are considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme, which has been in existence for more than 80 years, is starting to feel its age and is in need of refurbishment&mdash;not only because of the problems developing within the MIA but also for those living downstream of the MIA area. In the light of research and new technology now available, it is in a position to make the adjustments that will enable it to provide sustainable agricultural production into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with many longstanding irrigation schemes, the major problems to be overcome in the MIA are rising water tables and excessive drainage. One organisation that has been doing something practical about preparing a plan for the future wellbeing of the MIA is the working group of the MIA and district land and water management plan. This plan was first discussed at a public meeting in August 1991 and the responsibility for developing the plan was given to a working group of 10 community members and three New South Wales state government employees under the able chairmanship of Mr John Bonetti. The group was drawn from a wide cross-section of the local community and embraces irrigators comprising both mixed farmers and horticulturalists, dryland farmers and graziers. It includes people who are familiar with both the upstream and downstream nature of the problems of the MIA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1991, that group has worked tirelessly to resolve the MIA's land and water management problems, and in January this year the draft plan was made available to the community for comments and guidance&mdash;to see if

The plan has been prepared on the assumption that the New South Wales government will provide a financial grant to maintain and/or replace the existing water  supply and drainage, given the creation of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the implementation of this plan, the New South Wales government wants a rigorous economic evaluation to ensure an acceptable return to the taxpayers of New South Wales. It is proposed that Murrumbidgee Irrigation should implement the plan; however, there is some feeling that the local community would have more confidence in the plan if it were implemented by a representative community group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the final plan contains or whoever administers the refurbishment and changes in practices, the working group is to be congratulated on its endeavours. I believe it has done an excellent job to proceed to this point, despite some of the conflicting points of view that it has received from individuals and powerful lobby groups that have a particular interest to guard or promote. As we say in the MIA, there are more headaches in a barrel of water than in a barrel of whiskey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has almost completed its job and some hard decisions will still have to be made. Then it will be up to both the federal and state governments to assist, as they both have a large financial interest and investment in the region. The plan requests a further 15 years of financial commitment to the project. It is my hope that the federal government, through the Natural Heritage Trust, the Federation Fund or some other funding arrangement, will allocate money to provide a benefit both to the state and to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the restructuring of the CSIRO from 1 February, three divisions&mdash;that is, Soils, Water and Environmental Mechanics&mdash;have merged to become CSIRO Land and Water.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> A committee led by Mr Arthur Blewett, the Principal Chief Adviser of Corporation Development, was established to make recommendations about the merger. Mr Blewett recommended the formation of a CSIRO National Centre for Irrigation Science in Griffith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In announcing the recommendation in November 1996, Mr Blewett said that, in creating a new Centre for Irrigation Science in Griffith, the merger committee saw an opportunity to foster the development of an industry based on irrigation technology and know&hyphen;how. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS> on 23 January 1997 reads this way:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A top level CSIRO report has recommended the CSIRO's Division of Water Resources' Griffith site become a national irrigation research centre, in partnership with the Charles Sturt University and Victoria's Department of Natural Resources and Environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation was made to the CSIRO executive committee and overturns earlier speculation that a CSIRO reshuffle could mean the downgrading or even closure of the Hanwood site, near Griffith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the recommendations, the facility would become a National Centre for Irrigation Science and would focus on irrigation throughout Australia, broadening its outlook and providing a greater focus on northern irrigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, although the recommendation to have the new centre has been agreed to in principle, it would still need the approval by the yet to be appointed chief executive of CSIRO's new Land and Water Resources Division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the move, the local CSIRO site would get an extra four irrigation scientists, from its current level of four to five, but could lose scientists in river and wetland management areas, who would move to Canberra where the Rivers and Wetlands Division would be headquartered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Arthur Blewett, principal adviser, CSIRO corporate development, the new centre would provide economies of scale, but the Hanwood site's new status would not mean any funding increases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, this plan of the CSIRO is an opportunity for Griffith to become the key centre in Australia for the development and export of irrigation expertise and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes without saying that the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area&mdash;as I said before, the most secure and proven of irrigation environments in Australia&mdash;is the place that is most
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4603"> central to future research and education for the irrigation sector. It should be pointed out that, in the past, the CSIRO laboratory in Griffith has undertaken research of importance to Australia, and internationally it already has established close working relationships with Israel, China and the United States, amongst others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former CSIRO Division of Water Resources, and Charles Sturt University Professor of Irrigation, Professor Wayne Meyer&mdash;about the same time as the announce ment about the Centre of Irrigation Science being located in Griffith was made&mdash;put forward a paper outlining the aims of a National Centre for Irrigation and Research and Training at Charles Sturt University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendation of the CSIRO, which embraces the establishment of a chair of irrigation sciences at CSU, provides opportunity for the CSIRO, the peak scientific organisation of Australia located in Griffith and a university located in Wagga Wagga to be central to the practical development of a `green machine' for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since Dr Blewett announced the centre at Griffith, the merger of Soils, Water and Environmental Mechanics has taken place, and the new division is to be one of the most powerful within the CSIRO. Unfortunately, however, neither state nor federal government has picked up on Dr Blewett's announcement. No comment has been forthcoming from either the Premier of New South Wales or anyone in the federal government about what is happening in Griffith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Meyer has stated that Australia has the potential to take over from Israel in the fields of leading irrigation technology for the world, and it is seen as complementary that the New South Wales government has already established its Centre for Irrigation at Hanwood, a short distance from the CSIRO Land and Water Laboratory. This could be an exciting prospect for New South Wales, if not for Australia, as it combines educational research with an opportunity to carry out studies on some of the most technologically advanced horticultural and agricultural blocks in Australia, if not the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the importance of irrigation to the nation, I am trusting that the announcement made by Dr Arthur Blewett, the Principal Chief Adviser of Corporation Development, about the establishment of a CSIRO National Centre of Irrigated Science in Griffith will soon be confirmed by some action. We are all aware there is a big job to be done and we have little time to waste.</PARA>

The proposal will provide office accommodation, mission briefing and training rooms, storage facilities and workshops as well as associated amenities for a unit strength of 180 personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When referred to the committee the estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work was $10.25 million. The committee has recommended that the works should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. 6 Squadron is one of two squadrons equipped with F111 strike and reconnaissance aircraft. The squadron is responsible for F111 aircrew conversion training and the provision of an operational strike and reconnaissance capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until recently, there was some uncertainty about the life of type of F111. This uncertainty, and higher facilities priorities, delayed the provision of modern facilities for the squadron until now. With the benefit of numerous studies into the life of type of the F111, an avionics upgrade and the purchase of additional attrition and rotation aircraft, Defence now believes the aircraft will remain in service for many years. It is estimated that the life of type will expire in 15 to 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the aircraft and squadron personnel represent a substantial equipment and training investment by the taxpayers of Australia. The aircraft themselves are a sophisticated conventional deterrent force. I must say that the Public Works Committee was impressed not only with the briefing at Amberley but with the additional information made available about the capacity of the F111 and the sort of entrepreneurial spirit that had characterised Defence's upgrade of the F111 into a modern fighting aircraft.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4611">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on extensive inspections of facilities housing squadron activities, the committee concluded that facilities at RAAF Base Amberley occupied by No. 6 Squadron are inadequate due to their dispersed locations, age and condition. There is therefore a need to provide new purpose built facilities for No. 6 Squadron's existing command, administrative, technical and training functions at RAAF Base Amberley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed facilities will be at two locations. The new No. 6 Squadron facilities will be in hangar annexes and new buildings contiguous to Hangar 373 and the storage of F111 attrition or rotation aircraft will be in two existing Bellman hangars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that the proposed scope of the works can be justified as being consistent with the functional requirements for  squadron facilities. The committee also concluded that design features to be adopted are consistent with functional requirements and recognise the need to comply with relevant standards and codes. The scope of the proposed works capitalises on the adaptive re&hyphen;use of existing hangars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A master plan has been developed for the future development of RAAF Base Amberley with which the proposed works are consistent. Careful phasing of the works will minimise disruption to the continued operation of No. 6 Squadron during construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the basis of evidence received, the committee has therefore recommended that the development of facilities for No. 6 Squadron at RAAF Base Amberley should proceed. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue my speech on the budget. This government has dedicated substantial resources to address Aboriginal health, education and employment issues. We will guarantee funding levels for ATSIC for four years, giving them greater program flexibility and more financial security. In particular, there will be some additional funding going to employment and business development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see economic independence and self-determination as a key to the future wellbeing of indigenous Australians. Their health, education, employment and housing continue to be below the standards of the average Australian. We aim to fix that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must stand condemned in the eyes of this and future generations if we do not take practical steps to ensure a decent life experience for all Australians. We must frame policies that are just, and genuinely deliver the outcomes which our indigenous people identify as their priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ensure that this generation understands the history of the conquest of Australia, not so they come to feel guilt about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4612"> the frontier actions but so they can understand the struggles between blacks, whites and Asians who fought for a share of the resources as they established a new nation. Better understanding of the experiences of the different races should help us to become a more just and equitable society in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of European settlement across Australia tended to follow a pattern first set around Sydney. Governor Phillip was, at first, friendly to the indigenes, hoping to learn about the country from them. Within five months of taking over their fishing and hunting grounds, however, he observed that the natives were starving and attacking the convicts who stole their boats and artefacts. Two years after landing, in February 1790, Governor Phillip estimated that nearly half of those living locally had died of a smallpox type disease. Two&hyphen;and&hyphen;a&hyphen;half years after, in December 1790, he gave orders that any 10 natives be captured and beheaded in response  to the spearing of his gamekeeper. He supplied bags and hatchets for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May 1816 a military force was defending settlers while Governor Macquarie made a proclamation of native outlawing, placing &pound;10 sterling on the heads of 10 named warriors to be captured dead or alive. By 1836 the first protectorates were set up to keep the tribal remnants away from the settlements. Native police, in particular, did battle with the surviving Aboriginal nations. Typically unpaid, taken from the gaols where many faced death sentences and starved and beaten if they attempted to escape their white officers, these native police&mdash;in particular in Queensland&mdash;brought their superior bush skills to play in locating and defeating the enemy. For those who want to know more about the role of the native police, you will find their achievements and conditions described in the 1861 royal commission in the Queensland parliament's Votes and Proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Captain Cook's failure to treaty with the natives in 1770, despite his official instructions, meant the survivors of the land wars had no rights as refugees or as defeated enemies of the Crown. Tribesmen captured during the campaigns and skirmishes were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tried and gaoled or hung by colonial courts as common criminals&mdash;as thieves and murderers. They were not extended the rights of prisoners of war&mdash;as soldiers captured in battle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For more than a century the new Australian settlers were taught in schools that the Aboriginal population did not fight to retain their lands; they simply sickened and died away when confronted with the pressures and infections of `civilisation'. I learnt this same message when I went to school. Thus, Aboriginal people were emasculated in the minds of the majority. They were not afforded the respect of those who stand up and appear to fight for their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the defeated tribal remnants starved and succumbed to disease and despair, the newly emerging Darwinian concepts of 1859 and the 1860s were reinterpreted to rationalise the death rates, sickness and dependency as evidence of innate biological racial inferiority. The so&hyphen;called `full bloods' were expected to die out like the extinct dodos. Hence the health, education and employment policies for the survivors of the armed struggles for the land were for years distilled into the annual presentation of a blanket on his or her majesty's birthday&mdash;a gift from the colonial government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the era of armed struggle, the survivors of the defeated Aboriginal nations were looked to for cheap or slave labour, especially in areas where few white workers would venture. The following two statements, both in the official records of 1913, present the attitudes to Aboriginal labour that underpinned official remuneration and training policies. Mr W. E. Dalton, accountant and honorary secretary of the Aboriginal Friends Association, stated in evidence in the 1913 South Australian royal commission into Aboriginal issues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have to bear in mind that 60 years ago the natives were practically animals crawling about in the bush. The half&hyphen;castes are their children and usually also the children of the most depraved class of white men. They have not the heredity that other races have, and you cannot expect them to work on purely industrial lines. If you are going to have a four hour working day I think that the native could work beside the white man. He could not keep working for eight hours. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4613"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the other hand, Professor Baldwin Spencer wrote in his preliminary report on Aboriginals in the Northern Territory, prepared for the Department of External Affairs in 1913:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . while it is true that, in some parts the aboriginal gives trouble, it is equally true that at the present day, practically all the cattle stations are dependent on their labour, and in fact could not get on without it, any more than the police constables could. They do work that it would be very difficult to get white men to do and do it not only cheerfully but for a remuneration that in many cases makes all the difference at the present time between working the station at a profit or a loss.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we have the rationalisation of economic exploitation on the grounds that the worker is incapable of sustained work, despite the realities of Aboriginal participation in the work force at that time and often for no pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1913, in sworn evidence at the royal commission in South Australia, we see housing conditions described as being inadequate at Point McLeay and better conditions being  recommended. But this benevolence was undermined with the question from the honourable J. Jelly, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the natives are given the conditions you speak of is there any likelihood of their increasing in numbers, so as to become a very great burden on the State?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In reply, he was assured by E. C. Stirling:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a legitimate inquiry, but I think that the experience of all the world over is that the black races die out in the presence of the white races. I do not think that what you say is a serious contingency. I think that with all you can do you cannot keep them beyond a certain time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This same Mr Stirling then expounds on the virtues of separating the Aboriginal children of mixed descent from their parents in order to save them from going `back to the ways of the natives'. The Hon. Mr J. Jelly asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What would be a suitable age to remove them?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Stirling replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think when they are about two or three years of age.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The chairman, on hearing this, then asked Mr Stirling:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would not recommend that they were taken away when they are absolute infants?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Stirling said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No: because then you would have the burden of them that all children are at such a young age. When they are a couple of years of age they do not require so much attention and they are young enough to be attractive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He is then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you think that their experience of two years with the black mother would seriously interfere with them?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Stirling responds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. There would not be time for them to establish habits and customs. I am quite aware that you are depriving the mothers of their children, and the mothers are very fond of their children, but I think it must be the rising generation who have to be considered. They are the people who are going to live on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thus we see the royal commission considering the so&hyphen;called `rescue' of a generation whose mother's race was thought to be dooming them to extinction. However, it was to be a cheap rescue, which took place only when the babies had advanced out of nappies and on to solid foods, when they were two or so years of age, after their biological mothers had dealt with the inconvenience of their infancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next 70 years, Australia's miscegenation policies took thousands of children from Aboriginal mothers. The consequences for generations of Aboriginal people were the loss of physical and emotional wellbeing, the loss of personal and cultural identity, and economic exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the royal commission in Western Australia in 1927 into the killing and burning of Aboriginals in East Kimberley, the Reverend Gribble, head of the Forrest River Mission, observed the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the native is not the asset of the state, he is rather the asset of the individual who, shall I say, possesses him. I need only remind your worship that it costs only 5 shillings to obtain a permit to employ an aboriginal, which in the North carries no wages with it, while on the other hand, it costs 7 shillings and sixpence to register a dog.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One year later, in 1928, J.W. Bleakly, Chief Protector of Aborigines, reported that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one fact is universally admitted, that the pastoral industry in the territories is absolutely dependent upon the blacks for the labour, domestic and field, necessary to successfully carry on. If they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4614"> were removed, some of the holdings, especially the smaller ones, would have to be abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is remarkable that, although recognizing their absolute dependence upon the natives, there has been no attempt made by the people on these holdings to elevate or educate them, though this should enhance their value as machinery.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He added that, in particular, the Aboriginal woman:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is one of the greatest pioneers for the territories, for without her it would have been impossible for a white man to have carried on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These were the same enslaved and often sexually exploited women, denied an education or training, whose babies were taken in order that they be `rescued' from a life of poverty and degradation. If time permitted, I would quote the lack of funding and the cruelty and indifference found in so many of the half&hyphen;caste institutions that these babies were committed to, but the just released findings of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Children from Their Families says it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1964, the Northern Territory's legislative council abolished the concept of protective wardship for the majority of the territory's 18,000 Aboriginals of full descent. This entitled them to drink alcohol and cohabit with whites. However, the question of paying award wages, unemployment and sickness entitlements at the same rate as to others in society, was deferred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>, just released and just tabled in parliament, is a substantial and significant report. It documents the tragedy of Australian black&hyphen;white relations&mdash;how we denied the most basic human rights to individuals over generations: the right to belong to a family, to be safe and loved, and to know whence we came. Our government is yet to give its detailed response to this report. When that happens, I know it will be an appropriate response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1970s, I spent a number of years researching the evolution of our race policy, and it led me to work for years to overcome prejudice and ignorance about our race relations history. That general misunderstanding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continues. It is essential that we as a nation dedicate the right policies and adequate expenditure to overcoming centuries of damage done to Aboriginal people in the process of European settlement and the exploitation of their labour. To get these policies right, we must listen to and learn from Aboriginal people, those people who miraculously survived with their culture, to inform and enrich our great Australian society.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That speech is perhaps the latest example of why some people on this side of the House believe the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) is destined for promotion in the not too distant future. I commend her on the quality and content of her contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also pick up on a few of the comments she made. I do not know if she had a chance to see the recent ABC television documentary series called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontier</EMPHASIS>, which was shown over a three&hyphen;week period and contained a lot of background information on the land battles between European settlers and Aboriginal nations over quite an extended period, including the period she mentioned in her contribution. In my own part of the world, a bit to the north of the New South Wales central coast, there were two quite infamous incidents&mdash;at Waterloo Creek and near the Myall Lake region&mdash;which were well&hyphen;recorded at the time. Large numbers of Aborigines, including Aboriginal women and children, lost their lives in terrible circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that one day all members of this House will understand that this is not a matter of guilt. Both the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the former Prime Minister have said that guilt is not a very productive feeling. It is not just a matter of guilt; it is more an obligation to face up to our past and to try to make sure that we acknowledge the truth, as the honourable member has tonight, and to express the nation's regret. That is the first step before we can move to a more national reconciliation of all these issues. I commend the honourable member for Murray for her contribution.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4615">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But my job tonight is to return to some of the issues more directly covered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his budget a few weeks ago. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) described this budget as the budget of the Sheriff of Nottingham. You can understand why, because it does take a Sheriff of Nottingham to design a budget which slugs the elderly and the chronically ill by forcing them to pay more for their essential medicines. The government uses those savings from the elderly and the chronically ill to help fund a new savings rebate which gives $450 to people wealthy enough to have $60,000 in the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also takes a Sheriff of Nottingham to design a budget which claims it is trying to increase national saving by giving a family of battlers with $3,000 in the bank a savings rebate of only $13 while giving the Treasurer who designed the budget $450 for doing nothing. It takes a Sheriff of Nottingham to design a budget which cuts federal funding for public hospitals while giving families on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> rich list $450 for each family mem ber who may receive income from a family trust. Finally, it takes a Sheriff of Nottingham to give us a budget which cannot find an extra dollar for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health while giving the directors of BHP a $450 tax rebate for the capital gain they received when BHP shares rose after those same directors announced the closure of the Newcastle steelworks. A bit later I will return to some of the decisions in this budget that affect health and, in particular, the government's decision to impose a new tax on new drugs and the failure of the government's private health insurance policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever we might think about the Sheriff of Nottingham's role in history, at least he could make a decision. Under this government, we have a Prime Minister who cannot make a decision, who stumbles from crisis to crisis, delaying and putting off decisions. Australia is the country that suffers. We have had the Prime Minister fail on employment, unable to make a decision on cross&hyphen;media ownership rules, afraid to stand up to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) on immigra 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion, unable to stand up to the NFF and the National Party on Wik and unable to say sorry to people affected by the removal of Aboriginal children over many generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me begin on unemployment. This government predicted in the last budget that there would be sufficient growth in our national economy for us to reduce the level of unemployment in Australia. In the nine months since last year's budget was brought down, the rate of growth of the national economy has been scaled back on two occasions. It keeps getting scaled back because, under this government, the economy is as flat as a pancake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Figures in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> indicate that retail spending, in seasonally adjusted terms, is down dramatically. That is because people are worried about entering into large spending commitments because they are uncertain of their jobs and their economic future. This government has been unable to introduce greater confidence into the Australian economy. It has been unable to reduce the level of unemployment. In fact, after having promised lower unemployment, this government has delivered an increase in unemployment and, in particular, an increase in the number of the long-term unemployed&mdash;the people who find it hardest to get back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is because the economy has been as flat as a pancake, because unemployment is up, because retail spending is down and because the long-term unemployed rate is up that everyone who has a job does not know whether or not the government will be able to pull the economy out of this stagnation that it has fallen into. That is why Mr Smug, the Treasurer, keeps getting up here month after month&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know we need about four per cent growth a year just to keep the current level of unemployment where it is. If the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> is right and we are falling back to only a little bit more than half of that, it guarantees that we will have higher unemployment next year than this year. It guarantees that the economy will remain as flat as a pancake and that we do not get the new jobs we need for young Australians and we do not get the new jobs we need in future years for those middle&hyphen;aged Australians who might lose their jobs in Newcastle as a result of recent decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this government was advised by BHP that they were going to close the steelworks at Newcastle, one of the major employers in the Hunter region, what was the response of the government? The Prime Minister could not pick up the telephone, and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) put the opening of the casino in Melbourne ahead of a public meeting in Newcastle to discuss the crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, knowing what damage he suffered, rushed on to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> with Ray Martin to promise the people of Newcastle that he would visit them soon. They were the words he used: `I will visit the people of Newcastle soon.' A month has gone by and the Prime Minister of Australia announces&mdash;eight weeks or more after the announced closure of the Newcastle steelworks and after the Prime Minister has been to a cricket test at Lord's in England&mdash;that he will find the time to go to Newcastle and explain to those people why he could not pick up the telephone and was not prepared to use 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the power vested in his office to do more than he did to save the jobs for the people in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just an issue of the need for Australia to have a steel industry; it is also about cars. The Prime Minister keeps saying that it would be unthinkable for Australia not to have a car industry. People like Jeff Kennett and the federal Labor Party are saying, `What we do not want to see is the unthinkable thing happening. What we do not want to see is this government continue to delay making a decision on the future of the automobile industry in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an industry which, under the car plan developed during the years that John Button was the industry minister, has had to undergo some pretty tough rationalisation. The Button plan tried to increase the throughput for each of the models in Australia. It was also about trying to generate additional exports. The car industry has responded. We have seen a dramatic turnaround in the level of exports of fully built cars. That has been a great achievement of the Australian car industry. We have seen component manufacturers go ahead leaps and bounds, with factories right across Australia not only supplying components to the domestic Australian car manufacturers but also exporting automotive components right around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is those industries and jobs that are at risk every day that this government puts off making a decision on the future level of tariffs for this industry. It is those jobs and this industry that are at risk because John Howard will not listen to Jeff Kennett on what to do with the car industry. It is those jobs in this industry that are at risk because, for two months now, the government has refused to respond to the Labor Party's call that we freeze tariffs at 15 per cent until the year 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the simple proposal that the opposition has put on the table. It is a proposal that we believe tries to guarantee that we keep that industry growing and exporting and employing those tens of thousands of Australians in years to come. That is the employment situation: a government and a Prime Minister 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4617"> unable to make a decision about the car industry; a Prime Minister embarrassed to go to Newcastle; and a Treasurer unable to give us more than two per cent economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area which is a good example of a government unable to make a decision is cross&hyphen;media ownership. The former Labor government introduced the cross&hyphen;media ownership rules, which basically mean that you cannot own a television station or a radio station and a newspaper in the same capital city. If Kerry Packer owns the Channel 9 stations in the major capital cities, his company cannot own the major newspapers in those cities. That is the case today. If Rupert Murdoch's company, News Ltd, owns most of the newspapers in the capital cities, under the cross-media ownership laws he cannot own television stations or radio stations in the same capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What could be fairer than that? Nothing. That is why many other countries also have those same prohibitions on common ownership of newspapers, radio stations and television stations in the same capital cities. In the mid-1980s, late 1986 into 1987, the former Labor government introduced those rules. John Howard said he was against those rules.  Why, we will never know, but I will bet it had something to do with the fact that his friends at the Herald and Weekly Times and at John Fairfax were against those rules. For whatever reason, by 1991 John Howard was supporting the cross-media ownership rules. In 1991, John Howard put his name on the David Connolly petition that opposed any greater concentration in the media in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am afraid I am as bad at this as the Prime Minister, who did it several times in question time today. The Prime Minister said in 1995 that his view was that we should abolish the cross-media ownership rules and only rely on the Trade Practices Act. According to the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, that would mean that there would be nothing to stop Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch buying more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Prime Minister said before the last election was that he would have a full public inquiry into this whole issue before any decisions were made. What happened to that promise? What happened to that promise by the now Prime Minister of Australia that he would have a full public inquiry before there was any decision taken by this government on cross-media ownership? As soon as he is elected, we get limp excuses as to why he would not have a public inquiry. As soon as the election is out the way, that is one of those disposable promises, not a core promise. The future of the media in Australia, the level of media diversity, is not a core promise, it is totally disposable, so there will be no public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Prime Minister embarrassingly fronting up on TV and radio programs mouthing Kerry Parker's arguments as to why the cross&hyphen;media ownership rules should be abolished. So we get no public inquiry despite the promise. We get the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) saying that they intended to ram the legislation through in this sitting of the parliament. That is what they briefed the backbench committee on. Everyone in this parliament knows that is what they intended to do. Thank God, there was such a public reaction to the Prime Minister's plans that he has been forced to back off. The Prime Minister has been unable to proceed with the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4618"> plan to ram that legislation through during this sitting of the Australian parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just hope that those brave members of the Liberal and National parties who have had the courage to speak up continue to speak up and continue to make sure that the Prime Minister is kept to the statements that he made in 1991 when he said he was against any further concentration of the Australian media. It all comes down to a Prime Minister who is willing to dispose of the promises that get in his way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time that is left to me, I wish to highlight one decision in particular that is included in this budget. It is the Prime Minister's decision to impose a new drugs tax&mdash;a new drugs tax that is going to affect a third of the spending on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In my opinion, this is economic rationalism gone mad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the view that the government puts to us. The government says, `We're going to pick out six categories of drugs at random and the government subsidy will only be at the cheapest level for all the drugs in each of those six categories.' The categories involve three groups that control high blood pressure, one that controls high cholesterol, another for ulcers and another for depression. As I say, it is a third of all government spending on the  pharmaceutical benefits scheme and it is going to save more than $600 million. So it is a massive sum of money taken out of the government's scheme to make sure ordinary people can afford their medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While all the papers released by the government on budget night said that this involved drugs that were similar, a day or two after the budget the Prime Minister misled the House when he said that this involved only drugs that were of equal clinical value. That is the problem this Prime Minister has, because there are lots of drugs that have been listed since 1993 which, by law and by regulation, have to be different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, runs the pharmaceutical scheme for veterans. He would understand that all of the drugs that have been listed since 1993 have to be shown to be so 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> different, have to have many fewer side effects, that the cost effectiveness, the difference due to the different nature of the therapeutic action of the drugs, justifies the price difference at which they are listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, there is a drug called Norvasc, which has been proven by the government's own advisers to have a lower risk of cardiac failure for people who take that drug. Why should a pensioner be forced to take the cheaper drug that is older, that has more side effects, that does not work as well, simply because they are less well off? Why should someone, one of those BHP directors who gets the $450 for their savings as well as the benefit for closing the BHP steelworks, get the best possible drugs while the pensioner who might live in the Newcastle area cannot afford the best drugs that offer the least risk of cardiac failure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has even been the example of this in my own electorate. Mr David Schneider, who had a heart transplant some years ago, has written to me on his concerns about this issue. He is on four drugs that are covered by the six groups that the government has targeted under this new drugs tax, and he, quite rightly, is very uncertain as to the increase in his medication cost as a result of this unfair budget. We have had the AMA, not the Labor Party, say that people will be paying up to $30 a month more for their essential medication. I would hate to think how much ordinary Australians are going to have to pay for the right to use their essential medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of these reasons, we think this government is stumbling from crisis to crisis. We think this is a government that has been unable to show leadership on so many issues, most importantly jobs and employment. We think this is a government that should be doing more to try to ensure we have higher economic growth, generating more jobs&mdash;trying to make sure that young people have a better opportunity. It is a government that we think should be doing more to make sure that ordinary Australians do have a diverse media. It is a government that we think is implementing unfair cuts to the subsidies for essential medications for pensioners and ordinary

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity that this debate offers to discuss three broad areas which are being debated in the wider community; namely, trade, foreign investment and migration. These three areas are vital to Australia's standard of living and are particularly vital to those constituents who live in my electorate of Parkes, particularly my rural constituents. I appeal to everybody to take a broad view of what is needed on these matters if we are to understand them so that we can survive at our present, and hopefully increasing, standard of living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live today in a world of rapid change, a world where there is an instantaneous exchange of information and capital between countries. We live in a world that is highly competitive, where the marketplaces will buy and sell at the best price, wherever it is available&mdash;the best deal. We have to get continually smarter and quicker with all of these things if we are not to go backwards. In fact, if we utilise these factors to our advantage we can only go forwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have passed the era where we can live in isolation. We cannot insulate ourselves from the rest of the world if we are to go forwards. As much as some of us would like to hanker for the past, if we do so we will  only get left behind. The modern world is not one to be resisted or feared, but one to be embraced and used to our advantage. We need perspective if we are to change, and change for our betterment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard I would like to look at some figures relating to Asia, particularly trade figures. I have here a table of our exports into Asia, the latest figures available for 1995&hyphen;96. The table shows that in that year we exported to 222 different countries and regions around the world a total of $76 billion in exports: $1.4 billion into the African continent, a very small amount; only $6.7 billion into the Americas&mdash;both North and South America, including the United States and Canada; $9.9 billion into Europe; $7.7 billion into our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> region of Oceania; and $49.2 billion&mdash;almost $50 billion&mdash;into Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, 65 per cent of our export trade went into Asia. That is almost two out of every three export dollars we earn. Our trade into Asia is increasing today by in excess of $5 billion a year. In other words, the extra trade we will do into Asia over the next two years is more than we are selling, after 200 years, into Europe in a whole year. So Asia is absolutely critical to this country's standard of living. It is particularly critical to our rural industries, which are basically export industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at our top 12 export destinations, you see that nine of them lie in Asia. At the top of the list is Japan, followed by South Korea. Then comes New Zealand and the United States, which are not in Asia. Our fifth most important export destination is China. So $16.5 billion worth of exports goes into Japan, $6.6 billion into South Korea and $3.8 billion into China. Next on the list of trading partners are: Singapore at over $3.5 billion; Taiwan at $3.5 billion; and Hong Kong, about to go into China, at over $3 billion. Next is the United Kingdom and in 10th position is Indonesia with $2.8 billion, followed by Malaysia with $2.3 billion and Thailand with $1.8 billion. Nine out of the 12 most important trade destinations lie in Asia. Further down the list, at positions 15, 17 and 18, are India, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you wanted to indulge in a little bit of treason, destruction or detriment to this country, what would you do? If you wanted to hurt the farmers of this country, if you wanted to hurt the businesses in this country, if you wanted to hurt the workers in this country&mdash;in other words, if you wanted to harm our standard of living&mdash;you would go out and sledge Asia. You would insult them, you would imply that they are backward in some way and you would misrepresent the facts and figures on that region of the world. That is what you would do if you wanted to do harm in that area. I think that to be peddling anti-Asian sentiment from the shores of Australia is madness indeed. That is where our standard of living lies&mdash;like it or not. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4620"> should be cultivating these people. We should be bending over backwards to do what we can to embrace them and to win extra markets there, as this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To imply that these people are somehow backward is a cruel nonsense. In many ways, they are harder working people than we are, particularly those from countries that have embraced a half-decent political system. They show just as much if not more intelligence than we do. They are polite people, they are clean people and they are well&hyphen;mannered people. They are honest, they respect their elderly and they have good standards when it comes to family values. Above all else, what I like about them is that they drive the hardest bargain that you could imagine. They are very good business people. I like to deal with hard bargaining people, because you know that they will be there tomorrow and the next day, and they will pay you for the business that you can win from them, if you are good enough to win that business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Asia is very close to Australia, so we have an advantage over the other countries of the world in freight. That is where our destiny lies. We should not be offending these people with cheap political shots, with ignorant statements, by thoughtlessly insulting them or by scaremongering. As the leader of my party said the other day, such tactics are dumb&mdash;very dumb indeed. To say that we are going to be swamped by Asians in this country is a nonsense. They make up 4.8 per cent of our population. On the present increased immigration rates, it will only be a flicker over seven per cent by the middle of next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you compare the immigration rates from that part of the world with last century when the gold rush was on in this country, it is nothing unremarkable at all. I had lunch with some people from Thailand and some people from South Korea a few weeks ago and they informed me that the front pages and other pages over there are full of this scaremongering, insulting nonsense that is coming out of Australia. It is on the verge of harming our trade in this country. That is indeed a great tragedy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To peddle information that they can invest here but we cannot invest there is also wrong.

We will have a comparable standard of living to go along with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who say that should look at our trade with Asia, which I have been lauding and which I say we should be cultivating. We have a trade surplus with those countries. I read recently that we have a $16 billion trade surplus with East Asian countries alone&mdash;a surplus in our favour. If you compare that with our trade with the United States of America, for example, we are in deficit to the tune of billions of dollars. Not only are we doing a lot of trade with Asia but the trade is very much in our favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our standard of living in Australia depends not so much on the domestic market but on the export market because we are a trading nation. We export something like 98 per cent of our wool, 80 per cent of our skim milk powder, 80 per cent of our sugar, 78 per cent of our wheat, 74 per cent of our cotton and 72 per cent of our barley. In fact, we are the biggest exporters in the world of sugar and wool. Our wealth stems from our trade, and we must do everything we can to cultivate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who run around saying that we should be restricting imports, implying that we can export everything out of Australia but have no imports into Australia, are also preaching a dishonest policy. They have no idea of the advantages of pursuing a comparative advantage policy. If we had no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4621"> imports into this country, ultimately we would have no exports from this country. A simple study of exchange rate movements would tell you that. If you look at it the other way around, if we are going to have high exports from this country&mdash;which is surely something all of us want&mdash;we ultimately have to have high imports into this country. Otherwise we would have a very adverse exchange rate which would ultimately choke off our exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we should be aiming for is a balance of trade at a high level, healthy foreign investment and sensible immigration levels. I say sensible immigration levels because migrants to this country, particularly the right mix of migrants&mdash;that is, migrants who have something to contribute to this country&mdash;lead to the creation of jobs here. Even where that does not occur, they eat more food and they wear more clothes. Who does that benefit ultimately? It benefits the domestic market and the farmers of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people who come to us from faraway lands bring with them contacts in countries from where they came which will benefit our trade. They also bring in capital and expertise. All of this helps us. We have had 5&half; million migrants come into Australia since the Second World War. If we could put our hands on those people and take them back to the countries from which they came, it would collapse the standard of living in this country. They have benefited this country enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other myths that are peddled concern trade barriers. Some say that we should be increasing tariffs. In the last round of tariff reduc tions which we helped negotiate with other world trading partners, we reduced tariff levels in this country on 20 different products. Some people in this chamber might say that was a bad thing, but they are overlooking the fact that other countries whom we trade with reduced tariffs on 1,300 products. We gave concessions in 20 areas, but we won concessions in 1,300 areas. Surely that is ultimately to our benefit as a trading nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the dairy industry. It has opened up its markets in recent years by lowering protection levels. It now exports $1,600 million worth of products out of this country. Surely we are not saying that that should be stopped. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We could even look at the automotive industry. Earlier today some members in this chamber were calling to raise barriers. We export $1,800 million worth of automotive parts from this country. The wine industry is a great success story. It does not get one cent of government assistance. Yet in 1996 I believe it exported $543 million worth of products out of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, South Korea and others pay higher tariffs on getting their products into Australia than we pay on getting our products into those very same markets. I think it is time that the truth be told about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion on this particular part of my speech, I would like to appeal to those who peddle the simplistic slogans on foreign investment, trade, trade barriers and migration levels, those who prey on the undercurrents of fear, prejudice and uncertainty out there in the population, those who offer false nostrums and those who stir up and use people who themselves are in financial and other difficulties or who are otherwise vulnerable to think again. In doing so&mdash;for political advantage or whatever reason you are doing it&mdash;you are not helping those people; you are betraying the very people you are claiming to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a few short ill-considered speeches, you can undo decades of hard grind&mdash;won in trade benefits for Australia&mdash;and you are the foe rather than the friend of the farmers, workers and business people in my electorate and in the other electorates of Australia. If you like, in an un&hyphen;Christian manner, you are hurting the feelings of our migrants who are contributing to this country. I have seen it. You are hurting the feelings of exchange students and you are also hurting the feelings of the original citizens who live in this land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal not so much for tolerance but for common sense and intelligence and an honest reality and portrayal of the world's situation in this debate that we are having in this country today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made those remarks, in the short time remaining to me, I would like to make some brief comments specifically on the budget. I believe it was a very sound budget. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4622"> Personally, I would have liked to have seen a somewhat tougher budget. Even so, when we took over last year we reduced the budget deficit from $10.3 billion to about $3.9 billion this year. Next year we will move into a surplus of $1.6 billion, a turnaround in the first term of government of something like $12 billion. This is quite a remarkable effort when you think of it in the context of what has gone on in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interest rates have come down four times. Housing interest rates at the peak of the last government, which was in for 13 years, got to over 17 per cent. Today they are below seven per cent. I think they were 10&half; per cent when we took over last year. Today they are 6.99 per cent. That alone in the period of just over a year is a saving on an average home loan of $292 a month after tax.</PARA>

We are the first government which is really starting to put the pressure on the banks to pass these interest rates on, which I am also pleased to see. That is the other side of the equation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget was the second budget in a row in which there were no tax increases. I think that is a remarkable feat that has been overlooked. There has been no increase in personal income tax levels. There has been no increase in wholesale sales tax levels, there  has been no increase in fringe benefits tax, there has been no increase in capital gains tax and, most importantly for my constituents, this is the first time in which there has been no increase in fuel tax. The last government put it up from 6c a litre to 36c a litre in 13 years. That is remarkable in itself. We are spending $1,900 million a year bringing in our national savings plan, which will encourage constituents to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional development has been really looked after. Dollars are going into real projects rather than paying for committees and bureaucracies to run around the country. An 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amount of $21 million has been allocated to the Kidman Way in my electorate, $40 million has gone to the Newell Highway in my electorate this year and money has been put aside for levee banks in Warren and Bourke. Intec Copper, a major project in my electorate, got $6.4 million of R&amp;D funding. Projects like this will really benefit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this budget is certainly not the draconian document that the 1996-97 budget was for regional Australia in particular, it nevertheless targeted several areas in the regions that I would like to detail here tonight. Perhaps the most glaring anti-regional Australia decision was the cuts to the Commonwealth industry placement scheme, which severely impacts on Charles Sturt University in my electorate. The decision to slice this support for tertiary courses run for the police service will impact heavily on CSU, which currently trains 2,000 police at tertiary level. One has only to look at the recent Wood royal commission report in New South Wales and its recommendations that police receive university education to understand the lack of understanding by this government of the needs of law enforcement education in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university was informed the night before the budget of the decision to slash $10 million from its forward budget. This was a university whose vice&hyphen;chancellor had put the best possible slant on the increased HECS charges in last year's budget and those other budgetary changes that had impacted on regional universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Charles Sturt University has been a leader in establishing courses for the service sector. At the moment it has 3,000 students enrolled 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4623"> in policing, pre-hospital care, emergency services and Aboriginal mental health. The distance education capacity of Charles Sturt University has enabled large numbers of police and ambulance officers to obtain degree and diploma qualifications while continuing to meet their work commitments, often in remote locations. Charles Sturt University had to travel down here to Canberra after the budget and explain again to the government these capacities, which has made CSU a leader in developing such qualifications among those sectors of the work force that had been left behind academically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would have been well aware of these courses had it been on top of its job. Now, I understand, there have been some adjustments and the government has recognised its obligation to police students in particular at CSU beyond 1999. There are students, though, in the pipeline under the scheme up until 2002. New students may now be funded as overenrolments, but the downside is that the police trainees or their employer will now have to meet the HECS fees. That is perhaps not necessarily a negative, given the HECS fee applies to most university courses, but it could certainly act as a disincentive for people to enter these careers where pay rates are less than adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university's main complaint in this is the way the whole process was handled and how badly it sits with the government's alleged commitment to regional development. One senior university officer says one must take with a grain of salt any commitment to regional development when the rug is pulled  from beneath a regional university in such a fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be aware that universities like Charles Sturt, the non-sandstone universities, if you like, are leading the way in addressing the need for those professions with a very important social function such as police, emergency services, ambulance and fire sciences. It was only a few short years back that teaching and nursing were given the opportunity to become part of the full degree tertiary system. And who would question the need for that educational status for those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> professions? So too should it be with these most recent courses, particularly police, and the government must support where it can this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget did contain one initiative in the tertiary education sector that I and every rural member should applaud. While only modest in budgetary terms, the increased Austudy for families with two or more tertiary students living away from home by increasing the parental income test dependant deduction to $7,400 is very welcome. Having said that, the government has done nothing to adjust the actual means test and assets test, which are unfairly disqualifying many rural regional families from receiving Austudy benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This area needs urgent reform. I have students giving up school in my electorate because of the impact of the actual means test. That surely cannot be right. The actual means test still specifically targets partnerships, where in the rural industry nearly 80 per cent of farms are run as partnerships. In much the same way as small business and farmers were excluded by the provisions of the capital gains tax rollover relief until I was alerted from within my electorate and pointed it out to the parliament, so too are farm families&mdash;and others as well, I might add&mdash;being excluded from Austudy entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual means test treats debt&mdash;even a loan for the kids to go to university or an overdraft to get through a drought&mdash;as income. The test is inflexible and pedantic. It does not look at how people operate their farm or business in the real world. My youth officer, Tim Payne, has done more than anyone, I would confidently assert, to draw the attention of the department and Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to the shortcomings of the actual means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am preparing a submission for the minister on this matter, including detailed case studies, and I urge the government to consider it carefully. I have no problems with the intent of the actual means test. There is no doubt Austudy has been rorted in the past, but I am concerned to hear similar stories of undeserving applicants receiving Austudy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4624"> while those I have spoken of miss out. The government must rectify this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While a move in the budget to encourage savings is welcome, the rebate on savings measures will mostly benefit the higher income earner. The scheme will not encourage enough people to start saving because the rewards at the bottom end of the income scale are just not there and people on lower incomes are just not able to save anyway for a home deposit, let alone for any other nest egg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do agree with the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and others no doubt, including analysts, who believe that at least the rebate for the first $3,000 in personal contributions to super means that middle income households will gain, although I doubt lower income earners will see much benefit. The government suggested the rebate could be used to fund private health insurance, but a $450 maximum rebate, which only the well&hyphen;off savers would attract, does not go far towards the annual premium for family private cover. Far more innovative measures, including a wider tax rebate, are needed to arrest the private health cover decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rewarding of those who choose to defer their pensions for up to five years is a welcome move that should result in significant savings to the public purse while encouraging those with much to offer the economy an opportunity to maintain their professional input while also maintaining their superannuation contributions. Also welcome is the decision to preserve super contributions until the age of 60 by the year 2025, given the very sobering statistics on the number of our population that will be over 60 by that year  and the huge demand on our welfare system if we do not do something about it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is very little in this budget that will do anything to simulate employment growth. We have four per cent economic growth but we do not have any signs of employment growth. We have even the most optimistic forecasts suggesting barely any downward movement in the unemployment figures by this time next year. One might ask whether keeping a certain percentage unemployed is in fact part of our budget strategy to meet the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> requirements of our creditors. As B.A. Santamaria recently observed, are we as a nation being asked to preserve the value of the money lent to us by eliminating inflation, balancing budgets, selling off public utilities and assets, cutting wages and social services and maintaining a pool of unemployed to guarantee the policy result?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole program, without a serious training component, is more about blaming the victims of unemployment for the crisis than dealing compassionately and constructively with the crisis of unemployment itself. This morning I listened to a radio interview with Dr Bob Gregory of the Australian National University. He detailed the phenomenon that is becoming apparent in the community, city and country town alike, where those with jobs and are well off live in one section of the community and those without jobs and the poor live in the other sections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Has it ever been any different,' I hear you ask. Yes, indeed it has. In years past there was a more pronounced scattering of the unemployed throughout the community. The haves and have-nots were not so obvious and marginalised. To top it off, we now have many with work who are in fact the working poor, who desperately want more work but the work is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And do not be fooled by the apparent reduction in unemployment in the United States where economists boast the success of their downsizing and rationalist policies by pointing to a five per cent or thereabouts unemployment figure. That five per cent unemployment figure in 1997 is vastly different from a five per cent unemployment figure in the 1960s or 1970s, because back then 95 per cent of the work force had full-time work or individuals were working as much as they wanted to work. Today there may be 30 to 40 per cent only in that position. That is the difference. So America is not five per cent away from full employment, nor are we 8&half; per cent away from full employment. We are probably seven per cent short of an accurate unemployment rate anyway, for starters, with one hour per week regarded as employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4625">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do not want workplace agreements, they want work agreements, and there is nothing in this budget to suggest they are on the way. As the member for Curtin pointed out, an injection of investment expenditure is necessary to help reverse the decline in public sector savings and its associated unemployment rates. Simplifying withholding tax obligations is good as far as it goes, but small business will not of its own deliver the jobs we need in this country. To believe small business is the answer to solving our economic woes is to think small, notwithstanding the contributions small to medium enterprises make to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need&mdash;and here I suspect the member for Curtin and I part company&mdash;public investment in major infrastructure in this country as well as to facilitate joint public-private investment in projects like the Parkes inland freight airport. Do not laugh; wait for the feasibility study in a couple of weeks&mdash;done privately, after the government reneged on its commitment to that. Other initiatives that come to mind include the inland Melbourne-Darwin, via New South Wales and Queensland, rail freight line that several members in this House are keen to promote. Also, the federal government needs to dramatically upgrade the Great Western Highway through the Blue Mountains and across the sandstone curtain, as I pointed out in my first speech in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only through upgrading transport routes at public expense that private enterprise can follow the way, decentralise and use the stable resources, particularly labour, that the regions offer. So, too, should rail lines be upgraded once again, with far more than the $175 million over four years set aside in this  budget. Then, too, private operators would follow and invest, particularly if state governments like New South Wales offered a realistic freight access charge for the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government boasts about the 90 per cent of roads budget being spent in regional Australia. It fails to mention that, in the case of New South Wales, much of this has been spent on the north coast on one highway and the encouragement of the heavy road freight 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry, including greatly increased gross tonnages that are going to cost local and state authorities more in road and bridge damage. Independent consultant Sinclair Knight Merz has indicated that, for local government, the least cost to bring all existing overstressed bridges up to current mass limits will, for New South Wales, be approximately $430 million and, for the increased mass, an additional $160 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a letter from a central west council expressing frustration at the Commonwealth road funding arrangements, one manager told me today that recent initiatives of the federal government, such as black spot and roads of national importance, have been at the expense of the national highway system. The Commonwealth, he says, collects over $11 billion from fuel tax and excises and returns less than 15 per cent to roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken elsewhere on the heritage trust and the pea and thimble trick the government has pulled on its environmental commitment. There are simply not enough funds in the trust to tackle the enormous task of the Murray-Darling Basin salinity and degradation, let alone the other environmental challenges around this nation. Local government also received a setback in this year's budget with financial assistance grants reduced by 1.2 per cent in real per capita terms, despite assurances from the government to the contrary. Smaller councils like Rylstone, Evans and Oberon are heavily dependent on these grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that it is only asking local government to make a contribution to the budget bottom line, and I am pleased that the minister says that the per capita formula will hopefully be reinstated next year. But the councils are right to ask why they should put scarce resources into competition policy reforms when the government reduces financial commitment in such an arbitrary and short-sighted fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government in this budget has maintained its commitment to provide assistance to those farms continuing to experience severe drought. Existing drought exceptional circumstance assistance measures, including drought 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4626"> relief payment and interest subsidies under the rural adjustment scheme, will remain available for the duration of the drought and the 12&hyphen;month post-drought recovery period. I welcome that funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me tell you a story from my electorate that highlights the inadequacies of our drought policies and attention to the critical area of farm finance. A farmer in my electorate near Oberon has been receiving exceptional circumstance drought relief payments. Thanks to the foresight of the government, this help was extended 12 months after his district went out of drought exceptional status. But in this man's case the payments cease on 30 June. That is when the 12 months of extra payments come to a close in the Carcoar PP board area, where he resides. The only trouble is that the area is again drought declared after one reasonable spring&mdash;not enough to begin recovery. There has been virtually no rain in the 12 months since the district was in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The neighbouring Bathurst land board went into exceptional circumstances later. It is still there. So this man's neighbours, just a few miles away, are covered by special assistance as his assistance runs out. He has an overdraft of $160,000 and a term loan of $270,000 from the Commonwealth Bank. The bank is charging him 11&half; per cent plus a one per cent facility fee on his overdraft. His term loan costs him 10&half; per cent. What are his alternatives? Wool company and stock and station agent money costs 15 per cent. That flies in the face of the statement to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS> on 29 May by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) that the 0.5 per cent cut in interest rates could be worth as much as $90 million to the farm sector. Not to my constituent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in years farmers are starting to feel a bit of a `surge in confidence', the minister told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS>. Some might&mdash;that is, those lucky enough to be in a position of strength with their lender&mdash;but the great majority are not in the `surge of confidence' territory by a long way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent has also had his property recently declared infected by Ovine Johnes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disease. He can sell the wool and his sheep for mutton if he wants, but he cannot sell any commercial breeding stock. He is afraid his bank will adopt the same tactic of another major lender and start charging a penalty rate of 1&half; per cent interest for every Johnes affected client. He is faced not only with this huge interest bill but with buying in extra fodder for the winter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the type of situation out there which requires a far more flexible approach than has been displayed by the former government or by this government. We cannot afford to talk up the rural situation too much when the reality is otherwise, when from all indications we have another El Nino on the horizon. As I said earlier, in a debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill, we need to encourage new ways of farm financing. The minister said at the time in response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment it is largely debt financed and it may be that more innovative approaches are needed for the future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They certainly are&mdash;finance that reflects a market price far closer to the home mortgage rate from financiers empathetic with the family farmers out there who are still the major players in our agricultural future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a few quick words in relation to aged care. While there are still issues that are concerning the older population about the reforms proposed for the nursing sector&mdash;and I have raised them at other times&mdash;I must say this government and this minister have listened to my submissions and those of my communities, and to the electorate generally. I highlighted the concern and economic irrationalism of dismantling the rural dementia counselling services. The minister investigated this and accepted a late submission from the aged care assessment team in my electorate. I was delighted to see the more than $10 million set aside in the budget to not only retain this service through the Alzheimers Association but also provide additional funding for dementia assessment and support for carers. It must be remembered that carers save this economy $8 billion a year. To not support such people will end up costing far more as their loved ones move into the nursing home system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4627">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget consolidates the government's strategy and was never meant to be a repeat of the document brought down last August which caused so much pain in the community. But unless the government changes its attitude to cost cutting alone as the best economic tool and pays attention to revenue and tax reform and to creative expenditure then it will never generate the type of economic activity that this country requires to begin to attack our greatest economic and social ill: the levels of unemployment, particularly among our youth and particularly in rural areas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 March 1996, the people of Australia wanted a government that was committed to putting into place a plan of economic credibility, a plan for families, a plan for small business, a plan to get people back into work and, in particular, the people wanted a government that was totally committed to sticking to its guns in implementing its plan for their future and, more importantly, for their children's future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's budget, for the second year running, carries us very much along that same road with the same definite commitment to the future. This is a budget with a commitment to families, jobs and small business and to their future. As the former United States President Thomas Jefferson once said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This budget does not set about dreaming about a plan to produce better outcomes for young families, for small business, for retirees, for the unemployed and particularly for the people of the Hunter. Simply, this budget delivers. This plan, like any jewel, has many facets and, like any jewel with well&hyphen;cut and polished sides, it sparkles. One of the facets of this plan is the fact that it is focused on jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Plainly and simply it is putting the plan into place which has been in action since 2 March last year. The plan has seen the Australian Bureau of Statistics data indicate that in the month of April the Hunter's regional unemployment rate fell to 11 per cent&mdash;the lowest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mark this year&mdash;from a level of 12.1 per cent at the beginning of 1997. But, most importantly, the coalition has achieved a reduction of 2,500 unemployed people in the Hunter in just one month. This reduction in unemployment is despite attempts by Premier Bob Carr's New South Wales Labor government to increase the unemployment figures by playing the politics of the timber industry and not the science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan for jobs in the Hunter was to meet the challenge of the region's historic less than flattering record on job creation. Let us take a look at them: 17 per cent unemployment in the Hunter in 1993, reduced to 13 per cent by March 1996. Most importantly, that trend line is continuing to go in one direction&mdash;coming down. Whilst the Hunter is still some 2.3 per cent above the national average, a plan is in place and is working&mdash;a plan that has helped facilitate from the economic lever of fiscal policy a fourth official cut in interest rates on 23 May 1997 by the Reserve Bank. This has occurred only under the leadership of Peter Costello who has taken over the Treasury reins. That is a net saving of $290 a month on the average mortgage for each and every Hunter family home owner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember that great Australian dream of owning your own home or buying the farm&mdash;a dream was taken away from so many Australians by the Labor government in their 13&hyphen;year interest rate roller&hyphen;coaster ride to financial ruin. That roller-coaster ride was full of screams and, yes, we heard those screams. Remember the recession we had to have. Let me tell you: the people of the Hunter do. I remember the recession and I remember the screams. The coalition is about restoring that dream&mdash;a dream of pride in home ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sensible, responsible budget delivered is just one down payment to a better position for the Hunter for the 21st century. It is designed to lift the spirits of families, instil more confidence to invest and spend, to deliver an improved environment for small business confidence and to boost retail trade in the Hunter. That confidence has had cause to become dented with BHP's announcement back on 29 April 1997 that integrated steel making at the Newcastle steelworks would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4628"> cease at the end of 1999, displacing 2&half; thousand workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and above the ink of this budget, the Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that the people of the Hunter and the people of Newcastle feel in no way short&hyphen;changed by this decision of BHP. There will be a financial boost of at least $10 million for specific assistance initiatives which will facilitate fresh job and investment growth and unlock real, new employment opportunities in the Hunter to replace the lost BHP jobs. For example, there will be $1.2 million for an additional 100 NIES training places to the 300 places already announced in the budget. There will be $498,000 in funding for a business incubator to look for, source out and promote new business activity in the Hunter. It will be based not in Paterson&mdash;the most marginal seat in the Hunter&mdash;but in Cessnock, because this government is committed to delivering jobs irrespective of whether it be in a marginal Liberal seat or a safe Labor seat; it puts the dollars where they are needed. The sum of $150,000 will go to the Area Consultative Committee to do a skills assessment to find out what is needed to attract new employers to the area. There will be $350,000 towards upgrading the metal skills of our artisans in the Hunter so that they can fill the jobs without having to introduce new people to the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, as concerning as BHP's decision is, it is not the death knell for the Hunter. In many ways it is the defibrillator for private enterprise and for governments of all persuasions&mdash;a shock to kick&hyphen;start the heart of the Hunter and give industry a new lease of life. Industries like engineering, tourism, resources and particularly our defence industry, now the biggest global employer in the Hunter, will get a new lease of life under the coalition government. The Howard government's second budget helps facilitate this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sum of $140 million has been allocated for Hunter roads. Again, this government continues to pour funds into road infrastructure in the Hunter, recognising that the Hunter has roads of national importance. I seek to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remind the House that these roads were long deserted by the Labor government over the previous 13 years, despite the promises. But, as our Treasurer alludes to, they probably would have fixed the problems in the 14th or 15th years. They were gunna, gunna, gunna, but never did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has a plan for roads and transport. The Pacific Highway got the first big red tick with $196 million for the Bulahdelah to Coolongolook deviations, $2 million for the proposed Metford traffic enhancement proposals and $651,000 in black spot funding for East Maitland and Millers Forest&mdash;all forgotten about, all deserted by the former Labor government. Fresh funding will generate another 1,000 jobs in roadwork development in the Hunter. The government is injecting $140 million over the next 12 months, including another $12 million to the Raymond Terrace Bypass for its completion by the middle of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Confirmation has been given by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, that only red tape stands in the way of constructing, after a 15&hyphen;year campaign by local residents such as Lloyd Gregory, traffic lights at the intersection of Arthur Street, Rutherford and the New England Highway. It is one of the biggest shopping centres north of Maitland, yet there is no traffic light access to the highway&mdash;not for the club, not for the schools, not for the preschools. Yet people are expected to navigate their way and enter on to the New England Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first $16 million has been allocated for the Belford Bends on the New England Highway. Yet I still hear the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) bellowing that it is not enough, not good enough. But I do seek to remind him that under the 13 years of Labor government when the seat of Hunter was held as a Labor seat how much did they deliver. The answer is zero. And there is a federal commitment&mdash;ironclad&mdash;to meet the $52 million cost of completing the F3 link at Leneghans Drive by early 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the pleasure a couple of months ago of going up to see the commencement of the roadworks at the start of the Bulahdelah 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4629"> deviations to Coolongolook with Minister Sharp. Present also were Bob Carr, the New South Wales Premier, and Carl Scully. That was roadwork which should have commenced some six years ago but which was put off again and again, abandoned, but brought up by this government. It was only when it was brought up as an election promise by this government that the former government jumped in and decided that it was a good idea and that they were going to go on with it. Again, they were going to. The difference is we have delivered. We have turned on the tractors, we have started the bulldozers, we have loaded the trucks and the roadwork is well ahead. As I said, this is a budget not about dreams but about delivering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another facet to the jewel is the defence industry. The recent defence efficiency review augured good things for Williamtown RAAF base to become a super base. The misleading statements by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), who kept pushing the line that Williamtown RAAF base was to close, ignored the fact that page 42 of the review quotes its findings of `the attraction of Newcastle (Williamtown) becoming a prime air base'&mdash;a base that would effectively double in personnel from 2&half; thousand to 5,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With 2,500 people, the base injects some $2 million each and every week into the local economies of Raymond Terrace, Medowie and Port Stephens. When the number goes up to 5,000, $4 million each and every week will be injected into the local economies. That is secure income each and every week&mdash;secure income that businesses can plan on, that businesses can attract and, most importantly, that businesses can develop and employ people from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comparable to this is the increasing emphasis and profile being placed on Williamtown airport, where Hunter Aerospace and British Aerospace Australia have secured the  $1 billion lead&hyphen;in fighter project that will lead the way for a hoped rapid new growth in aeronautics and high&hyphen;tech associated avionics industry via a host of new players. With this in mind, the budget has met the plan of burgeoning defence industry interests and action in the Hunter head on.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our investments in the area recently included some $7.7 million to be spent on capital works for RAAF Base Williamtown, with a further $6 million to be spent in the following financial year on the $12.5 million eastern regional operations centre along with $1.4 million to construct an oxygen storage facility. We are investing $356,000 to upgrade overflow accommodation at Fort Wallace for RAAF Base Williamtown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New capital facilities development at RAAF Base Williamtown, as part of a $45 million investment spread over five projects, will provide support facilities for command and control activities. Other specific areas of funding for the people of Paterson are included during the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has committed another $10.7 million in 1997-98 to commence the regional forest assessment process which will benefit timber workers in Gloucester, Bulahdelah and Stroud and allow them to access the timber resource which has been locked up by the Carr Labor government for the past 10 months. That Labor government decision, which wiped out the employment numbers with the stroke of a pen, had a far more devastating effect than the closure of BHP in Newcastle. Losing 130 jobs in a town like Gloucester with a population of 1,000 is far worse than losing 2,500 jobs out of a population of 250,000 people in the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the federal government will not be pushed around or shoved around by this process. Our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, have stood up to be counted many times in support of the people in small regional and rural towns affected by the decisions of the Carr government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another facet to the jewel in the Hunter is that we have achieved $50,000 in funding for Hunter retirement living and community aged care. That will go to the Uniting Church at Salamander Bay and will provide another 30 home and hostel care places to be monitored and run by that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also delighted to find out that $31,000 had been granted to Maitland palliative care to increase the hours of the coordinator from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4630"> 21 to 35 hours a week and of the assistant from six to 28 hours a week. When the euthanasia debate was on, this government said it was committed to palliative care. By increasing the number of hours available for coordinators, it shows that it is not delivering rhetoric; it is delivering dollars and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet another facet is the delivery of effective digital mobile phone services for Gloucester, Dungog, Vacy and other parts of the Lower Hunter. By the third quarter of this year, much of the Lower Hunter will have access for the first time to digital phone services. It is hard to believe that, with the ongoing payment of 8c a day for the ABC&mdash;as has been quoted&mdash;people in areas such as Vacy have never been able to receive television reception, yet they are not more than 70 kilometres away from a major town such as Maitland. They will have their television reception by March 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In East Maitland, the town where I live, television reception has been very poor, and it has been poor for at least two years. Indeed, one of the local television stations based not more than 25 kilometres away cannot be received in East Maitland because of the transmitter. During the February break the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, came up to East Maitland, had a look at the area and met with the residents. He gave the instruction that, if the transmitter was not able to be rectified within two months, a new one would be installed. That transmitter will be installed by November this year at a cost of $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet another facet to the jewel is Medicare. This government has announced that patients will be able to electronically lodge claim forms directly from doctors' surgeries to save inconvenience and to speed up claims processing, especially for those living in outlying areas such as the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list goes on. There was a boost in AQIS funding of $78 million. That is of utmost importance to the people in the Hunter when you consider that, as a part of the push for the supermarket to Asia, a premium price is paid for our goods because of the clean and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> green food that we have in the Hunter Valley. We will continue to pursue that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, another facet of the plan is the positive outcomes for small business emanating from the Howard government's second budget. I am hopeful that, for small businesses right across our Hunter, the policy direction and fresh initiatives that have been outlined in the budget will stimulate greater consumer confidence and, most importantly, create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, for the second year running, there are no tax increases, no sales tax increases, no lift in the petrol excise, no rise in the company tax and the retention of the diesel fuel rebate. They were all promised in the plan and they were all delivered. That not only helps small businesses but keeps prices down for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My government has to date tried to set the standard that it is prepared&mdash;unlike any former federal administration&mdash;to cut red tape, to provide capital gains tax relief, to keep interest rates down and to get a flexible and fair industrial relations structure in place for small business. But its full reforms have not been able to be achieved because they have been stymied over and over again by Labor and the Democrats in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something the former Labor government would not do was deliver for small business. The members of the Labor government believe that profit is a dirty word and that perseverance and reward for effort just do not fit within their dogma. In the coalition, we believe that small business is the answer to unemployment and a brighter economy and that all the benefits for the long-term security of families come from having a vibrant small to medium business sector. That policy stance will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the sake of the nation, we have to get the nation's books back in fiscal order. Now, more than ever, it is important that we continue to create the right economic environment to enable businesses to enhance their profitability and to foster growth. It must be remembered that the government does not spend at the tills of the small businesses that manufacture Australian jobs and products. It is up to the consumers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and to support the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), which I formally seconded on 27 May, having reserved my right to speak. I now exercise that right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to concentrate on what I regard as the most important social and economic issue in Australia at the moment&mdash;that is, unemployment. That, of course, includes long&hyphen;term unemployment. As the amendment moved by the member for Holt indicates, the budget does nothing for jobs, `the nation's most overwhelming current economic and social problem'. Unemployment&mdash;or employment&mdash;is the most important social and economic issue that confronts us in this country at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a strong conviction that the most important thing you can give a person in our society is the opportunity for a job. The opportunity for a job brings with it the opportunity for members of one's family to have an education. The opportunity for a job brings with it the opportunity for a family to have decent living standards and to be able to take care of some basic provisions in life, such as decent health care. The opportunity for a job goes to a community's confidence about notions such as the capacity of people to educate their children, to provide decent health care and a decent standard of living for their family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two aspects to unemployment or employment. In the first instance, the number of people you are able to employ goes to the economic growth in your society. It is the responsibility and the role of government to seek to maximise economic growth, to seek to do everything that it can within the rigours of being a national government to maximise economic growth, because the maximisation of economic growth brings with it the maxi misation of job opportunities. It is also incumbent upon governments in this day and age, when faced with an unemployment problem, to do everything they can to assist the long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, experience in Australia and mirrored in comparable countries is that if you want to reduce the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed then you simply cannot rely on economic growth by itself. You have to take further steps. You have to take additional measures. You have to take what I describe as growth plus measures to give long&hyphen;term unemployed people the opportunity of getting access to training or employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, in both these areas&mdash;in the maximisation of economic growth to bring with it the maximisation of employment and in the need to take special measures to reduce long&hyphen;term unemployment&mdash;the government, from the moment it came to office, including the budget which the Appropriation Bill deals with, has failed miserably. This is not a government which seeks to maximise economic growth and, therefore, it is not a government which seeks to maximise employment opportunities. It is certainly not a government which seeks to take special steps to cater for the long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth recounting a number of economic and employment related statistics to enable the House and the community to put what I would describe as the most pressing and significant social and economic issue before us in its context. The government has recently revised its forecast for growth for 1996&hyphen;97 down to 3&frac14; per cent. As they say in the trade, the resident galah in the pet shop and the current Governor of the Reserve Bank, although I certainly do not attribute that description to him, say that if you want to have sufficient economic growth to create employment you have to have economic growth at four per cent or above. The government's own forecast for the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year ceases at three&hyphen;quarters of a percentage point of growth in GDP below that level which is required to increase employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent labour force figures for April this year show that the trend in employment is dead flat: it is exactly 0.0 per cent. Earlier, in January of this year, the government revised its forecast for unemployment from 8&frac14; per cent to 8&half; per cent. Now the forecast unemployment rate for the June 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4632"> quarter of 1997 has been increased to 8&frac34; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the coalition came to government virtually no full&hyphen;time jobs have been created and the number of unemployed people has risen by 31,500. We saw, just over a week ago, that long&hyphen;term unemployment had risen to its highest level for two years. The government's most optimistic forecast for growth of 3&frac34; per cent is still a quarter of a percentage point in growth below that which people generally regard as being the amount of economic growth required to have an impact on unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some comparisons are worthy of note as well. The current rate of growth in GDP under the coalition, if you annualise that to December of 1996, is under two per cent. The average rate of growth in Labor's last term of office was just under 4&half; per cent. The average rate of employment growth in the coalition's first year of office to March of this year was one per cent. The average rate of employment growth in Labor's last term in office was just under three per cent. The number of jobs created in the coalition's first year in office to March of this year was 90,000. The average number of jobs created in each year of Labor's last term in office was 225,000. The number of full&hyphen;time jobs that we have seen lost since the 1996 budget is just over 34,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks ago, when the figures were released which saw long&hyphen;term unemployment hit its highest level for just under two years, my colleague the shadow minister for employment, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), made the point that between March and April we saw the single biggest jump in long&hyphen;term unemployment&mdash;16,200. There are now just under 250,000 people on the long&hyphen;term unemployed queue. The member for Batman made the point that in May 1996, shortly after the government came to office, it announced it was cutting the funding to labour market programs in the order of $2 billion. Long&hyphen;term unemployment was then 206,400. Since that time, over 40,000 people have become long&hyphen;term unemployed. That array of statistics is a searing indictment of this government's course of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conduct since they came to office, both in failing to maximise economic growth and to take any steps to give long&hyphen;term unemployed people the opportunity to get back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a country of just over 18 million people nestled in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, as we are, what sorts of things do you need to do to maximise economic growth? The great future for Australia is as a modern trading nation. That means you want to be doing everything you can as a government to maximise your trade performance, your industry development performance and the natural economic strengths that your nation has. In the course of my contribution this evening, I will touch on some of those areas&mdash;trade enhancement, industry development measures and capitalising on some of our natural strengths, particularly in the minerals and resources area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with trade and industry enhancement measures first. What have we seen since the government came to office, and what do we see repeated in this Appropriation Bill which reflects the budget recently delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello)? We have seen a range of trade and industry enhancement measures either abolished or gutted by the government&mdash;and most of those in express breach of election commitments. To go through  the litany of sins, in the trade enhancement area, for example, we have seen the abolition of the international trade enhancement scheme, ITES, the abolition of the innovative agricultural marketing program, the abolition of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific fellowship scheme, the abolition of the Asia business links program, the discontinuation of the market Australia program, the cessation of the trade blazer project, the gutting of the export access program, the gutting of the export market development grants scheme&mdash;with a $426 million cut over four years&mdash;and a cut of $90 million to Austrade's budget in 1996&hyphen;97. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot give you that list: my contribution would be over. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4633"> the course of this budget, we have seen that focus on reducing the trade enhancement measures continue. General reductions in incentives and assistance to exporters which have occurred are in the order of $20 million over four years. User&hyphen;pays fees have been increased for those exporters using Austrade's services. There have been accelerated repayment measures introduced into the international trade enhancement scheme. The cuts to and capping of the EMDG scheme, the export market development grants scheme, remain. One of the primary national focuses which draws attention to the need for trade enhancement measures, the National Trade Investment Outlook Conference, NTIOC, has been cancelled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the trade figures, you see that in the last year of the Labor government exports grew at the rate of about 11 per cent. This financial year, under this government, the figure is down to seven per cent and it is forecast that it will remain at that level for 1997&hyphen;98. In the last year of the Labor government, 1995&hyphen;96, the contribution of exports to growth and GDP was plus one per cent. In 1996&hyphen;97, under this government, that contribution fell to minus half a per cent, and it is forecast to be minus a quarter per cent for the next financial year. So, at precisely that point in the cycle where the government's own forecasts say there will be a negative net export contribution to growth in GDP, the government guts trade enhancement measures. That is not even to deal with the array of trade and industry debacles that we have seen by way of the incompetence of the government or its ministers&mdash;whether it is the DIFF debacle, the Howe Leather debacle or the Australian&hyphen;European Union Trade and Investment Framework Agreement debacle, the litany of sins goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to industry enhancement measures, I will not detail to the House the array of bounties that have been abolished by the government, whether it is the shipbuilding bounty, the robots bounty, the computer  bounty or the book bounty. I make the point that in very many respects the most damaging of all the decisions made by the government to remove industry enhancement or incentive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measures was the reduction of the research and development taxation concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent&mdash;again in breach of an express election commitment. It has been the case in Australia over many years that, while our public contribution to research and development has been good, our private contribution has been bad. The 150 per cent R&amp;D concession was making substantial and significant inroads into that, to be cut off in its prime by a decision of this government. In the course of this term we have seen the government as well taking out the axe to chop away at our public science and research and development organisations, CSIRO in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do these things blend together? If you want to maximise economic growth for a country like ours, you have to maximise your strength, you have to maximise your trade and industry development performance. At exactly the time when we need that to occur, this government has gone in precisely the opposite directions. I indicated that you also need, as a country, to highlight and focus on some of your strengths. What are some of our strengths? We are a country which has a world class minerals and resources industry. What do we need to do to capitalise on that strength? We need to continue to ensure that our minerals and resources industries are internationally competitive. We also need to do everything we can, particularly in the employment context, to maximise the opportunities for downstream processing in those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of an aside, we have seen today indications that the government is proposing to break its agreement with the minerals and resources industry and cap the diesel fuel rebate scheme. We have heard the natural response from the Minerals Council of Australia that to go down that road is to make it very difficult for the Australian minerals and resources industry to be internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that was not announced in the budget. It was kept under the bleachers for an appropriate period of time. In the budget you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4634"> find a couple of measures which go to the heart, or are the key, of not doing everything you can to seek to maximise the capacity of our minerals and resources industries for downstream processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of areas I will draw attention to. One is the area of infrastructure and the government's decision in the course of the budget to gut the infrastructure borrowings program from a $200 million program, as it was under Labor, to a $37&half; million program in its first year and a $75 million program in its final year. Also excluded from consideration for that program is energy infrastructure projects, by restricting that infrastructure program to road and rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed today that the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) welcomed the talks between Comalco and Chevron on the feasibility of a $2.5 billion alumina refinery at Gladstone. Senator Parer made the point that there is a linkage between the proposed Chevron pipeline from PNG to (ultimately) Gladstone, if it is successful, and the proposed embarking by Comalco of an alumina refinery. There is a choice here for Comalco as to whether to establish a refinery at Gladstone or in Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand the minister welcomes the announcement of the feasibility study but, on the other hand, we do not see the minister berating his colleagues over the removal of the infrastructure borrowings program from energy proposals. If you speak to Chevron representatives who are seeking to get this project up, or to representatives of the Australian Gas Association, you will find consistent comments which indicate the very severe disappointment of the gas industry and people who have the vision to seek to embark on these projects about the government's gutting of the infrastructure borrowings program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particular gas pipeline proposal has the great potential to reduce the cost of energy. That gives the great potential to getting up the alumina refinery. Of course, you have the prospect of cheaper energy costs all the way down the north&hyphen;east Queensland coast, which  adds to the prospects for downstream processing in the resources area. We find the minister is happy to welcome the proposal but is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prepared to do anything which might actually assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue which arises in the energy and resources area is the government's decision to abolish the Energy Research and Development Corporation, which, again, has adverse consequences for those interested in making sure Australia is at the cutting edge of energy research and development. I noticed the other day that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) welcomed the development of a ceramic oxide fuel cell, which is designed to turn heat from the burning of natural gas directly into electricity rather than through steam generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all well and good for the Minister for Science and Technology to welcome a scientific advance, but what the Minister for Science and Technology and the Minister for Resources and Energy will not tell the community is that this particular scientific advance was made as a direct result of a combination of the Energy Research and Development Corporation and CSIRO. What have we seen in the budget? We have seen the cutting of funds to CSIRO and the abolition of the Energy Research and Development Corporation. There is a linkage between all these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are serious about trying to make inroads into unemployment and if you are serious about trying to do what you can to give long-term unemployed people the opportunity of employment, then you have to do everything you can to maximise growth. In the Australian context, that means you have to maximise your trade enhancement measures, maximise your industry advancement measures, capitalise on your international strength and maximise and capitalise on the potential and prospects for downstream processing. That means that, at every port of call, at every step in the process, you have to do precisely the opposite of that which this government has done since it came into office and precisely the opposite of what we find in this budget reflected by the Appropriation Bill. I support the amendment moved by the member for Holt. I commend it to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most effective way any government can increase national savings is to increase public saving. As well as reducing the budget deficit and thus increasing our public saving, this budget will create savings incentives for Australians who were locked out of Labor's compulsory super scheme. Retirees, the unemployed and women at home all will be able to take advantage of the savings incentives. At the same time, only last week, my home state of South Australia recorded a historic budget surplus of $1 million. I congratulate the Treasurer, Stephen Baker, on this historic achievement after the debt legacy he was left with by the Bannon years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Addressing national savings remains one of the nation's primary goals. Almost every issue in every department&mdash;the debate on taxation and health care&mdash;can be related to the need for us to increase our national savings. Without increasing the amount that we save as a nation, we will never be able to grow fast enough to significantly reduce unemployment without running into a balance of payments crunch. The previous government racked up $69 billion in debt over the last five years. I congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for shouldering the burden of reducing public dissaving and forecasting an underlying budget surplus in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After public saving, improving household saving is harder because, by offering incentives for private savings, there is a substitution effect between different forms of saving rather than a net increase. Most East Asian countries boast national savings rates of over 30 per cent. Ours hovers around 17 per cent to 18 per cent. So the coalition has shown how to increase the savings of the public sector. But how to increase private savings is going to require a dramatic and generational change in attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are still two issues which need to be addressed. Both the taxation system and the flow of Commonwealth benefits to middle and upper income earners influence savings behaviour. The most sensible way to tax savings, as identified by Vince FitzGerald in his 1993 national savings strategy, is not to tax the contributions or the interest accrued 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but to tax the savings on the way out. The United States 401K savings vehicle adopts that principle. Unfortunately, in 1988, when Labor first began to tax super, they levied it on the contributions rather than on the exit point. Now, to change those arrangements would be complex to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue, as Vince FitzGerald pointed out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 8 May this year, is the provision of government benefits to middle and upper income Australians, which reduces the necessity and incentive for private household saving. It is estimated that $20 billion of benefits flow from the Commonwealth to middle and upper income earners in the form of transfer payments and other benefits. That reduces the incentive to save as well as to pool risk through such measures as insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, Medicare, by providing free health care to all regardless of income, removes any incentive for high income earners to provide for their own health or hospital care. As Alan Mitchell highlighted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in March this year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure survey showed that the top 20 per cent of households on an income scale received $3,000 a year in health care assistance from federal and state governments. In the area of higher education, 38 per cent of government benefits are received by the top five per cent of families based on income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The top 20 per cent of households receive $4,000 a year on average in education benefits. Middle and high income earners well aware of the benefits of education are hardly likely to need the subsidy and should be able to contribute more towards the education of their children. While it is arguable that secondary education is middle class welfare, there is no doubt that tertiary education is. In fact, a tertiary education increases the lifetime income of someone by $300,000. The free education experiment of Whitlam&mdash;rather than opening up the universities and changing the socioeconomic mix in the tertiary sector&mdash;actually ended up providing extensive Commonwealth subsidies to the middle class.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4636">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next 10 or 20 years, Australia needs to clearly outline what the role of government should be so that government spending will have its greatest benefit and will reach those who really need it. The core roles of government should remain specific social objectives which are demanded by the community, to intervene where there is clear evidence of market failure and for the assignment and regulation of property rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the 1996 National Commission of Audit highlighted, government programs should be targeted at those in greatest need and should not be provided to those who can provide for themselves. This group, in effect, would end up funding their own benefits through higher taxes. That process known as churning, where middle and high income earners are actually funding their own benefits through the tax system, is actually a particularly wasteful way of churning around the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government provision of services always needs to be reviewed. Where the original rationale for a subsidy, such as the operational subsidy for child care, is no longer apt, the government's support should be reviewed and reconsidered. To highlight an example, it is worth recounting the story of the channel observers which were set up by the British government during the Napoleonic Wars. As Gordon Pirie recounted in a speech in the mid-1980s, that post was officially abolished in 1948. Often government expenditure can have a self&hyphen;perpetuating nature and can persist even after the original rationale has gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud that in the areas such as child care, in recognising that the elderly, if they are able to, should be able to contribute to the cost of aged care in nursing homes, in tertiary education, in export market development grants, this government has really addressed the issue and the rationale of whether government assistance should be provided in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month, the British Labour Party won a historic victory at the polls. With a new Prime Minister in Britain, much has been made of his Australian connection&mdash;living as a child in Adelaide, studying at Oxford with Australians Geoff Gallop and Reverend Peter

<PARA STYLE="Para">The alignments and association are Byzantine in nature. It is well known around this parliament the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is of the view that not one member who was a minister in the Keating government will form part of the next Labor government, not if he can help it anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the crushing defeat at the last election, the member for Werriwa knew it was vitally important that he begin soliciting support for his ambition to become the next Labor Prime Minister. Not finding a terrific amount of support in New South Wales, the member for Werriwa happened on the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). The member for Melbourne was a willing participant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, fresh from his experience as the former President of the ACTU, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) had forced his way into Victoria&mdash;he is a New South Welshman, of course&mdash;and, to the chagrin of many, made himself the leader of the Left faction. For that, I think the member for Batman does deserve some respect because there are so many different left wings in Victoria that it is not funny. It was, however, the member for Melbourne who was clearly miffed because it was he who had filled the gap when Brian Howe had left and here was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4637"> the member for Batman, someone from interstate, arriving to replace him as left wing king.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, the member for Werriwa has the vision and the ambition. And why not? For it is the member for Werriwa's solemn belief that he is the only man in the Labor Party who can fill the boots of the great Gough. That is what drives him&mdash;the great social reformer, the social liberaliser. If Gough was the Che Guvera for the 1960s, the member for Werriwa is our home&hyphen;grown Tony Blair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as Blair used the ALP as his template for modernising the British Labour Party, it seems that the ALP, under the economic nationalists of Beazley and Crean, are determined to replicate the wilderness years of British Labour. Rather than Kim Beazley being some sort of antipodean Tony Blair, he is in fact the antipodean Michael Foot. He is the antipodean Neil Kinnock. He is the man who is determined to keep the Labor Party out of government for over a decade by retreating to the left and retreating to the policies of the 1950s. The opposition have retreated from their responsibility to form an alternative government and have retreated to the old values of 1950s Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that there are quite a few similarities between the ALP and British Labour. Britain's New Labour government has promised to abolish hereditary positions in the House of Lords. That gains a lot of currency amongst the young turks of the ALP, locked out by the troika of Beazley, Crean and Ferguson, who all followed their fathers into politics. They actually like the idea of abolishing hereditary peers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>'s higher education supplement of 14 May this year there appeared an article entitled `The gospel according to Latham'. In readily assuming the mantle of Labor's new higher education prophet, the member for Werriwa is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You listen to Blair's speech&mdash;it's education, education, education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the member for Werriwa has traipsed around the nation's university campuses over the last two months, the title of the speech he has been repeatedly delivering on education philosophy is `Freedom to achieve: New 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor thinking for post&hyphen;secondary education'. In his speech, Latham argues that under a Labor government there would be universal access to post&hyphen;secondary qualifications&mdash;the old Whitlam idea that you actually encourage and support higher education. Rather than targeting it to those who need it, you actually open it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before, the experiment of free education in terms of changing the socioeconomic mix of university students never achieved its goal. University campuses remained the preserve largely of the middle socioeconomic groups. That is why when we came to government the amount of Commonwealth government spending on the top five per cent of income families was 38 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to that article, the member for Werriwa's plan for education fits into a broader rethink of social democratic goals which reject the concept of higher learning and begin to thaw on the frozen Dawkins, left&hyphen;of&hyphen;centre thinking. The member for Werriwa has stated that he reflects the paradox of New Labor&mdash;he is a right&hyphen;leaning economist with Labor roots. He wishes to draw on the revolutionary spirit of the Dawkins era in changing tack. He has said that the education policies of the next federal Labor government will need to be quite different from those pursued in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Daleks like the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and for the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), it is actually sad to report that around the world most social democratic parties or parties of the centre left are actually looking to the future, not the past.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no quibble with the proposition that macroeconomic performance in the immediate post&hyphen;war period was far superior to any period before or after. This has led a lot of people to use it as a basis for proposing economic policies for today. They look back at how things were done in the 50s and 60s and say, `If only we did it the same way today, our macroeconomic performance would be as good as it was then.' This approach has some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> merit but, if we are to use it, it is very important that we get our facts straight about what the policies actually were in the 50s and 60s.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">According to the Governor, the success of the golden age in achieving sustainable growth with low inflation is attributable to a background of macro-economic policies that did not try to be too ambitious in the short run. The Governor is keen to remind those such as the member for Hotham, who would have this nation cowering behind economic nationalism policies more befitting the One Nation Party, that during the period 1945 to 1965 Australia's macro-economic performance was conducted in an environment of unprecedented political cohesion among Western countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such cohesion witnessed a remarkable revival of liberalism in international transactions and a greater emphasis on the need for economic growth than existed in previous decades.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4639"> facing citizens in the electorate of Corio today, namely, the problem of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only 14 months out from a substantial election victory, the Howard government has already frittered away the golden opportunity to consolidate the social and economic gains given to it by Labor. The rot has already set in, and it is rot right from the top down. The Prime Minister has failed to deliver leadership in too many areas for this government to regain the political credibility it has already lost in barely 14 months in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has failed to deliver leadership on breaches of his own ministerial code of conduct by his own senior ministers. He has failed to confront head on the socially divisive and internationally damaging views of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), diminishing his office and the nation by his silence. In the core policy area of industry policy, which determines the living standards and employment opportunities of all Australians, young and old, his indecisiveness and procrastination have earned him the condemnation of one business leader after another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More recently, his failure to respond decisively and compassionately to the stolen children report has propelled the nation into a position of paralysis on the issue of reconciliation with our Aboriginal brothers and sisters; a position where the nation is finding it extremely difficult to progress and to leave the past behind us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is in the great manufacturing regions of this nation that the deep sense of betrayal at the continued assault on their communities by the Prime Minister and this coalition government is felt the most. Job losses and job insecurity have increased substantially under John Howard's government. Regional business lacks the confidence to invest heavily in the face of the policy uncertainty surrounding Geelong's major car and textile clothing and footwear industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The social fabric of my electorate, the social fabric of that multicultural community which encompasses the Geelong region, has been put under very real pressure by the inaction of the Prime Minister in dealing with the damaging views of the member for Oxley. The process of betrayal of the regions of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia, like the one that I represent in this parliament tonight, has continued in the second Howard budget brought down in March by the Treasurer (Mr Costello).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first Howard budget brought down in 1996 was a fiscal statement that was bound to fail with the electors who had put their trust in the Prime Minister and the coalition, because it was based on a naked electoral lie behind which the coalition sought to disguise the implementation of its discredited Fightback agenda in 1993. That electoral lie was the government's portrayal of the Commonwealth government budget deficit as a catastrophe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister left Labor in 1983 a current dollar equivalent deficit of $25 million, yet he and the coalition attempted to portray a $10 billion deficit as the end of the Australian way of life as we know it. He sought to deceitfully equate the budget deficit with the nation's debt, which, as the Prime Minister knows, belongs largely to the private and not the public sector. The Prime Minister sought to build around the budget deficit an air of fake economic and political crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they made one fatal political mistake. It is the most fatal political mistake that any political party or group of politicians can make. They began to believe their own propaganda. The situation was made all the worse because the propaganda they were peddling was false. That was the tragedy for Australia. The first Howard budget was based on  propaganda and an electoral lie. The consequences of that situation were somewhat predictable. The government became incapable of recognising programs put in place by the previous Labor government that were actually working and meeting their objectives. They stupidly set about dismantling projects that were actually working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second predictable consequence of their action was to talk the Australian economy down, as they set lower targets for growth and lower targets for job creation. As economic confidence dissipated, especially in regional areas like that of Geelong, social confidence was battered with the emasculation of social programs that were meeting urgent needs in the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4640">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest disappointment of the first coalition budget was its low economic growth target and its expectation of low jobs growth, especially since the previous Labor government had left the coalition with an economy that had grown over the previous four years by over four per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it was not just this fact that set back the growth of key regional areas such as Geelong over the term of this government to date. It was the emasculation of the regional development program, the labour market programs and the business support programs which had delivered much to the people of Geelong in recent years that fuelled the lack of confidence that we are now experiencing in the region. It was the assault of the government on the students and staff of Deakin University that diminished that great tertiary university and the assault on child&hyphen;care funding which has left working families in Geelong with higher costs for their child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, that assault on the great regional areas of this nation and the people who live in my electorate has continued in this second coalition budget brought down by the Treasurer recently&mdash;a budget forgotten by the media within three days of delivery and a budget that the member for Boothby and other members are so ashamed of that he comes into this House and delivers five minutes of his appropriation speech on the positive aspects of his own coalition government's budget and he dissertates for 15 minutes on the policies of a new Labor government that will be elected at the next election. It is a budget submerged by controversy surrounding the Prime Minister's lack of leadership on Wik, on cross-media ownership and on immigration issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of jobs, unemployment and economic growth, this budgets offers nothing for Geelong. It is a tragedy which is only now beginning to unfold. The average rate of economic growth in Labor's last year of office was 4.4 per cent. This contrasts with the current rate of growth under the coalition of barely two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an admission of failure when we read today in the newspapers of the declining rates of growth that are being predicted for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian economy in coming months. What a tragedy for this nation that this coalition government could not emulate the previous Labor government in delivering high rates of growth&mdash;around four per cent over the previous four years&mdash;for the next four years. If the coalition government had delivered that target in their first and second budgets, we would be well on the way to getting rid of the government deficit without the corresponding cuts to economic programs that have been the hallmark of these two budgets to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor left office the unemployment rate was 8.5 per cent, and we had a plan in place to reduce that and we had set a target for the reduction in unemployment. Contrary to the promises that were made by the Prime Minister in his pre-election policy statements to address this problem, the unemployment rate has gone up to 8.7 per cent and unemployment in the great regions of Australia has increased accordingly as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The raw figures tell a sorry tale of despair as the Prime Minister has literally caved in on addressing Australia's No. 1 problem. The number of unemployed has increased by 31,500. Is that an achievement that honourable members opposite are really touting about their electorates? The number of long-term unemployed has increased by 30,100 and the youth unemployment rate, sadly, has increased under the two coalition budgets that have been delivered by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unemployment rate in the Geelong region stands in excess of 12 per cent and shows no sign of abating, especially in the face of local job losses in the public sector that are a direct casualty of the policies of this government to date and, more recently, 450 jobs that the government abolished at ASTAAS at the stroke of a pen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to look briefly at the average rate of employment growth in Labor's last term in office&mdash;a growth rate of 2.9 per cent&mdash;the coalition can only average a rate of employment growth of one per cent to March 1997. That is a bald admission of failure in the budget documents by a coalition government that promised much and has delivered little. The upshot of the government's caving in on the unemployment crisis in regional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4641"> areas and failing to engineer higher growth rates has been a dramatic drop in consumer and business confidence in Geelong and across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer comes into this parliament day after day touting the benefits of lower inflation rates for the Australian economy. None of us on either side of the House would begrudge the Australian economy a low interest rate regime. But as any high school economist would know&mdash;we know that the Treasurer is barely at the level of year 12 high school economics&mdash;when you break the back of the underlying inflation rate in any economy interest rates will flow down. If the interest rates overseas are in a state of decline, they will decline in Australia. If you depress the Australian economy by failing to address the fundamental problem of unemployment and you engineer a lower growth regime and lower total demand in the economy, you will depress the pressure on interest rates as well. The Treasurer claims credit for a reduction in interest rates that have been caused and are a direct result of the failure of the economic policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That lack of confidence in my region is further exacerbated by the failure of the government on the industry policy front to send the correct signals to Australian car manufacturers in this country as it considers the final report of the Industry Commission on the car industry. I was bitterly disappointed in the response of the Prime Minister on this issue today on the floor of this House when he failed to give any succour to the community of Geelong and the community delegation that is going to visit Geelong tomorrow to argue the case for holding the tariff levels at 15 per cent at the year 2000. I implore the Prime Minister tonight on the floor of this House to meet with that delegation and to hear the real concerns of people in regional areas who fear for their jobs and who fear for the livelihood of their families if the government were to get its policy settings on this particular industry wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to read from the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> , which was prepared by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;a body which was attacked in financial terms in the last budget with a 40 per cent cut. I ask members to remember the fact that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has suffered that cut as we reflect upon the stories recorded in their report. One story says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I first met my mother&mdash;when I was 14&mdash;she wasn't what they said she was. They made her sound like she was stupid, you know, they made her sound so bad. And when I saw her she was so beautiful. Mum said, `My baby's been crying' and she walked into the room and she stood there and I walked into my&mdash;I walked into my mother and we hugged and this hot, hot rush just from the tip of my toes up to my head filled every part of my body&mdash;so hot. That was my first feeling of love and it only could come from my mum. I was so happy and that was the last time I got to see her. When my mum passed away I went to her funeral, which is stupid because I'm allowed to go see her at her funeral but I couldn't have that when she requested me. They wouldn't let me have her.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The next statement, by the same witness, goes to the issue of an apology and restitution:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has to explain why it happened. What was the intention? I have to know why I was taken. I have to know why I was given the life I was given and why I'm scarred today. Why was my Mum meant to suffer? Why was I made to suffer with no Aboriginality and no identity, no culture? Why did they think that the life they gave me was better than the one my Mum would give me?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And an apology is important because I've never been apologised to. My mother's never been apologised to, not once, and I would like to be apologised to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, I've been a victim and I've suffered and I'll suffer until the day I die for what I've never had and what I can never have. I just have to get

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I shouldn't forget counselling. I've had to counsel myself all my life from a very young age. And in the homes I never showed by tears . . . I've been told that I need to talk about my childhood. I need to be counselled for me to get back on with my life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The stories told within this report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>  are ones that need to be thought about and read throughout the land in recognition of our history as a whole&mdash;both the good parts and the not so good parts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that copies are not available for the community at large. I think they have run out. There was only a fairly small print run.

In the great universe of things that hold us all, my concerns that I must bring to the notice of this chamber really do pale into insignificance, but the record must be put straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the adjournment debate speech of Senator Forshaw on 15 May 1997, in which he defamed my good name and character, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of Saturday, 17 May 1997, which included a by-line which read `Lib MP deceived her electorate' and which printed selected extracts from two letters which were sent from my office. Senator Forshaw and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> erroneously stated that I deceived my electorate in a letter I sent to constituents regarding a meeting at Engadine in my electorate on 30 April 1997. This meeting was organised by the state Labor member for Bulli, Mr Ian McManus, as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a protest against the Holsworthy airport option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first I knew of the details of any such meeting was when I read an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">St George and Sutherland Shire Leader</EMPHASIS> of 22 April 1997. In an article entitled `People before politics', the state Labor member for Bulli stated that I and he would be together on the podium at this meeting, yet at that time I had received no previous communication whatsoever from the state member for Bulli asking me to join him and speak at that meeting. I was extremely surprised when I read the article, which said I was to be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter I wrote to my constituents was true and correct. The letter I wrote to the state Labor member for Bulli on 24 April 1997 was the incorrect letter, and this is a fact about which the member for Bulli is fully aware. And, if Senator Forshaw and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> had asked him whether he had actually sent me an invitation to join him and speak at that meeting, he would have had to say no because he knows he never sent me such an invitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At about 2.20 on the afternoon of 22 April 1997, the same day the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leader</EMPHASIS> article appeared, my office received a faxed copy of a `Dear resident' letter about the coming meeting. Subsequent scrutiny of this faxed copy gives no indication as to whether or not it came from the office of the member for Bulli. This faxed copy of a form letter to residents could in no way be construed to be an invitation to speak at the meeting, as held out by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, and it was certainly not received by my office a week before I read about the meeting in the local newspaper, again as stated by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, the dates and times on the face of the document will clearly verify this fact. I made two errors in this matter. The first and the most serious was to trust the state Labor member for Bulli, Mr Ian McManus, when he said he wanted to put people before politics and to fight together on the Holsworthy airport issue, which is vitally important to our mutual constituents. The second was for me to describe the faxed `Dear resident' flier as a kind invitation from him in a misguided spirit of cooperation and good faith.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4643">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this incident, I have discovered that the state Labor member for Bulli is bent on scoring some kind of cheap political advantage and I regret to say he has acted without principle and without conscience. He has touted these two letters around to the media. He has spoken out against me in the state parliament in an act which is nothing less than bearing false witness against me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state member for Bulli knows that he did not send me an invitation, yet he has sufficient unmitigated deceit to claim I deliberately deceived my electorate when he is the grossest deceiver. I say this because the state member for Bulli is fully aware of the good faith in which I wrote those words to him. He knows that I believe that the vexed issue of Holsworthy airport is becoming the defining moment in the psyche of our neighbourhood communities and that it is bigger than him and it is bigger than me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He knows that I believe for him to be fighting me when we as elected representatives should be fighting on behalf of our constituents is nothing less than an insult to our constituents who have their backs against their front doors fighting for their very homes. He knows that, in the spirit of putting people before politics, I wrote to thank him for the kind invitation he never sent; yet he took my kind words, my good faith and my desire to establish a working relation with him and used them all against me. It is obvious he would prefer to keep the airport if he could get rid of Danna Vale. I put the state member for Bulli on notice that, at another place at some unpredetermined time and in some unpredetermined space in the highest court of all, I will charge him with bearing false witness against me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it any wonder that private citizens feel that politicians cannot be trusted? I have learnt at my personal cost that the state member for Bulli is certainly one that cannot be trusted upon his word. He is a disgrace to himself, a disgrace to his family and a disgrace to his party. I say that because there are members of that party whom I know to be honourable and decent human beings and who are working to make a valuable contribution to our country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The following is one of the many telling excerpts from chapter 10 of the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> them home</EMPHASIS>  of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Mr Ronald Wilson, on the matter of children's experiences&mdash;a matter that has touched the hearts of many of us in this place in recent days in the poignancy of that particular report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were told our mother was an alcoholic and that she was a prostitute and she didn't care about us. They [foster family] used to warn us that when we got older we'd have to watch it because we'd turn into sluts and alcoholics, so we had to be very careful. If you were white you didn't have that dirtiness in you . . . It was in our breed, in us to be like that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me briefly read some other equally telling and disturbing excerpts from chapter 10, which is on children's experiences:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I grew up sadly not knowing one Aboriginal person and the view that was given to me was one of fear towards [my] people. I was told not to have anything to do with them as they were dirty, lived in shabby conditions and, of course, drank to excess. Not once was I told that I was of Aboriginal descent. I was told that with my features I was from some Island and they [foster family] knew nothing of my family or the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was from a submission from a South Australian woman who was removed to a children's home at 18 months of age in the 1960s and was subsequently fostered by the caretakers. Another excerpt, this time from a child who was removed from her parents in 1967 in Victoria, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I got told my Aboriginality when I got whipped and they'd say, `You Abo, you nigger'. That was the only time I got told my Aboriginality.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another equally poignant excerpt, this time from a man in the Northern Territory who was removed to the Kahlin compound at three years of age in the 1930s and subsequently placed at a foster home called the Bungalow, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no food, nothing. We was all huddled up in a room . . . like a little puppy&hyphen;dog . . . on the floor . . . Sometimes at night time we'd cry with hunger, no food . . . We had to scrounge in the town dump, eating old bread, smashing tomato 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4644"> sauce bottles, licking them. Half of the time the food we got was from the rubbish dump.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What I want to say, and I am sure what the overwhelming majority of the members of this House want to say&mdash;perhaps with the notable exception of the member for Swan (Mr Randall), who submitted by way of interjection the other day that the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, Mr Beazley, was a sook because he demonstrated some emotion when speaking on this same report&mdash;is that we had no idea; we really are genuinely sorry. Above all else the Aboriginal people, in my view, just want us to know and to at least feign some understanding of their pathetically sad story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) were just to have for one moment the wherewithal or the intestinal fortitude to say on behalf of the whole country, `Hey, we think we've got some idea of what you went through and we really wish it hadn't happened,' I am sure that not only would this House be uplifted but the whole nation and the whole standard of politics as is perceived in this country would indeed experience a similar uplift. What is required, in my view, is a simple resolution in parliament to acknowledge that these events occurred, that they are part of our history and that they were unacceptable. As I say, this would have an incalculably positive impact upon what I believe to be a magnificent race of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that needs to be done is to make some restitution, whether it is financial, by way counselling or both. If it takes the Prime Minister's own legal advisers and officers to word an apology to get him to do it, I think, Mr Howard, for the sake of our nation, you ought to reconsider the government's decision of today and, in the words of that sports shoe ad, just do it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4644"><TITLE>Suine, Luigi and Teresa</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to pay tribute to two very special people in the electorate of Riverina. Until a few weeks ago, when I moved house, Luigi and Teresa Suine lived across the road from me. On 14 May this year Lui and Teresa celebrated 65 years of marriage. I am sure all members of the House will join 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> me in congratulating this marvellous couple who presently have five children, 18 grandchildren and 20 great grandchildren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story of Lui and Teresa is typical of many migrants who have come to Australia over the years and made it the great nation that it is. The Suine's contribution to the early settlement of Griffith within the Murrumbidgee irrigation area has been significant. Both Lui and Teresa were born in Cavaso, not far from the famous city of Venice, and they knew each other as youngsters in Italy. However, when Lui was aged 17, he travelled to Australia to seek a new life with his father, Peter. This was in 1927.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently Lui and Teresa purchased a silver medal from the Australian Mint which commemorated the opening of the provisional Parliament House. Lui told me he did so because he has been in Australia as long as that building has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On arriving in Griffith he stayed with friends in one of a row of shanties known as barraccas. Although he could not foresee the future, his future wife's father lived next to him and Lui immediately looked for work. He states with pride that there were only three months of the 70 years he has been in Australia that he could not find a job and at that time he survived by shooting ducks and rabbits and catching fish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with many migrants, Lui endured many trials during his early years in Australia and two years before his marriage to Teresa he requested of Teresa's father that he might write to her. This he did and after months of correspondence and an engagement, Teresa arrived in Australia. She arrived by ship in Sydney and was put on the train by the brother of Lui's best man. Eighteen hours later Lui and Teresa were married at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Griffith with about 15 family members in attendance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For their honeymoon Lui and Teresa walked from the church to Hanwood, then back to Murrumbidgee Avenue to visit Teresa's aunty, before walking to another farm where they had dinner with Teresa's father. They arrived back at their new home, which was a hut in Hanwood, at about four 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4645"> the next morning, having walked 20 miles on their wedding day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hut was made of logs with hessian lining. It was rather up market because it had a cement floor, while many others at the time had earthen floors. Gradually over the years the Suine's made their way in life through plain hard work and endeavour. They nurtured their family as Lui worked as a builder and farmer. Like many migrants, they wanted to give their children the opportunity for those things they never had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all they gave their family an example of what it means to be good citizens and contributors to the community in which they lived. Every morning, Lui, who is now aged 87, still rises at 5 a.m. and walks on Scenic Hill with his little dog Jemma leading the way. His walk normally takes over an hour. I have never seen a day go by, except when either of them may not have been well, when Lui and Teresa are not working around their home. I have often sought Lui's advice when about to launch a project of my own, while Teresa is the gardening expert.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I admire most about the Suine family is their unity and the total respect the younger generations have for Lui and Teresa. There is hardly a moment of the weekend when some members of the family are not visiting them to bring them up to date with family occurrences&mdash;a birth here, a graduation there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I know all of the Suine family have celebrated this great occasion, I believe it is something that all of those who know Lui and Teresa can rejoice in. In fact, it is an anniversary the entire Griffith community, and indeed the nation, can be proud of.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4645"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my Labor colleagues, I wish to read from the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>  of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, colloquially known as `the stolen children report'. I do so because a lot of people in the community who do not have access to this report&mdash;it is out of print&mdash;will wonder what the fuss is about. Through 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some of the stories in this report, I want to bring home to people why there is a need for an apology from this parliament and for people to understand that, although we cannot erase these past wrongs, it is necessary for us to understand them as a precondition to going forward together. So to the story of William:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can remember this utility with a coffin on top with flowers. As a little boy I saw it get driven away knowing there was something inside that coffin that belonged to me. I think I was about six years old at the time. This was the time of our separation, after our mother passed away. My family tried to get the Welfare to keep us here . . . trying to keep us together . . . My uncle wanted to keep me and he tried every way possible, apparently, to keep me. He was going to try and adopt me but they wouldn't allow it. They sent us away.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When St Francis [orphanage] closed up, they sent us out to different</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">places. My second eldest brother and I went to a Mrs R. And my only recollections of that lady was when we first went there. We were</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">greeted at the door. The welfare officer took us into this house and I can remember going into this room, and I'd never seen a room like it. It was big, and here me and my brother were going to share it. We put our bags down on the floor. We thought, `This is wonderful'. As soon as the welfare officer left, Mrs R took us outside that room and put us in a two bed caravan out the back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was sleeping in the caravan. I was only a little boy then. In the middle of the night somebody come to the caravan and raped me. That person raped me and raped me. I could feel the pain going through me. I cried and cried and they stuffed my head in the pillow. And I had nobody to talk to. It wasn't the only night it happened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it seemed like night after night. It seemed like nobody cared. I don't know how long it went on for, but night after night I'd see the bogey man. I never saw the person. I don't know who that person was.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then we were all taken away again to a new home, to another place . . . And when I did have a friend I was shunted off somewhere else, to some other place. Wanting my mother, crying for my mother every night, day after day, knowing that she'd never come home or come and get me. Nobody told me my mother died. Nobody . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They shifted us again and that was into town again. And then they put us in with this bloke . . . They've got records of what he did to me. That man abused me. He made us do dirty things that we never wanted to do. Where was the counselling? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4646"> Where was the help I needed? They knew about it. The guy went to court. He went to court but they did nothing for me, nothing . . . I remember the child psychologist saying, `He's an Aboriginal kid, he'll never improve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hit the streets of Adelaide. I drank myself stupid. I drank to take the pain, the misery out of my life. I couldn't stop. I smoked dope, got drugs. I tried everything. I did everything. I just couldn't cope with life. I lived under cardboard boxes. I used to eat out of rubbish bins. I'm so ashamed of what I've done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suffer today. I still suffer. I can't go to sleep at night. It's been on for years. . . . I wake up in the middle of the night, same time. My kids have asked me why I get up in the middle of the night and I can't explain it, I can't tell them&mdash;shamed. . . . I often wish I was dead. I often wish I was gone. But I can't because of my children. You can't explain this to your kids. Why did this happen? I had nobody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've had my secret all my life. I tried to tell but I couldn't. I can't even talk to my own brothers. I can't even talk to my sister. I fear people. I fear `em . . . It's rarely I've got friends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish I was blacker. I wish I had language. I wish I had my culture. I wish my family would accept me as I am. We can't get together as a family. It's never worked. We fight, we carry on. I've always wanted a family.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That comes from a man removed from Alice Springs to Adelaide in the 1950s. It is because of that and so many other accounts in this report that we need, as a parliament, to pass a resolution to say to the people around Australia that we are sorry, and that is a precondition to moving forward.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4646"><TITLE>Member for Hughes

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, can I say to the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) that, listening to her earlier contribution, she may be very small in stature but she is certainly big in heart and she is even bigger when it comes to the commitment to her electorate. She should always remember that, even in the political processes, honesty and ethics will eventually prevail. I commend her for what she had to say this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of months ago it was an honour and a pleasure for me to attend the inaugural 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> address at the University of Southern Queensland given by the new Vice&hyphen;Chancellor, Professor Peter Swannell, and to listen to what he had to say. It was a brilliant speech, it was a very witty speech, it was intuitive and it was indicative of a chief executive of a tertiary institution who really wants to have total excellence when it comes to tertiary education in our nation. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to read in part from that speech and put forward a few of the points that were made in that very lengthy speech to the university. The professor said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This university&mdash;a regional, flexible and international university&mdash;is one of the undiscovered treasures of the Australian university system. It has remained largely undiscovered by those who live and move and have their beings in Canberra, or east of the Kenmore shopping centre&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is in Brisbane&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for many reasons.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attainable goals, whatever they may be, must also be perceived to be just that&mdash;attainable. The land of attainable goals is then a natural outcome of what we are good at. It must also be described in a way which is interesting, inspirational, innovative, inviting, individualistic yet integrating, interpretable internationally, intentionally intriguing, in place, in touch and in tune with the imperatives which have been put in place for all institutions in the next decade. It is an `in' thing that I am talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are good at is what we are. We are regional and we are also flexible and what we are is international. We are regional because we have the good fortune to be sited in one of the great productive key areas of Australia and the focus for the education of regional Australians for many, many years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are regional because we try very hard to be a university where indigenous Australians can increasingly contribute to its intellectual, social and cultural life. We recognise our special responsibility towards Aboriginal people as part of our commitment to the provision of educational opportunities to disadvantaged people, irrespective of race or social circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are regional because we are part of the national scene, part of a diverse multicultural country and as much part of that region of the world called Australia as are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra and the rest. We are regional because we function in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific rim, the home of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4647"> most significant economic and social movers and shakers in the modern world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are regional because we do regionally significant things. We provide a focus for theatre, for music and the visual arts in the region. We provide educational programs which recognise the needs of regional and remote Australians, nurses in isolated communities, teachers in country schools, farmers who need to sort out their accounts, small business people, land managers who really care about sustainable development, engineers who are happy to build roads and provide power, sewerage and infrastructure for the outback. We do leading edge research in agricultural engineering and environmental biotechnology, in literacy and learning, in the literacy of Australia, in the languages and literature of Asia. The things we do and provide in business and management education for the armed forces, for industry executives and for people who are just pressing on with their careers demonstrate that regional excellence means national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are international because we probably know more about providing educational opportunities for students worldwide than almost every other university.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present we have some 3,000 international students studying in their own countries and a further 900 international enrolments on campus in Toowoomba. That places us in the top five international providers overall among Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is with pleasure that I read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  record those excerpts from an excellent speech.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4647"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Early this evening and last week a number of my colleagues read into the record stories from the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> , which is the heart&hyphen;rending report on the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. In the short time left to us, I would like to read a couple of extracts from that report. This is a report that every Australian should read, and you cannot but have your heart broken when you read it. In confidential evidence to the inquiry, a person from Victoria said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why me; why was I taken? It's like a hole in your heart that can never heal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another person said in evidence:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Actually what you see in a lot of us is the shell, and I believe as an Aboriginal person that everything is inside of me to heal me if I know how to use it, if I know how to maintain it, if I know how to bring out and use it. But sometimes the past is just too hard to look at.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another person who spoke to the inquiry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've often thought, as old as I am, that it would have been lovely to have known a father and a mother, to know parents even for a little while, just to have had the opportunity of having a mother tuck you into bed and give you a good&hyphen;night kiss&mdash;but it was never to be.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was said by a woman who was put in a foster home at two months of age. Another person said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It never goes away. Just `cause we're not walking around on crutches or with bandages or plasters on our legs and arms, doesn't mean we're not hurting. Just `cause you can't see it doesn't mean . . . I suspect I'll carry all these sorts of wounds `til the day I die. I'd just like it to be not quite as intense, that's all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are stories that Australians need to know. These are stories about people who were hurt by people who often had the best of intentions. No-one is saying that many of the people who were involved in the stories of these Aboriginal people when they were young had bad intentions. But what all Australians need to understand is the hurt and the damage that was done to those people. We need to ask ourselves: what would we do if someone took away one of our children? What sort of anger and hurt would we have?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Department of Defence owns 20 golf courses. In addition, there are two private golf courses at Swan Island and Mt Macedon in Victoria on land leased from Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Defence golf clubs provide a sporting and social amenity for Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel and participation is encouraged with varying levels of financial support provided. Membership of private golf clubs is generally unattainable for ADF personnel over the period of a posting due to membership waiting times and the high cost of joining fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence golf clubs are also used by spouses and dependants, Defence civilians, ex&hyphen;ADF members and the public. The clubs are administered by duly appointed or elected officials and their accounts are subject to audit. Clubs derive income mainly from membership, competition and green fees. Most golf club buildings are owned by Defence although responsibility for maintenance of assets varies. Similarly, responsibility for course maintenance and ownership of equipment is shared or rests with either Defence or the clubs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Golf course areas are used for other purposes such as training and recreational areas, buffer zones, fire breaks, green belts, wildlife refuges and designated emergency landing sites. Hence, areas utilised for golf courses would need to be maintained, although not to the extent that a golf course itself requires. Clubhouse facilities are also used by other Defence sporting and social clubs.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many instances, Defence costs can only be approximated as utilities are not always separately metered and course maintenance can be part of a wider base contract. The total estimated cost of maintaining, running and administering the 20 golf courses is $3,390,000 of which Defence's contribution is estimated to be some $710,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Both gentomycin and enrofloxacin (a member of the fluoroquinolone group of antibiotics) have been restricted in Australia to use only in non&hyphen;food animal species on the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Working Party on Antibiotics (previously known as The Expert Panel on Antibiotics). The Working Party on Antibiotics consider that the use of gentomycin and enrofloxacin in food animals could potentially lead to a transfer of resistance from animals to humans and could compromise the use of gentomycin and the fluroquinolone group of antibiotics in human medicine. The antibiotic enrofloxacin is not used in human medicine in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Both gentomycin and enrofloxacin have been used in poultry production overseas. Both antibiotics are used therapeutically and not for growth promotion. Overseas countries consider that both gentomycin and enrofloxacin are valuable therapeutic antibiotics for use in poultry and other animal diseases, particularly food&hyphen;borne diseases such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli (E coli). Overseas Regulatory Authorities do not seem to have the same concerns over the potential transfer of resistance from animals to humans as does the Australian Working Party on Antibiotics. Moreover, Overseas Regulatory Authorities do not consider that the use of gentomycin and enrofloxacin in food animals contributes significantly to the resistance that is already development by the use of these antibiotics in human therapy.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
