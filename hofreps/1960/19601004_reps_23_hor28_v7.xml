                        <para>- I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister a question. What consideration has the Government given to the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Committee since the committee's report was tabled in the Parliament? Does the Government propose to take, during the life of the present Parliament, any action to Seek public approval of all or any of the recommendations by the holding of a referendum? If not, can it be assumed that the work of the committee and the considerable expenditure involved are to be written off as a complete loss? Finally, if the report is to be relegated to a pigeonhole in a government office, will the Acting Prime Minister explain what purpose the Government had in mind when it decided to appoint a committee to review the Australian Constitution?</para>

                        <para>- The report mentioned by the honorable member has been under consideration, by the Government. I understand that he is or was a member of the committee in question. The report embraces issues of such great magnitude that it would not be expected, I am sure, to lend itself to the making of hasty and conclusive decisions. I assure the honorable member and all the members of parliaments - I emphasize that it isparliaments in the plural - who are interested in this matter that the report will no find a final resting place in a pigeonhole. It will result in useful, constructive decisions. Obviously, at this stage I cannot say whether action will be taken in the near future or whether any action taken will result in an approach to the people.</para>

adopted to ensure that these additional exports are balanced between primary and secondary production? If not, will the Minister call together representatives of the various interested groups in order to formulate such a plan?</para>

                        <para>- Some people have an impression - I do not attribute this to the honorable member  - that the Government calculates what exchange resources the country needs over a stated period and then composes a mathematical plan designed to produce exactly those exchange earnings in the stated period. The Government does not work in that way. It does not believe that in a country where production and trading are so dependent on  the dynamics of private enterprise one can plan with that kind of precision. That occurs only under authoritarian forms of government. Having said that, I go on to say that the Government is, of course, constantly conscious of the need to ensure that over a period our exchange earnings are equated, with our exchange requirements. There  is a constant process of consultation between the Government and representatives of both primary and secondary industry. Primary industry has long since been geared to this purpose, because over a period it has provided the greater percentage of our export commodities. More recently, the Export Development Council and the Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council have represented the point of contact on this very subject between the Government and both primary and secondary industry.</para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Territories will recollect that in June last year he stated, that the Government had decided not to appeal from the Supreme Court of New Guinea to the High Court of Australia in the Sear case, not only because it did not think  appeal should be made but also because it was extremely doubtful whether an appeal could be made. I now ask him why an opportunity was not taken in the legislation now before the House to put beyond doubt the Crown's right of appeal against the extent or nature of the sentence imposed1 by a single Supreme Court judge in any future case in. which the Crown's advisers believe that the judge has been in  error.</para>

                        <para>- The case to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred was one in which there was room for difference of opinion as to whether a sentence passed by the Supreme Court of New Guinea had been severe enough. The point at issue was whether the Administration had power to lodge an appeal so as to increase the severity of the sentence. Quite apart from the particular case under notice, this point was considered very carefully by the Government and by its legal advisers. The opinion was reached that it was not desirable to take powers to enable the Crown to lodge an appeal in order to increase the severity of a sentence. It is because of a policy decision on that matter that no provision is made in the bill before the House.</para>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                            it is correct, as stated by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, that the directories of Sydney and Melbourne recently have been divided into two parts - the general section and the classified section. This was done mainly because the directories had become so large that they were difficult to handle. I have no doubt that, ultimately, as a similar position develops in other capital cities the same action will be taken. We have not yet arrived at the stage in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart at which such action would be necessary, involving, as it would, some extra cost in printing.
                        </para>
                        <para>The size of the type is a matter to which the department has applied itself for some time in order to determine the best type to use and, at the same time, to keep down as far as possible the cost of printing direc tories. The type used in the various directories at present is known as 6 point Bell Gothic. It has been selected, not only in Australia, but also by a number of other postal administrations throughout the world as the best for this kind of publication. It is certainly small, but it is not smaller than many of the types which one sees in newspapers and in other publications. I have noticed, in looking at the various directories from time to time, that this type, which is used1 in all capital city directories, seems a little more clear in, say, the Brisbane or Perth directories than in the Sydney and Melbourne directories. That is solely because a finer paper is used in the latter two directories in order to keep down size and cost. I am mentioning these facts, Mr.Speaker, because I wish the honorable member for Maribyrnong to know that this is a subject to which we have applied very considerable thought. At present we feel that the system now operating is the best that can be devised, but of course we will continue to try to ensure that we produce a directory, at a reasonable cost, which provides a service which the subscribers will appreciate.</para>

                        <para>- Thank you. In an electorate of that size, the honorable gentleman's constituents must cover great distances when they want to get in touch with him, as naturally they do, because of the representation he gives them. The question raises the matter of the policy of the department in the determination of trunk charges. It will be remembered that in the last couple of years the department has aimed at simplifying the charges applicable to all trunk line traffic by reducing from 22 to eight the number of mileage divisions to which trunk charges apply. In so doing we have had to amalgamate some of the divisions. One of the things we have had to do, bearing in mind that Australia is a land of great distances and that there will be many business and other calls made between widely separated points, is to reduce considerably the charges for calls over the greater distances. About two years ago it cost 24s. 7d. to make a three-minute call over a distance of 1,000 miles or more. That charge was reduced, first, to £1. Now, as a result of a further reduction, the charge for any major trunk call in Australia is 15s. In other words, within the space of a little over a couple of years, we have brought the charge for three-minute day-time calls over the longer distances down from 24s. 7d. to 15s. Obviously there is a limit to what we can do in matters like this. The charge for calls over distances of 400 or 500 miles is the same as that for calls over a distance of 1,500 miles. That is the result of the policy which we are pursuing and which we will be able to develop as we improve our services.</para>

Is he aware that a leading trading bank has stated that official policy will require it to refuse credit and drastically reduce overdrafts? Will this mean less money for home builders and farmers and essential services, but not less - and probably more - for borrowers who pay high interest rates? Does he agree that this distortion is the result of the fact that only part, and a shrinking part, of lending is regulated at all?</para>

                        <para>- As the honorable member for Wide Bay knows, the building to house the new automatic exchange at Bundaberg was completed some little time ago. The equipment which will be placed in that building in order to provide a completely automatic service in that area has now been obtained and the task of installing it is  a charge against this year's Budget. I think all honorable members know that the installation of automatic equipment for a large telephone exchange handling between, say, 1,000 and 2,000 subscribers, is quite a big job and generally takes up to twelve months to complete. Therefore it is expected that the new automatic exchange will be in operation in Bundaberg about twelve months from now - some time in October next year.</para>

                    <para>As the honorable member has pointed out in his question, there still exists a number of unsatisfied applications in the Bundaberg area. In order to cope with them, as a temporary measure, a new switchboard was installed recently in the manual exchange, and practically the whole of the present outstanding applications will be serviced through that new switchboard and will be in operation before the commencement of the automatic exchange. Therefore the present situation is being dealt with, and, in addition, when the automatic system comes into operation after October next year, I am informed - of course this is partly my own area and I know the position there pretty well - that the equipment in the new automatic exchange will be sufficient to meet all the increased demands, based on current applications, for a very considerable number of years.</para>

                        <para>- I speak from memory when I say that my statement of a little over a week ago was that I hoped to have the allocation of country television licences under consideration- not determined - by the Government in anything up to a fortnight. The honorable member very naturally asks whether the visit overseas of the Prime Minister will lead to a further delay. I reply that the Prime Minister's absence abroad will not, of itself, lead to a delay of this determination, but this is a matter of such importance in the development of television throughout Australia that I would very much like to have the Prime Minister present when the determination is made. I am expressing my own opinion that this would be highly desirable.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Perhaps I should expand that statement, because the honorable member for Macquarie -asked me a somewhat similar question last week. I want to make the point that it may not be realized yet, although it will be realized when the report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is released, just what an important determination this will  be in the development and expansion of television throughout Australia. The board has had a much more difficult and complex task in making this determination than it bad previously. The various questions that now arise affect not just this phase of            television but also future phases. The problems include the availability of frequencies, the use of very high frequency or ultra-high frequency transmissions, the availability of programmes, and the number of channels that must be prepared for use as far ahead as we can anticipate. Therefore, the report, to which I have been giving close consideration during the last two or three weeks, is a very important one. Although I realize that quite an amount of time has been taken in this present investigation, I have no intention of unduly rushing a decision, in view of the importance of the whole matter.</para>

He asks what action could be taken to keep down the size of telephone directories if all subscribers required the larger type. Of course, the obvious reply is that in such a case the revenue of the department would be considerably increased, and there would then be enough money to produce a directory of the kind envisaged.</para>

                        <para>- I am not going to be drawn into a debate on the last: part of the honorable member's question. However, in referring to the possible use of space satellites for television, the honorable member has touched upon a very interesting development that could have important effects over the whole field of communications, and not just on television alone. All I can tell the honorable member on this subject is that the possible use of space satellites for commercial purposes is at present under initial survey - I cannot say more than that. Voicing my personal opinion, I say that it is  quite possible that within a few years we shall have reached the stage at which signals of various kinds may be either bounced off satellites or received by some equipment in the satellites and then retransmitted to receiving stations in various  parts of the world. I repeat that the investigation of this possibility is in its initial stages, and I should think that a great deal of capital will have to be expended in order to determine, first, how such satellites can be put into orbit and kept there over a considerable period so that they will be reliable; and, secondly, how the best results can be gained from the presence of those satellites in space. These are matters that will take a number of years to determine, but one would foolish to say that the possibilities do not exist, and that the desired end will not be achieved in the reasonably near future. I think it will be.</para>

                        <para>- I ask the Acting Prime Minister a question. Was it the practice for some time after the inauguration of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization to keep the Leader of the Opposition as well as the Prime Minister fully advised regarding all important information coming into the possession of the A.S.I.O., as a protection against possible abuse of its powers? If so, will the right .honorable gentleman say why the practice was diicontinued? Is it because the A.S.I.O. is not now engaged exclusively upon matters involving national security, but has become the Government's secret political police, force?</para>

                        <para>- I have seen a newspaper report that some agreement has been reached between Mr. Macmillan, the British Prime Minister, and Mr. Eisenhower, the President of the United States of America, but I have no knowledge of any such agreement. I think bothMr. Macmillan and President Eisenhower would know that no effective agreement of this nature could be made without the prior approval of the Australian Government. At the same time I would like to say that the utmost cooperation has been achieved between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America with regard to the use for certain purposes of the Woomera rocket range by the Americans. It will be remembered that during the International Geophysical Year the Americans supplied certain minitrack and satellite-tracking equipment to us. That equipment has been left at Woomera and is still being used. They are also paying the cost of installations in relation to Project Mercury, the man-in-space satellite, and I am sure that the Australian Government will give every consideration to any request which is received from the British Prime Minister or the United States President in this regard.</para>

Will he confer with the Minister for Repatriation with the object of devising means of advising ex-servicemen, who are at present receiving an age pension or part age pen sion and who are eligible for a service pension, how they can transfer to the service pension? Is there any way in which these ex-servicemen who are at present receiving a pension can transfer to a service pension other than by filling in a new application form, so that they may be able to receive the new hospital benefits in a repatriation hospital?</para>

                        <para>- I shall be glad to confer with my friend and colleague, the Minister for Repatriation, in another place, and see whether it is possible to give some advice as to how a person receiving one pension can transfer and become eligible to receive another pension in its stead. At present, there is nothing to prevent a person in receipt of an age pension who qualifies for a service pension from transferring from the age pension to a service pension by cancelling the one and making application for the other. I can see no other way to effect the change. Applications are necessary in both cases, and an application for one pension could not be accepted as an application for another in a different department; but, Mr. Speaker, the persons in receipt of an age pension get advantages that have to be carefully weighed against the advantages received by those in receipt of service pensions. It is a matter for determination by the individual concerned.</para>

                        <para>- Although I am not quite sure, I have some recollection of having seen something about this matter quite recently. The honorable member for La Trobe has referred to a problem which we have to meet from time to time when some person who has been conducting a telephone exchange - often for a considerable period of years - is no longer able to continue the great service he or she has rendered. Under present day  conditions, very often it is difficult to replace such a person. The alternatives are to find somebody else in the district who is prepared to provide the service or to establish something in the nature of a small automatic exchange. There is a limit to the number of these automatic exchanges we can provide each year in Australia. It is our policy to substitute country automatic exchanges for manual exchanges as fast as possible. That is our objective, but until we are able to apply that policy completely, we have to resort at times to expedients. Either we have to get somebody else to work the exchange, or connect up the trunk lines with some points in the service which will ensure that the area or district is not deprived of a service. I shall have another look at the matter to which the honorable member has referred and see what can be done in this case.</para>

Does this procedure make the detection of losses more difficult? ls it a fact that employees of the Postal Department, the majority of whom are honest, would prefer the previous method because it afforded greater protection for their own integrity?</para>

                        <para>- My question to the Minister for Air refers to the Commonwealth property at Helidon in Queensland which was used previously by the Royal Australian Air Force as an ammunition depot. Will his department require this area in the future, or will all the property and buildings be transferred to the Department of the Interior for disposal? I refer also to No. 7 Stores Depot at Toowoomba. Is any change in the structure of this depot contemplated in the future? Can the Minister indicate the principal areas which are serviced at present by this establishment?</para>

                        <para>- The Air Force property at Helidon, near Toowoomba in Queensland, which was formerly used as an ammunition store, will not be required any further by my department. The ammunition store has been closed down and I shall soon take the last steps in disposing of the property, which will be to declare it formally surplus to my department's requirements and to hand it over to my colleague, the Minister for the Interior, for disposal.</para>

                    <para>The stores depot at Toowoomba, which also is in the electorate of Darling Downs which my friend represents, is an important R.A.A.F. establishment. Had I been inclined to neglect its importance, which I hope I have not done, the assiduous attention which the honorable member gives to the needs of his electorate would have made it impossible for me to do so. I assure him that no change is contemplated in the use or purpose of No. 7 Stores Depot at Toowoomba. It is the principal depot for the supply of a wide range of stores to all Air Force establishments and units in Queensland. It is also the central store for the whole of Australia for certain items of equipment. The wide re-arrangement of bases and units which has been carried out by my department over the last two years in an effort to obtain greater economy and efficiency, has led to a careful examination of the future of that stores depot. A decision has been made to continue the depot in its present form and for its present purposes.</para>

Will the Minister ascertain whether any agreements or decisions have been made by the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the President of the United States in connexion with the use of Woomera as a place for launching rockets, or for space research? Will he make a statement to the House in connexion with the matter? If any decisions have been made, will the Minister try to explain to  the House how this does not involve some loss of Australian responsibility and sovereignty? If no decisions have been arrived at, will he take into account, when decisions are being made, the responsibility of this House, as well as of the Government, as many millions of pounds might be involved?</para>

                        <para>- The honorable member was good enough to give me some indication of his interest in this matter. I am able to say that loans to the rural community are not lower than they were in 1953; they are very much higher. Actually, advances to the rural community by the trading banks are £89,000,000 higher than they were in 1953. In addition to that, there has been an increase during the last twelve months of £10,000,000 in the amount of money lent through pastoral houses, the total of loans from that source now being £101,000,000. There has, however, been a slight reduction in the percentage of all advances to the rural community in the last couple of years, but it is a diminution from a pretty high level of lending. In fact, the percentage of loans to the rural community to-day is still slightly higher than it was in 1953, and quantitatively it is higher to the extent of £89,000,000.</para>

                        <para>- I think that in the Old World there is still some residue of belief that  Australia as well as the other independent members of the British Commonwealth of Nations in some sense needs permission from Whitehall to do this and that. This is a residue of thinking long since out of date. I cannot say explicitly what the trade  commissioners can do about this, but I can say that the whole impact of Australian trade promotion and diplomacy is to establish the complete independence of the  Australian nation and our competence to make our own decisions in accordance with our own policy wishes. As between the Australian States, our trade commissioners are under quite explicit instructions, which I believe are being observed, to preserve neutrality. So I am sure that no Australian trade commissioner would ever advise an interested party overseas that he would do better to go to one State than to another. On the other hand, the function of the trade commissioners is to give all the information that is pertinent to the inquiries directed to them.</para>

                        I wish to direct my remarks
              to the proposed vote for the Department of Health, with particular reference to the
              pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This scheme is a fraud on the general public. Until
              1st March, 1960, life-saving drugs could be prescribed by all registered doctors and
              dispensed free of charge by any chemist. Since that date, this situation has been
              altered, and a special fee of 5s. is now charged for all those drugs which previously
              were available free of charge. When this change in the scheme was made, wide publicity
              was given to the statement that, in compensation for the charge of 5s., the list of
              drugs was being greatly extended and would include from 1st March of this year almost
              any drug which a doctor wanted to prescribe. The public was told that this new
              arrangement would be a progressive step and that, in spite of the charge of 5s. for
              each prescription, medicine would be obtainable more easily and more cheaply than
              before.
                    </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The facts are quite different. The charge of 5s. for each prescription makes
            medicine much more expensive than it was before 1st March last. This charge amounts to a
            new special tax - a paltry and mean tax - on the sick, and especially on those who are
            chronically ill. There is not a word of truth in the statement that almost every drug
            needed is available with the adoption of the enlarged list. The truth is that this list
            contains costly cheap and obsolete drugs which no self-respecting doctor has prescribed
            in the last twenty years. This list could be better and more accurately described as the
            list of rubbish drugs - the drugs that are left. The cost of these rubbish drugs is
            mostly little more than the 5s. the patient has to contribute. The majority of these
            medicines cost less than 8s., the patient paying 5s. and about 3s. being paid by our
            munificent Federal Government which belabours this so-called free medicine scheme. The
            great majority of modern drugs have been completely omitted from the allegedly enlarged
            list of drugs, and a patient who needs these modern drugs has to pay for them in exactly
            the same way as he paid for them before the scheme was altered.</para>
                <para>The first fraud in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as it at present operates
            consists in the fact that although the people were told that almost all medicines would
            bc available for the charge of 5s., all that the public can obtain is cheap rubbish, the
            majority of modern drugs having to be paid for in full by the patient. Whether or not
            members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Country Party like it, that
            is a fact. The second fraud in this scheme consists in an arbitrary limitation of the
            quantity of drugs available for the charge of 5s. This is a particularly severe
            limitation for a patient with a chronic disease who needs certain drugs permanently. He
            has to pay the charge of 5s. again and again. Indeed, his medicines would cost him only
            about half as much each month if he bought his monthly supply all at once and paid it
            entirely out of his own pocket without relying on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If
            any private person or a company cheats and defrauds the public by false statements, the
            Attorney-General immediately accuses the person or persons responsible and most probably
            a gaol sentence results. Has the public to accept a fraud when it is imposed by the
            federal health authorities?</para>
                <para>I should like to read a list of modern drugs which are needed every day by many
            thousands of persons, especially those who suffer from high blood pressure.</para>

                already increasing very rapidly. Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from high
                blood pressure. Modern treatment all over the world requires drugs of the rauwolfia
                or reserpine group. The drugs concerned are raudixin tablets, Serfia tablets,
                Serpasil, Serpiloid and Harmony tablets. None of these are on the free list.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>Tranquillizer drugs are also important because, through the hustle and bustle of
            modern life, many thousands of people - probably several hundred thousands - suffer from
            nervous exhaustion, nervous tension, and over-excitability. All over the world, modern
            treatment requires drugs of the meprobamate group and promazine. The drugs concerned are
            Largactil, and Karmazine, Atarax, Equanil, Vallergan, Siquil, Prozin, Sparin and
            Stelezine. None of these drugs is on the free list. Nor are anti-rheumatic drugs nor
            drugs required for liver diseases and upperrespiratory tract infections. 1 have a list
            of cheap medicines which are available under the Government scheme. These are drugs
            which, as I have said before, decent doctors refuse to prescribe. I emphasize that they
            are rubbish. Mixtures available under the widened Government scheme cost mainly 7s. 3d.
            or 7s. 6d. The patient pays 5s. for them and the balance is paid by the Government.
            These include aspirin mixture, magnesia hydroxide mixture, magnesium sulphate mixture,
            mercuric eye ointment, phenobarbitone tablets, potassium citrate mixture, thyroid
            tablets and stilboestrol tablets.</para>
                <para>I also have a list of drugs which are more expensive under the pharmaceutical
            benefits scheme than by prescription without the scheme, due to the restricted quantity
            available under the scheme. The first on the list is vitamin K tablets. Under the scheme
            the number that can be obtained on any one prescription is 25. These may be bought from
            any chemist at a cost of 100 for 8s. 9d. but, bought under the scheme 25 at a time, 100
            would cost £1. Aspirin and dover tablets are limited to 25 which cost 5s. under
            this munificent scheme but 100 may be bought from any chemist for 12s. 3d. Here, the
            additional cost under the scheme is 7s. 9d. A maximum of 25 butobarbitone tablets may be
            prescribed under the scheme and these cost 5s., yet the cost of 100 is lis., a
            difference in price of 9s. per 100. The maximum number of ephedrine hydrochloride
            tablets that can be prescribed is 25. Again, these cost 5s. whereas 100 may be bought
            for 7s. 3d. Not more than 25 neoepinine tablets may be prescribed at a cost of 5s.,
            whereas 100 may be bought for 18s. The maximum number of 25 pentobarbital tablets cost
            5s. while 100 may be bought for 13s. 3d., a difference in price of 6s. 9d. per 100. A
            maximum of twelve carbrital capsules may be obtained for 5s. although 100 may be bought
            for £1 12s. which represents a loss of 12s. 6d. to the patient. A maximum of 25
            nembudein tablets may be bought for 5s. whereas 100 cost 19s. 3d. or 9d. less than under
            the scheme. The maximum of twelve Seconal capsules prescribed under the scheme cost 5s.,
            while J 00 cost 28s. 6d., a saving of 14s. The maximum of 25 quinine tablets cost 5s.,
            while 100 costs 9s.</para>
                <para>These figures are taken from the price list of the Knoll Laboratories. This is an
            official list which is issued to doctors and chemists. Doctors must prescribe and
            chemists must charge according ito this list. I shall be very interested to hear the
            Minister's reply to my charges. My constituents are sick and tired of listening to
            the fraudulent publicity which comes over the air in an endeavour to give people the
            idea that they can get free medicine at any time. The general public pays an enormous
            rate of taxation in order to finance the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Yet the
            chronically ill including those who are seriously ill often have to pay, under this
            scheme, almost double the price that they would have to pay if the scheme did not exist.
            Once again, I challenge the Minister to deny the figures which I have placed before the
            committee. I should like to hear the Minister's reply to the case that I have
            presented.</para>

                    The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a good scheme and is well appreciated by all

                        I
              feel that one of the most urgent investigations of this committee should be into the
              incidence of cancer in Australia, with perhaps a subcommittee appointed to compile
              statistics concerning the incidence of cancer in ex-servicemen. Some statistics are
              available on the general occurrence of cancer in Australia, but no detailed
              information can be secured regarding the incidence of cancer in ex-servicemen. The
              Minister for Health
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron)</inline>
                        and the

                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Wight),</inline>
                        admitted that all the information required on this matter was not
              available. I think that this information should be compiled from existing records and
              made available to the members of this Parliament, who could then judge whether or not
              the incidence of cancer in ex-servicemen warrants the acceptance of cancer as a
              war caused disability or whether section 37 (3.) of the Repatriation Act should be
              amended to include provision that cancer be treated, in this respect, on the same
              basis as tuberculosis. However,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline>
                        suggest
              that while these matters are being decided future estimates for the Department of
              Health include financial provision for a "National Defence Against Cancer "
              campaign, which would embrace both ex-servicemen and other civilians. I advocated such
              a programme when speaking in this chamber on 17th March of this year, and again I ask
              the Government to consider introducing such legislation which, I suggest, could'
              provide benefits for the cancer sufferer similar to those now available to
              tuberculosis sufferers under the Tuberculosis Act.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Department of Health has issued a leaflet giving many facts about
              tuberculosis. When I have quoted from the leaflet honorable members will realize that
              many of these facts are the same as those which apply to cancer. The leaflet says -</para>
                    <para>Tuberculosis is a disease which has been knows for centuries. It is both
              preventable and curable, and is not inherited . . .</para>
                    <para class="block">That also applies to cancer. The leaflet continues - </para>
                    <para class="block">You can have tuberculosis, particularly in its early stages, without
              knowing, it. There are many people who are unaware that they have developed
              tuberculosis and that treatment is necessary . . .</para>
                    <para class="block">Again, that applies to cancer too. The leaflet continues - </para>
                    <para>Tuberculosis is more common in the middleaged and the elderly, but anyone can

              throughout life ... if your work involves substantial exposure to infection.</para>
                    <para>On that aspect of substantial exposure to infection, I quote from the speech that
              I made earlier this year on the subject of cancer. I said -</para>
                    <para>Environmental cancer is the newest and one of the most ominous of the end-products
              of our industrial environment. It could well be one of the main reasons for the
              ever-increasing rate of deaths from cancer. It should become one of the most urgent
              tasks of all medical men, labour and management leaders, public health officials and
              members of our parliaments to become familiar with the problems of environmental
              cancer. We must all work together to combat this type of cancer at its very source,
              which can be found, perhaps, in radioactive substances used in medicine, science and
              industry and even by the defence services. The source may be -found in the field of
              metallurgic research and development, or in the wide field of organic chemistry. Many
              new chemicals, without being pre-tested for cancerproducing properties, are now being
              commonly used in industry, for instance in the manufacture of insecticides and
              synthetic fertilizers.</para>
                    <para class="block">I went on to say - </para>
                    <para>Certain medicines, prepared foods and cosmetics, all designed for direct personal
              use and presenting possible cancer hazards, come under the heading, " Sources of

                        The national campaign against tuberculosis was a great step forward in our
              national health programme, but the time has come to take an even greater stride ahead
              and introduce,
                        <inline font-style="italic">on</inline>
                        the pattern of the Tuberculosis
              Act, legislation to assist people suffering from cancer. Now, surely, is the time to
              consider granting special allowances, subject to a reasonable means test, to all
              persons burdened with the disease of cancer.

                    <para>Half the deaths that have been caused by cancer could have been prevented by early
              diagnosis and early treatment. Early diagnosis is so vitally important in cancer,
              treatment that free cancer-detection examinations and medical checkups must be the
              basis of a national cancer campaign. Employers must be asked to co-operate by
              permitting staffs time off for these examinations. Examination centres must be
              established at easily accessible places.</para>

                <para class="block">I said later - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>When a positive diagnosis has been made, many domestic and financial problems
              follow, and :n particular there is the question of mental and physical ability to

              of charge, complete facilities for the examination, diagnosis and treatment of cancer
              in its many forms. The arguments in favour of such action are many; the main, and
              probably the only argument against it would be the economic argument.</para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Probably including the ability of the community to pay the cost. </para>
                <para>One other aspect of the matter to which 1 wish to refer, in relation to cancer in
            ex-servicemen, is that research had disclosed that certain vitamin deficiencies can
            cause lesions which sometimes are potentially precancerous. I suppose that ex-servicemen
            are the best examples we have of people who have been subjected to conditions which
            meant that they did not receive the full range of necessary vitamins. That would apply
            to men who were prisoners of war or who were operating under severe conditions on active
            service. If it can be shown that cancer may be attributable to vitamin deficiencies I
            think the Government should have a look at this aspect. The Minister knows my views on
            this subject. It is possible that as a result of the requests I have already made in
            regard to the matter some action is already under consideration, but I again ask the
            Minister and the Government to consider introducing legislation containing provisions
            similar to those in the Tuberculosis Act in order to give benefits to any person,
            ex-serviceman or otherwise, who is suffering from any kind of cancer.</para>

                        .- I desire to speak, first, to the estimates for the Department of Health and to
              voice some protest in connexion with an important building project that should have
              been undertaken years ago. I refer to the need for a new psychiatric ward at the
              repatriation hospital at Springbank in South Australia. Despite assurances from the
              Minister year after year nothing has been done about this matter. In 1956,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley</inline>
                        received an assurance from the
              Minister for Repatriation
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Walter
                Cooper)</inline>
                        that the Minister realized how inadequate the existing ward was,
              and that, in fact, specifications were being called for the construction of a new
              ward. But nothing happened. The year 1956 passed, and finally, about 1958, I joined
              with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley</inline>
                        in trying to further this
              matter. I raised the question in this House during the debate on the Estimates and
              pointed out the urgent need for this accommodation, because the existing ward was a
              temporary prefabricated war-time building in which 36 patients were crowded. The
              position was the same in regard to the dining room; and there was not adequate shower
              accommodation. I pointed out that as these people were suffering from war neurosis
              they were entitled, if any one was, to receive adequate hospitalization. On 17th June,
              1958,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline>
                        advised me that he had noted
              my remarks and was looking into the position.
                    </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>
                    In July, as I had received no word from him, I sent him a telegram, and in August
            1958 he advised me by letter that he was fully aware of the position in relation to
            th'e treatment of psychiatric patients at Springbank and agreed that the present
            treatment block, which was a war-time block, was below the general standard of the
            institution. He said he was mindful of the need for the new block and that that project
            was accorded high priority by his department. He gave me an assurance that immediately
            the construction of this ward at Springbank could be financed out of the allocation for
            the Department of Works, construction work would commence. In 1959, I raised the matter
            again, pointing out that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley</inline>
                    had
            previously had assurances from
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline>
                    and
            that we had received assurances but nothing else. In September, 1959, after the debate
            on the Estimates, when there was great disappointment because it was generally thought
            that approval would be granted and that funds for this work would be included in the
            Estimates, the Minister said to me that he had delayed advising me, pending
            clarification of the position, because he had thought funds for the work would be
            included in the allocation for that year. He said -

              project in the 1960-61 Works Programme for my Department. As this work now becomes the
              No. 1 priority I feel I have every reason to be confident that it will be included in
              the programme next year. I am fully aware of the necessity of the work at Springbank
              and will make every endeavour to see that it is undertaken early in the coming
              financial year.</para>

                    Well, the Estimates have come out again, but with other honorable

              Speaker,</inline>
                    I look everywhere, but once again, despite the assurance given by
            the Minister and despite the fact that in 1956 he said the Estimates would provide for
            the work and that tenders would be called, in this year's Estimates there is no
            provision for the erection of this most urgently needed block.
                </para>
                <para>
                    I have taken the trouble to examine the Estimates in order to see what has happened
            and what was included last year. I have looked at the Hobart project, for which
            provision was made for the expenditure of £276,000 and I find that only
            £12,000 of that sum has been spent in the last twelve months. If the work continues
            at that rate of spending - £12,000 a year - I do not suppose we will ever reach the
            stage of including the work at Springbank in the Estimates. I notice also that in. the
            Estimates this year there is a provision of £76,000 for the Callan Park Mental
            Hospital. I do not object to that; but if we look at last year's Estimates we find
            the same provision of £76,000, but dressed up a little differently. The provision
            was there and the money was allocated, but not a penny piece of it was spent getting on
            with the job. So, we find that year after year money is being allocated but is not being
            expended on what are considered to be most urgently needed buildings for the
            hospitalization of ex-service men and women. I have come to the conclusion that the
            Minister for Repatriation is just being pushed about by the Treasurer
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt).</inline>
                    1 cannot help feeling that that is the
            case because if, since 1956, the Minister for Repatriation had been sincere in his
            statement that this ward is urgently needed at Springbank Repatriation Hospital to give
            these unfortunate ex-servicemen, sufferers from neurosis, the benefit of this new ward
            so as to help with their treatment and help the doctors, we should not still be pleading
            this year for the work to be commenced.
                </para>
                <para>Year after year the Minister has given an assurance that he realizes the urgency of
            the work; but nothing is done about it. Either he is a very weak Minister - a nice
            gentleman in many ways, but completely weak in enforcing his opinion - or the Treasurer
            completely stands over him. 1 am not convinced that the money which this Government is
            spending throughout the length and breadth of this nation on various projects is more
            urgently needed or more important than the provision of adequate hospitalization for
            these unfortunate people. Admittedly, they receive the best medical attention; the
            doctors and nurses are first class and go to great pains to see that these unfortunate
            patients are well looked after. The rest of the hospital is in first-class condition,
            but this one ward is a blot on the record of repatriation hospitals in South Australia;
            but this Government pushes this necessary work aside. It says to these patients, who
            have waited there for years for something better, that it realizes the urgency of this
            work; but that is all it does about it. Last year great disappointment was expressed at
            that hospital by all those associated with it when nothing was done to remedy the
            position. I must agree that the departmental officers dressed it up and made it
            presentable. They made it look quite decent, but only because they really believed they
            had reached the end of the road and that this year's Estimates would provide for
            this work. But this year's Estimates have come down and there is no provision
            whatever for this work.</para>
                <para>If the Treasurer is responsible for this position, he should go out to Dawes-road,
            when he is in South Australia, and look at this ward and talk to the patients. He should
            go there at 5 o'clock one wintry morning when these people have to walk under a
            canopy to the shower block to get insulin treatment. When he inspects those buildings
            perhaps he will realize the need for this work to be done and have somesympathy with
            those people who are being treated at that hospital, because in this country's hour
            of need they were prepared to serve it. Yet the best the Minister and the Government can
            say to them, year after year since 1956, is, "We know you need it. We know the ward
            is obsolete and it should have been rebuilt, but there is not enough money to get on
            with the job." As I said, of the money voted last year for the various building
            projects 1 mentioned, not one penny piece has been spent, and no work has3 been
            commenced on those jobs.</para>
                <para>In the short time at my disposal 1 would like to refer to another matter which
            concerns the Department of Health. It relates to what is claimed to be an anomaly in the
            National Health Service in respect of which the Australian Oplometrical Association
            claims the act should be amended.</para>
                <para>I believe that the act should be amended to provide for the payment not only by
            various societies but also by the Government of benefits for the provision of
            spectacles. The association makes some specific claims. It alleges that government money
            is being used illegally in the payment of benefits for examination by doctors who
            perhaps suggest that a patient use some lotion for eye trouble when the position really
            is that the doctor is examining the patient in order to prescribe spectacles. That is a
            serious claim. The association, in a circular issued to-day, which no doubt the Minister
            has received, alleges that the Minister has dodged replying to the allegation and has
            asked that he be specific and that the Government investigate its claim.</para>
                <para>The Medical Benefits Fund of Australia offers some rebates for these examinations.
            The position is that some organizations provide for the payment of benefits and others
            do not. I would like the Minister to say whether he would give the necessary permission
            if all organizations asked to be allowed to change their rules so that this benefit
            could be provided. Would he also be willing to allow the organizations to amend their
            rules to provide that the benefit be paid when optometrists decide that glasses are
            needed. The claim is that members of the medical profession are receiving preferential
            treatment because of their financial interest, in some States, in the business houses
            that provide spectacles. It is alleged that there is almost a racket by doctors who
            issue prescriptions to be taken to one particular place of which the doctors, through
            their shareholding, are the owners.</para>
                <para>These are serious allegations. One way that this matter can be cleared up is for the
            Government to provide, in an amendment to the act, for the recognition of optometrists
            in the same way that members of the medical profession are recognized. Each year, more
            and more people need glasses and it is time that provision was made for the payment of a
            benefit by the Government as well as by various organizations. I ask the Minister to
            examine carefully the case that has been presented to him by the Australian Optometrical
            Association and to give an answer, if he can, to the claim made in the circular issued
            by the association that funds are being illegally paid as government rebates.</para>

                        .- I was shocked by the remarks of the honorable member for Kingston
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Galvin)</inline>
                        regarding the Minister for Repatriation
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Walter Cooper).</inline>
                        I think it is quite
              definite that the Minister has the confidence not only of honorable members in this
              chamber but also of all ex-servicemen. ] believe, too, that every one knows that
              the Minister is a very keen, capable and honorable Minister. I do not propose to
              indulge in a diatribe; I propose to make some suggestions regarding certain aspects of
              social services.
                    </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We know that social services could be improved in many ways, but we also know that
            all the ways in which they could be improved would cost money. The suggestions that I
            propose to make will not cost a great deal of money. I recognize that social services
            alone cost the Government well over £300,000,000 a year, but my suggestions will
            not cost very much extra. However, I claim that they will render justice to two classes
            of pensioners. The group that I wish to mention consists of widows. We know that there
            are several classes of widows, and I commend the Government for deleting this year the
            class D widows and making other provision for them. Class D comprised women whose
            husbands had been imprisoned for at least six months, if they had a child under sixteen
            years of age in their care or if they were at least 50 years of age. By deleting that
            class, the Government has done away with the stigma that always attached particularly to
            the children of men who were in prison for a period of at least six months. I commend
            the Government for giving consideration to this class of widow.</para>
                <para>In dealing specifically with the classes that are now established - classes A, B and
            C - we must consider mainly class A, which comprises widows with one or more children
            under sixteen years of age in their care. At present, the pension for this class is
            £5 5s. for a widow with one child, and if she had1 a second child, she would
            receive another 10s. a week. Then, of course, she would receive 15s. a week child
            endowment for the two children and if she were paying rent for a home and had no means
            of any size, she would receive 10s. a week supplementary assistance. This makes a total
            of £7 a week. In various States, allowances are made by the State government.
            Assuming that the widow received £1 a week extra as a State allowance, she would
            receive a total of £8 a week with which to look after herself and her two young
            children. My submission is that no widow with two children, of pre-school age
            particularly, could1 manage on that sum. If the children are very young, she should stay
            at home and look after them. Very few widows are in a position where they can get some
            one else to look after their children unless, of course, they are very fortunate.
            Usually it is difficult to get some one to look after their young children while they go
            out to work. If they go out to work, they are permitted to earn £3 10s. a. week
            plus 10s. a week for each child under sixteen years. If they earn more than that, their
            pension is affected. So, even if they go to work and so subject their young children to
            various difficulties, they still cannot make very much money. I suppose that one of the
            causes contributing to child delinquency to-d'ay is that the widowed mothers of
            schoolchildren have to go out to work.</para>

                        <para>- No, but in the cases I am discussing, it is the widowed mothers particularly
                who place their children at a disadvantage, and they do so necessarily because they
                go out to work. Their children come home from school in the afternoon and generally
                there is no one in the house to receive them. That is not good for the children df
                our nation, our future citizens. They should not have to roam around the streets
                while their mothers are working, and necessarily so. My suggestion is that we should
                have a fresh look at the rates paid1 particularly to widows with children. We must
                realize that, quite apart from the fact that the amount of money she receives is
                insufficient, the widow is in an unfortunate position because she has not the
                comfort, support and assistance that can be afforded by a husband. When considering
                the plight of these unfortunate women, we should have regard to the fact that at the
                end of June of this year the average wage being received by male employees in
                Australia was £22 12s., while a widow with two young children gets only £7
                a week, apart from any assistance she may receive from State governments. If these
                allowances were increased it would not cost very much, and certainly not nearly as
                much as would be involved in a general increase of pension rates.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>I wish also to direct attention to the allowance paid to the wife of an invalid
            pensioner. We are told that an allowance not exceeding £1 15s. a week may be
            granted to the wife of an invalid pensioner if she is living with her husband and is not
            receiving an invalid or age pension, or a service pension under the Repatriation Act.
            The rate of the allowance is affected by income and property on the same basis as an age
            or invalid pension. We are told also that this allowance is payable on the same
            conditions to the wife of an age pensioner who is permanently incapacitated for work or
            permanently blind. It amounts to this; If an invalid pensioner has to be cared for by
            his wife, the only money that is available to keep both of them is £6 15s. a week,
            and I submit that it is not nearly enough. The amount involved in granting an increase
            of the wife's allowance would not be great, and I suggest that the Government should
            seriously consider a substantial increase. I shall refer also to the allowance for
            children. An invalid pensioner may have a number of children, and his wife would then
            have to look after him and them. In such a case an amount of lis. 6d. is allowed for the
            first or only child under sixteen. I repeat that the amount of money available for a
            family in those circumstances is by no means sufficient.</para>
                <para>Similar remarks apply in the case of an age pensioner with a wife who is not old
            enough to receive an age pension herself. If such a pensioner is permanently
            incapacitated, his wife has to look after him. and she cannot find a job to earn extra
            money. In any case it is by no means easy for a woman aged about 55 to find work, but
            even if a job is available it cannot be accepted by a woman whose husband is an age
            pensioner and is permanently incapacitated.</para>
                <para>In short, I suggest that increases in these allowances should be seriously
            considered by this Government, which has shown itself in the past to be sympathetic to
            the needs of minorities. I believe we must help the little people. The big man can
            always look after himself, but in many cases the little people cannot do so. I have
            mentioned the circumstances of two kinds of people who are not sufficiently well
            provided for, and I ask the Government to give careful consideration to my submissions.</para>

                        op the humanitarian sentiments he has
              expressed. He has repeated to-day what I have been putting in this chamber for a long
              time. I have said frequently that until the Government realizes that it must grant
              substantially more than £1 15s. a week to the wife of an invalid pensioner my
              voice will continue to be raised on behalf of these unfortunate people. I am glad that
              the honorable member for Wide Bay has brought this matter up. As he has said, it would
              not cost very much to grant a substantial increase.

                </talk.start>
                <para>The honorable member referred to the new provisions regarding women whose husbands
            have been in gaol for at least six months, and who may obtain a pension at the same rate
            as that of une A class widow. He also referred to the allowance of lis. 6d. a week for
            the first child of an invalid pensioner, and he mentioned another matter which I have
            always considered anomalous. The honorable member said that although an allowance of
            Ils. 6d. is made for the first child of an invalid pensioner, the A class widow, who
            also receives a pension of £5 a week, gets only 5s. a week for the first child. I
            believe the Government should endeavour to do something more for the A class widow, by
            increasing the allowance for the first child to lis. 6d., as in the case df the children
            of invalid or age pensioners who are incapacitated.</para>

                    Before proceeding to deal with these individual pension matters, I wish to make a
            few remarks about pharmaceutical benefits. I believe that we should be progressive, and
            should try to increase, from year to year, the extent of our assistance to those who
            really need it. &gt; Looking at statement No. 5, concerning National Welfare Fund
            Estimates, which was one of the papers presented by the Treasurer
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline>
                    with his Budget speech, I find that
            although expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits test year amounted to £20,761,448,
            the estimate for this financial year is £18,644,000. This is £2,117,448 less
            than last year's expenditure. The Government's attitude to this matter is far
            from progressive.

                        <para>- I have given the figures that were presented to us by the Treasurer. I admit
                that the estimate for pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners, £7,680,000, is
                £4,105,776 more than the actual expenditure in 1959-60. I know that the cost of
                pharmaceutical benefits to pensioners will be practically doubled even without an
                increase in the number of pensioners who receive the benefits; but apparently the
                Government proposes to spend less on pharmaceutical benefits generally, and the
                people will have to bear a heavier burden.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>We were told that the charge of 5s. for a prescription would help to balance the
            cost of quite a number of expensive drugs because the people would have to pay tor drugs
            which previously were free. On the other hand, the list of drugs for which only 5s. was
            payable was to be extended to include many more life-saving drugs. The charge of 5s. for
            a prescription came into effect in the middle of the financial year and did not apply to
            a full year; yet we find that more than £2,000,000 less is to be devoted to
            pharmaceutical benefits for the general public compared with the expenditure for this
            purpose last year.</para>
                <para>There is another phase of this branch ot social services which will cost both the
            Government and persons concerned quite a lot more this year. 1 refer to the quantity of
            drugs prescribed for 5s. Perhaps the Minister for Health will correct me if 1 am wrong,
            but many persons have complained to me that they do not obtain sufficient drugs with one
            prescription. They have to go back to a doctor to get a repeat prescription sooner than
            they would if the prescription provided for a larger supply of the prescribed drugs. The
            cost of medical services is higher as a result, both to the Government and to the
            patient. I know that in the past there has often been a waste of medicine. Frequently,
            the patient did not take all the medicine that was prescribed and the rest was thrown
            clown the sink. I know also that there must be some control over the quantity that is
            prescribed; but the general impression is that the quantity that is given in one
            prescription has been reduced too much, and that the patient has to return to his doctor
            too soon to get a further supply. T hope that the Minister will give consideration to
            that matter.</para>
                <para>Recently I was travelling with a medical man from my own State. I do not know him
            personally, but I believe that he is a responsible person. I asked him to tell me
            candidly whether he considered the list of drugs that could be prescribed for 5s. was
            adequate. He said that definitely he did not believe there were sufficient drugs on the
            list. I expect that the Minister for Health will reply that an expert committee of
            highly qualified men decides what drugs shall be put on the list; but that is the
            response I received from a man who was honestly expressing his opinion.</para>
                <para>I know that the Minister for Health is trying to do what he believes to be best and
            right not only for the recipients of benefits but also for the taxpayers generally. As
            the honorable member for Wide Bay has said, anything we provide costs money, and the
            money must come from somewhere. I agree; but we must take a broader view of the health
            of the people. Immigrants complain bitterly about the difference between the medical
            benefits they obtain here and those that were made available to them in the United
            Kingdom. I admit that the people in England have to pay for the cost of those services,
            but in Australia we also make a definite contribution towards health and medical
            services through income tax and social service contributions. I want to emphasize that I
            am not making any wild charges concerning our health services. I know that many benefits
            are provided; but as you go along, you find weaknesses in the system which should be
            corrected. Therefore, I direct the attention of the Minister to the two matters to which
            I have referred - the quantity of drugs prescribed by a doctor with one prescription,
            and the number of drugs which are excluded from the list. I do not suggest that every
            new drug that comes on the market should be included in the list of drugs that can be
            obtained on a 5s. prescription, but I hope the Minister will consider those matters.</para>
                <para>I think we should consider just how far we can go with social service benefits. I
            have been gratified by the Government's decision to combine properly and income in a
            merged means test. I have advocated that for a long time, but I did not expect to have
            it introduced so soon. The Government, has taken a big step, and its decision will give
            great satisfaction to the people. However, we should consider how we can further help
            the family man. Many people think that the means test should be wiped out. Others
            suggest that it should be abolished progressively. One suggestion is that any person on
            reaching the age of 75 years should be entitled to a pension without the application of
            a means test. The honorable member for Wide Bay spoke about things which he did not
            think would cost very much. I was of that opinion also about this proposition, but the
            Department of Social Services has estimated that such an innovation would cost more than
            £30,000,000 a year in round figures. Another suggestion is that the means test
            should not be applied to persons at 70 years of age, but that would cost more than
            £120,000,000 a year, lt is obvious, therefore, that we must consider fully just
            what is best.</para>
                <para>Some honorable members have advocated a compulsory contribution scheme. I have
            examined that proposal and have found that it is distasteful to me. I believe that
            social service benefits should be a charge on the community on the basis of ability to
            meet the cost. Many years ago, we had a flat rate of income tax. I used to argue that it
            was not fair. When Labour first advocated this many years ago we were in grave trouble
            with our opponents, but the benefits of the scheme came to be recognized gradually,
            first in the States and then in the Federal sphere. We pay our income tax to keep the
            country going and to meet the country's growing needs according to our ability to
            pay, which is gauged by our income.</para>

                    <para>.- As this is Mental Health Week in Victoria, I think it is appropriate that I
              should direct some of my remarks to the subject of mental health and to some of the
              problems facing the State governments which are doing their best to cope with them.
              Last week I obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician the latest figures available
              in relation to mental hospitals. An analysis of the figures indicates that at present
              there are approximately 35,000 persons in mental hospitals in Australia and that
              slightly more than one-half of this number are under the age of 50 years. This
              represents to me a very tragic state of affairs.</para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It was of interest to learn also that those States with the highest population, and
            therefore the most densely populated capital cities, have the highest percentage of
            citizens in mental hospitals. The incidence of mental illness is identical with the
            pattern of State population. On the basis of 1,000 of the population, the number of
            persons in mental hospitals is 3.79 in New South Wales, 3.4 in Victoria, 3.33 in
            Queensland, 2.97 in South Australia, 2.63 in Western Australia and 2.3 in Tasmania. The
            Australian average is 3.39 per 1,000 of which 3.33 per 1,000 are males and 3.45 per
            1,000 are females.</para>
                <para>While on this subject, I should like to refer to the suggestion which has been made
            frequently by members on both sides of the House that at least part of the age pension
            be paid to persons resident, in mental hospitals. This matter has been raised many times
            over the years and I think that most honorable members are familiar with the reasons
            which have been given for not implementing the suggestion.</para>
                <para>
                    At this stage I compliment the Minister for Health
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr.
              Donald Cameron)</inline>
                    on the magnificent job which he has done since he has been in
            office. He is always doing what he can to introduce additional medical benefits and,
            since he has held this portfolio, expenditure on health has risen from a little over
            £43,500,000 in 1956-57 to nearly £77,000,000 for the
                    <inline font-style="italic">current</inline>
                    year. But in the matter of mental health, the
            cost of which is borne largely by the States, I should like to make some suggestions.
                </para>
                <para>In the first place, I refer to the States Grants (Mental Institutions) Act 1955,
            under which the Commonwealth provided £10,000,000 on a £1 for £2 basis
            with the States for capital works. This amount was allocated on a population basis. New
            South Wales was allocated £3,830,000; Victoria £2,740,000; Queensland
            £1,460,000; South Australia £895,000; Western Australia £720,000 and
            Tasmania £355,000. I understand that already Victoria has spent all of the money
            that was allocated to it. At the end of June this year it had works in progress to the
            value of £1,358,000, and had new work amounting to £2,498,000 planned to
            commence during this year, making a total of £3,856,000 worth of works either in
            progress or planned to commence. In addition, Victoria expects to spend nearly
            £2,000,000 on these projects during this financial year.</para>
                <para>Even though rapid strides have been made in the treatment of mental illness, and
            people are seeking treatment in earlier stages than previously was the case, it is
            estimated that if the present rate of population increase is maintained an additional
            1,000 beds will be required in Victoria every four years, apart altogether from
            outpatients clinics, early treatment hospitals and so on. Having visited several of the
            institutions in Victoria about which I am speaking, I know what a wonderful job that
            State is doing in the field of mental hygiene, and I plead for an additional allocation
            for capital works there. According to my latest information, with the exception of
            Tasmania and South Australia, none of the' other States has spent anything like
            one-half of the amounts which were allocated to them five years ago. I believe that any
            State which is trying to make a real impact on this serious problem deserves special
            help.</para>
                <para>Returning to the question of paying some portion of the age pension to those persons
            in mental hospitals who, but for being in a mental hospital, would be receiving the age
            pension, I point out that if they were in benevolent homes or ordinary hospitals
            normally they would receive the pension. The chairman of the Victorian Mental Hygiene
            Authority has stated that the payment of even a few shillings a week would be of great
            psychological benefit to the inmates of mental hospitals. I know, from inquiries which I
            have made in the past, that the cost of providing a pension or even a part pension has
            been calculated on the basis of the total number of persons in mental hos.pitals, but
            the .figures which were provided for me last week by the Commonwealth Statistician
            indicate that of the 35,000 persons at present in mental hospitals in Australia only
            7,854 are over the age of 65 years. There are also 2,886 persons between the ages of 60
            and 65 years. As women are eligible to receive the age pension when they reach 60, we
            can assume that approximately 9,297 of the persons at present in mental hospitals would
            qualify by age for the age pension.</para>
                <para>The Director-General of Social Services states in his latest report that
            approximately 50 per cent, of persons of pensionable age are at present receiving either
            full or part pensions. Presumably, the other 50' per cent, are disqualified by the
            operation of the means test. I think it is a fair assumption that approximately the same
            percentage of persons of eligible age at present in mental hospitals would be
            disqualified from receiving the pension by the operation of the means test. If this is
            so, there would be about 4,650 persons in these hospitals who would qualify for an age
            pension. To pay all of them 10s. a week would cost only a little over £120,000 a
            year. This is not much out of a total Budget of over £1,616,000,000, and a small
            amount when compared with this year's allocation of over £330,000,000 for
            health and social services. I have related this suggestion only to the age pension, but
            if it were proposed to make some payment to those inmates who- qualify for the invalid
            pension, I am sure that the number affected would not be great.</para>
                <para>
                    In speaking on the estimates for the Department of Health last year I pointed out
            that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cunningham</inline>
                    Dax, the chairman of the
            Victorian Mental Hygiene Authority, had stated that approximately 20 per cent, of all
            admissions to- mental hospitals could be attributed, at least in part, to alcoholism. In
            1952,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ian</inline>
                    Mackay, of the Walter and Eliza Hall
            Institute of Medical Research, in a survey of alcoholism, stated that at that time there
            were approximately 120,000 victims of alcoholism in Australia and that the cost of
            alcoholism to the community, excluding the cost to industry, was in the vicinity of
            £70,000,000 a year. The Victorian Alcoholism Foundation estimates that at present
            there are nearly 175,000 alcoholics in Australia. The president of the foundation,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Leonard</inline>
                    Ball, stated only last week that
            alcoholism was costing Victorian industries £10,000,000 a year. Both organizations
            to which I have referred are of the opinion that 3 per cent, of all persons in Australia
            over the age of twenty years are alcoholics. Last week, the Victorian foundation
            announced a five-point plan to combat alcoholism. One point is the establishment of a
            " half-way house " or a rehabilitation hostel for alcoholic convalescents in the
            stage between hospital and ordinary life. If such a place were established it would take
            some of the pressure from mental hospitals. This would be a good opportunity for the
            Commonwealth Government to provide capital aid on a basis similar to that provided for
            in the States Grants (Mental Institutions) Act 1955.
                </para>
                <para>Last year, I stated that if Id. a gallon of the excise on beer, which was estimated
            then to provide £106,500,000 in revenue but actually produced nearly
            £110,000,000, were set aside for research into alcoholism it would provide a fund
            of nearly £1,000,000. This year's estimated revenue from excise on beer is
            £112,000,000, and that from excise on spirits £9,000,000. Does this not
            provide an excellent opportunity for making some portion of this huge sum available for
            research into a disease which is costing Australia in the vicinity of £100,000,000
            a year?</para>
                <para>In the short time I have left to me, I should like to turn to the estimates for
            social services and refer briefly to- one particular section of the reciprocal agreement
            with the United Kingdom which I believe operates unfairly to a small section of the
            community. I know that those who administer the agreement abide by the letter of the
            law, but I believe that the effects are not in accordance with the spirit of that
            agreement. I refer to those clauses relating to the eligibility for a pension of persons
            who became blind before coming to Australia. Under the act a person who became blind
            outside Australia, but who has resided in Australia for not less than twenty years, is
            eligible to receive the invalid' pension.</para>
                <para>Under the terms of the reciprocal agreement with the United Kingdom, residence in
            the United Kingdom is counted as residence in Australia, so that persons who became
            blind in the United Kingdom, but who have resided in either the United Kingdom or
            Australia for a total period of twenty years, may receive a pension. As there is no
            blind pension in the United Kingdom, blind persons there receive what is known as an
            indefinite sickness benefit, amounting to 50s. sterling, or £3 2s. 6d. a week in
            Australian currency.</para>
                <para>The aspect of this reciprocal agreement which I cannot understand is that, while the
            Australian Government makes up the difference between the United Kingdom and the
            Australian rate to age pensioners, those persons whose need, in my opinion, is greater,
            other things being equal - persons blinded in the United Kingdom and1 who migrate to
            Australia - are paid at the United Kingdom rate, not the Australian rate. Admittedly,
            persons who were blinded in Australia and who migrated to the United Kingdom are paid at
            the same rate, even though the Australian rate is higher, but at least they are on the
            same footing as other blinded persons in the United Kingdom. My point is that persons
            who are blinded in the United Kingdom, and who migrate to Australia, will now be £1
            7s. 6d. a week worse off than their Australian brethren.</para>
                <para>As there would probably be fewer than a score of persons affected, I suggest that
            the Minister should have another look at this aspect of the agreement with a view to
            including in next year's Estimates a sum sufficient to bring within the spirit as
            well as the letter of the reciprocal agreement those unfortunate persons who have been
            deprived of their sight.</para>

                        .- I should like to refer to the estimates for the Department of Health. Already
              some mention has been made of optometrical services, and to the fact that, by and
              large, they are not covered by what is, in effect, our national health scheme. I hope
              that the Minister will take some notice of what has been said. I raised this matter by
              way of a question last week when I reminded the Minister that, while people who are
              referred to an ophthalmologist by a medical practitioner receive payments from
              hospital and medical benefit funds, those who are referred by an optometrist receive
              no such benefits. This seems to me to be an anomaly, and, as the honorable member for
              Kingston
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Galvin)</inline>
                        pointed out to-day, some
              very serious allegations were made in a circular issued by the Australian Optometrical
              Association.
                    </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It is wrong that optometrical services should not be covered by the national health
            scheme. For the life of me, I cannot see why a scheme which pretends to be a national
            health scheme should not have at least as one of its criteria the fact that it is
            comprehensive. I am sure that nobody discriminates between a disability of the eye and
            other disabilities of the body. Nor do I think that disabilities of the mouth requiring
            dental attention should be excluded from a national health scheme.</para>
                <para>The main plea put forward in support of the inclusion of optometrical services in
            the scheme is that about one-third of the Australian people require the services of
            optometrists or ophthalmologists at some time or other during their lives. According to
            a survey which has been made, 70 per cent, of the people who do require such services go
            initially to an optometrist. Apparently what is happening at the moment is that the
            people who consult an optometrist find that they might need treatment other than that
            provided by the optometrist. He refers them to an ophthalmologist, who is a doctor
            specializing in ophthalmology. The ophthalmologist then asks whether the patient belongs
            to any medical benefit fund. If the patient is a subscriber, the ophthalmologist advises
            him to go to a general practitioner and request that he be referred back to the
            ophthalmologist so that he may receive payment of benefit from the fund to which he
            contributes.</para>
                <para>It even goes beyond that. A serious allegation that has been made here is that
            sometimes people who receive spectacles from the ophthalmologist have been paid
            Commonwealth benefits when, in fact, they should not have received them. The reference
            by the medical practitioner is simply a statement on his account that the patient has
            been referred for treatment. Sometimes the patient does receive treatment in addition to
            a prescription for spectacles. Sometimes he is given a little ointment merely to make
            his claim legitimate under the National Health Regulations. According to the allegation,
            such patients are illegally receiving Commonwealth benefit at the same time as they are
            enjoying payment from a medical benefit organization. That is a serious accusation, and
            I hope the Minister will have something to say about it.</para>
                <para>A further important point is that the optometrists believe that this practice is a
            deliberate method of diverting people into the hands of doctors as against optometrists.
            They say that it is unfair discrimination against optometrists and ophthalmologists in
            favour of the general practitioner. I know something about this matter because I had
            some association with Professor Lederer of the Sydney University, who is now training
            optometrists in New South Wales. All optometrists registered now must first obtain the
            degree of Bachelor of Science, yet they are being discriminated against in favour of the
            general practitioner. The position now is that if a general practitioner refers a
            patient to an ophthalmologist the patient may claim benefits from a medical benefit
            organization whereas, if he is referred by an optometrist, his claim is rejected. The
            status of optometrists is involved here, and they are becoming concerned about it.</para>
                <para>The third point is that often patients who consult an ophthalmologist are
            channelled, as it is called, to various associated bodies that make the spectacles. They
            are sent to associations that are linked in some way or other with the ophthalmologists.
            I know that certain people have been asked by ophthalmologists if they have any special
            man in mind for the supply of the spectacles, and when they have said that they have
            not, they have been given a card and advised to go to one or other of the associated
            spectacle manufacturers. I can only describe this practice as a racket under which many
            optometrists, who must be registered, and who provide a high standard of service in the
            community, are being discriminated against. Again, those 70 per cent, of the people who
            consult optometrists are being unjustly discriminated against; first, because
            optometrical services are not covered by Commonwealth fund benefits, and, secondly,
            because they are not covered by the private medical benefit organizations. There is no
            point in the Minister for Health telling me, as he did last week, that the Commonwealth
            does not control what is done, that some of the funds pay benefits in respect of
            optometrists and ophthalmologists and some only in respect of ophthalmologists, and that
            that is a matter for the funds themselves.</para>
                <para>I think that there is an obligation on this National Parliament to ensure that a
            just service is provided for the community. We have heard much insistence that the
            patient shall be free to choose the practitioner whom he wants to treat him. The sort of
            thing that I have described indicates that he is not being given a free choice. In fact,
            the provisions of the National Health Act and the arrangements of the benefit
            organizations are being used to channel people into the hands of private medical
            practitioners and ophthalmologists and away from optometrists. In New South Wales and, I
            understand, in all States, optometrists have to have the qualification of a diploma to
            enable them to specialize in optometry. But they are apparently being relegated to a
            position inferior to that of a general practitioner who, I understand, does not have
            anything like as much specialist training in optometry as an optometrist has. I hope the
            Minister will have a look at the matter, and I expect to hear some comments about it
            from him. I think that the services of optometrists ought to be covered under the
            national health scheme, as they are in Great Britain.</para>
                <para>Associated with this deficiency, as I call it, in the National Health Act in
            relation to treatment by optometrists is the lack of provision for benefits in respect
            of dental treatment. There can be no question whatsoever about the professional status
            of a dentist. His services are vital. Indeed, dental care is important not just to one
            part of the body which seems to be discriminated against in the operation of the
            national health scheme. Everybody knows that bad teeth resulting from insufficient care
            of the mouth can have very wide ramifications with respect to general health. It seems
            that while the disability is localized in the mouth no benefit to help meet the cost of
            treatment can be obtained, but once the disability has had far-reaching effects which
            are detrimental to the rest of the body, apparently the national health scheme provides
            benefits in respect of treatment in order to cure a condition that doubtless could have
            been prevented in the first instance by proper dental treatment - treatment which should
            be covered by this scheme.</para>
                <para>This absence of provision for dental care not only adversely affects the community
            generally, and especially children, but also limits the supply of dentists. I am told by
            some friends of mine who are dentists that the number of dentists graduating from the
            universities in proportion to the population is declining. In 1959, if I remember
            correctly, only 41 dentists graduated from the University of Sydney. I understand that
            something like 240 or 250 should have graduated if anything like adequate dental
            treatment is to be provided for the people. Without having yet had a chance to look at
            the statistics. I am rather inclined to agree with my friends. I have three little boys
            of my own, and I know how difficult it is to get an appointment with a dentist in a
            Sydney suburb. It is very difficult indeed. I know many dentists in my own district, and
            I know that the dentists there generally work exceptionally long hours. I do not think
            that they are making a fortune out of dentistry. Overhead costs and the costs of
            materials have risen very greatly in recent years.</para>
                <para>I am informed that the community would be surprised to know how many of our
            dentists, soon after graduation, go to the United Kingdom, where the national health
            scheme assures dentists of decent working conditions and a reasonable return for their
            effort. Some dentists with whom I am acquainted have gone there. In the first instance,
            their only intention was to obtain a little more experience, but when they arrived and
            found the coverage provided by the British national health scheme and the better
            conditions under which dentists worked, they stayed on. As a result of these influences,
            the. supply of dentists in Australia is becoming smaller in proportion to the
            population, with great detriment not only to the dental fraternity but to the community
            as a whole.</para>

                in view of the training and work that he undertakes. I certainly would not begrudge
                it, realizing as I do the ultimate cost to the community as a result of a lack of
                proper dental care, with the consequent expense not ' only of dental treatment
                but also of hospital treatment and other medical services.</para>

                </continue>
                <para>I want to deal also with the pensioner medical service. We have heard much talk
            about the Government's laudable action in easing the means test on pensions. I think
            it is a great shame indeed that the means test in respect of the pensioner medical
            service was not eased also. In 1955, this Government introduced a means test in respect
            of that service. Under that means test, single pensioners who earn £2 a week or
            more, and pensioner couples with an income of £4 a week or more, are deprived of
            the benefits of the pensioner medical service. That was bad enough in 1955, but it is
            far worse to maintain those same limits five years afterwards when the value of money
            has fallen somewhat. That means test is even more discriminatory now than it was five
            years ago. It is penalizing a lot of people who in the evening of their lives
            unfortunately incur hospital and medical expenses greater than are those likely to be
            incurred by the ordinary people in the community.</para>
                <para>Another aspect of this problem has come to my notice only in the last few weeks. I
            refer to some of the farcical provisions in respect of the pensioner medical service and
            the way in which they can be evaded. A single pensioner may not obtain benefits under
            the pensioner medical service if at the time of application for the pension he earns
            £2 or more a week. But apparently this does not preclude people who intend to apply
            for admission to this scheme from ceasing work for a while so that their income no
            longer is £2 a week or more, obtaining the pension and being accepted for benefit
            under the pensioner medical service, and then returning to work and earning more than
            £2 a week. So long as they do not lose the pension altogether, they retain their
            right to benefits under the pensioner medical service. Likewise, a person who has money
            in a savings bank account, for example, or invested in shares or something else, may
            withdraw his money from the bank or realize his investments and reduce his income below
            £2 a week - as I have already indicated the limit is £4 a week for a pensioner
            couple - putting the money in a current account or keeping the cash at home. All he
            .needs to do is arbitrarily to reduce his income below £2 a week, obtain the
            pension and have his right to benefits under the pensioner medical service admitted, and
            then he can re-invest the money and continue to receive benefit under the pensioner
            medical service. This happens simply because the right to benefits, once admitted, is
            not taken away unless the pension is forfeited altogether.</para>
                <para>The provisions of the National Health Act in respect of the pensioner medical
            service were amended - I think last year - to provide that pensioners who could not gain
            admission to public hospitals and who had to have medical treatment in private hospitals
            which were not approved institutions under the provisions of the act could receive the
            equivalent-</para>

                        I should not have
              taken part in the discussion of these Estimates had it not been for certain statements
              made by the honorable member for Barton

                Reynolds),</inline>
                        who preceded me. He dealt first with the application of the
              national health scheme to optometrists. I have received a reply from the Minister for
              Health
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron)</inline>
                        to a question on this
              matter. Before I proceed I want to pay tribute to him for his very sympathetic and
              capable administration of the portfolio which he holds. Every one who has been or is a
              Minister knows perfectly well that if treasury funds were unlimited he could be even
              more sympathetic. Unfortunately, the resources of treasuries are not unlimited, and
              therefore a Minister must balance what he would really like to do against what
              treasury limitations will permit him to do. I am quite certain that within those
              limitations the present Minister has done and is doing a remarkably good job.
                    </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I now proceed with what I have to say about optometrists. In the first place, I am
            not unaware of the development of the optometrical profession in New South Wales. I was
            Minister for Education in that State when the question was raised of the status of
            optometrists who are also known elsewhere by other designations. Some people sought to
            raise the standard of the work done by optometrists. We launched a very excellent course
            at the Sydney Technical College on the diploma level which is the equivalent of the
            level of study undertaken by other professions at the university. I know perfectly well
            that there was a very distinct hostility to that move. In time, the course which I
            established as Minister has increased its standard. Although I am not fully in touch
            with it to-day, I believe that it has close affiliations with the University of New
            South Wales.</para>
                <para>There is not the slightest doubt, from my own practical knowledge, that the
            gentlemen in the profession have reached a very high standard and are doing an excellent
            community job. On occasions I have sought the services of an oculist or specialist for
            my own eye treatment. An optometrist and an oculist are entirely different. Once it is
            clear that the eye is healthy, then it is for the optometrist to attend to it. I believe
            that these gentlemen, almost without exception, perform their services in a true
            professional spirit in that if they happen to find the slightest reason for doubting
            whether the eye is healthy they refer the person concerned to a general practitioner.</para>
                <para>The Minister for Health has said that it is necessary for a person who wishes to
            attract Commonwealth benefit to consult a general practitioner before seeing a
            specialist. With that procedure I am in entire agreement. I do not think that the time
            of specialists should be taken up by people seeking treatment for minor ailments. I have
            a warm regard for general practitioners not only of the old school but of the modern
            school also. I think that they render outstanding service because as they grow older
            they achieve a knowledge of human nature as well as of their profession which enables
            them to serve their community with extraordinary skill.</para>
                <para>I am extremely sorry that, in speaking of the medical profession, the honorable
            member for Barton used words such as "racket". Surely in dealing with honorable
            professions and honorable people we should avoid that kind of word unless we have
            specific evidence to produce which we can assert of our own personal knowledge to be
            absolutely true. I am sorry that the honorable member introduced that note because I
            feel that what is being done by the Minister is common sense. Before a person goes to a
            specialist he should, for obvious reasons, consult his general practitioner.</para>
                <para>I come, next, to the question of the recognition of optometrists in relation to the
            payment of Commonwealth benefits. I accept the Minister's explanation that some
            limitations are placed on him by the Treasury and that this is one of them. Certain
            medical benefits funds recognize the value of the optometrist's service and
            reimburse the patient. Other funds do not. That is within their own competence to decide
            and the Minister cannot, be blamed. Whilst I would like to see any obstacle to the
            inclusion of optometrical services removed, at least I understand what is involved in
            the objection.</para>
                <para>Let me pass on to something which is nearer to myself. Considering the great number
            of people who suffer, as I do, from the disability of deafness, I believe that some
            approach ought to be made 'to the Treasury, if not to assist in the purchase of
            hearing aids, at least to assist in establishing clinics in the principal centres of our
            community and travelling clinics for use elsewhere. These could give impartial advice
            both on the state of a person's hearing and on the type of aid required. It is
            desirable that pensioners and others should be able to lease machines, an arrangement
            which is made for school children and war pensioners. The idea that elderly people
            cannot benefit from a hearing aid I have found so often contrary to the facts that I
            cannot take it seriously. There are thousands of- people from 50 years of age upwards
            who would gain immense benefit from a hearing aid. Anybody whose hearing aid has stopped
            functioning knows the tremendous disability that is suffered by a deaf person,
            especially with advancing years.</para>
                <para>Therefore, while I praise the services which are already provided by the Minister
            and dissociate myself from the remarks made by the honorable member for Barton, I say,
            as the Minister himself probably recognizes, that there is scope for a real service to
            be given to the community in the way I have suggested. Not only would this add to the
            comfort of the people affected, but it would add to the service that they could render.
            The deaf person who cannot carry on a normal conversation is, to that extent, a crippled
            member of the community to which he or she could render much greater service, with
            pleasure to himself or herself, if a hearing aid were used. I shall not labour this
            question. I rose mainly to rebut certain suggestions which had been made of improper
            practices by the Government and to make it quite clear that not for one moment would I
            entertain those suggestions. I recognize, as I have said, the limitations imposed by the</para>
                <para class="block">Treasury, but I do not recognize any limitations on the goodwill, the
            capacity and the knowledge of his subject of the Minister in charge of this department.</para>

                        . - I propose to direct my remarks to the position of people who, unfortunately,
              are compelled by circumstances outside their control to enter mental institutions, and
              are thereby deprived of social service benefits. I was very interested in the remarks
              made by the honorable member for Henty
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fox)</inline>
                        on the same subject. He made a most valuable contribution to the thinking or this
              vexed matter, and his speech showed that he had done a great deal of research on it. I
              think that what he had to say should help the case advanced by those who, like him and
              me, are attempting to get the Government to recognize the disability under which
              mental patients of pensionable age are suffering and to arrange for the enactment of
              legislation which will give these people something which is morally theirs - the right
              to receive social service benefits. 1 am prepared to concede that every government in
              the past has been guilty of sins of omission or commission in respect of this problem.
              But, after all, time moves on. The heresy of to-day is the accepted view of to-morrow.
              The fact that over the last 40, 50 or 60 years it has been the practice of
              Commonwealth Governments on both sides of politics not to provide any allowance for
              pensioners who enter mental institutions does not mean that this practice should be
              perpetuated if a case can be made out for a change. I think that over the last few
              years a case has indeed been made out by members on both sides of this chamber for a
              change.

                <para>
                    The Minister for Social Services
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton)</inline>
                    replied to some statements that I made some weeks ago when speaking to the Social
            Services Bill 1960, in which I suggested that there was an anomaly in the legislation in
            that a person living in a benevolent institution receives 35s. a week in pension but
            loses his benefit should he be transferred to a mental institution. Such a person, after
            entering a mental institution, would receive absolutely nothing, and to my mind this is
            a real and very obvious anomaly. It is a discrimination between a person who suffers
            from a physical illness and a person who suffers from a mental illness. The Minister, in
            replying to my statements, a:.d to similar statements made by other honorable members on
            this side, said -
                </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The benefit which he was receiving is suspended immediately because it is involved
              with the lunacy laws of the States and, in the normal course of events, payments
              cannot be made to the mentally ill person.</para>
                </quote>
                <para>It may be the normal course of events now, but there is no reason why the course of
            events that is now normal should not be altered completely so that the community may
            bear its obligations towards the unfortunate victims of mental illness. I am very happy
            to know that the attitude of the community towards such people has changed in recent
            years in that it has become more enlightened. Only this year we are celebrating World
            Mental Illness Year and, as the honorable member for Henty said, this week Victoria is
            observing Mental Illness Week. So it can be seen that there is a complete change in
            attitude towards the victims of mental illness.</para>
                <para>The position is quite clear. A person of pensionable age who is in a mental hospital
            receives not one penny piece of spending money in the form of social service benefit,
            and the hospital itself receives not a penny towards that person's upkeep. I know
            that it is argued in favour of this position that mental hospitals are the
            responsibility of the State governments. But surely that bar can be overcome as a result
            of a consultation between the Commonwealth and State governments in order to give these
            people some meed of social justice. Under the present set-up the Commonwealth Government
            is absolved of any financial responsibility despite the fact that the care of the aged
            is one of its constitutional responsibilities. As soon as aged people become mentally
            afflicted the Commonwealth metaphorically wipes its hands of that responsibility. In the
            light of modern thought that attitude is obviously indefensible. Elderly people who
            enter mental institutions have to depend upon the charity of others for tobacco, sweets,
            toilet requisites and such other little amenities as they may require. If they wish to
            go home for the week-end they have to find money for their fares somehow, either from
            their relatives or from some other source. They have not a penny to bless themselves
            with in order to meet even the smallest expenditure that they might be called upon to
            meet.</para>
                <para>The reason for the anomaly is to be found in the tangle of Commonwealth-State
            relations and in the unenlightened attitude towards mental illness that obtained years
            ago but which has changed over the last few years. I would say that the most frequent
            argument stated in defence of the anomaly is that mental health is a State matter and
            that the Commonwealth gives financial assistance to State hospitals in the form of
            general grants to the States. But nobody applies that argument in relation to recipients
            of social service benefits who enter State hospitals for other than mental illnesses.
            Those people still receive their pensions when they are physically sick and in a
            hospital, despite the fact that the hospital they are in is a State responsibility. If
            the same people were transferred to a State mental hospital, however, their pensions
            would cease immediately. I think that morally the Commonwealth should still pay the
            pension, or a part of the pension, in such circumstances.</para>
                <para>All I am asking, in fact, is that the 35s. a week allowance paid to a pensioner
            patient in a benevolent institution should also be paid to a mental patient in a mental
            hospital. This would not cost the Commonwealth very much. According to the figures given
            by the honorable member for Henty this afternoon, a payment of 10s. a week in such cases
            would cost the Commonwealth £120,000 annually. I would multiply that total by three
            and a half, because I think that mental patients should receive 35s. a week, which is
            the amount received by pensioners who are in benevolent institutions. This would make
            the Commonwealth's financial responsibility for such people £420,000 a year.
            That would be a very small amount compared to other calls on the Budget. If my
            suggestion were followed the payment of this amount would remove any feeling of
            inferiority on the part of mental patients that arises from the present practice.</para>
                <para>What we are attempting to do when we ask people to enter mental institutions is to
            give them an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves mentally. We are not helping in that
            direction when we refuse to give these people a feeling of confidence in themselves,
            while we put them in a position where they can say, "The community is finished with
            us. We do not get a penny from the community, and as far as people outside are concerned
            we do not count." That is not a state of mind that will help people to pull
            themselves out of the morass of mental illness.</para>
                <para>I am not blaming this Government for the existing position. I want honorable members
            to be reassured that I am making no political attack on the Government on this score,
            because every government has been guilty of allowing this anomaly to continue. However,
            members of all parties recognize that the community has changed its attitude in regard
            to its obligations to sufferers from mental diseases. We now have all sorts -of bodies
            concerning themselves with, the plight of these unfortunate people. This week we have
            sermons being preached in Victorian churches on the subject of mental health, and
            meetings in Melbourne designed to increase assistance for mental patients. The
            Commonwealth should make some contribution to World Mental Health Year. What better
            contribution could it make than to abolish this injustice, which has been perpetrated
            for far too long, and which prolongs a lingering prejudice against mental illness and
            shows a discrimination which is extremely unjust and out of keeping with the times?</para>
                <para>Scientific and medical advances have greatly changed the whole approach to mental
            illness, but despite this there continues this unreasonable bias against individual
            patients who are eligible for pensions. It is time that the Commonwealth recognized its
            attitude in this respect as a biased attitude, and we here should do our best to see
            that justice is done to this section of the community. I think that the present practice
            is a legacy of past misguided thinking, and until this legacy is removed the victims of
            mental illness who are of pensionable age will continue to harbour feelings of
            inferiority. I feel that the Commonwealth, therefore, should review its present attitude
            to these people. The Government should completely disregard precedents set in the past,
            and should not hide behind the fact that, to use the words of the Minister, this is
            against the normal course of events. It might be against the normal course of events,
            but every piece of legislation passed in this country tends to change the normal course
            of events. For example, we have before us a measure to amend the Crimes Act, and that
            will tend to change the normal course of events as far as that act is concerned.</para>
                <para>If it is good enough to amend theCrimes Act it is good enough to amend the Social
            Services Act in order to give these unfortunate people some redress. We pride ourselves
            that we are a progressive community and have achieved improvements over the years in
            every field of human endeavour. We say we have improved the lot of this person and of
            that person. We say we have a medicalservice second to none and that the recipients of
            social service benefits receive all sortsof benefits that they did not receive years
            ago. But our conception of the treatment of mental pensioners is the same as it was a
            century ago. The time has arrived when we should give this matter very serious
            consideration. I am satisfied that if a conference were held between the Commonwealth
            and the State mental health authorities, the difficulties which apparently still remain
            in the minds of some people could easily be ironed out. I am satisfied that somescheme
            could be arrived at under which these people could be given some spending money which,
            in turn, would give them a feeling of independence and show themthat this Government no
            longer looks upon them as inferior beings. It might be said that some of these people
            are not in a fit state to spend any money, but the director of mental hygiene in the
            State concerned could judge each case on its merits. We should not only make money
            available to these people but should also help to rehabilitate them.</para>
                <para>The whole purpose of our mental institutions to-day is not to let people stop there
            and die in the course of time. In recent years a great number of people have come out of
            such institutions cured and have then had to face the world. The real test of their
            rehabilitation starts when they are discharged and endeavour to earn a living and face
            the world again, that is if they are under 65 years of age. But what do we find? It is a
            big battle for them because, whether we like it or not, such people have a feeling of
            inferiority; they think the community has a set against them, and they might well think
            so because of the way we have treated! them. Surely the money which these people do not
            spend while they are inmates of these institutions could be put aside as a personal
            rehabilitation fund for them on their discharge.</para>
                <para>The Government has a real opportunity to make its contribution to the World Mental
            Health Year in this regard, because in recent years we have made no contribution, as a
            Commonwealth, to the lot of these people, other than by providing money for capital
            works. But I am talking about individual eases and the feelings of individual inmates.
            If what I have suggested were done, I feel certain that the esteem of the Parliament as
            a whole would go up tremendously. I make an appeal to the Government not to say that
            because a Labourgovernment did not do it or because of the intricate CommonwealthState
            relationsthe problem cannot be solved. I am satisfied that this Parliament can do a lot
            of things if it sets its mind to do them. If it sets its mind to see that these people
            are given some recognition, I feel certain it would not be long before the appropriate
            Minister would introduce an amendment to the Social Services Act to give the same
            treatment to these people as is given to inmates of benevolent institutions. The

                    that
            I am tending to imply that the pensioner is receiving sufficient. On the contrary, we
            all believe that the pensioner should be receiving more. However, we should recognize
            that children also have a responsibility in this matter; they should honour their
            fathers and mothers. Apart from the cash benefit provided for pensioners, they receive
            other benefits such as free medical service, hospital benefits, homes for the aged,
            district nursing services, home help administered by local government bodies and dental
            and optical benefits. As regards the pensioner medical service, I believe the Government
            intends in the near future to increase the list of drugs by about 100. I personally am
            proud of the assistance the Government has provided in housing our aged folk. In the
            main institution in my own electorate over 700 aged folk are housed, and in addition
            there are a number of smaller satellite homes where old folk escape the institutional
            atmosphere and live in an atmosphere of homeliness. I am proud to support the Government
            in that respect.
                </para>
                <para>Next we have our district nursing societies which tend the sick, particularly the
            aged sick. Helpers in those societies travel around daily to bath old people, and give
            them injections. All this service is given free, whether it is administered by the
            Commonwealth or the State. Then there is the normal home help service which is
            administered by the local government bodies. I have heard much criticism from the
            Opposition of the dental and optical benefits for aged persons. I am speaking only of
            practicalities. In my own electorate a pensioner, whether a service or age pensioner,
            can obtain an appointment at the Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital or at the Victorian
            Dental Hospital and receive free glasses or free dentures.</para>
                <para class="block">That service is rendered on a means test and the maximum amount that
            these pensioners pay for glasses or dentures is about £2. I am proud to say that
            all this is given by the State of Victoria. I do not know what operates in the other
            States of Australia, but in Victoria this is a service given to pensioners. Ballarat
            being some 70 miles from Melbourne, they are given a free return train fare. These are
            all services that we should support and of which we should be proud. It is stupid to say
            that we cannot from time to time improve on these benefits. Of course we can improve on
            them, but the benefits already given are benefits of which we can all be proud. These
            human benefits, of course, are in addition to the basic rate of pension or the cash
            hand-out and cannot be measured in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.</para>
                <para>
                    Some weeks prior to the Budget a deputation led by the Victorian president of the
            Pensioners Association was met by the Minister for Social Services
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton)</inline>
                    and the Treasurer
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt).</inline>
                    During the conference, a remark was
            made that there was a possibility of some easing of the means test in the forthcoming
            Budget. The president commented that she was not interested in any alleviation of the
            means test, but was interested only in an increase of the basic rate of pension. This
            outlook to my mind is completely selfish, as many people have been endeavouring to live
            on a fixed amount from small long-term investments. They have not been nearly as well
            off as the pensioners have been, and for some time they have been referred to as the
            "new poor". Of course, the alteration now made to the means test will change all
            this.
                </para>
                <para>It -is most unfortunate that pensioner organizations made up of many people who were
            responsible for our pioneering efforts and to whom thanks should be given for many of
            the privileges that we enjoy to-day are being led by a few unscrupulous people whose
            whole purpose is to use these organizations for Communist propaganda, which is contrary
            to our Australian way of life. In conclusion, I should like to say that this Government
            will never be found wanting in pouring out the milk of human kindness wherever it is
            needed by aged folk in Australia.</para>

              that I will be able, in the time available to me, to cover all the points, but I will
              deal with the main ones, I hope, satisfactorily. I will not necessarily deal with them
              in the order in which they were raised or in any order of priority.</para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>First, I want to say something about pharmaceutical benefits, because it is apparent
            that this subject is not properly understood. It is said that we originally made
            important life-saving drugs available free of charge, not only for pensioners but for
            the general public, and that we have now departed from that principle. There has been a
            very good reason for departing from it and the reason is that, when the original scheme
            was introduced, it was possible to single out a relatively small group of drugs which
            could be more or less accurately described as very important lifesaving drugs. However,
            in recent years, very rapid progress has been made in the discovery and in the synthesis
            of a very large number of drugs which really come into this class. So, the original
            conception of the scheme was, in any case, lost; there was no longer a small or
            relatively small group of drugs which could be treated in this way. It became apparent
            that not only was there a very large list of drugs which should be available to the
            public, many of them extremely expensive, but that this was a list which was growing
            rapidly and which would continue to grow. Therefore, certain steps were taken to enlarge
            the list of benefits.</para>
                <para>I point out that it is misleading to talk about free medicine if by " free
            medicine " is meant the provision of free pharmaceutical benefits, except in the
            case of pensioners because the position of pensioners has not altered under the new
            arrangement. Pensioners receive the entire list of drugs without payment, just as they
            did before the introduction of a charge of 5s. to the general public. The first step was
            to make a very large range of benefits, previously confined to pensioners, available to
            the general public. This meant putting on to the general list not all but almost all the
            drugs in the British Pharma copoeia. It is very easy to reflect on the value of these
            drugs, to say that some of them are not worth anything, that some are rubbish - a term
            used here to-day - and to imply that many of them are valueless. It is a singular thing
            that none of these comments was made when the drugs were available only to pensioners;
            they can be made, apparently, when there is a charge for the drug. In other words, those
            who now make these charges appear to be quite satisfied if the drugs are made available
            only to pensioners; they do not then worry about whether they are valuable drugs. The
            fact, of course, is that the drugs placed on the list are drugs in the British
            Pharmacopoeia. No one considered that they were either cheap or ineffective as long as
            they were confined to pensioners.</para>
                <para>Now that a charge is to be made, it has become apparent to some honorable members
            that certain drugs would be cheaper if bought in bulk than they are if bought in small
            quantities. In other words, the charge for a doctor's prescription for a small
            quantity may be 5s., but 100 tablets of the same drug could be bought at a
            proportionately lower rate. That is true. Most things can be bought for less in bulk
            than they can .be in small quantities, and if a fee has to be paid to the chemist for
            dispensing, handling and all the other things that he does when he makes up a
            prescription, that charge must be added. There may perhaps be a few instances in which
            the price does need revision. Those instances are in fact at present under examination;
            but really this is a very insubstantial and minor matter in the whole context of
            pharmaceutical benefits.</para>
                <para>
                    The honorable member for Port Adelaide
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Thompson)</inline>
                    said to-day that according to the estimates for pharmaceutical
            benefits, the amount spent on general benefits was being reduced. When I pointed out to
            him that the total estimate was not £18,000,000 but £26,000,000, he said that
            apparently pensioner benefits had increased but benefits to the general public had been
            reduced. The explanation is quite simple. Prior to the introduction of the 5s. charge,
            it was unnecessary to specify whether a prescription related to a pensioner or not,
            because no one paid for the drug. It was, therefore, quite often convenient to regard
            the prescription as a general benefit. It then appeared in the financial accounting as a
            general benefit. This made no difference in the overall scheme, of course, because it
            was paid from the same source in any case. The only valid comparison is between total
            expenditures, because the previous situation no longer applies. It is now necessary for
            the doctor to specify on the prescription whether the recipient is a pensioner or not,
            so that the chemist may know whether he is to make a charge. The accounting is now done
            more exactly. So far as the book-keeping is concerned, a large part of the expenditure
            has been transferred from the general column to the pensioner column.

                        <para>- All the drugs on the list of pharmaceutical benefits. The pensioner drugs have
                come on to the general list, which now covers all the drugs that were previously on
                two separate lists. The only real way of comparing the figures before and after 1st
                March is to compare the totals. When the honorable member does that he will find not
                only that the list is very much larger than it was previously, but also that the
                expenditure is greater. Whereas last year it was approximately £18,000,000,
                this year it will be about £26,000,000. There has really been no contraction of
                expenditure at all.</para>

                <para>Furthermore, as is well known, a substantial addition will be made in the near
            future to the list of drugs. What has really happened with regard to pharmaceutical
            benefits is that while there has been some financial imposition in the way of charges on
            those who benefit under this scheme, there has been a wide extension of a broad scheme
            of welfare, and a very large number of drugs, the prices of which are very high indeed,
            in many cases ranging from £5 to £6, £7 or even £8 for a single
            prescription, is now available under these arrangements to the genera] public at 5s.
            for each prescription, and to pensioners free of charge. The list, as 1 say, will
            shortly be extended to include a much wider range of drugs than it now does. Even under
            the present scheme members of the public pay 5s. for prescriptions the average price of
            which would be 18s. 6d. if no pharmaceutical benefits scheme were in operation.</para>

                probably be even higher.</para>

                        <para>- The new list will be published soon, and I do not want to say in advance what
                it will contain. I want to make one other comment about the list of pharmaceutical
                benefits. It is quite easy for honorable members to stand up in this chamber and
                say, sometimes on the authority of quite eminent medical people, that such-and-such
                a drug should be on the list, and such-and-such a drug should be removed from it.
                Finality can never be reached in this matter, because it involves, of course,
                matters of opinion. The Government must be guided, as it is guided, by a body of
                expert opinion. This body of opinion will, of course, be disagreed with now and
                again, even by members of the medical profession or of the pharmaceutical profession
                and. more frequently, by members of the public. But no government could do other
                than seek advice from a body of experts, who can tell it what drugs, in their
                opinion, should be on the list. Those are the drugs which are on the list. As
                honorable members know, the Minister has no power to add anything to the list
                without a recommendation from this committee of experts. Let me say something about
                this committee. It is often criticized. On the committee, and comprising the
                majority of it. are four doctors, all nominated by the British Medical Association.</para>

                        <para>- They do. They advise the Government on quantities, and invariably that advice
                is given on therapeutic grounds. While it is quite possible for persons to criticize
                concerning quantities, and to say, for example, " There were twenty tablets
                prescribed in a prescription, whereas the number should have been 50, or 100 ",
                nevertheless the Government must take the advice of its experts. We have recently,
                however, in consultation with the medical profession, bad a look at this matter of
                quantities, and in quite a number of cases the quantities are under revision, to
                bring them more into line with organized thinking in the profession itself. I am
                sure, however, that honorable members will realize that any government which
                followed any other course in fixing quantities or in placing drugs on the list would
                be irresponsible in the highest degree.</para>

                <para>I want to repeat just one remark before moving away from the matter of
            pharmaceutical benefits. Let nobody imagine that the taxpayer does not have to foot the
            bill. Not only has the Government to arrange a satisfactory list, and a list which will
            be acceptable to its medical advisers; it also has to exercise supervision over costs
            and, like all welfare schemes, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has to be paid for.
            This year, as I have said, the estimated cost of the scheme is £26,000,000. If
            members of the public are asked to provide 5s. towards the very high cost of a
            prescription, they are being asked only, as beneficiaries in a welfare scheme, to play
            some part in the direct provision of their own benefits. The Government believes that
            this is a good principle.</para>
                <para>
                    I pass now from the subject of pharmaceutical benefits, and I want to refer to the
            very thoughtful remarks made by the honorable member for Stirling
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cash)</inline>
                    this afternoon about cancer detection clinics.
            This is a subject that he has raised in the Parliament before. I hope nobody will
            imagine that I am trying to pour cold water on what he said, because I think there was a
            good deal of value in it and I think the honorable member made a thoughtful contribution
            to the debate. But one must examine all aspects of any proposal, and in this case I
            think it is useless to try to draw an analogy between the tuberculosis campaign and any
            similar campaign in the case of a disease like cancer. In fact there can be no valid
            analogy.
                </para>
                <para>Tuberculosis is a disease with a known cause, readily diagnosed, for which we have
            powerful weapons of treatment. Cancer is not a disease of this kind at all. It is not
            readily diagnosed. In fact, no matter how many examinations are made at regular
            intervals, it is only in the case of a few special types of cancer that the disease can
            be detected at all. It usually does not manifest itself in ordinary medical examination
            in the absence of some symptoms, and when symptoms are present they are often not easy
            to interpret. I think we would find great numbers of people who, shortly after having
            undergone an examination during which no sign of the disease was found, might be
            discovered to be suffering from cancer. A person in such a position might complain that
            at the earlier examination the doctor had found nothing at all. This would be quite
            true, of course, because there had been nothing for the doctor to find. Cancer is not a
            disease like tuberculosis, in the case of which you can X-ray the chest and see the
            shadow.</para>
                <para>There are some forms of cancer, ot course, which are apparent to the naked eye, or
            to what I might call superficial examination. I do not mean, of course, a cursory
            examination, but what I might call an external examination. For example, cancer of the
            skin is readily detectable. Cancer of the breast is not quite so apparent, but a routine
            examination might detect it in an early stage. Some forms of uterine cancer are fairly
            readily diagnosed. But cancer, generally speaking, is not a disease that can be easily
            detected. I personally think that no matter how many clinics we set up we would not
            succeed in detecting great numbers of cancer cases. That is not to say that it is not
            advisable to look for the forms of cancer I have referred to. The appropriate people to
            look for them, in most instances, are the ordinary medical attendants of all of us. What
            is valuable, of course, is for the medical profession itself to realize the very great
            importance of the interpretation, so far as it is possible to do so. of the early signs
            which they themselves may frequently encounter in their routine work among patients.
            While I acknowledge the interest that the honorable member has taken in this matter and
            the value of his suggestion, it is not really helpful1 to. obscure the facts of a case
            and imagine that, by doing ux this case what we have done in another, but not similar,
            case, we shall produce a successful result.</para>
                <para>I wish to turn my attention now to optometrists. Reference has been, made in the.
            committee to-day to- a document, which I have not seen; but I gather from what honorable
            gentlemen have said that it contains allegations, that the law with regard to the
            provision, of benefits, in the case of. prescription of spectacles is somehow being
            evaded'. I will come back to that point in a few moments; but first I want to make
            it clear what the position of optometry is in relation to this scheme. I want to say
            that I realize and value, as does every member of the Government, the great service that
            optometrists do. The fact that medical benefits are not paid for optometry is not a
            reflection on the profession; and if is not an indication that one does not think
            optometry is an important profession or that we do not realize the great value of the
            work that is done by optometrists. But in the context of Australian conditions, we must
            expand the national' health service step by step, and1 it has not yet been found
            possible to expand the service by including what I might call ancillary services. After
            all, the expenditure on the national health service has grown in the ten- years'
            between 1'950 and 1960 from £7,000,000 a year to- £73,000,000 a year.
            Nobody can say with truth that we are going ahead very slowly.</para>
                <para>As 1 said before when speaking on pharmaceutical benefits, the- beneficiary - the
            taxpayer - has to find the money. In the context of Australian conditions, it would be a
            great mistake for us to rush- rapidly ahead without paying; sufficient regard to all the
            things we have had to do in Australia. They are many and varied, and they tax our
            resources' to the utmost. I say that as a sort of general statement regarding: the
            provision of benefits for ancillary services.</para>
                <para>Let me say something about questions that have been raised recently by optometrists
            themselves. One is the- suggestion that a medical benefit should be payable to the
            patient of an optometrist. I have already dealt with that matter. The other suggestion;
            is that if as- optometrist refers a patient to an. ophthamologist - that is, to an eye
            specialist1 - the patient should receive a medical' benefit equal to the benefit he
            would receive if fie had been referred' by a medical practitioner. As the committee
            will realize, it is the- patient who receives the benefit.. The position is that if a
            patient is referred by a medical practitioner; to- an eye specialist,, he receives a
            higher benefit when he pays the: eye specialist's, bill than he would if he went
            direct to the eye specialist himself. If the patient is sent to a specialist by an
            optometrist, he is regarded as having gone direct to- the eye specialist himself. The
            reason for this is that it is considered to be in the proper interests of the national,
            health service and to maintain the proper status of the ophthalmologist, as a
            consultant..</para>
                <para>If the optometrist wants to refer one of his patients to a doctor, he will often
            have to do so because he believes the patient to be suffering from a systemic disease
            and it is to the general medical practitioner, that is to his ordinary doctor, that he
            should be referring the patient. So the question of a benefit in such a case, does not
            arise. On the whole,, I believe the provisions of the. act are- just, and until the
            provisions of the. act are expanded, as they may be some, day;, to include optometry,
            there is. no alternative but. to proceed1 with the present, arrangements.</para>

                    Let me return to the allegation that has been made by the honorable member for
            Barton
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Reynolds)</inline>
                    - and I hope he will correct
            me if I am wrong - that although the National Health Act prohibits the payment of a
            Commonwealth benefit if a patient goes to a doctor' and has spectacles prescribed
            for him, some doctors disguise the fact that they have given such a prescription, evade
            the act and allow the patient to receive the benefit by the nature of the certificate
            they give. I have two things to say about that allegation: One is that the act expressly
            excludes from benefit an attendance- at which spectacles are prescribed1.

                        <para>- No, it is on the doctor; but the fund has no right to pay the benefit until it
                assures itself that the payment is proper. The other matter that has been raised in
                this regard relates to dental benefits. I have answered questions about dental
                benefits in the House before. Might I repeat this about them: The suggestion that is
                made is that dental benefits similar to medical benefits should be paid. In other
                words, we should have a scheme of voluntary insurance for dental benefits similar to
                the scheme of voluntary insurance for medical benefits. The difficulty is that the
                level of premiums required to be paid would be so high as to discourage
                contributions. This is not a simple matter. The fact that it has not been brought to
                solution does not mean that it cannot be brought to solution, but that that solution
                will not be found readily. We have been in consultation with the Australian Dental
                Association and officers of the Department of Health have pursued the question of
                providing assistance for dental expenses, and it does not appear easy if it is to be
                done under a system of voluntary health insurance. If it is to be said that we
                should depart from a system of voluntary health insurance, it is as well that those
                who advocate compulsion should understand what compulsion means. It means that the
                government which employs compulsion must also ration expenditure under that scheme.
                In other words, it must fix the fees of everybody providing the services and that is
                a state of affairs which the people of this country have vehemently rejected up to
                the present.</para>

                </continue>
                <para>These are what one might call replies to criticisms. I do not want to sit down in
            this debate on the Estimates before I say something on the positive side of the ledger,
            because perhaps what one might call the social welfare side of the Depart ment of Health
            looms far more greatly in the public eye than do the other great activities of the
            department which are administered without many people being aware that they are going on
            throughout the year. I should like to say a few things about some of the great
            activities of the department which it is well that we should all realize are being
            carried on constantly. Not the least are the quarantine activities. I hope it is widely
            recognized that the efficient administration of quarantine has kept major epidemic
            diseases out of Australia, apart from one or two minor outbreaks, ever since federation.
            It is continuing to do so even in circumstances of modern high-speed transport, of
            aircraft and ships arriving at a much faster rate than they did previously of ever so
            much faster communications and of all the added problems of modern communications.
            Australian quarantine still functions with great efficiency, and it is a great tribute
            to the officers of the Department of Health that this is so. Quarantine covers not only
            humans but also plants and animals, and the quarantine of plants and animals has helped
            to keep our primary industries free of the serious diseases which have been the cause of
            great economic loss in other parts of the world.</para>
                <para>May I say something also about the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories? We say very
            little about this subject when we debate the Estimates each year. It is something which
            is taken for granted. The ordinary amenities of medical life; the antigen with which
            every child in Australia is immunized; the Salk vaccine which virtually has immunized
            the child population of Australia against poliomyelitis; smallpox vaccine; veterinary
            products; the anti-venene for snakebite, all come from the great laboratories at
            Parkville. It is a pity that we do not say a little more about the Commonwealth Serum
            Laboratories during the debate on the Estimates because much of the relevant expenditure
            is devoted to providing all those things to which I have referred.</para>
                <para>Let me refer also to the Institute of Child Health which is run by my department.
            The very distinguished first director of the institute has just retired. I suppose that
            he has done as much as any man, and more than most, in the cause of child health in
            Australia. All sorts of childhood disorders are investigated at the institute and
            research is done into them. Research is carried out amongst other things, into rheumatic
            fever, endocrine disturbances and heart diseases in children. All these things go on
            unnoticed and unmentioned.</para>
                <para>
                    Then there is the National Standards Laboratory which has been established in
            Canberra. This is one of the most important sections of my department. It is practically
            unknown to every one, but it determines the efficacy of the biological and
            pharmaceutical products that are used in Australia, setting a standard so that we can be
            certain that in this country we use nothing but the best. If it were not for the
            lateness of the hour,

            that are very little noticed, about which very little is known, and which are very
            seldom mentioned in this House, but which add up to a great service for the health of
            this country and reflect great credit on the officers who so ably administer them.

              Bill, to deal also with the matters covered in Order of the Day No. 14. When I was
              moving the second reading of this bill, I asked honorable members whether they would
              consider the contents of the bill against the background of the policy statement which
              I have made. Although I did not myself canvass again matters in the policy statement,
              I suggest to you that perhaps you might allow honorable members to do so if they wish.

              delivered in this House on Tuesday, 23rd August, and of his policy statement in

                <para>The Papua and New Guinea Bill is not just a machinery bill; it is a bill which deals
            with an improvement in the conditions of the natives of New Guinea. It is a bill which
            has very great significance to the Australian people, because the island of New Guinea
            means a lot to us. From the point of view of geography, it is our nearest neighbour;
            from the point of view of our defence, it is of tremendous importance; and from the
            point of view of human welfare, we have a responsibility to discharge. We have been
            discharging that responsibility very successfully, and we have no reason to be ashamed
            of anything connected with it. We are not a colonial power. We have never been a
            colonial power. We are not a colonial power because we have never exploited anybody in
            New Guinea or in any other dependency of ours. In spending money in New Guinea we have
            been guided by altruistic considerations, and the Australian public are still prepared
            to keep on spending in that spirit as the Parliament decides for the welfare and benefit
            of the peoples of Papua and New Guinea. We may not be able to spend all that we would
            like to spend; indeed, we cannot. If we could do all that we would like to do for Papua
            and New Guinea, we would have to spend six or seven times as much as we are spending
            now, and that is beyond our resources.</para>

            themselves to help to rectify the deficiencies about which they make very strong, and
            oftentimes very vigorous protests. The Australian people cannot of themselves, out of
            their own resources, find all the money that ought to be spent on education, health,
            public works and scientific aid to agriculture and the like without some assistance from
            the United Nations or some such body. But if we ever did receive any assistance from the
            United Nations in discharging our obligations in Papua and New Guinea, we should insist
            that it must come from the United Nations itself, and not from individual nations,
            because, if it came from individual nations, it would possibly involve us in many
            dangers and difficulties.</para>

                        <para>- I do not care who listens to me and who does not. These are my own views. I
                have derived them from my own somewhat slight experiences of Papua and New Guinea.
                Unfortunately, they are experiences which are not shared by most Australians. Too
                few of our people have gone to this island which lies to the north of us. It is a
                territory of 350,000 square miles, and would fit into Australia ten times over. It
                is peopled by 500 different groups or races, and there are great differences in
                their languages. They are not one people. They are a collection of tribes, or clans
                as they are more commonly called to-day.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>The island was divided by European powers. One geographical half belongs to Holland
            and of the remaining half one part is owned by Australia and the other part is
            administered by Australia under a mandate from the United Nations. This mandated
            territory was once German New Guinea. In the area for which we are responsible, we have
            something like 2,500,000 people. Some statistics give the number of natives as lower
            than that but, because of the work in the field of medicine, first of the missionaries
            of all denominations, without whom there would have been no development there and,
            secondly, because of the work of the Government, people are living longer now and more
            children are surviving the first year of life. The population of Papua and New Guinea is
            increasing remarkably, and our responsibilities are increasing commensurately. We try to
            meet those responsibilities by appropriating each year a considerable sum of money. This
            year, we have voted £14,500,000 for the work. Last year, the amount was
            £13,000,000. The year before that, it was £12,000,000, and .in the year before
            that it was £11,000,000.. This year, it is expected that £7,500,000 will be
            raised locally. The amount raised from local sources last year was £6,500,000. The
            year before that it was £5,500,000 and in the year before that it was
            £4,750,000. Expenditure on Papua and New Guinea is increasing, therefore, by at
            least £2,500,000 yearly.</para>
                <para>But we still cannot meet all the requirements of the people. It is pathetic to
            travel in Papua and New Guinea and see the thirst for knowledge among those who are
            sometimes referred to as bush natives or kanakas. Even the most primitive of these
            people want teachers. They want agricultural experts to advise them. They want doctors
            and hospitals, and they have the idea that any request they make in that connexion to
            the Administration can be met by the despatch of a letter or some message to the
            mainland. They think the people of Australia have unlimited supplies of all the people
            who are required. Of course, that is not so, and we can only do a certain amount.</para>
                <para>I have found, as I think those of my colleagues who have been to Papua and New
            Guinea have found, that the New Guinea natives are completely dependent upon us at this
            moment. They have no hesitation in saying that. They are not subservient or sycophantic
            people. They are proud and independent. They have no sense of inferiority, and they have
            no feeling of superiority. They are still a collection of tribes or clans and they will
            depend on us for a generation or more before they can be assured that they will be able
            to decide for themselves the type or form of government that they will wish to have.
            That opinion is widespread, although a few may disagree with it.</para>
                <para>The general opinion was well expressed by an old lulua'i, at Lae, who, when he
            was told that we Australians were staying in New Guinea not because we wanted to stay
            there but because we wanted to help them, and when he was pressed to state the
            approximate date of self-determination that he would fix, shrugged his shoulders and
            through an interpreter indicated the date in words something like this: " When old
            man passem out and young man passem in ". In other words, he was prepared to let the
            matter be decided at least a generation hence. I know that world -opinion is pressing on
            "us and .that we must do something earlier than that. Our neighbours, the Dutch,
            have made a decision in the matter, They have fixed a date for their territory and at
            may be given self-government in something like .a decade. That, of course, obliges us to
            speed up the development of our Territory of Papua and New Guinea -and hasten the
            process that we would ordinarily have allowed to develop more easily and in a way more
            .naturally.</para>

                anybody. The Dutch have their responsibilities, and they discharge their obligations

                been the case. .It is not only what the Dutch have decided that .makes the matter so

                when representatives of the United Nations Trusteeship Council visit Papua and New
                Guinea. I should like to say in passing that none of the missions from the

                -Guinea -severely,. All that .they have :ever suggested

                -satisfied that If the United Nations were to say to-morrow that the people of New
                Guinea had to make their choice immediately, those people would want 'New Guinea
                to become another State of the Commonwealth of Australia or at least would want a
                'very close association with this Commonwealth. But we are prepared to allow the
                matter to wait for a generation or more in the hope that the whole of the people of
                the island - there are now more than 3,000,000 of them and there may be 4,000,000
                when the time comes - will decide ;as one people the form of government that they
                want. Whatever, decision they make, we must accept - and the world must .accept.
                They will have ito .decide whether they want .to he part of a Melanesian
                'federation or part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, -whether &gt;they
                want to work out -a .closer association with us than -we can visualize at ^present
                other than as separate States .of the Commonwealth, or whether .they -want to tie
                themselves to Indonesia. That will be for them .to 'decide and nobody ought ito
                .-hinder them. But /for 'the time being, they are under the tutelage .of
                ourselves and the Dutch, and they are very happy to foe in that position at present.

                <para>Those are the things that I wanted to say broadly about Papua and New Guinea before
            I come to the statement which the Minister for Territories made on 23rd August. This
            statement, if I .might say so, was a very carefully prepared, temperate document in
            which the history of Australian administration in Papua and New Guinea since the end of
            World War II. was set out - and set .out lucidly, very simply and very tellingly.
            Anybody who reads this statement cannot help .but have very great, admiration for those
            who are mentioned in it for the work they have -done - the missionaries, the
            Administration officers, and those returned servicemen of World War 31. and others who
            have been working in Papua and New -Guinea over an any years. I know that there have
            been some bad cases -of disregard for the sights &lt;of natives on the part of a Jew
            individuals. That sort &gt;of thing will always happen. There have 'been examples,
            some bad examples, of exploitation in Papua and New Guinea. There is a 'good deal of
            exploitation on :all sides going on in Australia to-day. It :is hard to curb human
            nature, but the post-war Administrators, J. K. Murray .and D. M. Cleland, have done
            their best to protect the natives against any wrong-doing on the part of what are
            generally called the Europeans, or Australians. I know that some people can criticize
            quite fairly .and trenchantly things that .have happened in the Territory, but I do not
            propose to utter .any particular criticisms this evening, because my time is limited,
            for one .thing, .and I want to deal with some .aspects -of, the bill and some, of the
            things which the Minister said in his statement.</para>
                <para>I cannot repeat all that the Minister said about (the Administration in -the
            post=war,era and I ' do not want to try to repeat it. It is quite easy to throw our
            minds back to the days immediately after World War II. ended and to think of the
            destruction of property and the loss of life - especially the loss of so many great
            administrators and officers during the war - and the dislocation of the whole community
            life in Papua and New Guinea. When we think of those things, we can readily understand
            the great difficulties that confronted the people who went into the Territory and were
            charged with the responsibility of rebuilding the Administration after the war. I am
            pleased that my colleague, the former Minister for External Territories, is in the
            chamber this evening. It fell to his lot to appoint the first post-war Administration.
            It fell to his lot to play his part in rebuilding the whole edifice of the
            Administration. He started the local government councils. He started the whole education
            system. And he started the co-operative movement.</para>

                            There were no local councils in pre-war
                days. There was no native participation at the administration level. There were no
                co-operatives. To-day, there are flourishing co-operatives. When Labour went out of
                office in 1949, we had no local government councils established, but we had prepared
                the machinery for them. To-day, after almost eleven years, there are 36 of these
                councils operating. However, they are only a fraction of the number that will
                ultimately exist throughout the island. The process has been long and tardy.

            co-operatives in the Territory had a turnover of £1,250,000. When the price of
            copra was higher than it is now, the turnover has even been greater. For my part, I
            should prefer to see the native co-operatives grow even faster than they have been
            growing. I should like to see much of the trade of Papua and New Guinea in the hands of
            co-operatives. There are co-operatives, I think, in the cocoa and in the copra
            industries. I should like to see co-operatives in the robber industry and the coffee
            industry if there are none in those industries yet. Again, it is all right for the
            outsider to look in and say what ought to be done. We have to consider the mentality of
            the native peoples and their own wishes. We must let them work out their own future in
            their own way. They certainly are accepting a great deal of assistance and they are
            ready to accept the advice of the Australian people who are among them and who work with
            them.</para>
                <para>The Minister has told us that there are now 3,623 Australian public servants in the
            Territory of Papua and New Guinea, 334 native members of the Public Service there, and
            7.500 native employees of the Administration. That indicates how rapidly the
            administrative forces have grown over ten years. Those people have supervised all the
            great work of airfield construction, the provision of water and electricity supplies,
            the building of houses, the provision of sanitation and the conduct of schools. When
            that work is measured against what other people have done anywhere else at any other
            time, I think that we, as a people, have every reason to be proud of the performance of
            our fellow Australians who have laboured there so long and so successfully.</para>
                <para>The other statement which the Minister read to this House dealt with land tenure in
            New Guinea. There is a feeling among a number of people that the Territory of Papua and
            New Guinea is very wealthy, that there is a lot of land available, that the natives are
            not a work-minded people, and that if only the land could be made available to
            Australians the whole country would be better off than it is. I think that that idea is
            completely wrong. The Territory is largely mountainous or swampy. There is not much
            arable land available. A lot of land is very sour and there is very little that could be
            compared with the best land in Australia. Of the land that is available, only 3 per
            cent, has been alienated from native ownership. Therefore there is not a lot of land
            available for settlers from outside.</para>
                <para>It cannot be said that we have deprived the native of his access to land. The cause
            of most revolutions down through the centuries has been over land and the use of land.
            We have no reason to be unhappy about our attitude towards land in New Guinea. I am*
            glad that the Minister, in his statement, retained the principles which I think were
            laid down by his predecessor when he said -</para>

              native owners are willing to sell and, in the opinion of the Administration, the land
              is not required by them; and conversion of title from native custom to individual
              registered title may take place only if the majority of those interested in the land
              under native custom consent to conversion and the method of conversion.</para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">So the safeguards are very explicit in regard to the right of the
            native to the ownership of his own land and its use, and with regard to its acquisition
            by a foreigner or its alienation by any tribe or people.</para>
                <para>In some parts of Papua and New Guinea there is a real land hunger because of the
            rapid growth of population. Despite that fact, I did not find anywhere any hostility by
            the natives towards Australians living among them and occupying territory on which crops
            are grown. The only stipulation - and a very reasonable one - that was made by native
            leaders was that there should be no such thing as absentee landlordism or, as they put
            it, nobody should own land who was not prepared to use it. If a man was not prepared to
            use his land he should sell it back to the native people. That seemed to me to be
            reasonable and proper.</para>
                <para>The bill before us sets out conditions under which a new council shall be elected to
            guide the destinies of the people of Papua and New Guinea. At the present time we have a
            council of 27 members of whom three are elected and they, to use the common term, are
            European. Three natives are appointed and the rest of the members are all government
            appointees. Under this legislation the number of councillors is to be increased to 39,
            six of whom are to be elected by Europeans, and six by natives under an indirect system.
            At least five are to be appointed by the Minister from among the native leaders and
            another five will be appointed, presumably from among the European population. Two
            appointees will represent the missions. To day, the missionaries have three
            representatives.</para>
                <para>I know that there is a complaint on the part of some of the missions about the
            reduction from three to two. For my part, I think it would be better if the missions
            were not represented on the council at all. I think that the less the churches have to
            do with administration the less likelihood there is of their becoming involved in
            arguments between the native peoples and the Administration. But there is a good case
            for appointing the missionaries because of their long association with the people of the
            land. As the Minister has argued, they can, in a sense, because of their knowledge of
            the native peoples, be representative of native interests as well as of the missions.</para>
                <para>The Minister proposes, under his indirect system of election, to divide the
            Territory into six areas. The local government councils will appoint delegates in each
            of these areas and they will elect a native representative. Up to date, as I have said,
            there are only about 36 councils. Therefore, the number of natives covered in those
            areas by the council will be about 250,000. A lot of others who are not yet under the
            control of the Administration will not be even indirectly represented. The Minister
            proposes to give them representation through the appointed native members. That means,
            of course, that there will be five appointees for 2,250,000 natives and six elected
            members for 250,000 natives, in place of the three nominated native representatives who
            sit in the council as it at present exists. Instead of having three Europeans elected to
            the council we will now have six. They will represent 20,000 Europeans.</para>
                <para>The Minister has said, very rightly, "I am not going to provide for two sets of
            separate rolls. There will be one roll for Europeans and this indirect system of
            indirect representation will pass after a transitional stage". Unfortunately, he has
            not set a date at which that transitional stage will pass and the Opposition proposes to
            move an amendment to test the feeling of the House on the question of a common roll. We
            think that a common roll should not wait too long. We think it should come into
            operation at the first election. If it cannot come into operation at the first election,
            it should come- into operation at the next ensuing election.</para>
                <para>The Government feels,, apparently,, that it* proposal- should be judged by
            perform.ances. It. is a sort of trial and error scheme. The. Minister, said that in
            five, of six years there; should be another review of the system and? that. then,,
            perhaps,, more native: members will be- elected- and,, perhaps; fewer white Europeans
            will be elected, or there will! be: fewer appointed people: But. he. is&gt; certainly
            on the: right track,, in our view, when be- says- that, all- the people who go&gt; to
            live in. Papua and. New Guinea,, no matter what, their racial origin, must regard
            themselves ass citizens of. that Territory and there must be no racial distinction or
            discrimination ia future. Those who go from Australia to live in the Territory,
            will' be subject to the l'aws of the Territory just as a person, who was born
            there is subject to these. laws.. That is in accordance with modern thought, so modern,
            indeed,, that if it had been enunciated ten years ago it would have caused quite a lot
            of people to have very grave views about the. sanity of those who advocated such, an
            idea. But the. world' is moving on. There, is a phrase, " the winds of change
            "'. It is. a very much battered! and misused phrase in these, times, but if
            there is any legitimacy left ia its use the. winds of change are moving, over Papua and
            New Guinea just as they are. over other places in the world.</para>
                <para>We do not. propose- to; oppose the second reading- of the; bill-, but! we don
            propose- to move- an amendment at the committee, stage to. provide- that every adult
            resident, ia the. Territory shall be- entitled to' enrolment asan. elector for the
            electorate in which he resides. We do- not advocate- compulsory enrolment- or compulsory
            voting. But wefind ourselVes faced with- the position- in- theTerritory that?, as- f
            have said; there aremore than- 4,000 native leaders and people working for the-
            Administration, made- up of 3-34 native members of the- Public Service and'
            7,500' Administration' employees; who. have reached the' educational:
            standard which' fits' them; and should give- them' the right, to vote. None
            of-' them- will be elected! to&lt; represent the natives. The- only way, under the-
            indirect system that the Minister' proposes; in which these- people can. be
            represented1 is by some: of the- native: legislators; whom the. Administrator- will1
            appoint. There are also, of course, mem* bers: of the. Pacific Islands Regiment, and
            members of the Papuan Constabulary, who have many duties to perform. Some members'
            of the constabulary- can direct traffic quite as well as any policeman in any city in
            Australia. None of them will- be directly represented. We think, that these people -
            and- they are the- ones we have in mind principally - should have the- right to'
            go' on' the common electoral roll at this stage if they wish to da so. They
            should, also have the right to vote, in the. election for Europeans if they want to- do
            so. We feel that we would stand better in- the eyes of the world if: we took, that step.</para>
                <para>If we can secure passage of the amendment - and; I am very doubtful of ft- - we
            would then move to1 omit from clause. 8 proposed new sub-sections* (3.), (41.)1 and
            (4a.)1 of the act.</para>
                <para>The only other thing' I wane to- say about the: bill1 is; that it represents* a
            major constitutional change for the Territory, that it is ai desirable and necessary
            change, and' that it is; a change that all Australians should welcome.. It certainly
            does', mark an important- stage towards- self-government in the- Territory, and; I
            think that all people im the Territory, whether they are of Augtralian origin oe whether
            they are; indigenouspeople capable of- making a&gt; judgment, Believes, that it is. a
            good-' thing-- that reform of the; legislative Council is being tackled at this
            time.-</para>

                    The Minister made several visits to Papua, and New Guinea,, and- he tells us that

                <para>I met Taureka for only an hour or so, but j formed a very high opinion of his
            ability and integrity, and I did admire his forthrightness .as I did .admire -the

            men like Simogun, Yarriga .and Byas. All of them said, in effect: " If you want to
            make clear our views on .the future of Papua and New Guinea attach some of us to the
            delegation you are sending to the United Nations, and let us talk to the Afro-Asian
            group. We will be .able to tell them what we, who Jive in the country, want, and
            disabuse their minds of a lot of the opinions they hold to-day in regard to what we
            ought to have."</para>
                <para>We regard this island of New Guinea as a whole. What we in the Opposition would like
            .to see effected is a t-ri-partite .agreement between the Indonesians, the Dutch and
            ourselves for the preservation of the peace .and security of Indonesia and .the whole
            island of New Guinea against the day, a generation hence, when the native peoples, who
            are nearly one race even if they are of 'different clans, will be .able, as an
            educated democracy, to make their .own choice, to make it sensibly and make it finally,
            for the peace, order and good government of their -own .country. We would not want
            others interfering with them. We do not believe in Indonesian .claims to succeed the
            Dutch in sovereignty over the last territory in this part of the world in which the
            Dutch exercise suzerainty. We "believe that the Indonesian claim to the possession
            of Dutch New Guinea on the ground that the Indonesians are the successors to the Dutch
            in that area is only a form of neo-colonialism, .and we think that that is completely
            wrong. We think that such a claim rests .on the right of conquest, and the right of
            conquest is no right. We think that the peoples of the whole island are almost akin,
            ethnically, historically and culturally, even if not linguistically. We would hope that
            what comes 'of this legislation, what '.happens in the years ahead, and
            everything else done by this Australian Parliament -will always be conducive to -the
            peace, order and good government of that great Territory.</para>

                        . - In view of the vast importance of this subject to both present and future
              generations of Australians I -think that the most -refreshing thing that I have
              experienced in my -time in ;this -Parliament is the realization that at least on this
              very important matter we are at uniformity within this chamber. I was in New -Guinea
              during the time
                        <inline font-style="italic">the</inline>
                        Leader -of the Opposition
              (Mt. Calwell) was th,ere, and I think I can say without reservation that an
              opportunity that he might have used -for political -advantage he used with a
              tremendous sense of .responsibility in relation to all the statements he made. They
              -were -objective and factual, and I believe they were of vast importance because of
              the impression they made on Australian opinion and naturally, .through press reports,
              on world opinion generally. On this subject there is -no room for dissension, .because
              it is so important &lt;to our future, and especially at this time when we have the
              eyes of the world upon us. The matter is probably Australia's greatest immediate
              political and economic problem, on account of its proximity to our shores and also in
              view of the very considerable importance of the production of New Guinea and Papua,
              which is complementary to the production on our Australian mainland. I do not think
              anybody with any sense of responsibility in Australia - and particularly in this place
              - would allow himself to prejudice the future of Australia and the future of the
              people of New Guinea merely to try to take some petty political advantage which, in
              the eyes of the world, may prejudice not on'ly what we are doing for the people of
              New Guinea, but also their future and the accomplishment of what might be best for
              them.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                    the legislation
            before the House is another step forward

                    form of .eventual
            self-government for the people of -New Guinea. The main innovation contained in the bill
            deals with the introduction of a system of election of .native members by members of the
            native voting public. There is .also in the -bill a provision which reduces the number .
            of official .members in the existing Legislative Council. This is perhaps not so
            significant as it might appear because obviously the other section which composes the
            Legislative Council under the proposed legislation - the appointed members - will still,
            in conjunction with the official members, retain a majority should they vote together.
            However, in relation to those appointed members, another significant point arises, as
            mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Calwell),</inline>
                    in that five of those appointed members out of the ten should be
            drawn from the native population. The only argument that might arise out of this
            legislation is concerned with the amendment moved by the honorable gentleman in
            connexion with the electoral rolls. I believe - quite rightly in accordance with his
            political philosophy and that of the people who sit behind him - that he considers that
            every political theory should be implemented immediately and that you cannot have a
            restricted roll which is composed on principles which do not fit in with our modern
            democratic forms, and so I respect his judgment on that.

                    I believe, from the way he phrased his amendment, that, in actual fact, he realizes
            the impossibility of introducing a common roll at this stage. The excellent speech of
            the Minister for Territories
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck)</inline>
                    on this
            subject, explaining in considerate and moderate terms the difficulty of the
            Administration in implementing a common roll for elections in the Territory of Papua and
            New Guinea to-day, presents a situation that it is impossible to overcome; so, while I
            realize the sincerity of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, I believe that he
            knows that the time is not ripe for the implementation of a common roll. And, as he
            himself has said, in his contact with the native leaders in the Territory the policy of
            a separate roll was supported by the remarks they made to him. He also pointed out in
            regard to that section of the native community which would be debarred from being
            members under the voting system because they are members of the Administration, that it
            is available for them to be included as appointed native members. The Minister covered
            the objects of the legislation very well in his speech when he said - we have dedicated
            ourselves to the political advancement of the people and . in deciding what is best to
            do, we will apply the test of the welfare of the people rather than the satisfaction of
            a theory.
                </para>
                <para class="block">
                    I think we should ponder well on those words, because I think they
            imply a genuine approach to a difficult problem and one which cannot be overcome
            readily. At the same time we have also to consider our responsibility, as a parliament
            and a government, to the people of Australia. On behalf of the people of Australia we
            have to anticipate a situation which could arise if conditions went wrong in New Guinea.
            After all, as the Leader of the Opposition
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Calwell)</inline>
                    said, in view of the proximity of New Guinea to our own shores, the
            conditions that might arise in New Guinea if there were instability and civil strife, or
            perhaps an intrusion from outside in a condition of independence, could have a very
            serious and prejudicial effect on the security of Australia.
                </para>
                <para>
                    That leads me to my next point. In my mind the real difference between the situation
            in which Great Britain or France has made a grant of independence to an African people -
            as has been done freely during the last six months when some twelve or thirteen new
            nations have been admitted to the United Nations - and a hypothetical grant of
            independence on the part of Australia to Papua and New Guinea, is that in the former
            case it was a grant giving independence to an East African or Central African country
            and although economic interests of Britain or France might be prejudiced they would not,
            by transferring sovereignty, threaten the integrity of their own metropolitan countries.
            I suggest to you,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline>
                    this situation is very
            different from that which arises in our case with regard to New Guinea. We must make
            sure that whoever takes over in New Guinea in the future is going to be friendly to us.
            We have to lead the people there to their own ultimate self-government in a friendly
            spirit and make sure that they are strong enough economically and politically to develop
            their own country so that they will have a stability which will make New Guinea a good
            neighbour to the Commonwealth of Australia.
                </para>
                <para>After all we, in this place, are members of the Commonwealth of Australia and the
            proximity of New Guinea is such that we cannot, for considerations of the defence of
            Australia in the future, allow that situation to arise where New Guinea might be in
            hostile hands. As more and more of the non-self-governing territories of the world
            receive their independence, the few that remain under the tutelage of the so-called
            colonial powers are attracting the concentrated attention of the member nations of the
            United Nations Organization, particularly where the area concerned includes trust
            territories under the supervision of the United Nations Trusteeship Council. This is the
            case in regard to Australia's Territory of Papua and New Guinea, the latter being
            under the surveillance of the Trusteeship Council. It is natural, therefore, that in
            this atmosphere, unfortunately further clouded by the tendency in the United Nations
            Organization to give automatic support to any alleged anti-colonial case, and to use
            such cases as chopping blocks irrespective of their merits, the position of New Guinea
            as a whole, including our own Territory, is attracting more and more attention from
            members of the United Nations Organization, many of whom are illqualified to express any
            opinion on the subject of human rights, and whose vote unfortunately is not based on any
            realistic or logical approach but automatically follows the bloc when anti-colonial
            matters come up.</para>
                <para>At this very moment we have that situation there and it is obvious to anybody in
            this chamber that that is the type of atmosphere in which the problem of New Guinea will
            be discussed - not on its merits but purely in the anti-colonial light. Evidence of this
            rising interest or, more properly, interference, is clearly available when some
            mischief-making press reporter looking for sensations reports such incidents as the
            recent Epinery case near Rabaul. Whether this was deliberate or not it achieved
            international cover, and it is certain that the subsequent amending story giving the
            true context of the whole situation was never promulgated. Equally unfortunate - and I
            say this almost with despair - was the ill informed and gratuitous attack on the
            Administrator, based on this misinformation by a newspaper which I have previously
            respected for its standard of ethics; and I feel certain that the editor, after mature
            reflection, will realize the grave disservice he has done to a man who has given years
            of efficient and devoted service in a position of great difficulty, and also the great
            disservice he has done through this article to his own country, which is doing so much
            for the Papuan people.</para>
                <para>My recent visit to the Territory, during which I had the opportunity to avoid the
            beaten track of the normal political runaround, has convinced1 me that Australia has
            nothing to fear from any objective critical examination of its administration of Papua
            and New Guinea. An unbiased study of the reports of members of the Trusteeship Council
            following their visits will bear this out. I think the Leader of the Opposition made
            comments similar to this. Obviously, there will be disagreement on the scale of
            expenditure, on the rate of progress and on many other details of administration; but I
            believe that we are fulfilling with care and honesty the requirements of Chapters XI.
            and XII. of the Charter of the United Nations. We should consider our achievements in
            the light of recent events in parts of Africa, where physical problems - the problems of
            geography - are nothing when compared with those of New Guinea.</para>
                <para>
                    We would be betraying our responsibility to this trust if we allowed ourselves to be
            stampeded into premature action simply because we may be faced with a criticism that we
            know is likely to be illfounded and not disinterested. To put this more specifically, I
            point out that Soviet Russia has been very strong on this subject of anti-colonialism,
            particularly in the recent remarks of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              "Khrushchev</inline>
                    in the General Assembly where he made a most immoderate and,
            I thought, ill-considered attack on anything that savoured of colonialism. If any
            country has a record of colonial suppression at the moment, it is Soviet Russia, with
            many satellite countries unable to free themselves from the yoke of communism. I stress
            that Soviet Russia, who is one of our most constant and unrelenting critics, has a
            vested interest in producing chaos, and she realizes that an immature and unstable
            state, both politically and economically, is ideal materia) for her to exploit.

                <para>What is really required for the social, political and economic development of the.
            Territory above all else is an atmosphere of security. Nothing could be more damaging to
            the continuity of development than the derogatory criticism of certain nations at the
            United' Nations, and the misinterpretation, which- has been given great publicity,
            of the Prime Minister's " better too- soon than too late " remarks, dragged
            from their context and given the most extreme meaning. Not only is security a prime
            requisite but there must also be a satisfactory element of inducement. In both these
            directions, members- of the Commonwealth' Parliament can play a leading' part. I
            hope that the statement of the Minister for' Territories, a- well-thought-out,
            constructive statement, will have gone a long way towards- dispelling the feeling of
            insecurity ia the minds of both Europeans- and native people in the Territory.</para>
                <para>
                    If a reasonable and1 sensible rate of progress is to be maintained, it is obvious
            that the Administration must be maintained and expanded by retaining present personnel
            and. by attracting more of the right type from Australia and from the native people tq.-
            enter service within the Territory. One obvious impression I gained, and this would be
            certainly common' to other members of this House who have recently visited the
            Territory, is that there is a very real1 sense of. uncertainty amongst members of the
            Administration, as. to their future. It will readily be appreciated that if this feeling
            is prevalent amongst the present members of the Administration, it will not be very easy
            to enlist: new officers in&gt; a. service- which, by implication, may be described as
            living on borrowed time. Again, in the professional and commercial- spheres, young
            men' or women, will not regard New Guinea as a place

            certain parts of- Africa, at this; very* moment.

                <para>
                    This, sense of. security is equally important in; the economic sphere No- doubt
            somehonorable members, opposite, particularly the mischief-making member for Hindmarsh.

                    will- refer to the levels of
            native wages in the Territory, and will burst forth in- simulated wrath about
            exploitation', much to. the. pleasure of our critics behind the iron curtain.
            However.,, to look at this, problem sensibly should not be beyond the reach of most
            members of this House. It. is a fairly elementary principle of. economics that the
            standard of living, and hence the value of wages, must be closely related to the gross
            national product, of a country, and the share of national income available for the
            provision of wages and. salaries, will rise as. production values rise;. It is
            therefore,, ridiculous at this, stage to approach the. problem of the wage structure in
            the Territory on the basis of the narrow doctrinaire Australian trade union organizer
            outlook, which seems, to be the sole mental, exercise of fortunately only a few
            gentlemen, opposite,, apart from the other condition applicable that the native artisan
            or workman,, while definitely becoming, more efficient,, requires far more supervision
            and much more time for a set task than does the average person of European descent.
            Although the stepping up of economic development, during', the last decade has been
            quite remarkable; there is opportunity for even greater development in the present
            decade;, provided inducement and security are available.
                </para>
                <para>However thorough and painstaking, our administration, has been,, particularly during
            the. last ten. years, there are obvious directions in which we can exert more effort
            provided finance, coupled with additional administrative personnel, becomes available. I
            think that all who have studied the problems of the Territory will agree that there is a
            need to increase educational' facilities, and to do this we must not. only attract
            more people with the necessary qualifications from Australia but also increase the
            availability of teachers drawn from- the indigenous people. The suggestions, which have
            been given some publicity, that the State Departmentsof Education- may be approached to
            allow members of the teaching profession to serve in New Guinea without loss of
            promotion or other benefits, is worth investigating, but at the same time it must be
            remembered that the State departments themselves are constantly facing a shortage of
            staff to deal with the. increasing numbers of children reaching school age.</para>
                <para>One of the most significant developments in the sphere of education in the Territory
            is the increased attention being given to the education of girls. It seems reasonable to
            expect that, with a generation of girls who have received education during their youth
            taking their places as mothers in the future, the influence of a higher level of culture
            in the home - I stress this point - will provide that additional spur to the formal
            education of the school without which a real advance in general enlightenment would be
            impossible. As qualified men and women of Papuan birth become available through the
            spread of education, there should be encouragement for those who wish to enter the
            Administration. I think this is a very important point and one that we should consider.
            The figures have already been given in the very useful statement of the Minister, but I
            think we should go even further. It must be realized that there are tribal problems
            which would make it difficult for a native Papuan to exert authority in certain areas in
            which a person of European descent would be accepted. But as time goes on, this will be
            overcome, and surely it is wise to train persons for administrative functions in close
            association with, and under the supervision of, competent European officers while the
            opportunity is available, so that they will be able to assume more and more
            responsibility when the appropriate time arrives. In. that connexion, I want to read a
            passage from a very good leader which appeared in the London " Times " of 14th
            July last. It was brought to- my attention by a member of the Administration in New-
            Guinea. The leader is entitled' " The Backbone " and reads -</para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Congo disaster has driven home the lesson, if driving it home were necessary,
              that the granting of independence in Africa is. not possible merely through, a.
              political act. The colonial ruler cannot just wave a wand and declare "Let there
              be in-, dependence ". The technique of preparing a country is long- and1
              complicated requiring painstaking: effort and&gt; application. The- declaration of
              independence, if. this&gt; preparatory work is neglected,, merely leads to a state of
              chaos which is neither, independence nor self-government- but anarchy, which- may welt
              be' superseded by some- form- of neo-colonialism. The preparation needs to be
              proportionately more thorough as the grant of independence is made to increasingly
              more backward peoples.</para>
                    <para>The element, more than any other, which holds a colonial territory together is the
              colonial- service, whether administrative or technical. This service used at one- time
              to be regarded, as a scaffolding to be knocked, away when independence is achieved. It
              would be more aptly described as the vertebrae, without which the newly independent
              country cannot be held together. The truth.- of this has been demonstrated time and
              again, in India, in the Sudan, in Ghana. In order to achieve a smooth transfer of
              power, the colonial service needs both to be steadily Africanized prior to
              independence, and to retain a. slowly diminishing cadre of Europeans after
              independence.</para>

            the Lowlands Agricultural Experiment Station at Keravat and other centres, such as
            Bisianumu, is not only of value to our territories but is also providing much useful
            information for the whole of the South Pacific area. I think the members of the South
            Pacific Commission would realize the importance of the work that is going on in such
            centres, and its relation to problems confronting all parts of the South Pacific area.

            association. For instance, it would appear that rubber production could be increased if

            or co-operative trading store in the Territory shows the markets available for
            Australian goods, particularly canned foods of all varieties. There are few of us who
            have not been into a co-operative store in the Territory and seen the shelves lined with
            Australian canned foods of various kinds. The importance of this market to Australian
            producers is quite obvious.</para>

                    There have been from time to time irresponsible suggestions that some of the larger
            corporate or individual concerns in Papua and New Guinea have depended for their success
            on alleged exploitation of native labour. I was particularly unimpressed with a recent
            article in a leading Melbourne journal, in which the author applauded, with little or no
            knowledge of local conditions, the provocative attitude on native wages adopted by the
            honorable member for Hindmarsh
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron).</inline>
                    The conditions of native employment in New Guinea are very complex. There is provision,
            for instance, for transport to and from the place of employment at the beginning and the
            end of a set period, usually eighteen months. The practice of limiting the period of
            employment results in serious wastage, because much time and patience have to be
            expended in the elementary training stage to make employees reasonably efficient.
            Furthermore, while the cash wage may appear to the uninformed to be rather meagre, it
            must be realized that it is accompanied by full keep for the employee, and possibly for
            members of his family, health supervision and the other benefits that go with paternal
            supervision. Having in mind the labour conditions applying in the Territory, I believe
            that the general run of employers have carried out their responsibilities to these
            primitive people with thoroughness and honesty.

                    I would like now to refer to the status of our administrative officers in the
            Territory, and in particular to that of the Administrator himself. With the exception of
            the lamentable and mischievous attack to which I referred earlier, I think that
            Brigadier Cleland's administration, which has extended for almost ten years, has
            been widely recognized as being responsible for the most pronounced and concrete
            progress in the history of Australia's association with the vast problems of the
            Territory. I believe that Australia owes a real debt of gratitude to the Administrator
            and his good wife,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Cleland,</inline>
                    for the thorough,
            imaginative and sympathetic manner in which they have both carried out the heavy
            responsibilities thrust upon them. Furthermore, I believe that the status of the
            Administrator should be given greater recognition, particularly in the eyes of the rest
            of the world, by changing the designation of the office to high commissioner. This would
            represent but a small recognition of the way in which this officer's
            responsibilities have increased, and of the extent to which they exceed those of earlier
            occupants of the post.
                </para>
                <para>I realize that the efficiency of the work of the Administrator must naturally bear
            some relation to the quality of the men and women who make up the Administration service
            generally, and in this respect I think it will be widely agreed that the interests of
            Australia and the Papuan peoples are being well served in the finest traditions. I would
            suggest that this Parliament should show practical appreciation of the work of the
            Administration by tackling the problem of providing greater security for those now
            serving and those who may be attracted to the service in later years. I would like at
            this stage also to mention the vast work that is being done by the Christian missions.</para>
                <para>The bill now before us is a genuine step forward in the task of preparing the people
            of New Guinea for the responsibility of making their democratic institutions work. It
            may, and probably will, require modification or alteration from time to time. I
            visualize the probability that in the not so very distant future the amendment suggested
            by the Opposition will be accepted as a suitable one. On this note I would like to
            conclude. I believe that Australia has nothing to fear from an objective analysis of
            what the Administration is doing in Papua and New Guinea.</para>

                    <para>.- Undoubtedly the Territory of Papua and New Guinea presents many difficulties
              and problems for the Australian Government. Having agreed on that point, I part with
              the Government, because in my opinion it has not been as active as it might have been
              in certain directions, and probably too active in others, as I will show in a moment.
              I think the United Nations Trusteeship Council is to be congratulated on prodding the
              Government and getting some activity from it, because undoubtedly if it had not been
              for the criticism of that council we would not have had this measure before us this
              evening.</para>

              nations to make a declaration indicating readiness to conclude agreements respecting
              the mandated territories under our control. We did not come reluctantly to the

                <para class="block">That statement was made in the policy speech of the Labour Party.
            There are fundamental differences. Let me tell the House of some of Labour's
            achievements, because the Government to-day, where it has followed the policy which was
            commenced by the Labour Government, claims full credit for it although in many important
            respects it has departed from the policy that was then laid down. We set out to end the
            indentured labour system. We declared our intentions, and if we had remained in
            government the indentured labour system would have ended in 1950. We abolished it
            immediately in respect of the Administration, and although the Government to-day does
            not call it an indentured labour system, it is still an objectionable contract system
            which, in most respects, is the same as that which existed before the Second World War.
            We set up a government shipping line which this Government has now destroyed and sold to
            private enterprise. We set out to reduce the hours of labour worked by the natives. They
            were working 55 and 50 hours in the respective Territories. We set out to make it a
            uniform 44 hours and forbade the working of overtime ;except in an emergency. The wages
            of the natives were 5s. .a month in one Territory .and 10s. a .month in the other. We
            increased the wages to a uniform 15s. a month. Every speaker on the Government side,
            then in Opposition, who spoke in the debate opposed the reforms which were introduced by
            the Labour Government.</para>
                <para>We -established an organization to give the natives decent health and education
            services. We were the people who established the annual conferences with mission

            they suffered from enemy action. We -provided workers' compensation for the natives
            .and we saw -that their outstanding wage claims were met. We established the Australian
            School of Pacific Administration. We allowed native labour, which had been conscripted
            in many cases by the Army for war service, to return to the villages, .and we
            established the village .councils. We established the Native Labour Department and were

                <para>I want to deal now with the question of indentured labour because I regard the
            decision which was made by the Labour Government of the day in relation to it as of the
            utmost importance. We gave the natives of the Territory an undertaking to abolish the
            indentured labour system by 1950. That undertaking has been dishonoured. In 1945 we
            abolished - or set out to abolish - the professional recruiter and indentured female
            labour. We raised the minimum age for male indentured labour from fourteen years to
            sixteen years; we reduced the period of employment from three years to one year, and we
            provided that at the end of each year of service the native had to be returned to his
            village and could not be re-engaged for a further three months. In the pre-war period in
            New Guinea the period of employment was three years and in Papua two years, but the
            natives were allowed one renewal before they returned to their village. There were
            instances of natives in New Guinea having been away from their villages for eight years.
            We set out to end that system. In fact, we abolished the indenture system completely in
            Administration labour to show we had faith in our own policy and to bear out our
            contention that our policy would work. If we had remained the Government of Australia,
            by this time there would have been no indentured native labour in the Territories.</para>

            imprisonment without the option of a fine. Previously, for being absent without leave
            from employment the natives were fined £1 which, in some instances, meant four
            month's pay and, in other instances, two months' pay. For insulting words, they
            were fined £5, and if they deserted their employment they were imprisoned for three

                    Now let me turn to the question of racial discrimination, which still exists in the
            Territory. Australia can claim credit for many good things that it has implemented in
            the Territories. I believe that Labour's record during the brief period that we had
            control of the Territories will bear comparison with the record of any other
            administration of its kind in any part of the world. There is no doubt that this
            Government has sabotaged Labour's policy. You have only to remember Colonel Murray
            who was the Administrator of the day. You would not have got a better administrator or a
            more understanding and knowledgeable man for the job than Colonel Murray. But this
            Government was not satisfied until it had got him out of his position. It put pressure
            on him because he was not prepared to reverse the policy in which he believed, or
            because he would not vary it to the extent required. Honorable members know this
            Government's attitude to racial discrimination in the Territory. I paid a visit to

            for natives. He has admitted that there are milk bars in which there is one set of
            glasses for natives and another set for Europeans. Why is not something being done to

                    Now let me turn to the question of justice. We find that a European who was

            the other hand, a native named Mus Gunafaf - I asked the Minister a question on this and
            he said, that this man had' no previous convictions, recorded against him - was
            sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment with hard labour for having stolen food-.
            Do not honorable members, think that that is an illustration of discrimination against
            natives of the Territory? There is no doubt that some people believe that there should
            be a form of European supremacy in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. I do not think
            there should be. I think we ought to be setting out to develop the country, that we
            ought to. be sending our young men to help the natives in the administration of the
            Territory. There is no reason why the unrest in the Territory Public Service that has
            been referred to by the honorable member for Corangamite

                    should exist, because when the time arrives for the natives of
            Papua and New Guinea to decide what their political future will be, and if they
            determine that they are capable of filling all the administrative positions in their own
            country, those Australians could be brought back to Australia by whatever government was
            in control at the time and absorbed into the Australian Public Service without loss of
            privileges. That would not be as difficult as some honorable members would have us
            believe.
                </para>
                <para>I am afraid that this Government is setting- out. to encourage the exploitation of
            the resources of the Territory by private capital. I think that is a wrong policy. I
            think it could lead to many difficulties for us in the long run. In my opinion, we ought
            to be pumping in government capital to help the expansion and development of the native
            co-operatives. We ought to be helping the natives to engage in every form of activity in
            the Territory. The Minister has pledged himself to protect the rights and interests of
            the minority about which he talks, but I emphasize that if self-government is to mean
            anything it cannot have any strings attached to it. It must be remembered that some day
            people who want to remain in the Territory, regardless of their colour, will be under
            the control of the government of that area and that we will have no responsibility for
            them. If Australians who are there at that time want to leave, this Government ought to
            assist them to do so.</para>
                <para>Surely we do not propose to tie ourselves to- this present slow-moving Government.
            It talks- about reviewing the situation, in- five or six years' time. Why should! it
            not be reviewed, within ai shorter, period? Things ase moving rapidly in the Territory
            of Papua and New Guinea, and we ought to have more frequent reviews. The measure, that
            is now before us meets with the support of the Opposition because it is a step forward.
            It provides for additional native representation, hutt do. not let us: pretend- to.
            ourselves that we- will, not: rapidly reach the point of time when we shall have to take
            another step forward. I do not think that time is five or six. years; ahead-. If we are
            content merely, to move along in. a leisurely fashion,, we shall, be building, up at
            great deal of difficulty for ourselves in the future.</para>
                <para>I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it should, not be solely the
            responsibility of Australia to finance the great works that are required for the
            development of the Territory. Despite the opinions expressed by some honorable members
            on the Government side, and despite their antagonism to the United Nations Organization
            and to the United Nations Trusteeship Council, I am quite satisfied that if our
            difficulties were properly explained to those organizations they would be prepared'
            to cooperate with Australia in providing the- finance necessary to bring about the
            development necessary for eventual self-government by the native peoples. Labour stands
            for that. Let us get: away from this, humbug about there being no difference between
            Labour's policy and the Government's policy in connexion with the Territory. We
            want the Territory to be developed in the interests of the natives. We want the natives
            to have the right eventually to decide their political future, and we want to give them
            that right without any strings attached to it. We believe that it will be of great
            benefit to Australia, to- have a friendly nation to our north.</para>

                        .- As a Government member, I express my appreciation of the way in which- the
              Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline>
                        approached
              this: bill. Once again, the honorable member for East Sydney
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline>
                        did not follow his- leader. For a moment,
              during his concluding remarks, I thought, he. was going to do so;, but then, as I
              understood him. he. described, some of his leader's. remarks as humbug. I can.
              understand his attitude. I know that he feels- keenly the great progress that has been
              made under -the present Minister and the present Administration, compared with that
              made, when he was Minister for External Territories. I feel that- it was a pity that
              the honorable gentleman- spent so much time in referring to the past, to 1945 in
              particular. He plays the old record too often.

                <para>The bill proposes what one might describe as a constitutional change for the
            Territory. It is an early event in the programme to give the Territory selfgovern:ment.
            The bill comes before this Parliament at a time when many people are thinking seriously
            of the problems, connected, with nations obtaining independence from former colonial
            powers and of the difficulties that the peoples of those nations encounter ia their
            attempts to establish democratic government. As all honorable members know, there is an
            unhappy state of affairs in the Congo now. Last Saturday Nigeria became an independent
            and free nation within the British Commonwealth of Nations, enjoying confidence, respect
            and co-operation as between the retiring and the incoming administrations. This is in
            contrast to and a. great improvement on what is happening in the Congo.</para>

                    said among other things that Australia
            should set a target date for what he called the liberation of New Guinea. Some, people
            both outside and within Australia say that we must hurry towards the goal of
            self-government for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea with, the same speed as that
            at which the Dutch are supposed to be moving.

                    I suppose there are a few people who disagree- with, the proposals contained in this
            bill. Indeed, I understood disagreement to be the tenor of the. remarks madethis evening
            by the Leader of the Opposition. However, the real criticism of this measure seems to be
            that, it does not go far enough quickly enough. This is a catch phrase and is easily
            said. Therefore, we should be wise to examine what the b--ll proposes to do.. First, I
            should like to say that, these proposals are not the result of sudden decisions,, as
            they were said to: be by the honorable member for East Sydney a few. minutes, ago, They
            are the result of a. great deal of work by. the Minister for Territories
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck)</inline>
                    and the officers of the Department of
            Territories and the Territory's Administration, all of whom have had a great deal of
            experience oil lTerritory. These, proposals are part of a well planned programme. Too
            many critics, of this, programme have had little experience, and in a sense too many cf
            them have just reached the stage of discovering the- Territory.

                <para>
                    For a long time, one of- the main points in this programme- which the Government has
            set itself has been the establishment of a common- electoral- roll for all adults of the
            Territory in due course. As recently as July of this year, the Minister made :.i
            statement on this matter which

                <para>
                    So it is that the Australian Government has been working in- New Guinea for the
            educational, social, economic and political advancement of its people. The first three
            of. these fields; had to be given priority in the beginning and, as you,.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline>
                    know, great progress, has been made in
            them. In working for political advancement, we see the future of all the inhabitants of
            Papua and New Guinea as the future of a single people, and this bill will make a major
            contribution towards the attainment of that objective. Secondly, I point out that one of
            the great problems in helping people with little education and social organization, and,
            by our standards, a low standard of living, to attain democracy is that their
            long-established rituals and customs often conflict with our own moral and political
            codes and our technical know-how. The native leaders and the democratic leaders must be
            given time to find a way of working and training together in order to solve these
            problems, so that the native leaders will be able to cope with the entire administration
            of their country when the time comes and they find themselves taking over complete
            control. I agree that these things must be done as quickly as possible, but I think that
            I have said sufficient to show why it is silly to set target dates for any of these
            proposals.
                </para>
                <para>I believe that the problem is complicated further by outside pressures. To a great
            degree, these pressures come from Communist countries or from those who represent
            Communist thought. These people say that target dates must be set. I believe it is true
            to say that the Communists want self-government to be given to countries like New Guinea
            before their people are ready for it and before their leaders have had sufficient
            experience, so that anarchy and confusion will follow and the young and free democratic
            government will be lost and the way made easy for the establishment of a Communist
            dictatorship.</para>

                        <para>- I am supported in this belief by the honorable member for Corangamite, though
                perhaps I have stated it in words slightly different from those which he used
                earlier this evening. This problem in New Guinea has too many of the characteristics
                of the familiar pattern of events which we have seen happen too often, especially
                during the last decade. We must not let such events be repeated in New Guinea. One
                of the reasons why I am so enthusiastic about this bill is that it contains
                important proposals that will ensure that such things do not happen in New Guinea.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>These proposals, if I may summarize them very briefly, are to increase the
            membership of the Legislative Council for the Territory, to reduce the present official
            majority, to increase the proportion of elected members and to provide, for what I
            believe is the first time, for the election by the native people themselves of native
            members. Furthermore, the present Executive Council is to be abolished and in its place
            is to be established an Administrator's Council. This new council will be formed of
            both official and non-official members, and will have defined powers regarding the
            administration of the Territory.</para>
                <para>
                    As I have indicated,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, some</inline>
                    people say that
            we should copy what the Dutch are doing in West New Guinea. Before I deal with what our
            Dutch allies are doing in this regard, I should like to say that we should remember that
            Australia formulated its own programme for self-government in the Territory of Papua and
            New Guinea long before the Dutch formulated a programme for West New Guinea. In saying
            this, I do not intend to be critical of the Dutch. I am only stating the facts. I
            believe that it would be true to say that the Dutch got down to their present programme
            only about four years ago. As you,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, know,</inline>
                    we
            laid the foundations of our programme years earlier and indeed had already done quite a
            lot of work, especially in the fields of health and social and educational organization.
                </para>
                <para>Secondly, it is generally believed that the Dutch, for their own reasons, want to
            get out of New Guinea as soon as possible, having regard to their own special
            responsibilities in that area. Thirdly, and quite understandably, the Dutch
            constitutional requirements are different from ours. In the time available to individual
            members in this debate, it is not possible to go into any great detail, but I should
            like to summarize some of the requirements and objectives of the Dutch in West New
            Guinea to prove my point, having in mind the summary that I have already given of what
            we have done in the Territory and the proposals contained in the bill. I shall quote
            from a paper which I have concerning proposals of the Netherlands Government for the
            creation of a New Guinea council for Netherlands New Guinea. Dealing with the present
            administration of Netherlands New Guinea, the paper reads as follows: -</para>

                establish in these districts independent communities with their own district

                    you can see the difference between the

            without criticism, that the Dutch constitutional requirements are different from our
            own. Earlier in my remarks I gave other reasons for the impractibility of our following
            the Dutch. In many senses they have followed us because we established our programme
            much earlier and it has obviously been a success.
                </para>
                <para>While 1 am giving examples, I think I should briefly emphasize how advantageous it
            has been to other countries to go through this process of gaining self-government and
            independence, after having been governed by a former colonial power. I cite, for
            instance. Malaya and India. I have already mentioned Nigeria as the most recent example.
            Under the wise administration of the colonizing power, the British, these countries
            gradually received self-government and because of the training, instruction, and
            experience gained by the native public servants the change in the form of government has
            been without violence. There has been confidence, respect and co-operation on both
            sides.</para>
                <para>
                    If you compare that happy state of affairs with what happened in Indonesia where
            there was distrust and fighting, and with what happened in Indo-China and Viet Nam where
            there was hatred and fighting between the Viet Namese and the French, you will see
            immediately how fortunate we have been in association with our British cousins, in
            colonial administration, and how we have set ourselves what I believe to be the right
            programme in order to meet our own responsibility in the Territory of Papua and New
            Guinea. I feel that I have not mentioned quite a number of other things which are of
            importance and which could be included in this debate, enlarged as it has been at the
            suggestion of the Minister for Territories and with the agreement of the Leader of the
            Opposition
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell).</inline>
                </para>
                <para>I have not mentioned, as the Leader of the Opposition did in his opening remarks,
            the importance of New Guinea to Australia as our nearest neighbour but I. hope that my
            remarks have conveyed to the House my belief in these important matters. I summarize
            what I have said by saying this: We, the Commonwealth of Australia, through our
            Minister, through the officers of the department, and through the Administration, have
            set our own special target - not a target date, but our own target - for the building of
            a racial composite society in Papua and New Guinea where, if there is a class
            difference, it will be a difference of ability and not of race. The theory that the mass
            must come up first and that we must not help advance the few is a denial of the right of
            the people to produce leadership and, in fact, of any leadership that they may have
            produced already.</para>

                        the excellent speech
              made by the honorable member for East Sydney
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Ward)</inline>
                        tonight gave to the Commonwealth of Australia, for the very first
              time, the full story of Labour's magnificent achievements in New Guinea after the
              resumption of civil administration in 1945. I believe that it was fitting that the
              honorable member should have been the one to tell the story because it was he who, as
              Minister for Territories, was responsible for giving effect to the advice that was
              available to him and which is still available to this Government although it does not
              seem prepared to act upon it. The honorable member for East Sydney,as Minister for
              Territories, was courageous enough, energetic enough, and dynamic enough, to be able to
              implement recommendations thatwere made to himby his advisers. He had enough common
              sense to be able to sift the grain from : the chaff and to decide what advice should
              be accepted and what should be rejected.
                    </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>There is no doubt, as the honorable member for East Sydney said in his speech, that
            this Government is acting now only because of pressure of world opinion.It is not acting
            as a consequence of any genuine desire to help the indigenous people of New Guinea. It
            is acting only because of rapidly changing world opinion. It is acting half-heartedly
            but we support it because, at least, it is taking a step forward and any step forward,
            no matter how slow or short, is preferable toremaining in the almost static position it
            has occupied for the last eleven years. It is : true that the Government atlong last -
            long after everybody else noticed it - has discerned the winds of change. Perhaps the
            Government discerned these winds earlier than we imagine, but it was not prepared to act
            until otherevents took place, among them the decision of the Dutch to get out of West
            New Guinea. That decision has itself created pressures from within the United Nations
            Trusteeship Council which have forced the Government's hand and made it at last do
            something - because thereport of the United Nations Trusteeship mission that
            investigatedour stewardship of iNew Guinea was not a very happy one for us. It was not
            something of which we could be very proud.</para>
                <para>I congratulate the honorable member for East Sydney for the excellent point he made
            when he commended the action of the Trusteeship Council in directing the attention of the
            United Nations to the slowmoving attitude of this Government towards lifting the
            educational, political and social standards of the indigenous population of New Guinea.
            There are many people, among them scientists and great writers, who are of the opinion
            that the coloured races will very shortly - I do not mean to-morrow 'morning, but
            very shortly in termsof history - dominate She world scene. The coloured raoes already
            outnumber toy many hundred -of millions the white -peoples of the world. Through the
            advancement of China and other Asian countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and
            Japan, andnow through the emergence of the numerous African States, we find that the
            coloured peoples not only -outnumber us in population but that gradually, though at an
            increasing Tate, they are catching up with us militarily. Indeed, the day may not be far
            distant when they will outstrip the influence of the western half of the white races at
            any rate on the councils of the United Nations. It is pretty fair to assume that by next
            year the Afro-Asian bloc, together with the Soviet bloc, will have a majority of votes
            on 'the Trusteeship Council. And it will nol be very many years after that when the
            nations of the Afro-Asian bloc will have a majority of votes in rthe General Assembly
            and the Trusteeship Council in their own right without the Soviet bloc.</para>
                <para>So that is our situation. It is a position that we cannot afford to ignore. I said
            that this Government cannot plead that it has not had advice on which to operate. The
            Government has had plenty of advice. It has had good advice, but it refuses to accept
            that advice tendered by its advisers when it cuts across the interests of foreign entre
            preneurs like Burns Philp, Lever Brothers, Collier Watson, W. R. 'Carpenter, wealthy
            planters and other people who have invested money in New Guinea for no other purpose
            than to get rich quick They are not there for the benefit of the native people. They are
            there for the sole purpose of doing what investors in other colonial areas in the
            worlddo - of exploiting the natural resources of the country and exploiting the native
            peoples by using them for cheap labour. It is of no use for anybody to say that there is
            no exploitation of natural resources. Look at what the Bulolo Gold. Dredging Company
            Limited has done to the Bulolo Valley, one of the most magnificent valleys in New
            Guinea. It has turned it into something like the Gobi Desert. That company has churnedup
            thousands of acres of magnificent valley country. It has dug down 80 feet in order to
            pull up great gibbers and boulders the size of a man. It has thrown down, to 60 or 70
            feet below the surface, the beautiful rich topsoil that wasthere.</para>
                <para>The value of the goldextracted from the Bulolo Valley would not half compensate for
            the permanent damage that. that, company has', done- to that: magnificent valley. Is
            not' that, exploitation* of natural resources? Is it not exploitation, of the native
            people when they had tO' work' for five- bob' a month, which was the case
            until the honorable member for East' Sydney stepped: in and' stopped it? Is it
            not exploitation of native labour when now; after eleven years in office - and after the
            Labour Government* had stepped in- to begin a- reversal of the previous policy -
            this' Government still only pays- 6s. 3d. a week and single rations- to people who
            have only their labour to sell? If that is- not exploitation of cheap native labour I
            should" like to know what it is.</para>
                <para>Let me direct attention to some of the reports; that this Government, has had to
            guide it. A report was tendered to the Labour Government by General Blamey
            at the time of the resumption, of civil administration in New Guinea. He pointed out
            that one of the essential things to do in New Guinea was to establish native land
            settlements and co-operative schemes of various kinds for the growing,
            milling and marketing of cash crops. It is true that the Labour Government
            was not in office long enough after the resumption of civil administration in order
            to implement the recommendations made to it; but this Government has been in office
            for eleven years, and when one hears the story told by the honorable member for
            East Sydney and compares what the Labour Government was able to achieve in
            the short space of four years between the resumption of civil administration in
            1945 and its defeat in 1949, with what this Government has achieved in eleven
            years, one sees the great contrast between the two governments. Do not forget that
            when we re-established civil administration in New Guinea in 1945 we did so in
            a country that had been so ravaged by war that £70,000,000 was paid out in
            compensation for war damage done by the Japs. The whole of the native village
            life had been uprooted and disrupted and civil administration had completely
            collapsed.</para>
                <para>Not only has this Government had the benefit of the magnificent advice
            tendered by the advisers of the Chifleys Government advisers who were specially
            appointed by that Government in order to assist it to implement sensible means
            of developing the Territory - but it has also had the report of the royal
            commissioner Mr. J.D. Barry,. K.C., as he then was, who is now a judge of the
            Victorian Supreme Court. Mr. Barry sat as a
            royal commissioner to inquire into the collapse of Civil Administration in
            New Guinea. This Government, I dare say, has never even looked at that report. If it
            cared to examine the report it would see therein an explanation of some of the reasons
            why we have bottlenecks occurring in relation to government policy and
            its implementation, on both the ministerial and the administrative levels.</para>
                <para>There was also a Cabinet sub-committee: which inquired into New Guinea. This
            too&gt; was appointed by the* Chifley Government to make a special investigation into
            the problems of the Territory. It met and' later brought down a report: which
            this" Government has at its disposal, and which it could examine if if cared to do
            so. That report has been, completely ignored by the Government.</para>
                <para>
                    The. Chifley Government also appointed an economic, planning committee to inquire-
            into New Guinea's economic problems.: It- sat for months- and. brought down a
            voluminous: and- magnificent report.. Among other, things it recommended the
            construction of roads and airstrips;, and inr particular it directed attention to the
            need for the construction, of a. road from Mount- Hagen- to Madang. Had that road been,
            constructed: as recommended by that economic planning committee in- I947 it would have
            been, there to enable- the produce of the highlands to be transported easily and cheaply
            to the coast. One of the greatest impediments to' the development of New Guinea: is
            that the* only means, of get,ting:produce from the highlands to the- coast, is. air
            transport, which- is; not completely reliables Mrc. Tom Ellis,, the commissioner, at
            Mount- Hagen;, has told mec that there has been
                    <inline font-style="italic">as</inline>
                    route, surveyed from: Mount Hagen-: down to; Madang! and that he is in the- eour.se,
            or,- shortly, will be,, of surveying' another^ - evens shorter - route-: from* Mount
            Hagen &lt;down to Madang. This- Government has&gt; been- in- office' eleven- years
            and has not yet?., done a' single' things towards ' implementing that parti,
            of; the economic' planning- committee's report. Then- we* have a report that was
            tendered to the Prime Minister of the day by Colonel J. K. Murray, in which he made
            excellent recommendations to that government which, unfortunately, was not there long
            enough to implement them. But this Government has been there for eleven years, and I
            venture to say that the Minister for Territories
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Hasluck)</inline>
                    has not yet looked at the report tendered by Colonel Murray to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline>
                    in 1947. This, then, gives the answer
            to those who say the Government is lacking in advice. It is not lacking in advice or
            recommendations, but is lacking in initiative and the will to disturb the privileged
            position that is enjoyed by the planters and the foreign investors in that country.
                </para>
                <para>I believe that our children and our grandchildren will either praise or curse our
            names according to whether or not we are at this time prepared to face realities and
            show a willingness to help the New Guinea natives attain self-government for
            self-government's sake, or merely to perpetuate the present position of exploitation
            by foreign investors. The Congo is an example of where socialist pressure on the Belgian
            Government forced it to give self-government to the people of the Congo. But the wealthy
            investors with money invested in the Congo decided they would not be beaten so easily.
            So they created chaos by getting out of the country before the native people were ready
            and able to govern themselves, believing that their interests could be safeguarded by
            armed forces sent into the country under the guise of restoring order; and incidentally
            that is one of the difficulties and dangers that face us in New Guinea also,</para>
                <para>I disagree - and this might seem odd to honorable, members on the Government side
            who heard the beginning of my speech - with those people who say we ought to set a
            target date for giving self-government to New Guinea and that on that date - no later
            and presumably not earlier than the ring around a date on the calendar - we should give
            the Territory self-government. Nothing could be more stupid, more absurd, more dangerous
            or more damaging to the native people of New Guinea than to say that on such-and-such a
            date they are to look after themselves, because if on that date they were not ready to
            govern them selves a greater form of exploitation than is now going on would take the
            place of the existing system. It is true that this Government, with all its faults, has
            not been game to alter some of the decisions taken by the previous Chifley Government;
            and it was the decisions of that Government, to which I have referred, that have
            prevented the exploitation of the natives to an even greater extent than is now the
            case. Give New Guinea natives self-government before they are ready for it and the
            exploiters will move in and become the government of New Guinea, and not the native
            people, as we fondly imagine will be the case when we give them self-government.</para>
                <para>
                    Let us not fool ourselves that self-government means that there will be government of
            the native people, by the native people and for the native people. It means nothing of
            the kind. The granting of self-government before they are ready for it means that we are
            simply handing the primitive indigenous native people over to even greater exploiters
            than those who are there at the present time. For that reason it is nonsense to talk
            about target dates. I am sorry if I have to disagree with my good friend, the honorable
            member for East Sydney
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline>
                    who, being a good
            friend, is one of those people who can agree to disagree with me on a point like this.
            It is a matter of opinion and the honorable member may eventually be proved to be right
            when he insists that there ought to be a target date set. He certainly knows as much
            about New Guinea as does anybody else in this chamber but I, as one who has been to New
            Guinea and seen it - and not posing as a greater authority on it than the honorable
            member for East Sydney - believe that to set a target date would be damaging to the
            people of New Guinea.
                </para>
                <para>
                    We have to remember that here there is a people numbering 1,800,000, who speak SOO
            different languages, not dialects; and that one language is as different from the next
            as Eskimo is from Chinese - and only the Leader of the Opposition
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline>
                    would really know the difference between
            Chinese and Eskimo - but the difference is great. Just as we have 500 different
            languages in New Guinea, so we have as many different tribal customs or religions, if
            one can call them religions, and as many different kinds of taboos or ideas which are
            peculiar to the particular language group. What we need to understand is that deep down
            under these differences in language and custom, are tribal hatreds which go back for
            centuries - centuries of tribal hatred built on wifestealing, pig-stealing and
            land-stealing, and those three things are going on in New Guinea to-day. Land-stealing
            by the whites is still going on. I said " land-stealing ", but perhaps I ought
            to qualify that. The Government, to its credit, does not compulsorily acquire land from
            the natives. It does buy land and there are instances where it buys land from natives
            who do not really understand that in selling it they are giving it up for ever, never to
            have it again.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Before we talk about target dates we must first of all understand what are the
            elementary requirements of self-government. Education, of course, is one of them; an
            understanding of administering government is another, whilst an understanding of law and
            order is yet another. Until the people have those things it is silly to talk about
            giving them self-government at all. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam),</inline>
                    who said that he does not think the
            people of the Gazelle Peninsula should be made to wait for the benefits of
            self-government until the last primitive native in the Sepik Valley learns to govern
            himself. I think self-government should be a creeping thing, creeping over the country
            as and when the people are able to govern themselves through the native council system,
            and exercising their votes in the Legislative Council. What I would do is to accelerate
            the speed at which the native people are given the native council system of government.
            There are only 240,000 natives working under the native council system of government in
            New Guinea after eleven years of government by this Administration; and yet the native
            council system was introduced by the Chifley Government in 1949. It is true that that
            government was not in office long enough to implement the system, but in eleven years of
            the present Administration it seems to me to be very slow progress indeed for this
            country to have to admit that we now have only 240,000 natives under the native council
            system of government.
                </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition and I saw instances where native people from the
            villages had come to the Administration officers and pleaded with them for the right to
            be taxed and to have their native council system. Why should native people who want the
            native council system have to plead with the Administration to be given that first step
            towards self-government? I believe that the Leader of the Opposition has established a
            great precedent to-night in outlining the amendment he has intimated he will move at the
            committee stage, to the effect that this bill which is now before the House, though it
            represents great advancement in many directions - and for that reason the Opposition
            supports it - should be amended so that every adult person living in New Guinea, whether
            European or native, whether male or female, whether educated native or uneducated
            native, shall, as a fundamental human right in accordance with the universal declaration
            of human rights, have the right to vote and to be enrolled for voting purposes. This
            Government has no right to reject the proposal that the Leader of the Opposition has put
            forward. It has no right, in the face of the Declaration of Human Rights and of the
            debate which is now going on in the United Nations, to reject this proposal by the
            Leader of the Opposition, which is the first major step towards real self-government.</para>
                <para>What we have to have in self-government of any kind is a universal franchise; that
            is No. 1 requisite. Then there is the right of the parliament that is elected by that
            universal franchise to determine the whole of the policies or laws of the land. As I
            said earlier, we cannot as yet give to the Legislative Council in New Guinea full and
            complete power to make the laws, because that would be dangerous for the reasons that I
            have indicated. I think, however, that the native council system of elections has one
            serious defect, and that is the use of the whisper system. Under the existing system, as
            each native registers his vote, he whispers the name of the candidate he chooses in the
            ear of the returning officer. I believe that we should do as a missionary at Rabaul told
            me he has been recommending for some time, and that is introduce what is known as the
            symbol system. Though the natives cannot read or write, they can be given a ballot-paper
            bearing a symbol corresponding to the name of the candidate. They place a cross
            alongside the symbol that corresponds to the name of the candidate they favour. This
            would be a secret system, the votes could be counted and scrutinized, and it would guard
            against any corruption.</para>
                <para>Inow wish to mention a matter that represents only : my personal view; my party has
            not expressed an opinion on it. My view is that instead of -having six districts, we
            should have fifteendistricts because there are already fifteen administrative districts
            in New Guinea. Each of these fifteen administartive districts should be an electoral
            district, each returning three candidates electedunderthe proportional
            representationsystem of voting. I believe that unlessthe proportional
            representationsystem is adopted and unless we have smaller districts than thesix
            'now proposed, the native people for many years will not vote for their own people.
            Thehatreds 'built up throughcenturies of warring and bitterness will be so intense
            and deep-seatedthat in many instances the natives will prefer to vote for a white
            manthan for anative belonging to some other tribe. That, however, is a matter that can
            be adjusted as a machinery measure.</para>
                <para>One shortcoming from which I feel we suffer in New Guinea is a lack of real
            understanding of what the native people themselves want. It is not possible to go to the
            ordinary native villager andhave a conversation withhim. Very fewof them speak pidgin
            and hardly any at all speak English. In the main, we must rely upon the opinions
            expressed on their behalf by the luluais and the tul-tuls. These are the hereditary
            chiefs of the tribesand in a sensethey are the privileged people of the village. Through
            the centuries, they have enjoyed a privileged position over their fellows. J am -not
            -suggesting that : all the tul-tuls are corrupt; far from it. Mostof them believe that
            their people are entitled to a better deal than they are getting.It is true,
            (nevertheless, that, like whitepeople, likepoliticians, doctors andothers,there
            aregoodandbad among them.Ioften wonderwhethertheopinionsexpressed by some of the
            luluaison behalfof thenative people are in fact a genuine expression of native opinion.
            I do not blame the Government for using the influence of the luluais to secure
            acceptance of ourconception of law and order. This is surely preferable to the forcing
            of our conception of law andorder upon them at the point of a -bayonet. This only causes
            thekind of bloodshed that has characterized the acceptance of the white man's law
            and order in so many other parts of the world. All Isay is that weought not to hang on
            to the luluai system of government any longer than is absolutely necessary.</para>
                <para>In the timeI have at my disposal, I cannot deal with all the points I should like to
            raise. However, I think that one of the great needs in New Guinea is to develop amongst
            the native people greater wants than they now have. The trouble with New Guinea is that
            the -wants of most of the native people are so meagre and so primitivethat they are
            quite happy to sit in the shade of a banana tree while their Marys growsweet potato
            andother crops which they sell at the market twice a week for a few shillings. This
            meets their needs at the moment, because they know no different. We must develop greater
            wants in the minds of these people and teach themto want such things as (bicycles,
            sewing machines and transistor -wireless : sets. These arethree things that the native
            people like : and will do anything to get once they learn the value of them and once
            they see them in use. Ifthese wants were encouraged, wewould find that there would then
            be generated a greater incentive in the minds of the native people to want to get on, to
            want to get more valueout of their land, and to adopt better systems of growing cash
            crops. If thecash crop system of livelihoodwere developed, the natives then would not be
            willing to workfor the white man for a miserable 6s. 3d. a week. There is no doubt that
            many planters and others in New Guineato-day, thinking of selling out, are asking prices
            for plantations that do not represent thetrue priceof the plantation itself. To put it
            -starkly, 'they are capitalizingon the cheap labour available.</para>
                <para>
                    If I hadmyway, I would develop the natives : to such apoint by the use of
            cooperatives that they would not have to
                    <inline font-style="italic">work</inline>
                    for
            white peopleat such a miserable rate of pay. They would be in the position of being able to
            enjoy a farbetter livelihood working for themselves than they are mow able to enjoy
            working for the white man. 1 believe that the cheap wage rates and the rotten working
            conditions of the unfortunate nativepeople are unfairto the Australian manufacturersof
            plywood and growers of such products as peanutsand passionfruit. How can plywood
            factories in Australia compete against the lowrates paid by the Bulolo timber -mill,
            which produces plywood more cheaply thanwe can produce it on the mainland with our rates
            of pay? The contract system, to which the honorable . member for East Sydney referred,
            ought to be wiped out. Why should a native be compelled to sign on for two years and to
            leave his wife and family, never to return to them, until the expiration of the two
            years? Why should a native not be employed by the week, just as other persons are
            employed, able to leave on a week's notice and able to be dismissed on a week's
            notice, if necessary?

                        .- After listening to two members of the Opposition, I can easily understand why
              they are in opposition. First, we had the honorable member for East Sydney
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline>
                        who spent a considerable time telling us
              about what happened yesterday and what happened wayback in 1946. I personally am not
              interested in what happened yesterday; I am interested, as I am sure the Government is
              interested, in what is about to happen to-morrow. I suggest to the honorable member
              for East Sydney that if he concentrates on what is happening to-day and what may
              happen to-morrow, he will be in a better position than he is in to-day.

                <para>
                    A few minutes ago, we heard the speech of the honorable member for Hindmarsh
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron).</inline>
                    I am afraid that I disagree with all
            of his ideas on New Guinea. In the concluding part of his speech he referred to
            capitalizing on cheap labour. I venture to say that there is no such thing ascheap
            labour in New Guinea. The honorable member seems to forget that there isa difference
            between Shequality of labour to be found in NewGuineaand the labourto
                    <inline font-style="italic">be found</inline>
                    in Australia. The native people are not educated
            to work as the average Australian is. They are not used to it. They are used to living
            more or less from hand to mouth, day to day. They are not interested incontinuing their
            employment from day to day.
                </para>
                <para class="block">Let me say at the outset that this bill is one of the most important
            pieces of legislation concerning New Guinea, and affecting its future, evertohave been
            introduced in this House. I might go further and say that what is contemplated by this
            legislation exceeds all our expectations. Until now the Legislative Council for the
            Territory hashad three appointed native members, 'but when this bill becomes
            effective it will have not less than eleven native members of out 22 non-official
            members. There will also be, of course, the fifteen official members. When I had the
            privilege of visiting the Territory recently I heard much talk about the Legislative
            Council. As there are only three white elected members, they naturally have a very small
            voice, and 'this has caused some concern amongst the white residents of the
            Territory. They haveasked for morenon-official members. They do not necessarily want the
            non-official members to constitute a majority, but they want them to be numerous enough
            to exercise some influence in the council.</para>
                <para>A good deal has been said to-night about a common roll for natives and whites. No
            doubt this is the objective of the Government, but I believe it is almost an
            impossibility at this stage. There are many thousands of natives who have not even a
            recognized name. They may perhaps be known by the village in which they live. It is out
            of the question that those natives should be on the same roll as other residents of the
            Territory. In places like Port Moresby, Madang, Lae, Rabaul and some other towns, there
            would be some natives who have been in close touch with civilization, if I may put it
            that way, and who would be in a position to accept greater responsibilities than other
            natives. It is difficult, however, to place those natives on a common roll with white
            settlers while excluding the other natives. For these reasons I believe that the time is
            not ripe for the indigenous people to share a common roll with white settlers in the
            Territory. I agree with the Minister that although the natives are very primitive, they
            can, perhaps, show the whites a point or two in the way of loyalty to their leaders.
            When they appoint a luluai they have full confidence in him, and the loyalty that they
            show to him could prove an object lesson to others.</para>
                <para>This bill is an important forward move towards self-government in the Territory of
            Papua and New Guinea. When one studies the operations of local councils in the Territory
            one can appreciate the potential of the native people. No doubt they have a long way to
            go in the matter of education, but they are achieving a good measure of success in
            controlling their own respective areas through their local councils. I think it was the
            honorable member for Hindmarsh who said that the natives are eager to come forward and
            pay taxes. This indicates that they have accepted a full measure of responsibility in
            the task of improving their various districts. But while they have shown themselves to
            be effective in controlling the indigenous people in their various districts, these
            local councils still need guidance.</para>
                <para>The main problem, I believe, is that of education. In the Territory of Papua and New
            Guinea there is a population of just on 2,000,000 people. It is estimated that there are
            about 650,000 children. I say that this number is estimated, because it is very
            difficult to decide who should be classed as a child. The natives have no idea how old
            they are and an estimate must be made from their general appearance. Of these 650,000
            children fewer than one-third are receiving any form of education. About 50,000 attend
            registered and recognized schools. About 140,000 are attending various types of schools
            which are, unfortunately, not recognized schools, and which, I believe, are doing very
            little to educate the children effectively and so assist the future development of the
            Territory. I realize that they are giving the children some acquaintance with a form of
            civilization, but as far as educating them to our standards is concerned they leave a
            lot to be desired. The proportion of children receiving real education is very small.
            About 54,000 are being educated in recognized' schools out of a total of about
            650,000.</para>
                <para>Of the 50,000 odd who attend these recognized schools, a high proportion will not be
            satisfactorily educated. These people are not brought up with the idea that attendance
            at school is necessary. They go to a school when they feel like it, and if their parents
            want a bit of assistance they do not hesitate to stay away from school. Naturally, the
            results from the education angle are not very satisfactory. There is a risk that, even
            after a few years, the children will drift back to their native villages and environment
            and that the educaiton they have received will be almost completely wasted. One must
            remember that for New Guinea to have self-government, a very high standard of education
            will be needed. The responsibility of governing such a country could possibly be just as
            great as that of governing Australia, because in New Guinea are many thousands of
            indigenous people whom it is more difficult to look after than educated people.</para>
                <para>The standard of schools in New Guinea is at present not very high; that is only to
            toe expected. It will be many years before the standard can be expected to be high.
            Looking back over a life span, most people readily agree that a very high education is
            not gained in primary schools. The most important education is received after moving
            into the fields of secondary or tertiary education, or even after leaving school. We
            have heard it said that it is not until after going to work that one starts to knuckle
            down and learn. To my way of thinking, the people of New Guinea do not really know what
            education means. While only some children are receiving education and there is a risk
            that these will revert more or less to their primitive state, it will be a long time
            before there will be sufficient native people to accept the responsibility of
            self-government. The immediate background of those whom we are educating to-day is such
            that they could not carry the responsibility. Even with an increase in their numbers it
            will be generations before we will have sufficient for complete self-government. In
            other words, the children of the present children may have a chance. To my way of
            thinking, the children of to-day will have no chance of achieving effective
            self-government.</para>
                <para>
                    The future of New Guinea depends on many things. There are many bridges to cross.
            The most important of these is education, and the major requirement is time. Then there
            is the economic angle. To-day we see greater advancement in New Guinea than we saw a few
            years ago. There have been big improvements in the various industries. Unfortunately,
            the cost of development that is needed would far exceed the money that would be
            available if we gave independence to the people. I repeat that Australia has a very
            great responsibility from a financial angle. We have many obligations. I do not agree
            with the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Calwell)</inline>
                    some weeks ago that it was time we received outside financial
            assistance. This would be one of the most dangerous courses that we could adopt. If we
            received finance from outside, we would be obliged to receive advice from outside. Other
            countries have their own ideas about the future of New Guinea and Australia would be in
            a very precarious position. Many Communist countries would like Australia to give
            self determination to New Guinea at a very early stage, possibly hoping that after a very
            short period the natives would realize that they could not carry on financially and
            would then listen to the highest bidder. The western Powers could then well be the
            losers.
                </para>
                <para>I believe that New Guinea is one of Australia's most vital concerns. There is no
            doubt that we have many problems in the development of Australia but while New Guinea in
            its primitive state will be a financial burden I still think that we should give its
            development one of our highest priorities. This bill could be said to be a commencement
            towards the all-important goal of self-government for the native people. I should like
            to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister and the Government upon the
            measure. I am sure that the bill will receive the approval of all Government supporters
            and a mighty big percentage of honorable members opposite.</para>
