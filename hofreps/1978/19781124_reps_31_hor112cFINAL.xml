          <para class="block">I intend to raise in the public interest eight serious questions in relation to the conduct of this senior Minister of the Fraser Government, the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair).</inline> I hope I have time to cover all eight serious questions. The first is: Why is it that 34 months after he has taken virtually sole control of his family financial affairs- that is, almost three yearsthere has been no satisfactory explanation in response to the grave charges, made against him in the public arena, about those family affairs? Indeed, it is now over IS months- nearly 16 months- since the suspicions surrounding these bizarre activities came to light. On 12 August 1977 the Minister issued a Press release which in part stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It has been reported that there is a deficiency of more than $250,000 in company funds. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Press statement went on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There are no amounts outstanding which have not been accounted for within the company or between the shareholders. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In the light of unfolding events, what an extraordinarily misleading statement to make. If no amounts were outstanding on 12 August 1977, nearly 16 months ago, why on earth have not this House and the people of Australia been given the courtesy of a comprehensive statement by this Minister? It should have been easy for this to be done if there were no amounts outstanding. Of course, if there was nothing to explain, why on earth have we not had that put before us. Of course, that was a misleading statement. There is much to explain. The only purpose of such a statement was to mislead the people and to mislead this Parliament. Not only were these amounts of over $250,000 outstanding but in the same Press statement the Minister went further in seeking to mislead by suggesting that he was not a shareholder in the companies concerned. That was another attempt to mislead. </para>
          <para>I come to the second question: Why were these misleading statements made? The statement made on 12 August was only one of the misleading statements. There was the now infamous <inline font-style="italic">Willesee at Seven</inline> interview on IS August and screened on that day, and the answers to the former Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament on 4 October 1977. When questioned by Mike Willesee, the Minister said of the accounts filed with the annual returns: </para>

          <para class="block">This is an incorrect statement and a most regrettable misleading statement coming from a Minister of the Crown who was admitted to the New South Wales Bar and has said himself that he has had experience in accountancy in his father&#39;s accountancy firm and considerable experience as a director and principal accounting officer of companies incorporated under New South Wales law. He knows that companies, even though they may be exempt proprietary companies, still remain subject to the application of the Companies Act as administered in New South Wales by the Corporate Affairs Commission. He knows this. The continuing suggestion that there has been impropriety in the administration of the companies- this is public evidence from the twice amended annual company returns lodged with the Corporate Affairs Commission- reflects on the administration of the Companies Act by that Commission. </para>
          <para>The companies, being juridical persons, can only speak through physical persons. So far, this senior Minister of the Fraser Government has spoken on his own behalf but no one has spoken on behalf of the companies. If this is so, the New South Wales Attorney-General must defend these creatures of the law. He has been doing so through an inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane.</inline> I do not anticipate the results of the inquiry. I do not use in this debate any evidence from that inquiry. I use only public evidence that is in the Press releases and the newspapers of this country. Such a public inquiry is vital. What explanations have been given by the Minister for Primary Industry cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The idea of the </para>
          <para>Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that the inquiry should be terminated is monstrous. It must be rejected. In the interests of justice and propriety, such a suggestion should be rejected soundly. A further misleading statement has been made. I refer to a reply in this House on 4 October to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the then Leader of the Opposition, in this Parliament The Minister on that occasion said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Although the company is a proprietary company; although the matter is entirely personal; although the circumstances are such that the term &#39;misappropriation&#39; has already been explained in public ... in front of television ... to the Australian people . . . this affair is exclusively the business of the shareholders of the companies, not of the Leader of the Opposition, not of the people of Australia. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This I submit again is not correct. Annual returns lodged with the Corporate Affairs Commission are very much public documents. They are filed so that they will be available to the public for scrutiny. This is demanded by the law in exchange for the privilege of creating a legal entity, a company, which is a separate juridical person from its shareholders and able to limit its liability. Towards the end of his reply in the House, the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am quite prepared to accept responsibility for those statements which I signed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Now there is doubt as to what he did sign or what was signed for him. He went on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As, for the time being, I am executor of my father&#39;s estate, I have little alternative but to exercise the responsibility that that places on me. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is correct. The Minister has no alternative but to accept that responsibility and the further responsibility that the Companies Act of any State clearly thrusts upon company officers. Let us hear no more misleading nonsense that these affairs are only private and not public or of public concern. </para>
          <para>That brings me to the third serious question which I place before this Minister. He clearly acknowledged that his father was a chartered accountant who was, at a time, an auditor of the companies. This is obvious from the twice amended returns. Section 162 (3) of the New South Wales Companies Aa states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The directors of a company shall cause to be made out and laid before the company at each annual general meeting a balance-sheet as at the end of the financial year giving a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company as at the end of the financial year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Another section of that Act states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para>When those two sections are read together the public is entitled to speculate as to whether the Minister for Primary Industry has been fulfilling his duties as a director. To make the link between the Minister&#39;s competence as a company officer and his adequacy for public office is not unfair. He himself stated in an interview on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> on 21 November that he regarded the standards he has set in this House to be the same standards as anyone would wish a person in high office to set. In the Willesee interview the Minister was asked: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Who was the employee who was paid or benefited by the money? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He answered: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That&#39;s neither your business or anybody else&#39;s out there. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister has repeatedly glossed over the misappropriation. We know that it is at least $250,000. That is what we know has been claimed under section 71 of the Act. We know that if the section 5 1 claims had been agreed to the misappropriation would have been in the order of $265,000 or more. He claimed that the companies owed as much, if not more, in loans compared with the amount &#39;borrowed&#39; by the misappropriator and said that the accounts supported his assertion. They do not support that assertion. It may be that he is aware of the identity of the employee involved. The facts demand that the borrower had an authority to sign cheques and it is extremely unlikely that the Minister canhot at least guess his identity. </para>
          <para>The third major question is: Why has not this Parliament been told about these misappropriations in greater detail? Taxation claims have been made, the public purse has lost at least $ 1 1 5,000 at 46c in the dollar company tax and if the claim is greater than $250,000 of course the loss to the public purse is greater than $1 15,000. Section 174 of the New South Wales Crimes Act is worth noting. I shall precis it: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whosoever, being a director, or officer ... of any body corporate . . . receives . . . any of the property of such body corporate . . . otherwise than in payment of a just debt, and, with intent to defraud, omits to make ... a true and sufficient entry thereof in the books ... of such body corporate . . . shall be liable to penal servitude for 14 years. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">By virtue of the words &#39;penal servitude&#39; this offence is a felony. Section 350 of the Crimes Act states that every accessory after the fact to such a felony shall be liable to penal servitude for five years. An accessory after the fact may be defined as anyone who gives any assistance whatsoever to a felon to hinder his being apprehended, tried or suffering punishment. It is possible that whoever &#39;borrowed&#39; the amount of more than $250,000 committed an offence under section 174 and anyone concealing his identity may be culpable as an accessory after the fact. However, it is worth noting that die Minister stated baldly to Willesee: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. the misappropriation is not a criminal misappropriation. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That brings me to the fourth serious question. How on earth is a misappropriation not a criminal offence? When is a misappropriation criminal and when is it not? Why have not criminal proceedings been instituted? Have we had a police investigation or do we have a phantom criminal in our midst? These are genuine questions which should have been answered long before this. </para>

              <para>- We know that in the Willesee program to which I have referred a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Creighton</inline> Walsh mentioned the person whom he thought was the culprit in this case. We believe that it is over time for the Minister to clear everybody concerned with him in this case. He has had sole control for 34 months. We know that the person who was named by Walsh is now dead. But the people of Australia are entitled to a reliable assurance that this Minister has not benefited in any way from that person&#39;s estate and that he will not benefit at least until the identity of the borrower is established. The Minister knows of the stories that are doing the rounds- the extra homes in Canberra, the houses in Woollahra, the extra properties at Bendemeer. It is time that he made a statement to this House clearing his name and clearing this subject from the Notice Paper. We too want a good old fashioned fair go. A fair go is the entitlement of this Parliament and the people of Australia as well as the Minister. If the Minister is to be allowed a fair go it is only possible if sufficient and uncontradictory information is given to this House. So far that has not been done. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I come to the fifth question. Could it be that the Minister wants to release this explanation when the Parliament is not sitting? A rumour is going around that he may be prepared to release it next week when, of course, the Parliament will not be able to question it. Is that why this House is getting up a week early, in a hurry? I believe that the Minister ought to put the statement before this Parliament. Will we have to wait until the third anniversary of this sordid affair before we know the answers? As a chartered accountant I am not without some knowledge of accounting matters. I know of no good reason why the community has had to wait 34 months for these matters to be cleared up. The Minister said almost 16 months ago that no amounts were outstanding. Rumour now has it that, as I have said, the statement is to be released soon. Why does he not release it today when we can question him before this Parliament? The question sits. Is the delay because the Minister is belatedly calling in another firm of chartered accountants? I would not object if that were so. I would welcome such a move. But it should have been done two years ago and it should not cause the postponement of an initial statement to this Parliament. I would welcome the move because I believe that justice not only has to be done but also has to be seen to be done. </para>
          <para>I do not believe that the accountant who relies for so much of his income on Sinclair clients who have taken over the family firm is in a sufficiently independent position to be seen to be giving an objective report The charge has been made that he has been seen riding around in Commonwealth cars. I believe this is the opportunity for the Minister to answer that charge. The nature of the accountant&#39;s work is such that there are many subjective decisions which must be made. It is public knowledge that an amount of $138,000 which loosely came under the heading of audit fees and accrued interest is swinging. It makes the world of difference if that amount is allowed to be treated under the heading of audit fees and accrued interest when it went from the Walsh companies to the Sinclair company or whether it is treated as a loan which is repayable and on which interest is to be paid. Subjective decisions have to be made. The accountant who makes those decisions should be seen to be independent and not be seen to be somebody who is getting the majority of his income from Sinclair clients. Everywhere one turns as one examines what is public knowledge in relation to these affairs, the more subjective decisions which benefit one family at the expense of another have to be made. Why has interest been charged only on some loans and not on others? Why has interest not been charged for the full period? That is the reason why we have to have a really independent accountant inquiring into this. </para>
          <para>That brings me to question 7. Who on earth believes that one solicitor, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Torok,</inline> can look after the interests of the disparate group of three shareholders? It is an indictment of this Minister, with his legal training, that he allows such an unethical and inequitable situation to continue. Already we have had the unedifying spectacle of one shareholder accusing the Minister of intimidation and the Minister cruelly dragging the past of that shareholder through this Parliament in an intimidatory fashion. Yet he still pretends that there is no conflict of interest. Who is there experienced in business affairs who cannot visualise the dominance of this Minister of Stateexperienced, a lawyer, accounting training,  Deputy  Leader of his party, a right honourable, for what that is worth, and apparently it is worth something to somebody, a person who has his own parliamentary colleagues accusing him - </para>

              <para>- This is just another attempt to take up my time in a debate where there is so much information to bring forward. It is totally absurd that one solicitor could cover all the disparate groups, and the Minister knows it. It is another example of his dominance over the other two groups that he is continuing with this unethical situation. With my time being what it is, I come to the final question. Why on earth has he not at least stood down during this time? The Garlands and the Witherses and the Robinsons and all the rest were bound to stand down. Of course he should have done so. </para>

            <para>-Yes, I second the motion. The whole defence of the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has been one of a faithful son doing his best with a complex estate. That is the basic defence of the Government- one of a faithful son doing his best with a complex estate. This is false, this is a deception, and it is misleading Parliament. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> said on 24 October 1978 that Ian Sinclair was the executor of his father&#39;s will and that he reported the matters of the will immediately to the Australian Taxation Office and the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission. That was untrue, and the Prime Minister knew it to be untrue, because in fact it was 18 months after the death of George Sinclair before the Minister reported on 22 September 1977. That happened because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Creighton</inline> Walsh blew the gaff on the Minister on the Willesee program on 15 August 1977. So much for openness, so much for honesty, so much for the fair play of the Minister. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not rise on matters connected with the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission investigation, I rise on matters affecting the public purse of the Commonwealth and the revenue and the Taxation Office and to dwell on this question of misappropriations. Around that and the tax rebate which has come from it is the area where the Minister is culpable. The Minister used in an amended tax return in September 1977, in an amended report to the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales, the heading &#39;Losses by Misappropriation by Persons Unnamed. That was signed by Ian Sinclair. They are not loans to shareholders, because loans to shareholders of any company would have documentation and a liability would be clearly established. They are not loans to shareholders. In the Minister&#39;s own words it is misappropriation and the document was signed by him. So there has been misappropriation. </para>
          <para>We are now told the Australian Taxation Office has paid on those misappropriations. The company has claimed the misappropriation as a deduction against income and the Commissioner of Taxation has accepted the misappropriation. So the Allan Walsh companies, of which the Minister is a major shareholder, has received a tax rebate of $115,000 on a claim of misappropriation. This issue has nothing to do with the New South Wales investigation; it has to do with the revenue of the Commonwealth. What is important is that the Minister for Primary Industry has operated the accounts for the companies concerned for some years now. He is the one who knows all about them. He has had the cheque books. He says that misappropriations occurred. In that case, who is the embezzler? The Minister must know the identity of the embezzler. If the companies have claimed misappropriations, if the Minister has signed the document of misappropriation, and if the Commissioner of Taxation has paid on those misappropriations, then the Minister must know who the embezzler is. Why has the Minister not sought action to claim the moneys back from the embezzler or to identify the embezzler? Is the Minister protecting a felon? Obviously he is. We want to know why he is doing that. </para>

              <para>- I will withdraw that statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and make this point: The Minister knows the identity of the embezzler. If funds have been misappropriated- the Minister manages the accounts of the companies- he knows who the embezzler is if, indeed, it is not himself. That is the issue before the House. The matter that the Opposition has raised is that the Prime Minister will not stand this Minister down, on the basis that no charge has been laid against him. That is not consistent with the action he took with other Ministers when he stood them down for lesser matters. He wants them either in the paddywagon or on bail before he will stand them down. That is the issue. They have to be either behind lock and key on charges or out on bail before the Prime Minister will stand them down. What is wrong with honourable members opposite? That is the issue. The Minister knows the identitity of the embezzler. We on this side of the House want to know why the Minister, as a director of the company concerned, has not sought to recover the moneys. If there has been a misappropriation, why did the Minister not seek to recover the funds? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The new factor is that the Minister is now the sole beneficiary of the probated estate. The estate was probated on 2 November this year. The Minister is now the sole beneficiary of the net estate of $107,000. Of course, part of the estate has shareholdings in the Allan Walsh group of companies, which have been the beneficiaries of rebates from the Commissioner of Taxation on misappropriations claimed as losses. These misappropriations have been made by people or persons unamed or unknown. That is the issue. Through this estate the Minister is now the direct beneficiary of rebates from the Taxation Office to the Allan Walsh group of companies, of which he is a shareholder. The estate reflects that benefit. Despite all this, the Prime Minister still will not do anything about the Minister. The Prime Minister is still waiting until the investigation in New South Wales is completed. The Prime Minister is not looking at the taxation aspects at all. </para>
          <para>So we have the ludicrous situation of not knowing who the embezzler is. A Minister of the Crown has benefited by at least $107,000, which is the net benefit from his father&#39;s probated estate, in part from funds rebated by the Australian Taxation Office on a misappropriation that might have been committed by persons associated with the probated estate. That is the situation. How can any Minister of the Crown stay a Minister of the Crown with those kinds of questions hanging over his head? The thing is that we could have the crazy situation of the thief investigating his own crime. That is the situation, and yet the Prime Minister allows it to continue. He does not intend to stand down the Minister until the investigations have been completed. </para>

              <para>- The misappropriations for the two Allan Walsh companies total $374,000- that is not some piggy bank exercise- of which $265,000 is claimed as a loss to revenue. Some people ask: &#39;Why are not the other shareholders uptight about this?&#39; The reason is that the other shareholders are the beneficiaries of the tax rebates. They cannot count on the Minister or the estate tipping money back into the company, but they can count on tax rebates coming back from the Taxation Commissioner. So, nobody is going to raise that little issue, except, of course, die person who should be in charge of the revenue, namely, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard).</inline> That is the issue involved. Now $109,000 has been claimed in the return as a misappropriation but is not claimed as a loss to revenue. I want to know why that is the case and why that claim has not been made. </para>

          <para>We on this side of the House have reasonable reason to suspect that when the crunch comes and certain documents have to be produced all of a sudden it will be revealed that they were taken in the five burglaries. Perhaps they will just disappear overnight. </para>
          <para>The issue here is that a Minister of the Crown has admitted that companies of which he is a director have had funds misappropriated. Those misappropriated funds have been claimed as a taxation loss. Yet we do not know what the view of the Taxation Commissioner is about the matter. If the Prime Minister were interested in the role played by one of his senior Ministers, he could get a report from the Taxation Commissioner on the evidence that the Commissioner has which identifies the person or persons who are unnamed in the misappropriation claim. What we would like to know is whether the Taxation Commissioner- perhaps the Treasurer can answer this question- has asked the New South Wales Police to investigate the frauds or the misappropriations. This is an unbelieveable situation. A Minister of the Crown claims from the Taxation Commissioner misappropriations in a taxation return, gets a rebate which he picks up through probate on the will of an estate. Yet he can still sit in the Parliament under the protection of the Prime Minister. The Minister has worked this very cagily in the last year. He has known about this matter since September 1977. He knew that it would be raised. He has backed in the Prime Minister at every turn of the wheel- in Cabinet, in the House and everywhere elsetrying to lock the Prime Minister on his side. Following the Prime Minister&#39;s dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and the attacks upon the Prime Minister for his disloyalty to his colleagues, he cannot afford now to stand down the Minister for Primary Industry unless he absolutely has to do that. It gets back to this issue I mentioned earlier. </para>

              <para>- I take a point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> It is well known that traditionally rulings from the chair in relation to sub judice have applied to judicial proceedings alone. When I spoke on another censure motion on this matter some days ago I made the point that an individual, whether in this Parliament or outside this Parliament, can be just as grievously damaged by matters being heard by a quasi judicial body or even by an administrative body being debated in the Parliament. I made the point that the original rules in relation to sub judice had been formed before the practice in governments of quasi judicial and administrative proceedings had developed to the point to which they have. </para>

              <para>- On this matter, some days ago, I put the point of view that if debates of this kind were occurring in relation to a person under examination by a quasi judicial body outside this Parliament, the Parliament would not allow it. I suggest that in view of the behaviour of the Opposition the time has come for precedents to be made and not necessarily followed in relation to the rules of sub judice and debates on evidence part heard, part given and part presented to this Parliament on matters of a quasi judicial nature appearing in the administrative tribunals of other governments. They should not be permitted until after the end of the inquiry. I ask you, sir, so to rule. </para>

              <para>- It is important that the House understand that the point of order that the Prime Minister is taking is one which, if upheld, would permit a Prime Minister to protect any action of the Government by merely appointing a judicial or quasi-judicial inquiry, by appointing any sort of inquiry into a matter and then demanding that the Parliament not be able to debate that particular issue. This does not meet that criterion. What the Prime Minister is seeking to do is to bring in the sub judice rule in this Parliament as a means of personal censorship available to the Government. This is not sub judice. You have already ruled on it in this debate. </para>

              <para>-I have ruled on this point of order before in which I said that the sub judice rule did not arise, because this is not a judicial inquiry. A judicial inquiry is one which finally determines rights or obligations as between people. It is not a judicial inquiry. It is an administrative process by which facts are to be elicited in order to enable some person, who is as yet unnamed, to decide whether or not action should be taken under an Act. I understand the point that is taken by the right honourable gentleman but I am not prepared to alter my ruling in relation to the sub judice rule. I give that ruling. I call on the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> to apologise to the Chair for his behaviour. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>this is all pretty heady stuff. We open die newspapers in the morning; we listen to the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> who moved this motion this morning and to the seconder of the motion; we read articles which contain accusations; we read the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> we read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly; and even this motion today and we find that charges have been made of gross impropriety, embezzlement, protecting a felon, forgery and so on down to the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> calling me a bloody crook&#39;. This attack has come out of accounts which have been publicised for 18 months. The statements that have been made all imply that the man who has been appointed by the New South Wales Attorney-General either is grossly incompetent or, in some way, is not properly going about the charge that has been imposed on him by the New South Wales Attorney-General. Accusations have been made in this place against accountants; accusations have been made in this place against solicitors; and accusations made against everybody in any way associated with this company. What is the evidence? Let me say a Little bit about that. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Before I deal with the substance of the charges made against me I point out that what concerns me is that when this matter was raised yesterday the priority it was given then was equal, I think, to the substance of the motion itself. Everybody in this place knows the order of proceedings. We have an opening procedure and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> read prayers; petitions are read and then notices are called on and we move through to Question Time. So it went yesterday. At the end of Question Time the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> gave notice that he would move that a time limit be placed on answers to questions. Still no mention was made of a censure motion concerning me. Then we went on to deal with a matter of public importance- a matter dealing with a very worthwhile initiative of this Government in reducing the cost of international air fares by my colleague, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> Finally, we came to grievances and again no mention at all was made of this censure motion. It was only after the grievance debate that honourable members opposite saw fit to raise these matters, a series of serious and very fundamental charges, involving, if one were to believe the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford),</inline> a series of criminal acts. He read out the penalties for such acts and asserted, as I understand it, that every one of those penalties should be applied against me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> not only do I rebut totally all the accusations made by him but I think he, in the manner and form of his presentation, and even to a greater degree the honourable member for Blaxland- if I can give him the benefit of that honorific title- have demonstrated that there is no substance in the accusations. </para>
          <para>What I would like to do, because the accusations are serious accusations, is turn briefly to a couple of other aspects of the matter. Unfortunately, the time available to me is even less than was available for the honourable gentleman who moved this motion. There is a very worthwhile heading in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> which I think probably epitomises the whole of the efforts of the Australian Labor </para>
          <para>Party. It was written by one of those journalists who is not exactly known for supporting the Government It reads: &#39; Parliament winds up with Labor secure in Opposition&#39;. So may it be. However what I prefer to talk about is not the Leader of the Opposition or the ABC <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Max</inline> Toichmann, who is senior lecturer in politics at Monash University, about the Leader of the Opposition. What is happening is that the Leader of the Opposition is now passing the buck and two of the more junior members of the Opposition front bench, who are showing little respect for the dignities of this House, have taken the attack unto themselves. </para>
          <para>We come to the whole question to which I want to refer. I think the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian- I</inline> am not going to read it againreferred to the fact that these matters are currently under investigation and by proceeding with the matter this way the Opposition not only is destroying the whole integrity of that special investigation but also is putting me in a position where if I answered in detail in this House the charges made against me I would again be accused for having done just that. In other words, I am in a &#39;Catch 22&#39; position. What do I do? Do I come into this House and give the detailed answers to questions that have been put to me under the so-called privacy of a special investigation? If I do so am I going to destroy that whole inquiry? How do I do it? Do I come in here and lay down my defence? I assure this House that I have responded to every question that has been put to me by the special investigator. </para>
          <para>The bank responsible for one of the subsidiary companies involved wrote to me and stated that it did not believe the investigator had a right of access into my affairs because the terms of reference of the special investigator did not embrace my personal accounts or those of my father. I wrote back and said that I waived ail privilege with respect to those documents. I have done everything I possibly can to make sure that the special investigators inquiry is pursued with the integrity that it should enjoy. Members in this House, in the Senate and in the Legislative Assembly- I think the Labor member for Illawarra is the person concerned- are doing their darndest to ensure that this inquiry is totally prejudiced in its presentation, its hearing and its consideration of evidence. If that is the way that the affairs of this House are going to be conducted I would submit that we are rapidly going about destroying the very fundamentals of democracy in this country. </para>

              <para>- Let me refer to those matters which are public and on which I can say something at this time. The honourable member suggested this morning in his sanctimonious manner that I am dealing only with evidence that has been published. Let me explain that The published accounts are accounts of private companies. Very early in the piece, on 12 August 1977- the honourable gentleman referred to it this morning- I stated: </para>

          <para class="block">The matters are on record. What has happened is that after the death of my father I appointed an accounting firm which was in fact the firm which purchased my father&#39;s chartered accountant business. That firm pursued, as I believed it should, a proper inquiry into where matters stood and what was happening. Immediately the accountants identified that amounts were outstanding they reported to me. In order to ensure that there would be completely no interference by me in the conduct of affairs at the official level, they reported the matter to the Corporate Affairs Commission and to the Taxation Commissioner. All these things that are being said about the special inquiry I think need to be seen in the light of those original reports. When the special investigation of the New South Wales Government was set up a report appeared in a publication on Sunday, 21 May 1978 which stated: </para>

At the Federal level there have been allegations that again, if one were to listen and to believe the charges laid by the Opposition, that the Taxation Commissioner has improperly applied to me concessions that are not a matter for any other taxpayer in this country.

              <para>-On 29 May the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter dated 26 May from the Commissioner of Taxation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> J. O&#39;Reilly. I do not intend to read it, but it is still pertinent because the point I seek to make is that up to that date and even now both the Corporate Affairs Commission officers and Taxation Office officers have been totally involved in the investigation into these matters. The special investigator in New South Wales has been totally involved. Not one of those people has laid any of these charges which have been bandied around in this House today. If the New South Wales police believed the things that have been said, they would have conducted an investigation. There has been ho approach to me and as far as I am aware there has been no approach to anyone acting on my behalf suggesting in any way that there is any substance in any of these charges that are being laid. Let me refer briefly to this letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Reilly</inline> to the Prime Minister. He said of the matters relating to these companies: </para>

            <para>You will note that the deduction is by law allowable in the income year in which the loss is ascertained, not in the year in which it actually occurred. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is a very important aspect of this tax claim and this censure motion to which I want to refer. My own view and the view that I advised my accountants and my solicitors was that, because I had immediately accepted responsibility for all the sums that were found to have been misdirected at the time they were found, they should be treated as loans due to me and to my family group of companies. I said that neither in the year in which they were ascertained nor in the year in which they occurred should they have been allowable. The honourable gentlemen are putting to me that they did not believe that it was the firm that bought my father&#39;s practice that could give impartial advice. It was indeed another firm, Messrs Greenwood and Challoner on whose advice the taxation returns and submission were made in respect of losses by misappropriation. In addition the firm of solicitors who acted for the companies, also said the accounts should be treated in that way. </para>
          <para>My own belief was that they should have been treated as being fully taxable right through. I said in that Willesee interview that because I had accepted that responsibility they were not misappropriated funds in the normal course. They were funds which had been directed by my father in a manner which I believe was not correct. They had been directed either to my benefit or to the benefit of others and I believe that as a result they should have been taxable and not expressed in that form. What the honourable gentlemen are saying is that members of this House and members of the community, having received professional advice, should overthrow that advice. I just do not believe that would be proper or correct. It is not just I who is involved; it is other shareholders. Having employed professional people and having been told to write the accounts in a certain way and the matters being under investigation, had I insisted on my point of view prevailing we would have finished up with a different set of accounts to the ones that the accountants themselves recommended. Is that what honourable gentlemen wish? In fact I have accepted totally the advice of the accountants and in the following year, as the honourable gentleman would know, I identified the amount as sums that are the responsibility of Sinclair Pastoral Co. By the so-called round robin of cheques. Because they are now a debt due and the responsibility of Sinclair Pastoral Co. tax is payable in the year in which they were so recouped in accordance with the advice contained in the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Reilly</inline> which was tabled in the House by the Prime Minister on 29 May. The whole of the substance of these accusations relates to matters about which naturally I am not very happy. I am disappointed that the matters have occurred as they have. There are explanations which I do not intend to give at this time for what happened as far as my father was concerned. </para>
          <para>The companies- where they are and what they are- are entirely the result of his endeavours. They are all trading normally. They do not owe money to any outside creditors. They are functioning correctly and properly. As soon as any debts occur or taxes are said to be payable they are paid. No money is owed to anybody. No member of the outside public is involved. This matter is an attempt by members of the Labor Party to try to throw muck wherever they can. Because they have no issue of substance to pursue they have moved a motion of censure against me, which I rebutt entirely. I also reject completely many of the accusations and charges that have been made, as to which I have no time to respond now in this House. On any occasion if any of those charges are laid and if I have a proper and correct chance to do so, I intend to present the evidence. </para>

He said that it certainly does not assist the investigation that is being carried out in New South Wales for Federal parliamentarians to be reading from transcripts. It is my concern that the evidence that is largely the basis for the wildest of the charges flows essentially from those transcripts. Again I want to state in the House that, in the words of the special investigator, this is a matter in which he has not as yet reached any conclusive view on any of the aspects that are before him. In terms of the special investigation there is no suggestion that there are any aspects at this stage from which any charges flow. </para>

              <para>- The honourable gentleman says that they have been made in here. With what substance have they been made? They have been made on the basis of a gross exaggeration of accounts that I have explained were presented by the accountants and not by me. Even though the honourable gentleman has made what I would regard as grossly derogatory remarks with respect to those accountants, die accounts were drawn up totally independently of me. Those accountants acted not on my instructions, but on the advice of independent accountants who gave them the basis on which the losses by misappropriation should be shown. In that respect they acted against my wish and inclination. So much for the serious public charges. </para>

          <para>I have said before that when the matters are settled I will be prepared to explain the nature of that settlement and the basis of the whole affair. Unfortunately that settlement has not yet been achieved. There is no basis in the suggestion that was made by the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> that it will be ready next week. As soon as it is ready- if it is ready next week I will be delighted- I hope to be able to comment on it. The claim that the House is rising because there will be a settlement next week is no more substantial than the other charges. The second part of the honourable gentleman&#39;s accusation concerns the justification of taxation claims and misappropriations. The reason for those taxation claims, as I have explained, is that against my personal inclination the accountants prepared the accounts, and I believe quite properly. I have in no way intervened in determining what is contained in those accounts. Had I done so I believe I would have been acting in breach of my responsibility. Indeed I would suggest that what I have done is only what anybody could do in the circumstances. I regret the circumstances that have occurred but I stand by completely the actions that I have taken in trying to ensure that there shall be a complete resolution of this whole matter. </para>

            <para>-This matter now dominates the politics of Australia. It is concerned with whether the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> will continue to allow a very senior Cabinet Minister to be treated differently from other members of the Ministry who have been dealt with by the Prime Minister over the past three years. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> is surviving, not because of bis conduct and not because of the allegations that may not have been proved; he is surviving because Reg Withers was sacked. Reg Withers is saving the Minister for Primary Industry because the Prime Minister does not dare again take the action against the Minister for Primary Industry that he took against the former Minister for Administrative Services. When one compares the offences, allegations and situations in which all the Ministers have found themselves, one would have thought that this Minister whose affairs are under discussion today in this Parliament has more hanging over his head than did the honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Garland), the right honourable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> combined. </para>
          <para>We from this side of the Parliament are entitled to ask: Why is the Prime Minister making a different decision? Obviously he has weighed up the politics of the matter and has decided that he dare not take action against the Minister for Primary Industry, in spite of all the allegations, that he took against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> because the disruption to the coalition that would be caused by that action cannot be tolerated. The Minister for Primary Industry says that he is waiting on a report from the Corporate Affairs Commission in New South Wales. That is not the point at all. That is a quite independent investigation that is being undertaken in New South Wales. As the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> has pointed out, an investigation has been going on for 34 months by the Minister&#39;s accountants. What has happened to that report? The Minister for Primary Industry signed a document in 1977 in which he stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Losses by misappropriation by persons unnamed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He signed it &#39;Ian Sinclair&#39;. Not too many people are associated with the company who could have had their hands in the till. We want to know which person it was. Was it the Minister for Primary Industry? If it was not, why does he not tell us? We gave him 22V4 minutes in which to do so. We are prepared to sit here all day. All we want to know is: Was the Minister for Primary Industry a person unnamed? He signed the document. That is all we want to know. Perhaps he has told the Prime Minister that he was not involved and perhaps that is why the Prime Minister does not take any action. But what if he tells the Prime Minister that he was involved? What if that is the result of either of these inquiries? Why has it taken 34 months? Honourable members opposite take a very peculiar stand on this matter. They say that it is no business of ours that this misappropriation became the subject of a tax rebate. Not only did someone have his hand in the till but the taxpayers of Australia had to make up the losses. We just put a surcharge on the taxpayers of Australia. What did we put on that surcharge for? To pay all the crooks who misappropriate money from their companies? Is that what we have the surcharge for? </para>
          <para>We are entitled to know on this side of the House. It is quite simple, we did not take a point of order on the Minister for Primary Industry quite deliberately. We wanted to give him all the time he had. He got up and spoke about the prayers and the end of democracy and the order of business in the Parliament, what a decent fellow he is and what terrible people we are on this side of the House. But he did not tell us how he can explain this statement Let me say it again: Losses by misappropriation by persons unnamed&#39;, signed Ian Sinclair. It is as simple as that. Is there another Ian Sinclair who we have not been told about? We took it on this side of the House that as that report was signed in 1 977, that would have been long enough to find out who had his hand in the till. One would have thought that by now the Minister for Primary Industry could come in here, as a senior Minister in the Australian Parliament, and say: &#39;It was not me. I did not receive any benefit and I am not associated with the misappropriation.&#39; We do not want to hear his views on the prayers that are said before the Parliament sits. We have all been through that and we all know it pretty well. We want to know who misappropriated the money from the companies and who got the benefit of the tax rebate. </para>
          <para>There are two very simple questions, and the Minister for Primary Industry ought to be able to tell us. We will allow him to get on his feet again if he will promise to tell us who misappropriated the money and who were the persons unnamed in 1977. Of course, the Minister for Primary Industry says that it was quite legal, that he got the rebate quite legally to the companies on losses. Of course the Taxation Commissioner pays on losses. He pays if a payroll is knocked off. He pays on all sorts of losses. But who made the misappropriation in the first place? We are quite entitled to ask that Fancy honourable members opposite having a double value on this. Can one imagine anybody on that side of the House sitting quietly and saying that it is none of his business if any one of my colleagues had been involved in this scandal? If anybody on this side of the House had been involved in this theft, this scandal, could one imagine them all sitting there and saying: &#39;It is none of our business*? They would be on their feet every day. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Primary Industry told us the last time we moved this motion that it was not important because we had not asked a question. We are asking a question today and we are going to go on asking it, as are people throughout Australia: &#39;Losses by misappropriation by persons unnamed,&#39; signed Ian Sinclair, and the taxpayers had to make up the losses. So there were two lots of people- the people who were not sharing in the misappropriation, some of the company directors, and the people who did not share in the tax rebate that was given because of the misappropriation. We are entitled to know. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister tried to shelter this whole scandal by taking a point of order for five minutes in order to limit the time given to the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating).</inline> That is how important he thinks it is to cover up. Poor old Reg Withers. I wonder what he thinks about all this? He made a telephone call - </para>

              <para>- This is relevant to the values of the Prime Minister and the way he is treating the Ministers. The members of the Liberal Party ought to look at it more seriously than anybody else because their colleagues have all been hung. The Prime Minister said he saw the report on Phil Lynch and that he did nothing wrong, but he was sacked. Eric Robinson was stood down. Garland was stood down. Reg Withers was dismissed. The Minister for Primary Industry is associated with the misappropriation of large sums of money and he is sitting there smiling because he is a member of the National Country Party. What strange values they are prepared to tolerate on that side of the House, and they say we are not to ask questions and that it is no business of the Parliament. They have got to be joking. As I said at the outset, this matter is dominating politics in Australia. People want to know what sort of values this Prime Minister has. How can he sit there day after day with a cloud hanging over the head of one of his three or four senior Ministers, a person who has been associated with this scandal right from the start? </para>

          <para>Do not worry about the investigation in New South Wales, worry about the investigation that has been set alight by the Minister through his own accountants. That has been going on for 34 months. If we are going to get the Parliament up early in order to avoid debate on this question we will never come back. That accountant must be the slowest accountant in the world. He has had 34 months to look at these books, and the matter was signed in September 1977 saying that the money had been knocked off. Honourable members opposite ought to have Darcy Dugan look at it He could tell them what has happened and he could probably tell them in five minutes who has got it. He could probably tell them why the Minister for Primary Industry is always smiling. It is an absolute joke that this matter is allowed to continue. The Minister for Primary Industry ought to explain. He ought to use the time we are prepared to give him to tell us where the money went and why this action with the Taxation Office was taken by the company. &#39;Money misappropriated by persons unnamed&#39;- let me just imprint that on the minds of honourable members. It was written by the Minister for Primary Industry in September 1977. Why is no action taken? No one is named and nothing is done. The Prime Minister puts up with it, and I finish on that note. The Prime Minister puts up with it because of Reg Withers. Poor old Reg Withers is sitting over there on the back bench of the Senate, sacked for making a phone call to the electoral commissioner of Queensland. I will tell Government members what they have to do to survive under Malcolm Fraser Join the Country Party. </para>

              <para>- The censure motion which has been put down this morning has two limbs to it. One relates to what is described as being serious public charges. We are not told who has made them, we are told that they are serious public charges. The accuser is not known to us, but they are serious public charges. That is the first limb of the censure motion. The second relates to what is described as taxation claims for misappropriations made by companies. We are not given the precise evidence to support that. I want to deal as I can within the constraints of time with both of those limbs, but I go back to the manner in which this thoroughly disgraceful proceeding started. It started with quite one of the meanest speeches ever made in this House by the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford).</inline> What he said to the House this morning was this: Let me whimper a contemptible accusation and upon that I will build a pavilion of truth. &#39; </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>What has the honourable gentleman done this morning? He has done two things- whether he is conscious of them or not I do not know. On the first hand, he has forever forfeited any claim to respect in this House for simple fealty. What is the second thing he has done this morning? He has not put on trial the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> he has put on trial the Australian Labor Party. He has put it on trial this morning because out of his mouth has come such a cataract of confession that forever we will ignore the rules of natural justice. That is the central feature of this debate. The Standing Orders, the whole catalogue of precedents that the British parliamentary system has built up, may say forever, No, this does not infringe the sub judice rule&#39;, and I will say something on that later. But the rules of natural justice are there. They bind us all in everything we do in this world, whether we like it or not, and the whole body of natural justice must revolt against this proceeding. Where was the evidence? It started with what purported to be transcript of a proceeding. There was no certificate before this House to say: &#34;This is the transcript from a proceeding being conducted by the Corporate Affairs Commissioner.&#39; A photostat copy of what purported to be a transcript was brought in here. How do we know that it was not picked up in the park? Would the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> or the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> like to have his status, his reputation, assailed on the basis of an unidentified transcript? </para>
          <para>If we make the assumption that the transcript was in fact a bona fide one, how do we know that the whole character of the man whose evidence it purports to be was not destroyed by the 20-odd witnesses? When we seek to put a man on trial, when we seek to take away his liberty, when we seek to diminish his status as a simple citizen, we do not look at one piece of evidence; we look at the whole body of evidence. How do we know how this man Creighton Walsh appeared to the Corporate Affairs Commissioner at the end of the day if 20 witnesses came in and all of them condemned him? It is as fundamental to natural justice as anything else that I can conceive that evidence which has not been cross-examined is not worth very much. We have had no opportunity to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Creighton</inline> Walsh, no opportunity to know whether he can look a person in the eye, no opportunity to know whether in fact he is telling the truth. The honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> laughs. Our people have not trudged across the centuries to build up justice for simple-minded people, malevolently minded people such as the honourable member to wash those efforts away. I am bound to say this to the honourable member for Prospect: If the Treasurer ever put a tax on brains the honourable member for Prospect would get a refund. </para>
          <para>I want my friend, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> to consider the gravity of what we are doing here today and what we have done in the past few weeks. Please, I beg of honourable members opposite, do not laugh this away. It has been the tactic of people down through the years to laugh and to scorn when high principles are put in jeopardy. Honourable members opposite will not be allowed to put these in jeopardy without complaint from me. I say this to the honourable gentleman who laughs: How would he like to be the subject of a proceeding before a man- we do not know what procedure he follows; he is hearing evidence in camera- when day after day after day there is public debate on the subject of the proceedings before that man? It would take a super effort indeed by any human being to ignore the inflammatory remarks that have been made. I suggest to all my honourable friends in this House: Surely not one of us would relish the idea of our status and our future being put in jeopardy by such a proceeding. That is the precise matter that we are deciding today. </para>
          <para>I do not know anything about the private affairs of my right honourable friend. I do not seek to know. He has stated to this House that when the inquiry is finished the results will be put before us. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has described the inquiry as a quasijudicial proceeding. Whether one accepts that or not, I do not think it greatly matters. But the primary hearing is going on and we are having a public debate in the Parliament and a debate in the newspapers. Since when is a man to be put on trial by newspapers or by Parliament? A jury decides this. That is a great principle and we cannot water that principle down without washing it away. </para>
          <para>Now I come to the matter of misappropriation, the second limb of this censure motion. What does the Opposition do with respect to that? It is not my right honourable friend &#39;s integrity which is impugned; it is the integrity of the Commissioner of Taxation. What is being said in effect is that the Commissioner of Taxation, by one means or another- by blandishment, cajolement or threat- has succumbed to the right honourable gentleman. The letter written by the Commissioner of Taxation states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As you know, the Minister has taken these matters up with my office. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Is that not a display of candour? It was not left to the Commissioner of Taxation to take up the matters. The right honourable gentleman himself went to the Commissioner of Taxation and said: &#39;Here are the facts as I see them. You give your adjudication upon them&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I want to come to the sub judice rule because I believe that it is of the greatest importance to this House today and, as I see it, for the future. With respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> agree with the ruling that you have made upon the sub judice rule, but I do say that it is within the possession of this House to create a precedent relating to the sub judice rule. I quote from page 333 of the Nineteenth Edition of May &#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice.</inline></para>
          <para>By a Resolution of the House matters awaiting or under adjudication in a criminal court or a court-martial, and matters set down for trial or otherwise brought before a civil court may not be referred to in any debate or question . . . </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane&#39;s</inline>proceeding is not criminal in character. It is not a court in the strict sense, but it is a tribunal, the adjudication of which can in a very significant way affect the right honourable gentleman concerned. In recent years we have seen a whole paraphernalia of administrative tribunals created. All of them can put at risk and can affect the status of any individual involved before them. I submit to the House that in the very near future the House should turn its attention to this matter and should seek to fill what appears to be a palpable gap. I commenced by saying that we do not know who makes the public charges which are the subject of this motion. I ask honourable gentlemen opposite: Since when is anonymity accepted as a body not merely capable of making a charge but capable of making a very severe charge, capable of making a charge which can affect in a very direct and real way the status of the right honourable Leader of the House? He is not on trial today; this House is on trial today. This House commenced today&#39;s proceedings with a very mean, very shabby proceeding. It will be a proceeding which will continue to haunt the Australian Labor Party for years to come. </para>

            <para>-I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the parliamentary career of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kenneth</inline> Ross Ingram, who joined the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff 42 years ago, closes with his retirement on 18 December. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> was born in Dundee, Scotland, in 1913. In the mid- 1920s he came to Australia with his family and as a schoolboy living in Canberra saw the finishing touches put to the construction of Parliament House and witnessed its opening in 1927. After leaving school he joined the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> as a cadet journalist and, in 1936, became a cadet reporter on </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Shortly after the outbreak of war, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> joined the Royal Australian Air Force but was recalled to bis Department because of the extreme difficulty being felt at that time by <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in maintaining a reporting service to the Parliament due to the lack of staff. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline>saw service in the Parliament under 13 Prime Ministers, the first of whom was the Right Honourable Joseph Lyons. When he joined <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> at least two of the original members of the Parliament were still occupying its benches. In the Senate there was the Right Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Foster Pearce and in the House of Representatives there was the Right Honourable William Morris Hughes. There are few people who could bridge from today back to the original Parliament. During his parliamentary career, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> witnessed many notable events, including three double dissolutions of the Parliament. the appearance of Browne and Fitzpatrick at the Bar of the House of Representatives in 19SS, the advent of daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in that year and the joint sitting of the Senate and House of Representatives in 1974. He has played a large part in controlling the operations of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> since 1968 when he was appointed as deputy head of the Department. In 1970 he was responsible for the establishment and development of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> tape transcription centre without which the present large volume of transcripts of evidence given to the increasing number of parliamentary committees could not have been handled. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline>is a man of great personal charm, a man of great personal integrity, a person I have known and liked very greatly over the years I have spent in this Parliament. I have found him at all times most accessible, friendly, and most anxious to help. Sadly, I should say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> has been in indifferent health for some time now and, on medical advice, he has not attended the Parliament for the last two weeks of these sittings. I am sure, however, that every member of the House will join in with me in thanking him for his immense service to the par.liament over the 42 years and that, also, we will wish him good health and a happy retirement. </para>

I know that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> wishes to advert to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram&#39;s</inline> retirement this afternoon in the remarks he will make in the concluding stages of the session. On behalf of all members of the Government parties I would like to say how much we are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> for the years of service to this Parliament. As you remarked, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> 42 years is an incredible time of service, particularly in the history of Australian Federation, transcending as it does more than half of that history and going back to the origins of this place. It is truly a remarkable term. I join with you in wishing him a recovery from his present illness and trust he has many more years of health and happiness ahead of him and that with his family he may now enjoy those years of retirement which he has certainly more than justified. </para>

            <para>- On behalf of the Opposition I join with both yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in expressing the greatest appreciation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> for the services he has given this Parliament and also to convey the best wishes of the members of the Opposition, indeed of the Parliament, to both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Ingram</inline> for a happy retirement. It comes as something of a shock to hear the announcement today that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> is about to retire. Like most members, indeed if not all, I had come to the situation of being so used to seeing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> around the place and accepting him as an essential part of this building, of the services that keep this building going, that it never occurred to me that retirement may be coming fairly soon. It is a matter of regret to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> is leaving because he has always been a person diligent and capable in his task but, more importantly, as you observed, an extremely genial, friendly man who has been helpful at the personal level. I must say for the record that although his services have been diligent and of a consistently high order, I am not always certain that he has given a consistently faithful record of what has taken place in the Parliament because when I read the parliamentary debate it is too consistently lucid to persuade me that that could be consistently true. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>He went from journalism to politics- I leave it to honourable members to make a judgment as to whether it was progress or some other way- but in coming here he contributed right through the development of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> services, from the point before the introduction of the daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to the introduction of the daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> which was a massive task at that time and a most valuable record of what takes place in the Parliament. Parliament is a curious institution. For lengthy periods it can proceed with its duties and its responsibilities in a relatively uneventful way and suddenly one will find oneself projected into the centre of high drama. I know that has certainly been so in my case in the 17 years I have been here. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> has been here some 42 years and he would have seen a very high order of this sort of drama both in the Depression and war time and then later through the post-war period. I wish him and his wife well in retirement. I wish his successor well. I wish his successor every satisfaction in the job he is about to do. All honourable members know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram&#39;s</inline> successor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kerr,</inline> know him too as a man in the mould that we have come to recognise as part of the staffing qualities of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> service, and those qualities are of a very high order. We are very fortunate to have had them and to continue to have them. </para>

            <para>-This report of the Committee relates to the acquisition of automatic data processing systems in the Austraiian Public Service. It is mainly about the acquisition of medium-scale and large-scale computer systems. It also deals with the procurement of equipment to expand existing systems and with maintenance services. It does not look in detail at procurement of software, or services other than maintenance. This report is one of a series in a comprehensive study, by the Public Accounts Committee on major aspects of computer acquisition and usage to be presented to Parliament Others in the series will deal with: The Public Service Board&#39;s Mandata system; the planning and co-ordination of ADP developments; the efficiency and effectiveness of installed computing; and the collection and dissemination of statistical material by the Commonwealth. </para>

        <para>During the period 1962-63 to 1977-78, the Australian Public Service spent approximately $150m on the purchase and hire of computing equipment. In the last five years, there has been an average annual growth rate in equipment spending of IS per cent. Some procedures and practices currently in use for ADP acquisition are unduly costly with little compensating benefit. Moreover, they tend to be inflexible, inhibiting the optimum match of vendors&#39; solutions to the user&#39;s requirements. The major unsatisfactory aspect of present procurement practice is the length of time it usually takes. The Department of Administrative Services has estimated that under new administrative arrangements for the acquisition of computers, the time required to acquire a computer from the beginning of the feasibility study to the beginning of implementation would be in excess of 48 months. From evidence received this is three times greater than the usual time taken in the private sector. We suggest that the Public Service Board should set itself the modest objective of reducing the average time for the acquisition of computer systems in the Public Service by 25 per cent. This would still mean the average would be approximately twice that in the private sector but would produce some $6m per annum in additional benefits and reduced costs. </para>
        <para>The Committee has reviewed the interim guidelines produced by the Public Service Board and the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet and Administrative Services, and has concluded that, if implemented, they would not result in efficient and effective computer system procurement. The guidelines are largely orientated towards review, approval and checking. They do not deal with the inefficiencies that exist in the present process; indeed if implemented, they would exacerbate many of the present inefficiencies. The interim guidelines which do provide adequate opportunity for ministerial scrutiny during the procurement cycle, for a large amount of interdepartmental committee surveillance and for an independent assessor do not contribute to the achievement of, or recognise the need for, moving the task of computer system procurement more firmly into the hands of departmental management. The great emphasis that they place on review and checking by the IDC on automatic data processing suggests that they may even have the opposite effect- that of further reducing the generally already inadequate level of involvement and control exercised by permanent heads in computer system acquisition. </para>
        <para>Currently, a significant component of the time cycle for procurement of large computer systems is the time taken in obtaining the endorsement for approval of departmental proposals by the IDC on ADP. It has been estimated that the IDC could be costing $4.5m in deferred benefits. The </para>
        <para class="block">Committee considers it unlikely that the IDC review produces annual benefits of equal magnitude. It is the Committee&#39;s view that review and co-ordinating bodies such as the IDC should be publicly accountable for the costs saved and benefits lost due to their function. New administrative arrangements for computer procurement should be based on a cost/benefit analysis which takes into account the effect of delay on both direct costs and lost benefits. </para>
        <para>The Committee has suggested new interim guidelines to ensure that there is adequate opportunity for ministerial scrutiny without the delays in the existing procedures. In brief, the responsibility for the review of departments&#39; computer proposals would be vested with the Public Service Board. The Board would be charged with responsibility for the speedy processing of all proposals. The Board&#39;s officers would be responsible for drawing Cabinet&#39;s attention to proposals which involve possible difficulties such as conflict of interest. The Committee is anxious to ensure that fairness, honesty, free competition and more open negotiation prevail in all procedures developed. In all, the Committee made 40 recommendations which it feels will improve the acquisition of ADP systems in the Public Service. </para>
        <para>This has been the first major review undertaken relating to the acquisition of ADP systems in the Australian Public Service. The Committee wishes to express its appreciation of the cooperation and assistance accorded to it by staff of the Public Service and suppliers of computer equipment and services. The information and material provided has greatly assisted the Committee in its prompt presentation of this report. The Committee would also like to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of its technical advisor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> MacGregor of P. K. MacGregor and Associates, in the preparation of this report. </para>

      <para>The Committee recognises that the Department of Administrative Services has a role in the procurement of computer systems and related services. This role derives from the Administrative Arrangements Order and the Government&#39;s decision that the Purchasing Division of the Department should assume responsibility for the procurement of computers. It may be necessary for the Department of Administrative Services to acquire or develop additional skills to enable it to perform the computer purchase operation effectively. It is also recognised that in order to implement the following procedures it will be necessary to raise the level of computing technology skills within the Public Service Board. </para>

        <title>ACTIVITIES OF THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE</title>
        <page.no>3426</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>In 1976 1 commenced the practice of informing the Parliament of the activities during the past year of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. </para>
      <para>As we are rarely given the opportunity of debating the numerous reports which are tabled, I believe it is important that the parliament should be given details of our activities. 1978 has been a record year in terms of meetings of the Committee and the general areas which it has reported on. In all there were 45 meetings of the full committee and 29 meetings of sub-committees, a total of 74 meetings. </para>
      <para>In addition to our regular reporting on items such as the Auditor-General&#39;s reports, and our investigation and subsequent reports to Parliament on the Advance, of the Minister of Finance we also finalised our enquiry into ownership and leasing of overseas property by the Commonwealth, and we commenced a most significant examination into the use of computers in the public sector. </para>
      <para>The report on overseas property was tabled last Tuesday and today, I have tabled the first of a series of reports on computerisation in the public sector with regard to the acquisition of ADP systems. This will be the first of a series in a comprehensive review by the Committee on major aspects of computer acquisition and usage. </para>
      <para>Next year, we will present reports on the Public Service Board Mandata system, planning and co-ordination of ADP development, the efficiency and effectiveness of installed computer services, and the collection and use of statistics by the Commonwealth. </para>
      <para>We believe that these reports will give the Parliament a substantial basis upon which to assess the role of the public sector in this most significant and expensive area of administrative development. </para>
      <para>The committee has also decided to undertake early in the new year a comprehensive review of the cost effectiveness of services to the unemployed. This examination will take into account the reports of the Norgard and Myers reports into the Commonwealth Employment Service. The review will test the effectiveness of specific schemes in terms of established Government policy. </para>
      <para>The work of the Committee was significantly helped during the year by the secondment of officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Public Service Board and the Auditor-General&#39;s Office. The Committee believes that the continuation on a regular basis of the secondment of officers from other departments is very useful, both to the Parliament and to the departments concerned, as it enables middle-ranking officers to obtain valuable experience and insight into the financial affairs and administration of a wide range of other departments. It also enables them to gain an appreciation of the role of the Committees of the Parliament in financial scrutiny. </para>
      <para>During the year, the Committee also commenced the appointment of outside advisers, not only to help us with specific enquiries, but as a means of ensuring that the secretariat has access to specialists in areas of relevance to the committee. Accordingly, we appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> MacGregor as our consultant in the area of automatic data processing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr K.</inline> C. O. Shan, C.B.E.-up until recently  Chairman  of the Public Service Board- and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> Jay, a specialist in government accounting and federal state financial relationships, have accepted appointments as special advisers and I hope to be soon in a position to announce that a retiring justice of the supreme court of New South Wales will also take up a similar position with us. 1978 saw an extension of the Committee&#39;s interest in developing associations with similar Committees in the parliaments of our near neighbours. Following a visit to Canberra by a delegation of the PAC of the Parliament of Papua New Guinea, arrangements were made to second the previous secretary of the Committee to help the Papua New Guinea Parliament for a period of six months. We understand that the secondment of this officer has been of immense value. </para>
      <para>We also received a delegation from the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament of the Solomon Islands and they are interested in maintaining a close relationship with us. Upon their attaining self-government, we also had discussions with the Government of the Northern Territory and we stand ready to assist them should they wish to establish a committee for financial scrutiny in that legislature. </para>
      <para>The Committee is encouraged by the growing interest internationally as well as in the State Parliaments of Australia, in more effective scrutiny of public expenditure. During the year the  chairman  and secretary were invited to give evidence before a committee of the NSW Parliament and we have reason to believe that the PAC in the NSW Parliament will be significantly strengthened. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has established a working party made up of PAC chairmen from a number of member parliaments, including our own- they will be reviewing progress in London next September. </para>
      <para>Amendments to the Audit Act and introduction of efficiency auditing are seen by the committee as being of great significance. We regret that is has not been possible for the Parliament to pass the enabling legislation during this session. Following discussions with the Government, it was agreed that PAC and the Expenditure Committee of the House of Representatives would consider all efficiency audit recommendations and reports made by the Auditor-General. It is the PAC&#39;s preliminary view that we would be interested in acting as an arbiter in cases where departments are unable to agree to recommendations made by the Auditor-General and we have already commenced this role. </para>
      <para>We have noted with some concern the growing tendency of Committees of the Parliament and even Ministers, to question publicly the recommendations made by the Auditor-General in his reports. We believe that the integrity of the Auditor-General should be safeguarded at aU times and we fear that any major public criticism of him would not be in the best interests of the Parliament, nor assist the efficiency of government administration. Nevertheless there is a heavy responsiblity on the Auditor-General to ensure that his reports are at all times balanced and fair. The PAC has always found this to be the case. </para>
      <para>In my 1977 report, I foreshadowed a number of significant amendments to the PAC Act. Unfortunately, little progress has been made on this matter, but we are assured by the Minister that enabling legislation will be passed during the autumn session. </para>
      <para>The Committee is concerned with the need to improve relations between the Parliament and the public service as a whole. We are conscious of a lamentable lack of appreciation by the latter of the work of Parliament, and of the tendency for public servants to forget that both the administration of government policy and Parliament&#39;s right to protect the interests of electors, are in fact closely related. We are both indispensable parts of the same system of government, the efficiency of which should be of common interest to us all. As in previous years, the  Chairman  of the Committee and the secretary were invited to speak at a number of seminars conducted by the Public Service Board for medium and senior officers of the Public Service. We have also continued our close relationship with the Royal Institute of Public Administration. The Committee has decided to take a further initiative in this field by establishing on an annual basis a seminar for medium ranking officers of the Public Service, where members of both Houses of Parliament especially those who are involved in the work of committees such as the Senate Committee on Finance and Government Operations, and the Expenditure Committee, can join with us in discussing issues of relevance with middle ranking officers of the Public Service. The first seminar will be held in Canberra during the second week of the autumn session. </para>
      <para>It is my hope that during 1979, we will also be able to build further regular contacts with professional organisations in the private sector, in particular the Institute of Auditors and the various State branches of the Society of Accountants. </para>
      <para>While we do not question the need for an independent career public service, nevertheless there is a constant need for a greater degree of co-operation between the private and pubUc sectors, not only at the level of staff transfers and secondments, but just as important, the establishment of a regular means of more effective communication. </para>
      <para>I would like to conclude by thanking the Auditor-General, the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board and the Secretary of the Department of Finance, as well as their officers for the considerable support they have so willingly given us during the year. </para>
      <para>I must also, on behalf of my colleagues, thank our extremely hard working secretariat, ably led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Talberg; without their dedication, the effective performance of our task would be quite impossible. </para>

          <para>-by leave-This is an extremely important report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It is the first of a  series which aims to inform the Parliament and the people of Australia about the significance of automatic data processing in the public sector. The worst thing that could happen would be for this report to be presented, to be accepted with expressions of goodwill on all sides, and then for it to lie unread, undebated, lodged in some comfortable pigeon hole. The full Public Accounts Committee and the sectional committee which worked on this report, worked extremely hard. The report in its way is a text book, one of the most significant documents presented, certainly in the brief time that I have been a member of the House of Representatives. However, if the report is not read and debated at length in this place and then acted on it might just as well have never been written at all. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I hope that the Government will undertake to set time aside in the autumn session to ensure that there is adequate debate on this extremely important report. The implications of the report are serious. Conceptually, ADP is a very difficult area to work in, particularly for laymen. It illustrates for many members of parliament, who are laymen and generalists in most areas, the problem of the fragmentation of knowledge. I have spoken about this before in this House. As the volume of accessible knowledge increases exponentially and as it becomes increasingly difficult for members of parliament to be able to comprehend the range and depth of government activity, we may fall increasingly into the hands of technocrats with tunnel vision who understand their area absolutely. But we will find that the range of members of parliament are unable to understand it and cannot find the time to acquire the information to argue out on policy and administrative matters in equal terms. </para>
        <para>I draw attention again to the 40 recommendations referred to by the  Chairman,  or the 40 steps. I remind honourable members of the story which they may know of Voltaire&#39;s comment about St Denis, the patron saint of Paris. According to the legend, when he had his head cut off he picked up his head and put it under his arm and walked for 40 steps. Voltaire said: &#39;I really am prepared to accept most of the story&#39;. He said: &#39;I am certainly prepared to accept that he walked perhaps 39 steps but in fact it is really only the first step that I am worried about&#39;. I think in this case we need to make sure that the first, the second, the third, right up to the 40th of those steps, is understood, debated in this place and acted on. </para>

            <para>-The Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 is essentially a machinery Bill which endeavours to deal with a set of apparently unforseen difficulties which arose out of the major changes made to the Broadcasting and Television Act following the Green report. Those changes were made in 1977. A principal change was to transfer the power to grant and renew licences for broadcasting and television from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In addition the 1977 Act also laid down specific times for the lodgement of applications and renewals and for submissions relevant to those applications and renewals. These were two changes that emerged in 1977. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill is designed to clear up the administrative chaos that followed those changes. Let me detail some of the chaos that was involved this year in the effort to carry through those changes. There was considerable confusion, in part created by the  Chairman  of the Broadcasting Tribunal, as to the appropriate form which public radio licence applications should take. As a result of this and other matters some 26 applications were not formally correct. In addition, with reference to the public broadcasting applications, there seems to have been a failure of the Tribunal regularly to clear its post office box, as evidenced in articles in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> in early September. The problem in relation to television renewals arose from an inconsistency in the original Act which stipulated that new licence applications should be lodged with the Tribunal, but that renewal applications should be lodged with the Minister. As a result of this inconsistency all the Adelaide renewals were mistakenly lodged with the Tribunal and not with the Minister as the Act required. </para>
          <para>Although it is beyond the Bill to ensure that the Tribunal clears its post office box regularly, the Bill does seek to clear up the chaos which has arisen in the other fields. It does this firstly by introducing much greater flexibility in the procedural arrangements for lodging original and renewal applications and related submissions and documents; secondly, it ensures that all applications for licences and renewals will in future be directed to the Broadcasting Tribunal and not to the Minister; and thirdly, it includes sections to validate retrospective the public broadcasting applications and the televison renewal applications. </para>
          <para>The Opposition welcomes these amendments as both necessary and desirable. We believe that the direction of licence renewals to the Tribunal and not to the Minister is hopefully a further depoliticisation of licensing matters. We certainly welcome that change. We also welcome the greater flexibility with respect to applications and submissions which will be of benefit in our view both to the applicants and to the Tribunal. But the Opposition would fail in its duty if it did not deplore the administrative mess which gave rise to these amendments and to these retrospective changes. The retrospective changes themselves indicate the failure of the Minister in the middle part of this year to ensure that proper procedures were observed when licence applications and renewals were lodged. I think it is important to deplore this failure because these public radio licence hearings marked the very first occasion of such licence grants by the Tribunal. Equally, the television licence renewals were of great significance as the first public renewal hearings held by the Tribunal. As such they were central elements in the concept of pubhe accountability of licence holders. It is disturbing that in both of these pioneering undertakings by the Tribunal, considerable irregularities occurred. </para>
          <para>What were the reasons for the irregularities that took place? I think two major points seem to have been neglected in the original legislation and are perhaps not fully covered even by this legislation. The Tribunal does not appear to have sufficient administrative and legal competence to ensure that the provisions of the Act are properly observed. That seems to be one major weakness which explains many of the irregularities that took place in May, June and July of this year. Secondly the Tribunal perhaps did not fully understand the inconsistency I have already mentioned between renewal and application procedures. When the applications were heard in Adelaide the Tribunal clearly did not realise or did not appear to realise that there was an inconsistency in the Act under which it was operating. This anomaly meant that the applications for the licence renewals for the Adelaide stations were lodged, quite incorrectly with the Tribunal. Under the Act, they should have been lodged with the Minister. Moreover, as I have said, the Government&#39;s embarrassment and the Minister&#39;s embarrassment were further compounded by the administrative incompetence of the Tribunal which failed to ensure that in regard to the public broadcasting applications its post office box was regularly cleared. It seems that simply because of this omission a number of applications were received by the Tribunal after the appropriate date. </para>
          <para>As I have said, the Opposition welcomes the amendments which give the Tribunal greater discretionary powers to extend any deadlines for submissions, applications, renewals, evidence or replies to submissions. We welcome this kind of power in the hands of the Tribunal to see that in future we will have fair and relatively impartial hearings conducted with a degree of administrative flexibility which this Bill endeavours to provide. But we are worried about some of the factors that have led to its introduction. This is another sign of the incompetence at the administrative level that we are finding in many places under this Government. We welcome the corrections that have been made. We would like to draw attention to what still seem to be weaknesses in the legal and administrative support staff of the Tribunal, but we believe that at least this Bill is a start in correcting the anomalies that turned up in the middle of this year. </para>

            <para>- It is true that the amendments that are before the House today have been introduced to tighten up aspects of the Broadcasting and Television Act which has caused difficulty in the staging of public hearings for the renewal of licences over recent months. I too welcome these amendments which are certainly going to make things a lot easier than they have been in the past. I think the amendment relating to the lodgement of renewals with the Tribunal rather than with the Minister is one to be commended. Previously, in the days of the old Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the applications went to that Board. I think the industry is probably also at fault in not reading some of the rules and regulations in the right way and in posting the applications to the Tribunals as a matter of expediency. The passing of this Bill will certainly overcome this problem. There will be a number of public licence hearings coming up in the course of the next few weeks. I was very interested to follow closely the public hearings that were conducted recently in Adelaide for the renewal of commercial television licences. I think anyone who followed those public hearings could not help feeling some concern at what was happening. If we read the Act and consider what happened in Adelaide I am sure we will acknowledge that there are many problems and many bugs that must be ironed out of the Act so that the industry can operate completely and utterly to everyone &#39;s satisfaction. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I noted at these hearings the fact that although the Act provides that where in the opinion of the Tribunal licence holders who have not breached the law can have their licences automatically renewed, this did not necessarily happen in the case of the Adelaide television station. The other thing that was of particular concern to me at the Adelaide hearings was the fact that members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal seemed to take a lot of submissions from the floor. I wonder whether the Act should be tightened specifically so that if people want to make submissions they will have to be made in writing under the same terms and the same conditions as the television stations that lodge their renewal applications. Giving submissions from the floor caused a great deal of heartache for some of the witnesses who appeared before that Tribunal. Also I would like to voice some criticism of some members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for the way in which they conducted themselves at the public hearings. </para>
          <para>After looking very closely at some of the transcripts of the hearings I wonder whether some members of the Tribunal were in breach of the Act because of some of the questions they posed and some of the allegations they made against the people who appeared on behalf of the television stations that were seeking to have their licences renewed. I know that a lot of the members of the television stations expressed concern at the way in which those hearings were conducted. I think the last thing we would ever want to see with this form of renewing television licences is a major legal battle. If the type of behaviour that was displayed in Adelaide is any indication, one can see that at future major hearings representatives, whether they be of commercial television stations, commercial radio stations or indeed the public broadcasting sector, will have to have legal counsel to work out their rights. </para>
          <para>Indeed I would believe that if that was the case members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal would have to have legal counsel as well. One could imagine that these public hearings could well develop into a major legal battle going on for days, weeks and months at a time. This disturbs me because this certainly is not in the spirit of the Act as it stands at the moment. I think we all applauded the fact that the public had an input into radio and television in Australia with the implementation of the new Act. It would be a very great shame indeed if that input was lost because of the nature of the conduct of the particular hearings and in fact if these legal battles raged in the cases of some of the major licence renewals that will be held in coming months. </para>
          <para>The other point which concerned me and which seemed quite obvious was that the members of the Austraiian Broadcasting Tribunal, when they began the hearings in Adelaide, really did not have too many clues as to exactly the form that the hearings should take. It would seem that not enough preparation was done, whether by members of the Tribunal or members of the department concerned, in having the members completely briefed on what their role was to be. Another criticism that was voiced was the fact that the industry could not obtain official forms on which to make their applications from the Postal and Telecommunications Department even though their applications were filed on time. Obviously this matter will be cleared up now but we must express concern if this type of thing is to go on within the operation of government. In coming months there will be quite a number of public hearings for the renewal of radio and television station licences. I wonder if all members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal should be expected to undertake all those hearings. Even if two members at a time go to the different centres the work load will be quite incredible if the hearings in Adelaide were any indication. I believe that there could be quite a good case made out for the establishment of part-time member positions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to overcome that work load. It is a most extensive industry. A lot of technological development is taking place at the moment and there is a lot of work for the Tribunal to do. There are a number of areas in which I think some action should be taken very soon indeed. </para>
          <para>One of the areas that I think is well worth investigation is the quality of television reception that is being received on the Queensland Gold Coast. In fact some areas of the Gold Coast have some of the worst television reception in Australia. For a number of years there has been a great deal of debate in this most important part of Queensland- after all it is the tourist capital of Australia- as to what should be done to overcome the difficulties in television reception. Two notions have been put forward, the first being that that area should have its own commercial television station to service the area. The second notion is that translators should be provided to bring a television signal from Brisbane to be beamed on the Gold Coast Bearing in mind that this debate has now been taking place for seven or eight years and that no real action has been taken in this direction in that time, perhaps this could be a task for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to undertake, that is, to check on the actual viability of having a commercial television station to service that area or whether it may be a better proposition to relay programs from all four Brisbane commercial television stations to the Gold Coast </para>
          <para>As I said, some of the areas of the Gold Coast, particularly those areas around Burleigh Heads, have some of the worst television reception in this country. It would seem to be very strange to me that a city such as the Gold Coast with 80,000 permanent residents and almost 250,000 people in peak holiday time does not have quality television reception available to it. I would like to stress to the Minister this aspect so that perhaps he could undertake some investigation with the Broadcasting Tribunal as to how this matter can be overcome. Basically the principle of these amendments that are before the House today will streamline the procedures. I believe there must be a settling down time for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I would hope that we do not see in future hearings some of the anomalies that certainly came up during those Tribunal hearings in Adelaide in recent weeks. I commend the amendments to the House. </para>

            <para>-As it has been at least a few days since the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill 1978 was introduced to the House, I would like to say something about it in a descriptive way before getting down to my detailed comments on it. The House will remember that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976, in other words, an Act that has been with us for only a couple of years. The amendments were foreshadowed by the Minister for Industry and </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> and the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> in a joint statement on 16 August this year, shortly after the Budget was introduced. The main thrusts of this Bill are three in number Firstly, an increase in the size of grants payable to eligible companies; secondly, the revamping of various elements of the Act, aimed at simplifying the procedures governing the application by companies for grants and the processing of these applications by the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board; and, thirdly, a change to the date on which the grant rates are set for a particular grant year. </para>
          <para>The proposed change in the grant rates encompasses both project and commencement grants. Firstly, project grants have been increased from 25 per cent of company expenditure, subject to an overall limit on grant payments to any company of $250,000, to the rate of 50 per cent, subject to a new annual limit of $500,000 for any company. Secondly, commencement grants have increased from 25 per cent of eligible company expenditure with an annual limit of $ 1 5,000 to a 50 per cent rate with a new annual limit of $25,000. This simplification of the Act involves amendments to various key definitions, including eligible contract expenditure, eligible expenditure, eligible plant expenditure and eligible salary expenditure. Also, the section relating to joint industrial research and development projects will be altered to allow the Board to enter into a single agreement with companies undertaking joint industrial research and development rather than being required to enter into a separate agreement with each participant as is currently the case. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Bill proposes that grant rates be set by 3 1 March preceding the start of each grant year, compared-with the current date of 30 September, a date which falls three months into the grant year. This change will give companies advance warning of the rates that will apply for the next grant year. This foreshadowing of grant rates is a step in the right direction since it should allow management time to set cash flows and plan IRD for the next financial year. So much for the purpose, as the Opposition sees that purpose, of this Bill. I would now like to make some comments on it, hastening to say, however, that the Opposition is not going to oppose the Bill and in principle we support it. According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Productivity, the new Government policy on IRD is aimed at:  . . preventing further wastage of Australian research and development resources, and to contribute advances in productivity, innnovation and sound industry development. </para>
          <para class="block">Those are fine words with which we agree. On the face of it, it seems that the Government may at last have woken up in relation to its policy attitudes towards IRD. But a leopard never changes its spots, and we have a number of critical comments to make. We in the Opposition are concerned that the Government may not actually achieve the grand purpose it would have us believe that it seeks to achieve. We need to examine whether the Government is guilty of glossing over some of the real problems which remain for industrial research and development in Australia. </para>
          <para>The Government is guilty of a stop-start approach to IRD and of shoddy treatment to reward the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board. Funding in the past has been erratic under various conservative governments. In contrast, during the Whitlam years funding was far more stable, with the 1975-76 Budget allocation being an all-time high of $ 19m. Of course, that is in 1975-76 prices, and when making a comparison with what is being appropriated today we would have to update that amount of $19m by the amount relating to inflation. The Fraser Government reduced this allocation to $15m in 1976-77 and reduced it again to $14m in 1977-78, this in spite of increases in the cost of materials, with the price of materials used in manufacturing going up by 21 per cent during that two-year period. This means that the level of IRD expenditure by the Fraser Government as a percentage of gross domestic product has declined steadily. </para>
          <para>The effect of this erratic and neglectful policy has been significant in a number of ways, and I want to list them. Firstly, the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board has not been able to meet its commitments, resulting in long delays in the payment of grants to qualifying companies. Secondly, companies have continually decreased their participation in the scheme. Thirdly, because of previous commitments and first priority being given to commencement grants, funds have not been available for new IRD projects. The last point I want to make under this heading is that excessive selectivity has been forced upon the Board in its allocation of the shrinking funds made available to it by the Fraser Government. Because of these facts, the much-heralded substantial increase- I am now quoting from the ministerial statement- of 75 per cent in the 1978-79 Budget allocation is not what it might otherwise seem to be. The Government&#39;s neglect of IRD will continue to leave its mark. Of the $24m allocated for this year, at least $8m will be required to bail out the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board from the predicament the Board has found itself in because of the Government&#39;s attitude hitherto to the funding of industrial research and development in Australia. This $8m is required so that the Board will be able to pay it existing debtsgrants which have been awarded but not yet paid to qualifying companies. For this reason alone the grandstanding associated with the socalled 75 per cent increase- the increased allocation of funds- borders on the deceptive. In reality, the Government has allocated only $16m for new grants this year, an increase of only $2m over the previous year and a figure which still falls a good deal short of the allocation of $ 1 9m in the Whitlam Labor Government&#39;s final Budget in 1975-76. </para>
          <para>A further consequence of the limited funding has been the setting of guidelines by the Board when determining which companies are eligible for project grants. Such selectivity means that the best interests of this country may not always be served. Lack of funds forces the Board to make a choice between widely differing proposals, and that is just not good enough. This is not the only legacy of past neglect which IRD policy will have to bear. In past years, because of financial restrictions, the Board has been unable to provide funds for IRD projects as they have taken second place to commencement grants. Because companies are aware that grants are not available for specific projects they have ceased approaching the Board and/or have let their IRD divisions run down. For this reason, one injection of funds will not be enough to restore the business community&#39;s faith in the Board or in the policy of the Fraser Government in this area. In fact, the Government must follow this year&#39;s increase with further increases in funds over the next few years. </para>
          <para>While on this point, it may be worth while questioning the merit of separate IRD funding between commencement on the one hand and project grants on the other hand. This distinction may place an artificial restriction on the potential contribution which government promotion of IRD in Australia pursues. Many companies undertake IRD on a more casual basis than the formal project work as denned in the Act. Research is undertaken but without the formalisation of a forward program required by the Board. Such work is ineligible for a project grant as well as being ineligible for any alternative commencement grants. These companies tend to be small, but it is these companies which have the reputation for being more innovative. Surely we should look at the point I have just raised. Surely the Government should examine additional ways in which it can assist small innovative companies. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, may I summarise the points I have made. The past performance of the Fraser Government in die area of industrial research and development has been very poor. The figures now do not in any way compare with the amount appropriated in the last Whitlam Labor Government Budget. The erratic nature of the Government&#39;s funding of the Industrial Research and Development Grants Board has had a detrimental effect on the level of IRD in Australia, causing a general decrease in the levels undertaken and undermining the stated intentions of the Board. The business community, we believe, has lost faith in the Board, and it will take more than an announced new policy, more than an increase in funding in one Budget year, for the Government to make up its lost ground. Let us hope that this Bill is a genuine attempt by the Government to redress the faults of the past. There is no doubt that in the search we must all join to create new jobs in Australia industrial research and development are absolutely vital. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill, but with the qualifications that I have made in this speech. </para>

            <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to cany out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of stage 1 development, Bonegilla army site, Vic </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The proposal is for the construction of new permanent living, working and recreational facilities to accommodate the Army Apprentices School at present located in sub-standard accommodation at Balcombe, Victoria; the School of Military Survey presently located in temporary accommodation at Bonegilla, Victoria; and recruit training for the Women&#39;s Royal Australian Army Corps, presently in temporary accommodation at George&#39;s Heights, Sydney, New South Wales. The estimated cost of the proposed works examined by the Committee was $29.5m at July 1978 prices. </para>
          <para>In reporting favourably on the proposal the Committee has made two recommendations. In recommendation 4 the Committee has recommended that the proposed 50 metre 9 lane swimming pool be heated and covered with some space for spectator seating at an estimated additional cost of $330,000. The objective of this recommendation is to ensure maximum utilisation of the pool for training and recreation purposes by the large number of Army personnel in the Bonegilla-Bandianna area. In the short time available before the House adjourns it is not possible to examine the full implications of this recommendation and confirm that it is acceptable. However, the merit of the recommendation is recognised and will be taken into consideration as the proposal is further developed. The Committee will be advised when a decision is taken. </para>
          <para>In recommendation 6 the Committee recommends that the Department of Construction should undertake a thorough examination of the proposal regarding project management put to the Committee by Civil and Civic Pty Ltd. This proposal was examined in some detail by the Department during the course of the Committee&#39;s inquiry. The project management concepts put to the Committee by the company do not seem to add to the techniques that the Department has available to it and uses for the planning, design and construction of government works. The company&#39;s specific proposal in relation to Bonegilla is one which the Department has adopted previously, where appropriate, and is not new. However, I have asked the Department of Construction to examine the proposal in more detail. Upon the concurrence of the House in this motion, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </para>

            <para>- by leave- In May of this year the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> announced new procedures for the formal consideration of parliamentary committee reports. I have pleasure in tabling a document summarising action the Government has taken or proposes to take on the recommendations contained in the last three reports of the House of Representatives </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Standing Committee on Road Safety. These reports are on passenger motor vehicle safety, tabled in May 1976; heavy vehicle safety, tabled in April 1977; and motorcycle and bicycle safety, tabled in June 1978. Before dealing with the reports in detail, I propose to describe briefly what has been achieved and is being done in the field of road safety. </para>
          <para>Throughout the decade of the 1960s there was a continuing increase in road accident casualties, with more than 30,000 people killed and 760,000 injured on Australia&#39;s roads. This trend reached a climax in 1970 with a record toll of 3,798 killed and over 91,000 injured. Since 1970, however, there has been a marked departure from this upward trend. In each of the years from 1971 to 1977 fewer people were killed on the roads than in 1970, despite increases of over 1.5 million in population and two million in motor vehicles. Since 1970, some 4,200 more people would have been killed had the trend from 1960 to 1970 continued. These figures show that significant gains have been made in recent years, but there are no grounds for complacency. In 1977, the fatality rate per 10,000 registered vehicles was 5.2. While this compares very favourably with the figure of 7.9 of a decade earlier, it is nevertheless still higher than the 1976 figures for the United States of 3.3, for New Zealand of 3.7 and for the United Kingdom of 3.8. </para>
          <para>As honourable members are aware, most of the direct action possible in the road safety field is the responsibility of the State government, the principal role of the Commonwealth Government being one of support and co-ordination. Co-ordination is achieved through the Australian Transport Advisory Council and its associated committees. Council is known as ATEC and it comprises State and Northern Territory Ministers with responsibility for transport, and the Commonwealth Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister for Transport. It is a forum for seeking and implementing national solutions to transport problems. The Council has played an important role in road safety; it is through its work and that of its technical committees that much of the progress made so far in vehicle safety, road safety publicity and roaduser performance has been achieved. The Government attaches considerable importance to this work. </para>
          <para>In 1969, the first safety design rule for passenger cars was introduced. Australian Design Rules, as they are called, have been progressively extended to trucks, buses and motorcycles, and cover matters such as seat belt and braking systems, collapsible steering columns, burstproof door locks, and side impact protection. The Government, through the Department of Transport, provides the technical and secretarial resources to the ATAC committee which develops the design rules, as indeed it does to all the advisory committees of ATAC. The improvement in safety during the 1970s has flowed in no small measure from the Government taking a more active role in identified problem areas. For example, over $27m was provided to the States in the years 1976-77 and 1977-78 for road and traffic engineering improvements to specific locations with high accident records or significant traffic congestion. A further $14m has been allocated for expenditure during this financial year. There can be no doubt that this concentration of funds on low-cost, but highly costeffective, projects has made a substantial contribution to improving safety in Australia&#39;s road system. </para>
          <para>Other important examples of the Government&#39;s commitment include the establishment of the Office of Road Safety in the Department of Transport and the funding of extensive road safety research and promotion programs. Some $800,000 will be spent by the Office this financial year on research and education to further road safety in Australia. The introduction of legislation by the State and Territory jurisdictions to require the compulsory wearing of seat belts has given Australia a special place in road safety in the eyes of the world. Not only has the legislation been remarkably effective, but also the Australian initiative has encouraged many overseas countries to introduce similar legislation. The Government believes the wearing of restraints to be of key importance, and considers that continued effort should be directed towards maintaining the benefits flowing from this legislation. </para>
          <para>The Standing Committee on Road Safety has also played a significant role, with five reports completed and a sixth inquiry- covering alcohol and drugs- now under way. The  Chairman  and members of the Committee are to be congratulated, and I look forward to receiving the results of the current inquiry. There can be no doubt that foremost in the road safety problem is the role played by the excessive use of alcohol. In Australia about one-half of drivers killed, about one-quarter of pedestrians killed, about onequarter of motorcyclists killed, and about onefifth of passengers killed have blood alcohol concentrations of 50 milligrams per 100 millilitres or greater; that is 0.05 or above. When you apply these proportions to the road toll in Australia in 1977 you find that about 1,000, or one in every three adults killed, has an elevated blood alcohol level. No other single factor approaches the importance of alcohol as a contributor to serious road crashes. </para>
          <para>Recognising the importance of developing effective countermeasures to this problem, the Government joined with the International Committee on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety to host the Seventh International Conference on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety in Melbourne in January, 1977. Some SOO delegates attended from universities, governments and research bodies throughout the world. The conference provided an international forum for the updating of knowledge, assessment of new techniques, the development of public awareness as to the nature and size of the problem, and the suggestion of effective countermeasures. The Government strongly supports therefore the Committee in its current investigation into alcohol, drugs and road safety. </para>
          <para>I revert now to the three reports which are the subject of the document I now table. About twothirds of the recommendations contained in the three reports- the recommendations total over 100- relate to the activities of ATAC and its technical committees. Just under one-quarter relate to the Department of Transport and other Commonwealth departments, and the remainder refer to a range of industry and other organisations. To assist in the Government&#39;s consideration of the reports, comment was sought from appropriate departments, from the States and Territories, and from a range of other organisations. In summary, the Government supports about 50 per cent of the recommendations and considers that a further 30 per cent require additional investigation before a final attitude can be determined. Action is proceeding on a number of fronts to commission research, to review and to upgrade design and operational requirements, and to encourage initiatives by the States and Territories and industry and other groups. Projects already in progress include a review of the effectiveness of bicycle ways and preparation of a code of safe loading practices for heavy vehicles. New projects are planned to study motorcyclist spinal injuries and the handling and stability characteristics of motorcycles. </para>
          <para>Only 20 per cent of this large number of recommendations cannot be supported. For example, paragraph 247 of the report on motorcycle and bicycle safety recommends investigation of a scheme for the compulsory registration of bicycles. However, the State and Territory registration authorities consider that operational costs and administrative difficulties would far outweigh any benefits which may be derived from such a scheme. Members interested in the Government&#39;s attitude to individual recommendations can refer to the document I have tabled. I conclude by congratulating the  Chairman  of the Road Safety Committee the honourable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter),</inline> who is in the House, and the members of that Committee on their devotion to the work that they do on the Committee. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>-by leave- On behalf of the Opposition, I commend the Government for reporting to the Parliament its intentions in regard to recommendations made by select committees, such as those outlined in the speech just delivered by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> I believe that the Government intends that the responsible Ministers respond to other reports presented to the Parliament. I believe it is a good innovation and it is one which I hope, and I underline that hope, will give honourable members collectively an opportunity at some time to debate at length in the Parliament the Government&#39;s decisions either to accept or to reject- mostly it rejects- committee recommendations. I have found from my experience from being associated with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety since its formation that only on very rare occasions- they have been so rare that I cannot bring to mind any particular occasion- have committee members been political in the recommendations that they have made. In the vast majority of cases, the decisions of the Committee have been unanimous. I feel that giving honourable members an opportunity to comment on reports presented to the Parliament, as we are being given today, is a good innovation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One aspect of the Minister&#39;s speech which I regret is the way in which he has to a limited degree introduced politics into the debate. The Minister has given credit to himself but not to the Labor Government which was responsible for so many of the innovations that were introduced in relation to road safety. For example, the Minister mentioned only the amount that his Government has allocated to the Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Improvements Program; he made no mention of the fact that it was the Labor Government in 1973 which made the first allocation to the MITERS Program and which introduced legislation for that purpose in 1973-74. I am pleased to note that the present Minister has not changed the legislation. He has maintained the existing legislation. The same situation applies to the research and investigation funds that were provided by the Labor Government. I am pleased that his Government has continued the good work that the Labor Government commenced. </para>
          <para>However, there is one area of regret. Very early in the life of the Government which was elected in 197S, it abandoned the Labor Government&#39;s Road Safety and Standards Authority. It revoked the legislation. Incidentally, it is quite interesting to note that the  Chairman  whom I as the then Minister appointed to the Road Safety and Standards Authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Yeend, is now the head of the Office of Road Safety in the Minister&#39;s Department Obviously, the Authority was not abandoned on the score that the person whom I had appointed was unsuitable for the position that he held then since he is not considered unsuitable for the position he holds now. Therefore, I regret that the Minister has seen fit to fiddle with the Authority and to try to claim political credit for something that his Government did not do. </para>
          <para>In relation to the Office of Road Safety, it took the Government from March 1976 to December 1977 to get that Office under way. There was a great deal of talk about it being established. There was quite an amount of information available in the Department to help the Minister make a decision if he wanted to change the format of the road safety system, whether by establishing a road safety and standards authority or whether by burying it in the Department as an office of road safety as is the present situation. All the information in the world was available to allow the Minister to make an instantaneous decision. It took the Minister just on two years- one year and nine months, in fact- to make up his mind what to do and how to set up the Office of Road Safety. </para>
          <para>We set up the Road Safety and Standards Authority on the recommendations of an expert group, which was not set up by the Labor Government. It was set up by a former Minister for Transport. I believe that was the present Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> who is under very strong questioning at the moment and in relation to whose business affairs we moved a censure motion this morning. That expert group he set up made a report to the Parliament in the middle of 1972. That report set out a number of recommendations. One of those recommendations was that a Road Safety and Standards Authority be set up. Another recommendation was that an allocation of funds be made to a road safety program which later became the </para>
          <para class="block">MITERS Program. It made a recommendation that there be uniformity in the collection of statistics. </para>
          <para>The Labor Government set about implementing those recommendations. The present Minister for Transport was the Minister to whom that Committee reported. As I have said to him time and time again in this place, he could have done something about those recommendations as a member of the McMahon Government. That Government did nothing about the matter. It could have done so and did not. The Labor Government had the opportunity to do something and did so. We were the people who got on with the job of providing the funds for the setting up of a decent Road Safety and Standards Authority in this country. Unfortunately, this Government has abandoned that authority. </para>
          <para>I am also sorry to say that at a meeting of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety on Thursday of this week, our attention was drawn to the fact that it is the intention of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to reduce the volume of statistics that it compiles. The decision was taken to direct the  Chairman  to write to the Minister and to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> asking that the present system of gathering information be retained. This Government does not have a good record in regard to road safety. It dithered prior to 1972. It could have done something, but it did nothing. It destroyed the Road Safety and Standards Authority and set up a less efficient organisation. Once again it is going to act contrary to the recommendations made by its own expert group. </para>
          <para>I regret the fact that the Minister has brought politics into the question of road safety. It is not a political issue. Road accidents kill Liberals, members of the Country Party and members of the Labor Party. They have no regard for a person or his political belief. Liberals are not immune to road accidents. I ask the Minister to keep politics out of it. Let him find the best method of reducing Australia&#39;s shocking road toll. Even on the Minister&#39;s own figures, Australia has a bad accident rate compared with the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Australia&#39;s record in road safety is fifteenth or sixteenth on the list of the developed countries. </para>
          <para>There are a number of other things about which the Government should have done something. I always give full credit to the Victorian Liberal Government for having the courage and being the first Government, I believe in the world, to introduce the compulsory wearing of seat belts. This Government took a long while to catch up. I hope that before very long it will introduce random breath testing of drivers to ensure that people driving under the influence of alcohol will be detected. Those people are a menace. The evidence is quite clear. People under the influence of alcohol are incompetent drivers and cause accidents. I refer honourable members to the Minister&#39;s own statement today as to the effects of alcohol on drivers. It is time that he introduced the necessary legislation to permit the random breath testing in an endeavour to reduce the number of people killed. Alcohol is involved in SO per cent or more of fatal accidents. I hope he takes politics out of the matter and does something. </para>
          <para>There are a few items in the paper which the Minister tabled which I would like to refer. The Minister indicated that the Government does not agree with some of the recommendations and is seeking further information on others. The Government&#39;s attitude on a few of the recommendations concerns me. Recommendation 25 in Attachment B deals with heavy vehicle safety. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Materials used in furnishing buses be fireproof and of a material which does not produce toxic gases when subject to heat. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister said that there is insufficient evidence to justify further action in that regard. He is responsible for safety in aircraft. There is clear evidence that people are asphyxiated as a result of fires in aircraft because of the material inside the aircraft. The same thing could apply to heavy vehicles. The Minister also wants further information about the uniform inspection standard for omnibuses. The Government has reservations about the Committee&#39;s proposal and is awaiting further advice. All the Minister has to do is consider the number of tourist buses which have been involved in accidents. I turn his mind back to the Snowy Mountain fatality. A considerable number of old people were killed because of the malfunctioning of the braking system of thenbus. It was an interstate bus. The Australian Government is responsible for interstate transport. All the State Ministers for Transport were in total agreement with the Australian Government taking over responsibility for the testing and inspection of interstate buses. That agreement would not have been confined to testing and inspection. The States would have been prepared to pass the total responsibility to the Australian Government. The Commonwealth Government and State governments have differences of opinion from time to time, but on issues such as this I have always found the State </para>
          <para>Ministers to be most co-operative, helpful and desirous of doing the right thing. I hope that this Minister is prepared to do likewise. I now refer to attachment C. Paragraph 68 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A requirement for licensing be a demonstration of the effective use of all brakes fitted to the motorcycle particularly the front brakes, and DOT develop advisory performance specifications for this test </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is clear evidence that braking is important whether in motor cars, heavy vehicles, motor bikes or even the lowly push bikes. The Committee was unanimous that something needed to be done about this. I am disappointed in the Government&#39;s attitude. I know that other people want to speak on this matter and on others. There are a lot of other things on which I would like to comment, but having in mind the time of day I will reserve my comments for another occasion. </para>

            <para>-by leave-I express the appreciation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> An innovation such as this is encouraging to a committee. Past history indicates that when a committee makes recommendations very little is heard about them. The Minister stated that 30 per cent of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Road Safety need to be looked at again. I assure him that the Committee will do so. It will also reconsider those which were rejected. I thank the staff of the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Hinkley, the Secretary, and his staff have done a splendid job. No Committee has a greater sense of its responsibility than this one. It is dealing with human tragedy involving 10 deaths per day.

              <para>-This is the document that was sent to potential customer countries for Australian uranium late last year as a basis for negotiations with them on nuclear safeguards. Honourable members will be aware of the requirement, described in detail in the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> of 24 May 1977, for the prior conclusion of stringent bilateral safeguards agreements with countries wishing to import uranium from Australia under new contracts. In the past the Government has declined to make this document public. I explained in the House on 10 April 1978 that it would be contrary to established practice and principle to bring into Parliament matters under negotiation with other governments. I also pointed out that the model agreement simply reflected in draft treaty form the policy on safeguards which the Government has announced. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The situation has moved forward since then; first the Government has signed safeguards agreements with Finland and the Philippines and has concluded an interim agreement with the United States. I have tabled these agreements in Parliament. These agreements, having been finalised and made public, have tended to replace the model agreement as the reference points for negotiations with other countries. The model agreement was merely a negotiating tool to that end. </para>
          <para>Second, it is the actual agreements we negotiate, not the model, which count and which have real status as binding legal documents. Honourable members and the public have always been free to compare the agreements, as they are concluded, with the policy requirements set out on 24 May 1977. It is clear that the agreements fully satisfy that policy and are indeed, in some respects, even more stringent. But the Opposition has persisted in trying to confuse and obscure this achievement by dragging in the red herring that the original negotiating tool- the model agreement- has not been made public. By tabling the model today I wish to dispel this irrelevance once and for all. It will be seen that the model text is, as we have always said, a completely faithful reflection of announced policy. </para>
          <para>Very satisfactory progress is being made in the negotiation of bilateral safeguards agreements. There is no doubt internationally or in the minds of other governments of Australia&#39;s determination to ensure effective safeguards. In addition to the agreements I have already mentioned, texts have been negotiated at official level with the Republic of Korea and Iran for consideration by governments. Negotiations are underway with the United States and Japan. Officials will soon be commencing negotiations with Sweden. We hope for early commencement of negotiations on safeguards to cover uranium exports to the European Community countries. All these agreements, when completed, will, of course, be tabled in Parliament I present the following paper. </para>

            <para>-We note the fact that at last a model safeguards agreement has been tabled but we think it is the height of impertinence to suggest it is going to be of some value in the last day of Parliament. Let us bear in mind that the Opposition has been seeking details of the proposed Model Safeguards Agreement for almost 12 months. On every other occasion this has been raised we have been denied the opportunity even to have a look at it. I believe it is treating Parliament with contempt in the very last hours to drag this in here on the basis that it will ease the burden of public debate. We were asking questions about this matter many months ago. We are not at all impressed by the fact it is trundled in here today as though it is going to be of some assistance to us. We are well aware of the fact that it was in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 23 June last; that is how Parliament is treated from the point of view of being given some worthwhile information. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We are also aware of the fact that it was virtually the same agreement that was tabled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> on 24 August last relating to the agreements then proposed to be entered into with Finland and the Philippines. It is not good enough just to bring it in here on the basis that it will satisfy the requirements of public debate. We have asked questions of the Minister particularly in relation to the Finnish Agreement and the fact that uranium will be enriched in the Soviet Union- asking about safeguards procedures for toll enrichment- and we are not getting any assistance. From our point of view these are important matters. There is not much point in attacking the Soviet Union on the basis of having bugging devices here as though it is a pleasant exercise and in the same context not telling anything about nuclear safeguards arrangements with that country from the point of view of uranium supplied to Finland. </para>
          <para>Let me put the issue clearly because we do not think there is any need for secrecy to the extent it has been indicated to the Parliament In the past, questions asked as to who got the safeguards agreement from the point of view of draft proposals had never been answered. Even today we still do not know to which countries this type of agreement has been forwarded; with which countries we are apparently negotiating. But we do know about some of the countries and I advert to those situations, because we are told that it is going to include the Republic of Korea, </para>
          <para class="block">Iran, Sweden, the European Economic Community and Japan. We do not want to single out any one country on any special basis but let us look at it from Australia&#39;s point of view. What about the tragic events that have occurred in Iran in recent weeks? This is important from the point of view of what happens to uranium processes in that country. The real question is not what the Shah&#39;s intentions may be but what bis successors &#39; intentions may be. </para>
          <para>We are dealing with a period of time that is going to take us into the 2 1st century. What safeguards are there in those types of countries with all the difficulties that they face at present? Change can take place very rapidly. It is well known that there have been difficulties in the Republic of Korea for some time. They are locked into a situation which is almost a perpetual threat to peace, if not a war and there is a threat to any future proposals to the stability of the region. As a result of a recent report by the United States House of Representatives Committee on International Relations, we know that some study was apparently taking place in relatively recent years on the possibility of nuclear weapons being produced in Korea. The fact is that these preparations were made within the Government in Korea which at that time was party to a Safeguards Agreement with the United States of America. I am told that a major factor in thwarting the move by South Korea in that direction was pressure brought to bear by the United States. This related particularly to the intention of Korea to purchase nuclear reprocessing equipment from France. I want to stress the point that the solution to that problem was that it barely related to the Safeguards Agreement, and related to the fact that the United States decided to exercise its military and political strength to indicate to those governments that it wanted something else done. </para>
          <para>We do not want this grandstanding and this posturing on the basis that something can be adequately protected in a series of words which we are not able to debate here. It is not good enough to be talking about this being good politics from Australia&#39;s viewpoint. Let us look at the Model Safeguards Agreement. We have tried to raise this before. We say article 7 of the Model Safeguards Agreement is weak. Under that Model Agreement any signatory country can reprocess our uranium, thereby producing fissile material, with our consent In its agreement with Finland, the Government removed from Article 7 all reference to concern that weapons-usable material should not be stockpiled. Instead, it endorsed reprocessing for waste management. This is a process which, by definition, separates weapons usable material for stockpiling. </para>
          <para>It also strengthens Finland&#39;s hand and weakens its own by agreeing in article 10 to an arbitration clause which effectively removes control from Australia. </para>
          <para>The Philippines Agreement incorporated the same weaknesses and went further. Article 5 of the Philippines Agreement, which is Article 4 of the Model and Finland agreements, removed from the Agreement any explicit reference to the need for Non-Proliferation Treaty safeguards to be in place. Article 7 of the Philippines Agreement, that is, Article 6 of the Model and Finland texts, weakened the physical security provisions by taking away requirements of earlier texts for review and updating. </para>
          <para>The people of Australia do not know why the Foreign Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> have been anxious to keep the Model Agreement secret. We do not know why, but we know that that has been the situation. It would appear that they did not want to have this matter debated, on the basis that it might affect the opportunity for buyers. </para>
          <para>We have yet to see the language of Australia&#39;s proposed Safeguards Agreement with Britain. European Council of Ministers took exception to that agreement and it will not go ahead. One thing to which it took particular exception was the Prime Minister&#39;s announcement that the agreement had been reached, and he said that at a Press Conference during his 1978 European tour. That is the situation; we can hear about it all over the world except in this Parliament. It is becoming clear that this Government&#39;s policies on uranium are not determined by any rational approach but by the pressure of what suits the Prime Minister from the point of view of grandstanding and what might be suiting the Deputy Prime Minister from the point of view of export revenue. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister&#39;s so-called disarmament policies are perverted by the pursuit of uranium contracts. The Deputy Prime Minister&#39;s obsession with the sales of uranium does nothing for our own future energy needs. As I said before, he really weakens the standing of the Foreign Minister. In the context both of them, he stands as a political neuter. What stimulated the Foreign Minister to make this statement today we are at a loss to understand. </para>
          <para>It contains no new matter. It is matter which we should have been able to obtain as far back as April this year. The things which have been done by this Government in the uranium field over the last year contribute nothing to nuclear nonproliferation. The problem still exists and continues to expand as nations acquire more nuclear industry and more nuclear material. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I present the annual report of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for the year ended 30 June 1978. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in tabling the annual report of my Department for 1977-78, I wish to inform the House that the Government has recently completed a review of certain basic policies in Aboriginal affairs. This review is part of a continuing process of review and assessment in which increasingly Aboriginals themselves will be involved through institutions such as the Council for Aboriginal Development established by the Government for this purpose. </para>
          </talk.start>
		  <para>Coalition Government Policies, 1975 Statement</para>
        <para class="block">The review of Government policies in Aboriginal affairs took place against the background of the Government parties&#39; policies, announced in 1975. The 1975 statement committed the Coalition &#39;to the principle that all Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders should be as free as other Australians to determine their own varied futures&#39;. It recognised the fundamental right of Aboriginals to retain their racial identity and traditional lifestyle or, where desired, to adopt partially or wholly a European lifestyle. It expressed the intention to finance programs which develop Aboriginal self-sufficiency and which represent initiatives that Aborigines themselves believe will enhance their dignity, self-respect and selfreliance&#39;. It also expressed an intention to promote cross-cultural understanding. In particular, the statement indicated that a Coalition Government would &#39;respond with new initiatives &#39; to Aboriginal claims to self-management, land rights, additional funds and self-sufficiency. </para>
        <para>In respect of self-management, the parties saw Aboriginals playing a leading role in setting long-term goals and objectives, expenditure priorities and program evaluations, as well as assuming responsibility for the success of the programs adopted. Under the land rights heading, the statement recognised that the rights of some tribal clans and reserve communities in the Northern Territory can be satisfied by granting title to their traditional areas of land. For other </para>
        <para class="block">Aboriginals, it looked to alternative forms of land and housing rights to be negotiated. Under the heading of additional funds, the statement referred to an Aboriginal Entitlement Revenue Account for major expenditure on the provision of services and to an Aborigines Entitlement Capital Account, the funds of which were to be invested for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. It placed the provision of these funds in the context of recognition by the coalition parties of &#39;the problems flowing from the past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal people and the community&#39;s resulting responsibility&#39;. </para>
        <para>Finally, the statement under the heading of Aboriginal self-sufficiency promised continuation of the allocation of substantial funds for expenditure on education, health, housing and employment and on special programs to encourage Aboriginal initiative and enterprise. This Government, I believe, has good reason to be proud of what it has done in the three years since it won office in 1975- that is to say, within the normal life of a parliament. It has fulfilled five major commitments. It has through its policy of self-management given Aboriginals a new hope of controlling their own future in the same way as other Australians; it has restored a national forum for the expression of Aboriginal viewsthe National Aboriginal Conference- and at the same time it has created a formal Aboriginal advisory body to the Government which could in time win greater authority; it has legislated to give Aboriginals title to traditional land in the Northern Territory; it has decided to establish an Aboriginal Entitlement Capital Account; and it has decided to legislate for an Aboriginal Development Agency to carry on and extend the work of the Land Fund Commission and the Loans Fund Commission, and thus encourage Aboriginal initiative and enterprise. </para>
		<para>Aboriginal Disadvantages</para>
        <para>It is fitting that such a review should have been undertaken this year, the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, when Australia will be celebrating along with other nations, steps which have been taken because of the Declaration to enhance respect for the dignity of man and his right to live in freedom. There have been important gains and achievements since May 1967, when the people of Australia, by an overwhelming 90 per cent majority, supported the constitutional amendment which gave the Commonwealth concurrent power with the States to make special laws for Aboriginals. The near unanimity which the Australian electorate displayed in that referendum has been reflected in the intervening years in the general support for government policies, originating from both sides of this House, designed to bring justice to citizens of this country long denied the basic standards and freedoms which other Australians take for granted. </para>
        <para>But important achievements as I have earlier mentioned must not blind us to the tragedy and deprivation which haunt the everyday life of far too many Australian Aboriginal citizens. The significance of such momentous occasions as the handing over of titles to traditional land owners in the Northern Territory has to be set against the facts that Aboriginals as a group have the highest death rate- particularly amongst the very young- the worst health and housing, the lowest educational, occupational, economic, social and legal status of any identifiable section of our population. Australian Governments, both Commonwealth and State, in consultation with our Aboriginal citizens, have a national duty and a moral and political obligation to remedy this extreme state of disadvantage. I propose in this statement to concentrate upon the results of the Government&#39;s review of the basic policies of self-management and self-sufficiency and the need for better co-ordination of our assistance programs. I shall touch upon developments in land rights and related matters, and conclude by looking at the road ahead for Aboriginals over the next decade. </para>
		<para>Broad Approach to Aboriginal Policies</para>
        <para>Following the review, the Government has reaffirmed its broad approach. This approach seeks to secure for Aboriginals access to government services equal to that accorded other Australian citizens together with additional services appropriate to their state of extreme disadvantage of which I have already spoken. In addition, we have sought to discharge the community obligation, deriving from the past dispossession and dispersal of Aboriginal people, by providing certain limited special benefits not available to other citizens. Because of the unique character of this response, these benefits have for the most part been placed before Parliament for its consideration. An increasingly important and deliberate factor in this general approach is the wish of Aboriginals themselves, which they have conveyed to me, to contribute on an increasing scale to the well-being of the Australian nation as a whole. Effective financial assistance on the basis of welldocumented, community-based programs, together with the recognition by white Australians of Aboriginal values, is opening the way to Aboriginals to enrich Australia&#39;s culture and broaden our national aspirations. </para>
		<para>Self-Management</para>
        <para>The Commonwealth sees self-management as the key to the implementation of its policies. In essence, the policy of self-management requires that Aboriginals, as individuals and communities, be in a position to make the same kinds of decisions about their future as other Australians customarily make, and to accept responsibility for the results flowing from those decisions. The issue is one of Aboriginals exercising authority with responsibility. The Government sees this policy as offering to Aboriginals a means of breaking out from the state of dependence which has for so long enchained them. In any society, decision-making and responsibility are essential to the restoration of self-respect and to the removal of the social maladies of despondency, inertia and resignation. This policy is generally recognised as appropriate for application to groups of people in a state of dependency as a minority in countries dominated by other cultures. </para>
        <para>In advancing this concept of self-management the Government seeks to open the way to Aboriginals to enjoy the same rights as other Australians who, as individuals or in co-operation with others and in some cases with Government support, make choices as to their lifestyle and decide to have a say in their community affairs, to provide services for themselves, to conduct businesses and to make their own decisions within the law of the land, recognising the rights and obligations which flow from that. This policy has been evolving over a period of years. It is a contrast to earlier attitudes in which solutions to Aboriginal problems tended to be imposed upon Aboriginals by governments and officials and missionaries without sufficient thought to the needs and aspirations of Aboriginals as seen by Aboriginals themselves. We believe, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has said, that the day when officials could decide what was good for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are finished. </para>
        <para class="block">Self-management at National Level </para>
        <para>At the national level, the two all-Aboriginal institutions established by this Government- the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development- are completing their establishment phase. They can be expected to take on more responsibilities in the years to come. For example, I expect the National Aboriginal Conference at its annual conference next March to be expressing views about objectives and priorities for expenditure on Aboriginal affairs and about programs which are now under way. The Conference, as a national forum for Aboriginal citizens, will no doubt be making its views known directly through resolutions and delegations to members of this Parliament. I have invited the Council for Aboriginal Development, as the formal advisory body to the Government on Aboriginal policies, to review over the next year or so the whole range of Government policies and to let me have its conclusions. Because of the large scope of this assignment, I have suggested that the first element of the Government policy to be reviewed should be self-management. I have also formally sought the advice of the Council for Aboriginal Development on the principles to be embodied in the legislation to establish the Aboriginal Development Agency. </para>
		<para>Regional and State Level</para>
        <para>At regional and State level also, the views of Aboriginals are being taken more and more into account. As honourable members will know, the NAC operates at State as well as Federal level. Its State branches are available for consultation with State authorities should they so desire. I understand that, for example, the Northern Territory Government intends to use the State branch of the NAC as an advisory body. I commend this approach to other State governments. NAC members in South Australia are fully involved in the State government machinery for co-ordination and advice on expenditure of Commonwealth grants by State government departments. The publicity given to the negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Land Council should not obscure the influence which Aboriginal organisations in such different fields as legal aid, Aboriginal health and the fight against alcoholism are exerting well beyond their initial locations. It is at local level in the 800 or more separate Aboriginal communities in Australia that selfmanagement offers its greatest opportunities and faces its greatest tests. </para>
		<para>The Outstation Movement</para>
        <para>One notable result of Aboriginals being able to choose their lifestyles is the outstation movement. Outstations involve small groups of Aboriginals, generally family groups, moving away from more established communities in order to live on or closer to their traditional lands and to maintain a tradition oriented lifestyle. There are now 148 outstations and the movement is gathering momentum. It is true that the movement presents some problems for State and local governments whose responsibility it is to provide, for example, educational and medical services. These problems are not only financial. There is also a requirement for flexibility and imagination to ensure that the services provided are appropriate to the needs and wishes of small separate communities and that they utilise the skills available from Aboriginals resident in the outstations. I believe that given good will and imagination, these kinds of problems can be resolved. It is accepted that prior consultation with Commonweath and State authorities should take place before Aboriginals move to outstations and that, in the early stages at any rate, Department of Aboriginal Affairs&#39; grants should be directed to the provision of basic necessities such as water, shelter, communications and transport. While the responsibility for the provision of essential services to outstation communities lies with State, Territorial and local authorities, it is also accepted that supplementary grants may be considered to those authorities to encourage them to undertake these increased responsibilities. </para>
        <para>The Government has endorsed its commitment, and approved guidelines against the background of consultation between departmentsCommonwealth and State- and communities, to the provision of services and support to outstations in a manner that takes account of Aboriginal lifestyles. </para>
		<para>Larger Settlements</para>
        <para>There are other communities at local level who choose to remain in larger settlements. They too have now the opportunity to manage their own affairs in a variety of ways. They may wish to provide municipal type services. They may wish to join together in housing associations to build and manage groups of houses. They may wish to run a business. There is now the possibility of their incorporating under State or Commonwealth law for these purposes. </para>
		<para>Assessment of Progress</para>
        <para>No matter what form self-management at local level may take, it offers to Aboriginal communities opportunities to manage their lives in ways acceptable to them and to make decisions affecting their futures. It is sometimes said that the administrative processes required of incorporated bodies whether under State or Federal legislation are too complex for ready application to Aboriginal communities. In a sense this criticism is a misreading of the meaning of selfmanagement, which does not require that Aboriginals immediately administer or manage projects. Control of detailed administration can come later when skills have been developed. </para>
        <para>The Government monitors progress in selfmanagement on a regular basis. It acknowledges that the pattern which presents itself is uneven. There are, for example, claims that block grant funding, that is, the handing over of grants to be spent as Aboriginal communities decide, is the only way to promote a full sense of responsibility. But Aboriginal communities already have a large degree of autonomy in determining priorities within a known financial allocation, and increasingly have come to accept, indeed to welcome, their accountability under present financial rules for their disposal of government moneys. There are cases were poor management and exploitation by white employees have occurred leading to loss of interest on the part of Aboriginals who should be taking their responsibilities. But the outlook overall gives grounds for confidence. In this connection, I commend to honourable members a special section of the annual report of my Department entitled Communities with Confidence in the Future&#39;. </para>
		<para>Conclusions</para>
        <para class="block">In acknowledging that the pattern is uneven, the Government&#39;s response is not to put the clock back but to treat each situation on its merits and to place particular emphasis on training and relevant assistance. The effects of training on any scale may not be evident for some time to come. The Government recognises that the process of achieving self-management at a standard which will not involve frustration and/or the misuse of some Government funds is likely to be slow and painful. It is to be noted that no alternative has been proposed by which Aboriginals may escape the state of dependence without losing their identity and culture. Having reviewed the progress in self-management, the Government has endorsed its commitment to the policy at all levels with appropriate training and development of self-reliance recognising that this will involve consultation and co-ordination between departments, both Commonwealth and State, and with communities themselves. </para>
        <para class="block">Self-sufficiency </para>
        <para class="block">Turning now to the policy of self-sufficiency, I remind honourable members that before the advent of white settlers, Aboriginal communities in Australia were entirely self-sufficient. They had a stable population. They lived in ways which enabled them to achieve cultural and economic balance. They owed no man anything. Now they find themselves: </para>
        <para>Strangers and afraid, </para>
        <para>In a world they never made &#39;. </para>
        <para>Self-sufficiency is the economic face of selfmanagement. It is therefore a question of the Government providing appropriate guidance and assistance for Aboriginal communities and individuals to adapt as circumstances and their needs allow to the new physical and social environment. Aboriginals have no way of going back, through the outstation movement or by any other means, to the economic independence of pre-white settlement times. Self-sufficiency now has to be defined in terms of money incomes and the things in our society like money and property, which are the source of money incomes. </para>
        <para>By such a definition Aboriginals, whether in remote, rural or urban areas, find themselves at a disadvantage compared with other Australians. Where they live in areas with little or no economic potential, their prospects for self-sufficiency are minimal. In fact, nearly all remote Aboriginal communities do not wish, for a variety of reasons, mainly cultural, to move to areas of greater economic potential. The only dramatic breakthrough may come from mining and the organised distribution of royalties. There are, therefore, limitations on what it is possible to do by administrative means other than through grants from the Government of the kinds now being made. Nevertheless, Aboriginal selfsufficiency is being encouraged by the following means: Land ownership; expansion of employment opportunities; training programs; support for limited economic initiatives; home ownership; support for outstation movements; increased Aboriginal contributions to financial and other aid projects. </para>
		<para>Land Ownership</para>
        <para>Land ownership is conferred through legislation such as the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and by purchases through the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. I shall refer to these in more detail later in this statement. </para>
		<para>The National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals</para>
        <para>This Government has designed, and is now putting into effect, a national employment strategy for Aboriginals. My colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street),</inline> and I have together reviewed progress in putting the strategy, I first announced in 1977, into effect. In a period when Aboriginal unemployment is running at probably five to six times the national average, spectacular results cannot be expected m the short term. Indeed it is disappointing to record that the number of Aboriginals unemployed increased by some 20 per cent over the past 12 months and some 15,158 Aboriginals were registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service throughout Australia at the end of October. The Government has established a broadly based National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> K. Miller, General Manager and Director, Hastings Deering (Queensland) Ltd, to oversight a national campaign to stimulate job opportunities and particularly to persuade employers, private and government, to ensure equal job opportunities for Aboriginals. The Government has recently approved expenditure of some $330,000 for the current financial year. We need the cooperation of the whole Australian community in improving Aboriginal job opportunities. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and I reiterate our previous appeal to government authorities, private sector employers, trade unions and the community in general to play a positive role. The Prime Minister has written to State Premiers asking them to support the various initiatives contained in the strategy. </para>

        <para>Amongst the particular Commonwealth schemes which are in hand to stimulate Aboriginal employment, I single out Community Development Employment Projects. These are developed in response to specific requests from communities for an alternative to unemployment benefits through payment for work done on projects chosen by the communities as being meaningful to them. Employment under Community Development Employment Projects is an alternative to unemployment benefits and where individuals in a community are offered work under such a project, this constitutes a work test and rejection of an offer brings to a close their eligibility for unemployment benefits. The essence of CDEPs is that they are instituted only at the request of communities and are without prejudice to the principle that individual Aboriginals are entitled to exactly the same social security benefits as other Australians. A special campaign has been undertaken by the Commonwealth Employment Service which has resulted in an increase to 7,150 in the number of Aboriginals placed in jobs in the 12 months ending May. The Aboriginal involvement in the National Employment and Training scheme will be extended. This has already grown from 1,298 Aboriginals under training in March 1977 to 2,130 in May 1978 and 2,572 in September 1978. The Commonwealth is taking action through one strand of NESA to improve employment and training opportunities for Aboriginals in its departments and authorities. </para>
		<para>Conclusions</para>
        <para>As with self-management, the results of the Government&#39;s policies leading to self-sufficiency are uneven. For example, there are some successful pastoral operations and smaller economic ventures. But many economic projects are hampered from the start by lack of training, lack of suitability and lack of motivation, and because they have not been seen as genuine Aboriginal initiatives. Nevertheless, bearing in mind that the project is long term in character, the Government has, as a result of its recent review, endorsed its commitment to the support of selfsufficiency in community development. In so doing, it has taken note of the particular measures being taken to develop skills and resources through education, through the national employment strategy and through further experiments in innovative projects which give communities control over economic assets. The Government believes all these projects should be the subject of proper evaluation and is therefore in consultation with Aboriginal groups, carrying out such evaluations in appropriate circumstances. </para>
		<para>Australian Aboriginal Development Agency</para>
        <para>In relation to the development of Aboriginal self-sufficiency, the Government attaches considerable importance to its decision of 26 October announced to this House to legislate for the creation of an Aboriginal Development Agency which will embrace the present functions of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission and the Aboriginal Loans Commission and take over from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs the administration of its enterprise program. The Government will be looking to the Agency not only to carry on existing measures on existing scales but to put forward for consideration new kinds of programs designed to contribute to the self-sufficiency of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. In company with the decision to create a new agency, the Government has also, in accordance with the coalition parties&#39; joint policy statement of 1975, decided to establish an Aboriginal entitlement capital account. The new account will be used to fund the operation of the statutory authority. It will receive all the funds currently available to the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, the Aboriginal Loans Commission and the enterprise vote of the </para>
        <para class="block">Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Additional funding to start the process of building up the account will be considered in the 1979 budgetary context. The new agency will provide a means through which Aboriginals may determine thenown needs and priorities and participate in decision-making affecting their economic and social place in the fabric of the nation. I look forward to the support of honourable members on both sides of the House in developing this new Agency. </para>
		<para>Land Rights</para>
        <para>Before Europeans came to settle in Australia, Aboriginals were the undisputed owners of the land, but European settlement dispossessed the Aboriginal people of their land, and dispersed many from their traditional areas. Our 1975 election platform recognised that the Aboriginals &#39; affinity with the land is fundamental to thensense of identity. This vital element in our Aboriginal affairs&#39; strategy was given effect within the Northern Territory with the proclamation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act in January 1977. This Act restored traditional Aboriginal ownership of the areas that had been historically set aside in reserves and allowed Aboriginals opportunities to obtain title to traditional land outside reserves where this had not been alienated. It has opened up for Aboriginals in the Territory important new opportunities for self-management and for self-sufficiency. By giving Aboriginals proprietary rights over their traditional lands, it provides an economic base which Aboriginals may use in ways they wish, and it puts them, rather than government, in a position to shape their own future and protect their own interests as they wish. As I mentioned earlier, I had the great honour in September of this year, of presenting land title documents to Northern Territory communities occupying Aboriginal reserves in ceremonies in Central Australia and Arnhem Land. </para>
		<para>Aboriginal Land Commission</para>
        <para>The land rights legislation for the Northern Territory provided for the establishment of the Aboriginal Land Commission. I have this week presented to Parliament the first report of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toohey. I therefore now do no more than note the importance of this office in the overall land rights policies for the Northern Territory and convey the Government&#39;s appreciation to the commissioner. </para>
		<para>Aboriginal Land Fund</para>
        <para>In the Government&#39;s overall approach to land rights, the Aboriginal Land Fund has an important place. It is through this Fund that, in accordance with the policy statement of 1975, the Government has had the opportunity of making lands available, not only to tribal Aboriginals living on or near their traditional areas which are not on reserves, but to non-tribal Aboriginals in rural or urban areas. Purchases by the Land Fund Commission have continued in this Government&#39;s period of office. They will continue when the Land Fund Commission is incorporated into the new Aboriginal Development Agency with the added advantage that the same authority will control not only the funds available for purchases but also the funds available for development of properties purchased. </para>
          <para>Assistance Programs</para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s aim is to relate its assistance programs directly to the wishes and priorities of Aboriginal communities. A system of consultation has been instituted which increasingly encompasses other Federal and State authorities, and ensures that the totality of aid is a response to community priorities and that there is maximum Aboriginal participation in preparation, planning and implementation of projects. The policy basis for all assistance programs is declared each year in my ministerial directive which is reproduced in the annual report. An essential part of the self-management process is acceptance by Aboriginals of responsibility for the outcome of projects which they have initiated. Accountability through observance of financial rules is being insisted upon and has been widely accepted. In addition, there is now a systematic review of projects conducted by departmental review teams. Since May 1977, 310 projects have been examined. One hundred and forty-five of these projects have been the subject of major reports including appropriate recommendations to regional directors to ensure that projects meet the objectives set by the individual Aboriginal communities affected. </para>
        <para class="block">Co-ordination </para>
        <para>The Government has in the course of its review endorsed my role in the co-ordination of measures to implement its Aboriginal policies in all fields and has agreed on appropriate coordination procedures. These will include a meeting in December- January of each year of a Commonwealth standing committee of officials at which my Department and functional departments and agencies will be able to discuss their plans and programs. At regional and local levels  community reviews are to take place every six months. Officers of my Department will invite all authorities with aid responsibilities to take part, together with the NAC member concerned, so that assistance programs can be co-ordinated, duplication and waste avoided, and outcomes of programs assessed. To enable the Government&#39;s Aboriginal policies to be achieved, my Department&#39;s responsibilities have this year been redefined as: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The development, in consultation with the Aboriginal people, of national policies directed to the advancement of the Aboriginal people, the administration of those policies, and the co-ordination of programs. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">None of these responsibilities affects the basic responsibility of Commonwealth and State functional departments and agencies to deliver and finance services to Aboriginals as to other citizens. The Government accepts as a general principle that Commonwealth departments should ensure that in programs administered by them the needs of Aboriginals are accorded due priority on the basis of need. The Aboriginal populations of the States are included in general revenue reimbursement calculations, and the Commonwealth Government expects that the States will provide at least a pro rata share to Aboriginals in their own welfare programs, and in those supported by the Commonwealth, and apply the priority of need principle in respect of Commonwealth funds made available for welfare purposes. I am very conscious of the need for consultation with the State authorities, in particular where financial decisions or new initiatives will affect existing State services. Consultation, co-ordination, accountability and review are elements in the process of upgrading the effectiveness of departmental assistance programs. I have already referred to the action the Government has been taking to increase employment opportunities for Aboriginals. </para>

		<quote>
          <para>Training</para>
        <para>The Government recognises that real Aboriginal selfmanagement and self-sufficiency can only be achieved if adequate and effective training is provided. We are determined that it will be provided. This is why this year&#39;s Budget provides, for the first time, finance for a separate and distinct Aboriginal training program. </para>
          <para>Education</para>
        <para>In the field of education, it is significant that the 1 97 1 Census revealed that nearly one-quarter of all Aboriginals not then attending schools had never attended school. This is striking evidence of the past neglect and inadequacies which were typical in respect of the provision of almost all services to Aboriginals. By the end of 1977 there had been a substantial improvement. Almost 13,000 Aboriginal children were studying at secondary schools and were receiving Commonwealth study assistance. At the same time, approximately 2,500 Aboriginals- mainly young adults- were studying a variety of courses at technical and tertiary institutions. In contrast to earlier policies, an important element in the development of current educational programs is the encouragement of Aboriginal participation from community to national level, including the establishment in 1977 of the National Aboriginal Education Committee, an all Aboriginal body. This Committee provides Aboriginal advice on education needs and appropriate means of meeting them. A range of special education programs is now available to Aboriginals in all categories from pre-school to technical and further education. Special Aboriginal student assistance schemes encourage Aboriginals to take up educational opportunities. </para>
          <para>Housing</para>
        <para>The Government gives a high priority to overcoming the effects of years of neglect which have resulted in a deplorable housing situation for Aboriginals. Since 1968 approximately 7,000 houses have been constructed or purchased for Aboriginals using Commonwealth finance, to provide accommodation for between 30,000 and 40,000 people. In addition, over 2,000 hostel beds have been provided through Aboriginal Hostels Limited. The Government has allocated a further $40m for Aboriginal housing programs in 1978-79- some one-third of the total programs allocation to my Department- which demonstrates our priority for housing and determination to sustain our effort. </para>
          <para>Health</para>
        <para>Although Aboriginal access to health services at all levels has improved markedly in recent years, the general health status of Aboriginals remains low. The Government&#39;s aim is to provide, as soon as possible, equality both of access and outcome for Aboriginals in respect of health services, and to raise the health standards of Aboriginals to those enjoyed by the general Australian community. Aboriginal medical services, managed by Aboriginals, play an effective role in the delivery of health services to Aboriginals. My Department now supports 10 Aboriginal medical services in metropolitan areas and in large country towns. Services now operate in Brisbane, Townsville, Redfern, Kempsey, and Melbourne, Bairnsdale, Shepparton, Port Augusta, Perth and Alice Springs. </para>
        <para>In addition, the Government in the past year has supported the establishment of three community-based health services on a pilot basis in the Central Australian region, with the community assuming responsibility for all aspects of planning, management and delivery of services. Among other things, these services employ ngangkaris, or traditional healers, to work as colleagues alongside salaried doctors, nurses and Aboriginal health workers. Initially, the services are giving attention to meeting immediate health needs with the provision of basic health care and curative services, but it is envisaged that they will increasingly move into preventive and promotive activities. Honourable members will be aware that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs has this year been inquiring into the whole question of Aboriginal health. This inquiry has my full support and I look forward to having its findings and recommendations to assist the Government in overcoming the health problems of Aboriginal Australians. </para>
          <para>Alcohol Problems of Aboriginals</para>
        <para>The same Committee issued its final report on the Alcohol Problems of Aboriginals in November 1977. This report emphasised the importance of preventive measures in the Aboriginal alcohol program, of supporting community decisions to restrict alcohol consumption and of supporting Aboriginal-run rehabilitation and follow-up services. The Government recognises- as do the Aboriginal people themselves- how crucial it is for Aboriginals as individuals and as communities to limit alcohol abuse and control its effects. Priority is being given to programs in this field. Some 33 Aboriginal-run alcohol rehabilitation centres and related projects are being supported by my Department. It is in part a measure of the effect of alcohol abuse that, on a population basis, Aboriginals are grossly over-represented in our courts, prisons and corrective institutions. Prison statistics indicate that Aboriginals charged with offences in the courts have a much greater probability of being convicted and jailed than other Australians. </para>
          <para>Civil Liberties</para>
        <para>Eleven independent Aboriginal legal services operating from nearly SO offices in all States and the Northern Territory are providing legal advice and representation for Aboriginals involved in both criminal and civil legal matters. Although a number of measures already exist in the States and the Northern Territory, last year I instructed my Department to promote a strategy, in co-operation with the States and the Northern Territory, for action to overcome problems which Aboriginals encounter in their dealings with police. The strategy encompasses measures such as the establishment of police-Aboriginal liaison systems; recruitment of Aboriginal police and police aides; the institution of training schemes to assist police in recognising the particular needs of Aboriginals; improvement in police complaints procedures; and procedural reforms relating to the detention and interrogation of Aboriginals. </para>
        <para>A particular problem area of Aboriginal relations with the law concerns Aboriginal juvenile offenders. My Department, in co-operation with the States, is seeking to promote uniform and adequate protections for Aboriginal juveniles questioned by the police or charged in court. The Australian Law Reform Commission is continuing its study of the possibilities of applying or otherwise recognising Aboriginal customary law in the administration of justice. This reference was given to the Commission in response to requests by many Aboriginal communities in the north for help in handling law and order problems in their communities and for recognition of the problems they face in adapting their traditional forms of social control to their contemporary situation. I believe,, that this kind of initiative by Aboriginal people typifies the quite revolutionary changes that have occurred in Aboriginal life in the past decade. </para>
          <para>The Road Ahead</para>
        <para>Aboriginals are no longer, as they once were, a silent minority, the largely passive and remarkably tolerant recipients of whatever policies and programs governments and their officials in their wisdom decided were good for them. They have stepped forward to grasp new opportunities, to make their own decisions, to make their voice heard and to make a positive and important contribution to the cultural, social, economic and political life of the Australian nation. They have found a new dignity and a new pride in being Aboriginal. It is this change, rather than the evidence of improvements in educational and health status or figures on the number of houses provided by and for Aboriginals, which really provides a measure of the effects of the Aboriginal affairs&#39; policies that have been applied over the last decade. </para>
        <para class="block">It is this change which, I believe, should give us all, and particularly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves, great hope for the future. </para>

            <para>- The recent negotiations of the Northern Land Council on the terms and conditions for mining of uranium at Ranger and Nabarlek, and the leasing of land for the Kakadu National Park, are only the first of many occasions when Aboriginals, with their own expert advisers, will deal with governments and corporations on a basis of equality to negotiate the conditions on which their lands can be used by others. The new political strength of the Aboriginal voice has also been reflected in the attention given to Aboriginal affairs in this Parliament in recent years. It is reflected in the new significance of the Aboriginal vote in elections. Gone is the indifference of political aspirants towards Aboriginals as voters. The Government welcomes these developments and, to ensure that this political involvement is available to aU Aboriginals no matter what life- style they choose to live, has approved a comprehensive program of electoral education for Aboriginal people living in non-urban areas. This program will commence in March next year and is planned to run on a national basis for at least three years. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Today, Australians generally recognise the value of the Aboriginal cultural heritage and the contribution Aboriginals are making to our multi-cultural society. They themselves are very conscious now of their cultural identity and of the extent to which it is everywhere threatened and has in many parts suffered loss through the destructive effects of contact. The Government has been helping Aboriginals throughout Australia to maintain, develop and restore and rebuild their cultural identity through the programs of the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council and through bi-cultural and bilingual education programs. In this context I mention that, in response to requests from several communities, we have been working on proposals for the development of local communitybased broadcasting services for Aboriginals in their own languages. The Postal and Telecommunications Department is currently developing proposals for public broadcasting stations to be operated by certain Aboriginal communities. These will soon be finalised and applications will be invited, these applications to be considered by the Australia Broadcasting Tribunal. In addition, several Aboriginal groups are already making use of the new public radio stations. </para>
          <para>In this modern age, radio and television services are very powerful and influential tools of knowledge and understanding. I have taken steps to ensure that Aboriginals are not deprived of this by directing the Government&#39;s working party on Aboriginal broadcasting to give first consideration to remote communities. Accordingly, the major Aboriginal languages which could be serviced have already been identified. I shall be reporting in due course on the outcome of these new initiatives and on other steps to extend broadcasting services, both radio and television, to remote communities in the north. </para>

          <para>Conclusion</para>
        <para>In this statement I have presented the results of the Government&#39;s review of its policies. Other aspects of policy will be reviewed from time to time by Aboriginal bodies as well as by the Government. I have tried to give Parliament a balanced picture. I do not underestimate the obvious difficulties yet to be resolved but I believe that there is a firm foundation on which to make progress in future. The Government has prepared this foundation by taking decisive steps to put into effect its policy commitments to selfmanagement, land rights and self-sufficiency. It has established the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development. It has legislated for land rights in the Northern Territory. It has decided to proceed with the Aboriginal entitlement capital account and to legislate for an Aboriginal development agency. It has expanded the scope of existing assistance programs. Its policy initiatives are extending to new areas, such as law reform and special broadcasting facilities. </para>
        <para>There is no doubt in my mind that the Government has created conditions in which significant changes in Aboriginal outlook and expectations are taking place. In the changing context of Aboriginal affairs, the Government&#39;s policies are a proper and effective response to die legitimate aspirations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. I am encouraged by the marked degree of support which the Government&#39;s initiatives have received in the wider community. Many church and community organisations have indicated such support Many of their statements have urged the Government to do more than it is able to do at present with the funds at its disposal. Indeed, an opinion poll taken earlier this year found that 44 per cent of people surveyed believe that the Commonwealth and the States are not doing enough in Aboriginal affairs. I welcome such interest and good will as a healthy sign of community commitment to our common aims in Aboriginal affairs. With such support from the Australian community, I believe that Aboriginal Australians can look forward with confidence to years of progress ahead firmly based on foundations which this Government has built I present the following paper </para>

            <para>- The pleasant document presented to this House by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> as so commonly in this portfolio, highlights his Government&#39;s hypocrisy. It falls far short of his assessment of it as a balanced document. The Government&#39;s 1975 policy on Aboriginal affairs was a hurried attempt before an election to improve its old policy and bring it more into line with the achievements and policies of the Labor Government. This Government&#39;s implementation of that policy has been pathetic. In some respects it has moved the opposite way. There has been an impediment and a dismantling, not implementation. Contrary to what the Minister has said, I believe that this Government has no reason to be proud of what it has done in the area of Aboriginal affairs since it came to office. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister claims that five major commitments have been fulfilled. Let us look at these. The first is self-management Let the Minister tell that to the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island. Let him tell the Maningrida people, whose chosen advisers he personally sacked after consultation not with the Aborigines but with the white cronies of those the Aboriginals did not want. Let him tell the Aboriginal people in his own State that they are selfmanaging when the Western Australian Government has now placed control of entry onto Aboriginal reserves by  mining  companies into the hands of the Minister for Mines. Let him tell the Oenpelli people, who have got tired of fighting and exposing his deceits. Let him tell the residents of New South Wales reserves that, when he is depriving them until December of the funds allocated this year. Some communities have some self-management, provided by the Minister and his Department. I do not want to knock those communities, but I must stress that wherever the Minister steps in personally to proclaim government initiatives for self-management, Aborigines have learned to watch out for a new act of betrayal and dispossession to help a State, a mining company, or an exploiting European. </para>
          <para>The second claim of the commitments the Minister says have been fulfilled is restoration of the National Aboriginal Conference and the setting up of the Council for Aboriginal court which only reason to restore the NAC was that the Government had destroyed the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. It gave the NAC the same advisory role but allowed it less delegates to fulfil that role- 35 now compared with 41 in the NACC. As usual, this was in line with performance, not policy or promises. The Government has cut everything else in the area of Aboriginal affairs, especially funding. The third claim of a commitment fulfilled related to land rights. We all know what this Government did to the Labor Government&#39;s achievements in the area of land rights. The Labor Government was pressing negotiations for full land rights and equal land rights in the States. What has happened to that under the present Government? There have been no achievements in that area, except the watering down of the Labor Government Bill, making less broad land rights harder to obtain. Let the Minsiter tell the people of Borroloola about bis Government&#39;s achievements in land rights. He sold them out to Mount Isa Mines by delaying purchase of a central pastoral lease, Bing Bong, until the mining interests had made the first bid and bought it. </para>

              <para>- The Minister again challenges me on this, and this is the third time I have raised it in separate debates. The fact is that his Department knew at least two years before that the the Aboriginals wanted that land. It was within the capacity of the Minister to make the funds available to purchase it, but the Aborigines heard of the purchase of Mount Isa Mines only after the event A white caretaker sits there and the traditional owners retreat to the wooded outskirts. The fourth and fifth commitments claimed to have been fulfilled relate to the establishment of the Aboriginal Development Agency. I have already stated in the House that the Opposition endorses the principle behind the ADA Indeed, stated government policies go far to cover Australian Labor Party policies in just about every area of Aboriginal affairs.

              <para>- I am pleased, nevertheless, to have the Minister&#39;s assurance that he has recently approved such a purchase. He spent 24 pages attempting, as always, to kid himself, perhaps his Government, and the Australian people about the Government&#39;s achievements and bona fides, but he puts consultation with the States before consultation with the NAC, and that is the order in which they are mentioned in several of those sentences. He sees the referendum as giving the Austraiian Government concurrent powers with the State governments. Yet he will not ever give Aboriginal requests priority over State demands in such matters. He admits, of course, that Aborigines have the highest death rate, the worst health and housing, higher unemployment- more than 50 per cent- and the lowest educational, occupational, economic, social and legal status of any identifiable section of our population. We submit that the Minister has no reason to be proud of the Government&#39;s response to this disaster area of such magnitude. He approved this year&#39;s Aboriginal housing funding, taking credit for an increase in funds. So there should be an increase in funds. In the first two Budgets after his Government came to office it succeeded in slashing $8m from the level of funding for Aboriginal housing under the Labor Government. This year it is still under that level- 28.5 per cent in real terms- despite the inclusion of a new service category, that is, the training programs the Minister has mentioned today. In real terms, total funding through the Department has dropped by about one-quarter from the level under the last Labor Budget? </para>

          <para>This insensitive implementation of presentable policies has created an intolerable backlog in housing provision, leaving thousands of Aboriginal families with no shelter. Under this Government, there is an eight-year waiting list for Aboriginal housing loans. The Minister tells us every week about Aboriginal consultation and assistance programs. What does he do in reality? He got rid of the consultative body for Aboriginal housing, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Housing Panel. Again, the Opposition believes that the Minister has nothing to be proud of. Even the highest need area of Aboriginal Affairs is not immune to the scandals of this Government There has been no tendering for housing contracts, and we have seen intimidation of housing association employees by a company in the electorate of the Prime Minister attempting to exchange VIP treatment for a building contract, the advance supplying of lists of housing associations with building requirements to that firm following intervention by the Prime Minister- a practice that has no precedent- </para>

          <para class="block">The Minister must be very one-eyed if he thinks that that statement is to his advantage. Certainly in my view it is an understatement. It is perfectly obvious that the Aboriginal people can expect nothing from this Government except subminimum funding once a year, if they are lucky. The people of Aurukun and Mornington Island, the people of the Kimberleys and of Arnhem Land, an know that they can expect only trickery and sellouts from this Government. I think it is a fitting comment by the Aboriginal people on what this Government gives them that yesterday the Aboriginal Lands Trust of New South Wales passed the following resolutions: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That as from the date of this meeting the Office of the Aboriginal Lands Trust is to cut off all consultation with the offices of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs concerning financial matters until such times as the Aboriginal Lands Trust receives meaningful reply to its request to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for its full funding program for New South Wales. </para>
            <para>That a special investigation committee be resolved to look into financial strangulation of the Aboriginal Land Trust and other Aboriginal organisations. </para>
            <para>The Committee is hereby appoined comprising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cruse,</inline> M.B.E. and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Griffith</inline> with the authority to co-opt the services of the Trust as may be required and any other persons whomsoever the Committee deems necessary to look into the financial strangulation of the Aboriginal Lands Trust and other Aboriginal organisations and associated matters. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is important to note that the  Chairman  of the Aboriginal Lands Trust of New South Wales, a member of the newly set up Committee, is also the Eastern Region  Chairman  of the National Aboriginal Council. The Minister&#39;s statement is more than hypocritical. He has forced the New South Wales Land Trust into a position where essential services on reserves have been cut off completely. The reserves have been forced to sack many of their employees including essential Aboriginal field workers. Essential repairs and maintenance for plumbing, sewerage, et cetera have no funds until December. The Minister&#39;s explanation of why he refuses to give the reserves the funds that have been allocated to them in the Budget of last August is that several communities are getting funds direct instead of through the Trust. But several communities are getting nothing. The repair and maintenance funds for the Trust are little better than half the amounts provided for self-managed homes. The Minister has not disclosed why this year&#39;s funds ae being withheld until next month. </para>
          <para>What the public and the Aboriginal people were hoping for when this statement was foreshadowed was an announcement of some major achievement or some dramatic breakthrough. They were hoping for a draft lease for Aurukun, or an acknowledgement by the Northern Land Council that it would consult with Aborigines on their ground in their style and time scale, or perhaps an undertaking that there will be a tightening up of mistakes, such as those made in the appointment of the NAC secretary or in the Stawell Timber Industries deals. But no, this statement is one more public relations exercise. It is an exercise in easing the conscience of the Minister perhaps, or simply an exercise in wearing down the voices of protest. The Minister has lost the trust and respect of the people he serves. Instead of singing the dubious praises of his Government, it would do more for this institution if he set about practising what he preaches in his policies and promises and tried to regain what he has lost. </para>

            <para>- by leave- This statement relates to the June 1978 report of the Senate. Standing Committee on Science and the Environment relating to herbicides, pesticides and human health. Honourable members are aware of the deep community interest in the toxic effects on humans which have been attributed to various agricultural chemicals and in particular their alleged connection with birth defects. Two such chemicals have been singled out by the media in this regard- 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. These, to a large extent, formed the basis of the Senate Committee&#39;s report. It is vital to any consideration of this matter that it be accepted at the outset that many substances, not only herbicides and pesticides, are toxic when used incorrectly or used for a purpose for which they are not designed. Indeed, as one world authority has stated: &#34;There are no harmless substances; there are only harmless ways of using substances&#39;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The use of agricultural chemicals for pest and disease control has for many years been an essential ingredient in increasing levels and quality of agricultural production not only in Australia but throughout the world. Herbicides and pesticides are by their very nature toxic to certain types of living cells. Indeed were this not so they would be totally ineffective for the purpose for which they are manufactured. The aim must be, therefore, to establish safe usage of herbicides and pesticides. This clearly demands that such substances must be exhaustively tested before being put on the market. </para>
          <para>Let me set out at this stage the present procedures for the examination of agricultural chemicals before they are released on the Australian market. Eminent scientific and medical experts in this country study in the utmost detail the results of all the exhaustive tests carried out all over the world. The deliberations and subsequent reports of the various committees and councils on which these experts sit form the basis on which action regarding subsequent use of herbicides and pesticides is taken and on which legislation is based. In this regard I would mention in particular the Australian Agricultural Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. No agricultural chemical is accepted for registration in any part of Australia without these exhaustive studies having been completed and without the recommendations of these bodies on which sit some of our leading experts. These procedures have been in operation for many years and have proved to be entirely satisfactory and at this time I see no reason to suggest any change. </para>
          <para>I now come to the question of the review of all aspects- including safety- relating to agricultural chemicals subsequent to their initial release for general use. It is recognised that it is necessary that all such substances&#39; should be kept under continuous review to ensure that unexpected or untoward effects which may arise at a later date do not pass unnoticed and that appropriate remedial action is taken. I can assure honourable members that the recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Agricultural Council for clearance for registration of agricultural chemicals are kept under constant review and revised as necessary in the light of information obtained from a multitude of worldwide sources. </para>
          <para>In recent years the work associated with the review of these substances has increased in volume and complexity. There have been tremendous advances in technology. In line with this, moves are at present afoot to strengthen my own Department&#39;s ability to meet the challenge. A national drug information service with computer facilities has been established and is at present being further developed. Work is already in progress to expand this into a comprehensive drugs and poisons information service and I feel confident that my ministerial counterparts in the States will be happy to give whatever assistance is required to allow this to progress. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will appreciate that it is essential for those who use chemicals and other potentially dangerous substances to be fully aware of the restrictions in usage, safety directions, precautions and so forth to ensure safety to themselves and others. This is normally accomplished by appropriate labelling. In Australia labelling is controlled by State and Territory legislation and with agricultural chemicals the inclusion of various statements concerning composition, use, directions, limitation, precautions and safety is mandatory. The language used routinely is English. Unfortunately, some members of our community whose command of the language is not entirely adequate could experience some difficulty and it has been suggested that translations into other languages would be the means of overcoming these difficulties. What is generally not appreciated is that the labelling is frequently lengthy and complex and consequently direct translation into several languages is simply not practicable. Difficulties of this nature are recognised and machinery, including the appointment of ethnic liaison officers, has been set up to look into such problems. </para>
          <para>This brings me to the Senate Committee &#39;s final recommendation concerning the examination by the Minister for Health of the current machinery for the systematic collection of information on the occurrence and frequency of congenital abnormalities and of types of cancer. Since the tabling of the report, I have carefully examined the situation and I am confident that much can be done to rectify any deficiencies in data collections which are recognised here in Australia. At the same time I would stress that such deficiencies are by no means confined to this continent but are seen as a worldwide problem. Our present weaknesses are seen to be incomplete data collection in some areas and a lack of coordination on a nationwide scale. Some deficiencies in the machinery for the analysis of collected data are also apparent. </para>
          <para>A need is seen for the collection of more comprehensive information on toxic effects of substances including the underlying causes of birth defects which are not of genetic origin. Indeed I believe it would not be stressing this aspect too far if I were to say that much of the public concern and indeed alarm which has been generated recently could have been allayed if basic data relating to possible extra-genetic causes of foetal abnormalities had been more extensive. </para>
          <para>Whilst recent concern has been concentrated on the possible effects of 2,4,5-T and to a lesser extent 2,4-D, both of which have been extensively researched, there has been little comment on the other environmental factors- some occurring naturally, some generated by man&#39;s inventiveness- which could result in foetal abnormalities. Bearing in mind the need to keep the whole subject in proper perspective, I propose that the following developments should take place: Collection of perinatal statistics should be extended to cover the whole country. This information is currently collected in only two StatesWestern Australia and Tasmania. The next Health Ministers&#39; Conference in June 1979 was to have discussed this extension. However, I am now suggesting to my colleagues in the other four States that we proceed immediately with those discussions as a matter of priority. </para>
          <para>The total cost of extending the data collection system to the other four States is estimated at $ 120,000 per annum which it is suggested should be met on a cost-sharing basis, and the Commonwealth Government is prepared to meet half the cost of this. My counterparts in the States will be approached to obtain their views regarding this. Since the analysis of the data, related to births, from these various statistical systems would need to be performed on a nationwide basis, a national perinatal statistical unit will need to be set up. The cost of this in the next financial year is estimated at $80,000, increasing to $ 100,000 in the following year. </para>
          <para>Collection of information on acute poisonings and cancers is already covered reasonably satisfactorily and, whilst some improvement may be necessary in these fields, major restructuring of systems is not envisaged. The analysis of data in relation to these two aspects is an appropriate function of an expanded national drug poisons information service to which I referred a few moments ago. I am confident that the establishment of these systems will allow more extensive monitoring of the incidence of poisonings, congenital abnormalities and cancers and will allow detection at an early stage of change in disease patterns in the community which might be attributable to toxic environmental substances. </para>
          <para>In order to concentrate specifically on the effects of various substances on pregnant women, I am asking the National Health and Medical Research Council to advise on the feasibility and the desirability of conducting a prospective study extending over possibly 3 years. If such a study were considered to be necessary- and the comments of the experts on the possible additional benefits will be awaited- there is no doubt that costs would be high and could well amount to over $2m a year. </para>
          <para>In the meantime, I reiterate the advice given by the National Health and Medical Research Council in June of this year following a study of all information available at that time regarding 2,4,5-T, 2,4-D and the risks of foetal abnormalities. The conclusions reached by the Council were: Firstly, the use of 2,4-D is not producing any risk to human health; there is no evidence that it is linked to human birth defects; and, secondly, in the light of present knowledge there is no reason to place any additional restrictions on the use of 2,4,5-T. Council could find no substantiated scientific evidence of a causal link between the use of 2,4,5-T and human birth defects. These agricultural chemicals have both been in use for around 30 years and different action to control their use have been taken in various parts of the world. Although a few countries do not use these chemicals, nevertheless, controlled usage has been adopted as the method of choice on a wide scale. </para>
          <para>With the extensive information which has been available and with the advice provided to me by the experts, all of whom are held in high esteem in our community, I see no reason at this time for suggesting any changes in current practices. However, all chemicals must be kept under constant review. I am confident that this will continue to be done in this country and that the extensions to the various data collections which I have suggested will provide us with a system which will compare favourably with any other country.

I  believe that the Opposition spokesman on health, the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman),</inline> will be making a statement on the matter later in the day. Two points which occur to me from the statement of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> perhaps need to be considered. One is the matter of the prospective study which will cost $2m a year to carry out. It invites a comparison with the retrospective study carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr McBride</inline> on thalidomide.  I  suggest that it might be fruitful and far cheaper to do a retrospective study of environmental factors in those areas in which birth defects apparently have been endemic in recent times.  I  have no firm data on which to blame herbicides or anything else, but  I  know that misleading answers were given by a local authority in my area to parents who were involved in a freak cluster of abnormality occurring over a short period in an area in which there was large scale aerial spraying to destroy water weeds. There is still room for retrospective study in areas where deformities have been clustered. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I  would like the Minister to clarify, if not today on some other occasion, the nature of the drug and poisons information service. A service is available at certain poisons information centres. In cases of poisoning doctors can obtain confidential commercial information on the composition of poisons such as cleaning fluids.  I  wonder whether the time has arrived when the general public is entitled to a more frank accessibility to knowledge about poisons, their effects and their handling. The instructions on the label, particularly in the case  I  mentioned with regard to the use of herbicides by a local authority is not always obeyed.  I  believe that there is a need in some cases to tighten up supervision. </para>

          <para>- by leave- Before we leave the House for 1978, 1 would like to pay tribute to the hundreds of people, behind and in front of the scenes who ensure that the Parliament functions effectively and efficiently. All members appreciate the manner in which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> have performed your official duties. Your patience, firm hand and good humour have guided this House through many hours of somewhat too spirited debate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>You have sought at all times to maintain a high level of dignity, decency and fairness in our proceedings for which, I must say, you do not always get the support that you should from all sections of this House. I would also like to congratulate the honourable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Millar)</inline> on the way in which he has carried out his task in his first year as  Chairman  of Committees. You have both been ably assisted by the  Clerk  of the House and his officers. The smooth running of this chamber is in large measure due to the knowledge and experience of these officers of the Parliament. </para>
        <para>We are grateful, too, for the hard work of many other parliamentary officials. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff never fail in their duty to report the parliamentary debates promptly and with an elegance of grammar which frequently surprises the honourable members whose words are recorded, when they read them the following day. I wish the new Principal Parliamentary Reporter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Kerr, every success in his new position. To <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ken</inline> Ingram, who retires next month, after 42 years service with <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I pay a special word of thanks. Over the past decade he has initiated many new procedures which have enhanced the capacity and efficiency of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to report our proceedings. I wish him well in his retirement. </para>
        <para>I also wish to note the retirement during this year of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Les</inline> Moore as Parliamentary Librarian, and the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harold</inline> Weir to succeed him. All honourable members avail themselves of the resources and assistance of the Parliamentary Library. I thank all members of the Library staff for their courteous help to all members, of all political persuasions. The staff of the Table Office, too, deserve our thanks for their attention to members&#39; request for reports and other essential documents. I thank Roger Webb, the Parliamentary liaison officer, who works diligently to ensure that this chamber functions efficiently. </para>
        <para>The First Parliamentary Counsel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Quayle,</inline> and his staff receive our thanks for their achievement in preparing for parliamentary consideration Bills of a consistently high standard. Their skill and attention to detail makes our task much easier. Within this building hundreds of people work quietly behind the scenes to provide refreshment and transport facilities and to ensure that security is maintained at all times. I thank all those involved in this essential work. In particular I would like to remember Gordon Pike who has looked after the personal needs of many members for transport over decades. He has served the Parliament and its members well over many years. You, sir, have already referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Worth</inline> who has assisted as co-ordinator of security in this building. We wish him well in his renewed retirement, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dick</inline> Hillyer who has also served the Parliament well and faithfully in a most important capacity. </para>
        <para>It is not possible, however, to enumerate all those who contribute to the smooth and efficient running of this House. We are conscious at the close of an arduous period of sittings, as we are throughout the year that without the skilled assistance of many people we would not achieve the legislative and representative goals of this Parliament. The major burden of government and of the carriage of the business of this House falls on the members of the Ministry. To them I would like to place on record my personal appreciation for their hard work, dedication and the way in which they have worked together as a team. </para>
        <para>We also owe a debt of gratitude to all the members of the Government parties on whom the Ministry so heavily relies. Their loyalty, energy and contributions to policy and debate are greatly valued by the Government. In these last sittings, we have seen the initiation of an important parliamentary reform- the legislation committees of this House. In the consideration of the seven Bills so far considered by the two committees, honourable members have taken the opportunity to become more fully acquainted with the finer details of complex measures. I am advised that in a non-partisan way in Committee, amendments have been accepted that might well have been difficult to accept through the previous procedures of debate in the Committee of the Whole. </para>
        <para>I believe quite certainly that as time passes this committee system will expand and develop further and may well assist in the process of the Budget debates themselves. Some consideration could be given to the possibility of the Committee stage of the Budget being carried forward in committees, two or more, which could sit concurrently enabling more members to express their views on matters of importance to them. Now that the legislation committee system has been developed, that may well be introduced successfully. It may well be that between now and the passage of the next Budget a proposal in relation to that particular matter could at least be examined to see if the Parliament thought it worth implementation and development in the autumn session for use in the next Budget sittings. A number of worthwhile and constructive amendments have been proposed and accepted through the new and proposed procedure for the Committee stages of Bills. I think it is good to see the Parliament develop procedures which enable a less partisan approach to measures which come before the Parliament I would like to thank the Committees&#39; chairmen, the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> and the honourable member for Scullin <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Jenkins),</inline> for their service and their commitment in getting the committees off the ground in a proper and constructive manner. </para>
        <para>I trust that all members and their families utilise to the full the coming weeks in their various electorates to the best of their own endeavours and I wish all members and their families for the coming period a happy Christmas and a prosperous new year. I hope that we all return to this place next year reinvigorated- for those who feel the need of rein vigoration- for the autumn session, which I have no doubt will be busy and will take our intelligence and time. </para>

          <para>- by leave- I join with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in expressing conventional tributes which are made at this time of the year each year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> it has been a busy year- rather euphemistically from your point of view a demanding and challenging year, even a trying year. We all look forward to the break of the festive season to recharge batteries and return invigorated with new ideas, hopefully to contribute constructively to the big challenges that confront this country in so many ways. As the Prime Minister acknowledged to the extent that we are able to do that with success, we can only do it with the support of so many people who work in this Parliament House or work in houses nearby as staff of the House and help us to discharge our duties in various ways. I forget what the relationship is between people who work in support capacities to keep troops in the front line, and troops in the front line. It is quite a high ratio and from time to time has been commented on as being extraordinarily, if not questionably, high. The ratio in this Parliament is even higher. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am told by the  Clerk  that there are about 1,000 persons working in Parliament House or in buildings associated with this House providing services to keep us functioning one way or the other. Without that sort of help we would be nothing but a beached hulk, as ineffective as that. We are grateful for it. We appreciate the dedication of the people in the various roles they fulfil in this Parliament House which allow us to keep functioning. I do not intend to enumerate them. I believe the Prime Minister has done that effectively. However, I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister&#39;s speech about the possibility of a further reform in parliamentary procedures designed to try to achieve more bipartisanship in the consideration and discharge of various obligations and duties which we have in this Parliament. From the reports which I have received from my colleagues of the Opposition, I can confirm that the new committee system considering legislation at this stage appears to be working well and has been successful in breaking down a substantial degree of political polarity which otherwise would have been evident within the chamber. I added that I sincerely trust that progress will continue. </para>
        <para>I am encouraged by the Prime Minister&#39;s comment about further exploration in this area designed to achieve further progress towards bipartisanship in the things that we have to do here. I said before and I mil say many times again- I hope honourable members will listen to these comments with some patience and restraintthat one of the most encouraging experiences I have had in this Parliament in 17 years was to work on a joint parliamentary committee of inquiry into the pharmaceutical drugs listed under the National Health Scheme. There it was interesting to note the way in which attitudes presented themselves between the various members of the Committee. Some members of the Austraiian Labor Party and some members of the coalition parties would take what we might say would be a more radical view, share it and press it. Some other members of the Labor Party and of the coalition parties would take a more conservative view. Often there would be a shift in that sort of distribution of attitude on the political spectrum. </para>
        <para>That was a particularly valuable experience for me because it showed that unlike the situation in this chamber it is possible, in the final result, to get a great deal of bipartisanship in conclusions about a particular matter put before a group of parliamentarians, but more importantly that this could be achieved with a greater cerebral contribution and with much more harmony than we are used to seeing in this chamber. What I am saying is simply that the debating technique of handling matters of such complexity, as we have to do these days, seems the least effective and desirable way of approaching such responsibilities. I have likened it often enough before to a type of 1 9 1 4- 1 8 trench warfare in which people bed down in their trenches and start blasting one another, little progress being made between the two sides, every one in a fixed battlement position and the outcome pretty much resolved before it even starts. </para>

            <para>- I am trying to give a fairly open approach to what I think can be done. If the honourable member wants to inject some political partisanship into the discussion I am happy to respond. But let us leave it at this level for this occasion. The honourable member did not do too badly this morning either, if I may congratulate him. What I am saying to the Prime Minister, through you <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> is that the Opposition is keen to follow up the suggestion that he has conveyed. We believe that there is room for a wide range of reform in this Parliament. I say this in a purely objective sense. I believe that there is a need for vast improvement in the way in which we handle Question Time in this Parliament. It is defective as it now operates, and it has been all the time that I have been a member of Parliament, regardless of which party has been in government It is very easy for any Minister answering a question to ignore the substance of that question if he wishes. That is not a particularly productive undertaking in my view. It does not contribute at all helpfully to a consideration and better understanding of the great issues before this Parliament and for which we are responsible to the nation. I would like to see a system at Question Time during which questions are put on notice and certain Ministers could appear on certain selective days in this House to answer those questions. Honourable members would have the right to ask supplementary questions. The honourable member for Holt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Yates)</inline> I expect would be well aware of this system. I believe that would lead to a much more effective communications system for the public and the Parliament and be a far better test of how well a Minister is handling his responsibility. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There are a range of other matters which we ought to be looking at too in relation to the functioning of the Parliament so that we could reduce the level of artificial polarity that exists in this Parliament. I do not pretend for a minute that I am totally innocent in this respect but I do not accept for a minute that I am totally responsible for it either. It is the nature of our system and the way in which it functions that this exists and will continue to. Accordingly, I would like to see a situation in which we set up a committee of inquiry to investigate very broadly ways in which we can reform the broad perspective of the functioning of this Parliament </para>
        <para>I feel that I have gone far enough in that direction. I am really on my feet to join in an expression of tribute to all those people who have helped us. The Prime Minister has commended his Government members. I also commend the members of the Opposition for the assiduous way in which they have fulfilled the various tasks which they have as parliamentarians, for the dedicated way in which they have worked to represent their electorates and for the effective way in which they have performed as an Opposition. I trust that aU families enjoy the festive season. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I hope you come back in a relaxed frame of mind and are prepared confidently to accept the new challenges that lie ahead of you and the Parliament in the new year. </para>

          <para>- by leave- I would like briefly to join in the remarks that have been expressed by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in commending those who so effectively serve this House. As Leader of the House I have no doubt that it would be impossible for this Parliament to function were it not for those who sit at the table and who assist you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in your duties as they do me in mine. To you <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to your  Deputy  and to those who assist you in maintaining the order and decorum of this House I also extend my thanks. I believe that the task you exercise is made all the more difficult by the activity and behaviour of some members in this place from time to time. We trust that in the new move towards bipartisanship which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has just expressed he might be prepared to take note of some of the remarks that have been made by you and by others exercising your authority. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>To my colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fife),</inline> who has assisted me in my role as Leader of the House, I extend my thanks. It is a job which takes up a good deal of time. I am particularly grateful for the manner and form of his assistance. Of course neither of us would be capable of performing our duties at all if it were not for the work of Roger Webb. I know that next year Roger hopes to move to other things.  His  successor will come into the House some time during the next session of Par.liament. But in particular on behalf of honourable members I say to Roger that he has our thanks for the way in which he has worked between the Government and the Opposition parties. He has effectively ensured the flow of legislation and parliamentary business. </para>
        <para>Many other people help us in this place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> both you and the Prime Minister have referred to some of them. I do not wish to repeat all the names but in particular I would like to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Kerr who is taking over as Principal Parliamentary Reporter that we wish him well in his new responsibility. I said a few remarks today about the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> writers have an important role. We are indebted to the way in which they perform. I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kerr</inline> well. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you have mentioned the retirement of Dick Hillyer and Bill Worth. Dick Hillyer has been a stalwart of this place. Again on behalf of the members of the National Country Party I extend to him our good wishes for a happy retirement I have known Bill Worth for many years. He worked with my wife at Expo 67 when she was Chief Hostess and I have been associated with him over the years. We are indebted to the way he assumed the role, out of retirement, of Principal Security Officer in the Parliament. I believe that the work that he has done has ensured that today there is a far greater degree of reasonable security in this place than otherwise would be the case. </para>
        <para>I share in the wishes of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to all members of the House that they come back to this place refreshed for next year&#39;s session. However, I must say that in the discussion of parliamentary reform and the suggestions by the Leader of the </para>
        <para class="block">Opposition with respect to Question Time I believe much of the fault lies not in the system but with Opposition members. I remember well, as do many honourable members, the way in which government members of the present Opposition performed at Question Time. The use of Question Time only as a manner and avenue for expressing policy is not the intention of the present Standing Orders. I am interested in the suggestions the Leader of the Opposition has made to change the character of Question Time. Yet I find the degree to which there has been within Questions on Notice some variation from time to time I hope that we can devise a way to ensure the effectiveness of what is a fairly unique system. I think that our system of Questions Without Notice has much to commend it That does not mean that the system cannot be reformed. Perhaps there are some ways of improving both the method of presenting and answering the questions. It seems to me that the area in which there is the best prospect of parliamentary reform is the area to which the Prime Minister has directed his attention. There is no doubt that the effective operation of the legislation committees has been a notable advance in the reforms introduced by this Government. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in wishing all honourable members in this place and all those who are associated with it a happy Christmas. I trust that we will all return to the fight in somewhat better form in the New Year. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I do not want to detract from the fact that the House is adjourning for a recess which includes the seven remaining days of November, the whole of December and January, and for 19 days out of February. I do not think we should feel that that is not a good idea. But, unfortunately, events in the world outside will be continuing. At present, the Iran Government is tottering; the Lebanon is in chaos; and Central Africa is in great trouble. As we look around the world, we are beginning to wonder why this Parliament has not had a major debate on foreign affairs this session. Therefore, I ask the Government: Should the United Nations decide to invite this Government to send Australian forces during the parliamentary recess into the Pacific, the Persian Gulf, perhaps into Zambia or elsewhere, will the Government first call the Parliament together. I hope that the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> will consider this matter seriously. I would not be prepared to permit Australian forces to be committed to the United Nations without a full debate first being held in this House. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I do not in any way detract from the Christmas spirit that is with us. We have our international responsibilities. I ask the Leader of the House to give an undertaking before we pass this motion to honourable members on both sides of the House that, if the United Nations SecretaryGeneral requires the presence of Australian armed forces to assist the United Nations, much as we would approve of such action, the Parliament should be recalled and the debate should take place before such action is agreed to. In that spirit, I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> very much. I have noticed that your procession is going well. I hope that parliamentary processions will continue. I hope that everybody will enjoy another happy new year. </para>

          <para>-I should like to raise a couple of matters. I think that 1978 has been the most significant year in our history for the Parliament. There is a number of reasons for this statement. I mention the decision to build the new and permanent Parliament House, upon which I congratulate the Executive Government and the Opposition for their unanimity, is an immense advance. Secondly, we were privileged to have the Presiding Officers&#39; Conference of the Westminster parliaments here in this chamber a few months ago. Thirdly, we have established legislation committees. I think that the Executive Government is to be very highly complimented for its willingness to adopt tins reform of Parliament. The fact is that, by legislation, rights and obligation are created. It is not in the interests of democracy that those rights or obligations should be created without the closest scrutiny. That cannot be done in the plenary sessions of this Parliament and must be done in committee sessions. I congratulate the Executive Government for agreeing to this action. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It has been a most productive year also for legislation and debate. The quality of debate- I may be challenged on this statement- has been rather high at aU times although there have been certain lapses from that high quality. I do not choose to identify those persons who have been responsible for the lapses. One ought to be careful who might be identified. </para>
        <para>The assertion of parliamentary authority to which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has contributed so much in this year I think ought to be properly acknowledged. The Prime Minister on 25 May 1978 gave an undertaking that, within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action that the Government proposes to take in relation to the report If the six-month period expires during a parliamentary recess, the Ministerial statement will be made at the earnest opportunity in the next parliamentary sitting. </para>
        <para>I think it is proper to say that this year- I pay tribute to the right honourable gentleman without any qualification- has been one of the most significant years of parliamentary reform in this Parliament &#39;s history. Therefore, I was extremely pleased to hear the right honourable gentleman in this debate say that he would like to see a further development of the committee system and would like to see the establishment of committees to deal with the Budget Bills next year. I welcome that statement. I am very pleased to hear it. I am sure that it will be of immense value to this Parliament </para>
        <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> in a pleasant aside said to me that he hopes that I come back refreshed and able to meet the challenges which 1979 may present to me. Of course, there will be changes for many people. As the momentum of reform of the Parliament gathers, there is one significant reform which needs to be taken account of by all members of the Parliament from whatever party- that is, the adoption in this Parliament of the Westminster convention of the separation of the  Speaker  from aU political party activity. It necessarily involves very marked changes in the attitude which parties have hitherto held towards the Speaker&#39;s position. </para>
        <para>I propose during the next year to do all possible to achieve in this Parliament the acceptance of the Westminster system. The Westminster system will necessarily mean that the  Speaker  will continue in office regardless of change of government giving him a continuity which others would not possess. Because of that fact, I cannot be the advocate for the system and the beneficiary of the system. Accordingly, I wish to inform the House that, while I will press for the Westminster system, I would not be willing to be the beneficiary of the adoption of it. </para>
        <para>I think that, if we were able to adopt the Westminster system, in a short time after the acceptance of the system we would grow up a century. I am very anxious to see it adopted. I hope that I can count on the support of aU members of Par.liament. I do not suggest that it can be adopted overnight, but adopted it must be, for what honourable members see around them is the fulcrum of parliamentary democracy. Without it functioning as it ought and without the occupant of this Chair not only being impartial but also being seen to be impartial and accepted as being impartial a fundamental tenet of the system is absent I believe that we ought to preserve it. I believe we ought to take action now to ensure that it will be preserved. </para>
        <para>I should like to pay a tribute quickly- although it will be done quickly, it is no less important than the other points I have raised- to the  Chairman  of Committees. I do not see him in the House at the moment He apparently is being refreshed. The honourable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Millar)</inline> has performed extremely well, as I am sure every honourable member of the House would acknowledge. He was thrown into the position, so to speak, without warning. He has discharged that position excellently. I pay tribute to him for his work. </para>
        <para>I wish to commiserate with the  Deputy  Chairmen of Committees because a decision of Executive Government withheld from them a small remuneration which they would have otherwise received. I am having inquiries made as to whether they have suffered from travelling allowances in Canberra being paid to them at the back bench rate while they themselves are office bearers under the Tribunal&#39;s finding without receiving any remuneration for it I am very pleased at the way in which the  Deputy  Chairmen of Committees have serviced the House. </para>
        <para>To the Clerks at the table and to the House of Representatives staff I express my appreciation. It will come as no surprise to honourable members that the  Clerk  of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pettifer,</inline> is known in my office as &#39;the little pet&#39;. That has regard to the fact that he is an ever helpful, ever honest man of immense integrity. It is pretty hard to believe that that chap sitting there on the right-hand side of the Table was flying multi-engined aeroplanes over the Atlantic during the war. To all his staff I give my thanks. I thank the Library staff and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. I thank the Leader of the House for the cooperation I have received at all times. I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for the cooperation I have received from him at all times. I congratulate the party whips on their subdued interjections. I thank the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Roger Webb, for the co-operation that I have always received. I wish to thank all honourable members for spending half an hour each morning thinking of how they can make life easier for me during the day. For that half hour of contemplation I thank them very much. Had it not been for that half hour of contemplation I do not know what sort of pressures would have been upon me. I am fortunate to have a personal staff the personal quality and efficiency of whom are impossible to describe, but I know many members of this House have personal contact with them. Those members can very readily be a reference to me in my statement of thanks to my staff. </para>

This statutory declaration said that during the course of a meeting with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Illig</inline> the question was raised of Stawell Timber Industries being able to finance building contracts, given that receivers and managers had been appointed.

I have sought to assist it as the member for Wannon once the company became part of the electorate of Wannon, but I gave only the private assistance that I would give any constituent or constituency group. The guarantees referred to in the statutory declaration were not given by myself to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Illig,</inline> to Stawell Industries or to anyone associated in any sense, shape or form with the company. An officer from my staff has this afternoon been in touch with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Illig</inline> who said that he might have used the word &#39;guarantee&#39; in relation to Stawell &#39;s future market but certainly not in relation to me and that he would sign a statutory declaration to that effect.

          <para>The Australian Minerals and Energy Council agreed at its meeting on 10 March 1978 to initiate a national programme to conserve energy, with strong emphasis on oil. The Council also established a joint Commonwealth-State Consultative Committee to develop the first stage of the programme. </para>
          <para>At its meeting on 1 1 August 1978 the Council received certain recommendations made by the Committee, including recommendations that information on existing energy consumption in buildings should be gathered and that a standard code for energy audits of buildings should be devised. The Council noted the incorporation of energy conservation standards in building regulations as a matter meriting further study. Action in this regard will be considered further by the Council in the future. </para>

            <para>The practice of declining to answer questions concerning the activities of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was commenced by Prime Minister Chifley in 1949 and has been followed by every Government since. The Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security recommended that the present practice, whereby the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the ASIO Act do not confirm or deny allegations, or presumed allegations, in respect of ASIO, continue in force&#39; (Fourth Report, Volume I, paragraph 78 1 ). In a statement to the House on the 25th October last year I indicated the Government&#39;s acceptance of that recommendation. </para>
            <para>There are, of course, compelling reasons in support of such a practice. As <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> said in the House of Representatives in 1949 &#39;The Security Service must be operated with secrecy in order properly to protect the community &#39;. </para>

The development of the deposits at Rundle, one of those identified in the Report as appearing to have the highest potential for exploitation, is under active examination by the companies concerned. </para>

        <para>Attorney-General&#39;s Department: Since the volume and complexity of Australian law is expanding at an increasing rate, an efficient automated system for legal work is vital if the Department is to avoid a decrease in the quality of service that it provides to the Government There are not, at this stage, any significant savings in staff numbers which could be directly attributed to the use of our existing automated system. For the future, the use of a computerised legal retrieval system is more likely to result in a more efficient service rather than a reduction in staff numbers. </para>
        <para>Department of Trade and Resources: The Department of Trade and Resources has introduced computer systems principally to support operations in areas where it is necessary to match the performance of Australia&#39;s trading competitors. Examples include the provision of trade economic statistical analysis to support trade negotiations, and the provision of firms&#39; details summaries and analyses to support Australia&#39;s competitive marketing efforts. </para>
        <para>Because of the nature of this work, the Department does not attribute any direct savings in staff numbers to the use of computer support The benefits of the support are realised in improved analytical capability and increased productivity rather than in cost reductions derived from staff savings. </para>

            <para>Whilst information which might be provided at a public opening of tenders could be of some interest to tenderers, where requirements are of some complexity or the tender calls for minimum performance standards in a requirement, little would be gained because the tenders require detailed evaluation in order to determine which tenders comply with the specifications and which tender represents the best value for money. </para>
            <para>It is considered that in regard to public access to information on purchases and fairness to tenderers, Commonwealth procedures compare favourably with those of other countries. </para>
            <para>Unsuccessful tenderers currently have the right of appeal to the Minister concerned and if an independent review is required they may appeal to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. </para>
            <para>It is considered, on balance, that whilst public opening of tenders could be expected to add to administrative costs, no commensurate benefits can readily be demonstrated. </para>
            <para>The practice of seeking deposits with tenders is now applied only in respect of special categories of tendering, principally in the construction field. The practice of specifying such deposits adds to the cost of the tender and if applied widely, may well discourage some tenderers thereby reducing competition to supply Commonwealth requirements. </para>
            <para>In the circumstances, I would not see any benefit in a joint select committee of the Parliament being established to study and report on the matters raised by the honourable member. </para>

                <para>Yes. However, it was recognised from the outset that the design details would have to be progressively developed throughout the construction period, particularly in relation to the internal layout of the building and the internal finishes. Accordingly, the contract for the construction of the building contains provisional sums for those components not fully documented when tenders were called. These provisional sums are adjusted progressively as the details are finalised and the contract price varies accordingly. Increases have also occurred for other reasons, the most significant being for delays outside the contractor&#39;s control (such as weather conditions, industrial disputes, unexpected underground conditions) and for rise and fall provisions in the contract which take account of variations to industrial awards and conditions. </para>

              <para>I am unable to answer the honourable member&#39;s specific question regarding the taxation affairs of the Utah Company because the secrecy provisions of the income tax law do not permit the Commissioner of Taxation to divulge such information to me. Speaking generally, however, the amount of Australian tax payable in respect of the Australian business profits of a foreign-owned company that produced a taxable income here of $91m would, assuming legislation now before the House is enacted, depend on whether the Australian business is carried on through a subsidiary company or through a branch. In either case, primary Australian company tax of $41. 86m would be payable on the taxable income. In the case in which the business is carried on through a subsidiary company, however, dividends withholding tax at the rate of 15 per cent would be payable on dividends declared to the overseas parent company, if resident in a country with which Australia has a double taxation agreement, or 30 per cent if resident in a country with which Australia has no such agreement. The amount of withholding tax would depend on the amount of profits distributed out of profits remaining after payment of primary company tax. In the case in which the business is carried on through a branch, the &#39;branch profits tax&#39; legislation currently being considered by the Parliament would, in broad terms, impose additional tax of 5 per cent on the taxable income of $91 m, in lieu of dividend withholding tax. In each case, of course, further tax would generally be payable in the home country of the parent or other shareholder. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Primary company tax of $41. 86m would also be payable on a taxable income of $91 in derived by an Australian resident company. To the extent that the company distributed profits remaining after the payment of this tax to personal (i.e., non-corporate and non-exempt) shareholders resident in Australia, tax would also be payable on the dividends received by the shareholders at a rate determined by reference to the taxable income of each. (3)I know of nothing to suggest that, when the aggregate tax liabilities I have spoken of are compared, there is any bias in favour of overseas owned companies. </para>

            <para>The Australian Statistician has advised that in calculating the increases or decreases in the real value of the wages specified he has assumed that the wages are award rates of pay and hence that each indexation decision would have applied to the full weekly wage. On this basis, for persons now receiving  $100  a week the increase in the real value of the wage, that is, in relation to the CPI since December quarter  1975,  is  1.3  per cent For persons now receiving  $125, $150  and  $200  a week the changes are decreases of  0.7  per cent,  1 .9  per cent and  4.3  per cent respectively. </para>

The NIF-7 version of the Treasury- Australian Bureau of Statistics National Income Forecasting Model provides an estimate of around  -1.1  for an elapsed time of two to three years, for imports of goods other than government imports and imports of petroleum and civil aircraft. That is, a  1  per cent rise in import prices is estimated (other things being equal) to lead to a  1.1  per cent fall in this category of imports measured at constant prices over this interval of time.

In these circumstances, the calculations requested, which are of a highly simplistic kind, would produce results of little, if any, practical value. I do not believe, therefore, that the work required to give the figures requested by the honourable member would be warranted. </para>

I do not know the basis of that or the other figures quoted in the question, and I am not able to confirm them. But whatever the figures are, it should be understood that the taxpayers from whom taxation revenue is derived include present and retired public servants, and the present public servants also themselves make contributions towards their retirement benefits. Also, private employees belonging to superannuation schemes benefit not only from their own contributions but also from employers&#39; contributions which are met out of amounts the general community pays, directly or indirectly, for goods or services supplied by the employers. </para>

(1), (2) and (3) The Department of Social Security does not keep separate statistics of the persons who have had their benefits terminated on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Although statistics are kept in . relation to appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunals and of the decisions given by those tribunals m favour of the appellants, no separate record has been kept of the number of cases which arose out of CES decisions. </para>

          <para>The information the honourable member has requested could only be obtained by examining all of the department&#39;s unemployment cases. As there are about a million new unemployment benefit claims each year and the files are destroyed after an applicant has been off benefit for a relatively short time, it would not be practicable to obtain the requested information in the latter years, and it would be impossible to obtain it in relation to the earlier years in relation to which most files would have been destroyed. </para>

            <para>Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Aa provides that private companies must distribute a specified minimum proportion of after-tax profits in order to avoid an additional tax at the rate of 50 per cent of the amount by which the actual distribution falls short of the required distribution. For distributions in respect of taxable incomes of the year 1975-76 and subsequent years, the Government increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent the minimum proportion that can be retained without incurring additional tax. </para>
            <para>The purpose of Division 7 is to impose on owners of private companies an overall amount of tax comparable to mat which would be payable if the business were not incorporated, but operated as a sole trader or partnership. The Asprey Taxation Review Committee accepted that, as long as the maximum marginal rate of tax for individuals exceeded the company tax rate, the Division 7 provisions would be necessary to prevent the use of private companies as a means for high-income shareholders to avoid tax. </para>
            <para>The Government considers that the present provisions ensure an equitable outcome and, at the same time, allow private companies adequate scope for financing investment by way of retained earnings. </para>

There are both seasonal factors and factors specific to this year that would indicate a similar pattern for 1978-79: </para>

          <para>In some years the pattern of company tax instalments/ collections has resulted in low receipts in the early part of the financial year; in 1976-77 the first major instalment was collected in March and in 1977-78 in November; the seasonal factor is less apparent for 1978-79 as quarterly payments of company tax have been resumed. </para>

              <para>1 ) and (2) It was indicated in Statement No.  4  attached to my Budget Speech for 1978-79 that the temporary increase in the standard rate of income tax to 33V4 per cent, for 1978-79 only, would be reflected in PA YE instalment deductions from 1 November 1978. 1 indicated that from that date, PAYE deductions would increase by an amount designed to make deductions received over 1978-79 broadly equivalent to the increase tax to be assessed on the income of 1 978-79 as a whole. Allowing for a month &#39;s lag in PAYE collections (deductions made by an employer in one month are not received by the Taxation Office until the next month) this meant that PAYE deductions for only the seven months from 1 November 1 978 to 3 1 May 1979 would be received in the 1978-79 financial year. Accordingly, in order that receipts in 1978-79 would reflect the full year equivalent of the temporary rate increase, PAYE deductions from 1 November had to be increased by the factor 12/7. The excess deductions in June 1 979, which will be received by the Taxation Office in July 1 979, will form part of refunds which will commence to issue in that month. </para>

          <para>Regulations prescribing PAYE deductions calculated on this basis, and incorporating other relevant Budget changes, were duly made. The Commissioner of Taxation arranged for the publication and distribution of tax instalment deduction schedules and notes for employers that set out details of the PAYE arrangements applicable from 1 November 1978, as foreshadowed in the Budget Speech. </para>

            <para>As mentioned in my Second Reading Speech on the Primary Industry Bank Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> 26 October 1978, page 2376) the major trading banks and the four State banks concerned will receive a maximum interest rate margin of l.S per cent per annum to cover administrative costs and risks over the Full period of the long term loans. Thus, under the present arrangements, the Primary Industry Bank will lend to banks at 8.5 per cent in respect of loans below $100,000 and 10.5 per cent in respect of larger loans. This will in turn permit the banks to lend to primary producers within the maximum interest rates of 10.0 and 1 2.0 per cent that have been announced. </para>
            <para>No &#39;agency&#39; or other fee is payable by the Primary Industry Bank to the banks under the agreed arrangements. I mention that the banks are not in fact agents of the Primary Industry Bank; the relationship is rather one of &#39;prime lender&#39;, and &#39;re-finance lender&#39;. </para>

            <para>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the following question without notice, on 16 November </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I address a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I refer to the decision of the High Court last Thursday in what is known as the Sankey case. In particular, I refer to the criticism of the Minister by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Aiken at page 78 of that judgment, where he dealt with an affidavit of the Minister in which the Minister referred to meetings of the Australian Loan Council.  His  Honour said: </para>
          <para>The deponent . . .&#39;, </para>
          <para>The Minister- - does not state that he has himself perused the particular documents. He does not specifically state that the minutes record either in full or in summary form the discussions which took place at those meetings or whether they record merely the decisions arrived at. &#39; </para>
          <para>His Honour went on to say that he found the affidavit completely unsatisfactory. I therefore ask: Why was the claim of Crown privilege made in such an unsatisfactory form? </para>

            <para>The affidavit that I swore on 11 November 1976 in the proceedings known as the Sankey Case claiming that certain Loan Council documents should be withheld from production to the Court of Petty Sessions at Queanbeyan set out at some length the material upon which I based that claim and which counsel considered sufficient to enable the claim to be properly put before the Court. As the documents subpoenaed were the documents of a previous Government, the Government took the view that they should not be perused by Ministers. This view was reflected in my affidavit and in other affidavits filed in the proceedings. </para>
            <para>The Justices of the High Court themselves examined the Loan Council documents. In the result the Court ordered that certain small parts of the Loan Council documents should be produced, being the first nine lines of paragraph 71 of the minutes of the 104th meeting of the Loan Council and the first ten lines of paragraph 10 of the minutes of the 105th meeting. </para>

These classes aim to improve the practical skills of those students who have difficulty in succeeding with a more academically inclined curriculum. In the Northern Territory, schools at the larger Aboriginal communities have postprimary facilities where classes are conducted in a range of manual arts. </para>
          <para>Since 1970 the movement to re-occupy traditional lands has intensified and Government support has now aided large numbers of Aboriginals to establish independent settlements known as outstations. My Department has responded to the movement by making provision for educational services at these centres. In many instances the teaching is carried out by Aboriginal teacher assistants who have the benefit of periodic visits by more experienced staff. The location of these outstation schools in traditional settings affords opportunities for pupils to learn traditional knowledge by traditional means. Tune-tabling is flexible to cope with the lifestyles at these centres. </para>

              <para>An important innovation in Aboriginal education in recent years has been the introduction of bilingual programs. The bilingual program in the Northern Territory now involves 19 schools in Aboriginal communities. Twelve different Aboriginal languages are used along with English in formal programs. In addition a number of schools use the local Aboriginal language in an informal way. At Maningrida, for example, the large number of languages spoken precludes a formal program in any one of them, but it is possible for some of the older children to be introduced to literacy in their own language. </para>

Twelve Aboriginals have now qualified for recognition as permanent teachers by the Commonwealth Teaching Service. A further nineteen have completed two years training to qualify for appointment of temporary teachers, and another group of 57 have completed part of their teacher training course. While the numbers are still not large, they represent a growing and significant involvement of the Aboriginal people in their education. The Roper River school is staffed by Aboriginals, including the first Aboriginal principal in the Northern Territory. In addition, some 300 teacher assistants are employed in Northern Territory schools. There are also some 400 Aboriginals employed in teaching positions in the States.

          <para>Many computers have been introduced to gain benefits unrelated to staff savings.

      <para>Accurate details of staff savings, achieved through introduction of computers in the labour intensive areas engaged in the administrative type functions are not available. Such an assessment of the manpower equivalents of each machine would be a costly, long-term exercise offering inconclusive results. The problem arises from the fact that computerization in the Department of Defence commenced in the early 1960&#39;s. No recent basis exists on which to estimate the practical staff level which would be required to perform the now much expanded management facilities and monitoring functions available from the machines, but undoubtedly these would be thousands. </para>
      <para>A limited exercise undertaken in 1976 to attempt to assess the staff savings from the use of the Central UNIVAC and Honeywell installations in Canberra indicated that some 1200 staff positions had been released for other duties within the Department These people had formerly provided the Armed Forces Pay, Personnel and Supply functions. </para>
      <para>Whilst no staff have been retrenched through the introduction of these computers, they have enabled a limitation of the staff growth which would otherwise have flowed from the increasing complexity of administration of the Armed Forces. </para>

            <para>Although the current Californian legislation, Assembly Bill No. 2286, is designed to assist the export of any commodity (except almonds) grown in California, to date it has not been invoked by exporters of any of the abovementioned items. The legislation allows agricultural marketing organisations, with official approval, to impose levies on production and use the funds to promote export sales and subsidise export freight costs. Almonds come under Federal jurisdiction and are excluded from the provisions of the Californian legislation. </para>
            <para>The earlier legislation. Assembly Bill No. 3428, was invoked between August and October 1977, to assist in the export of canned peaches to Europe. However, due to a short crop and strong existing markets in the United States and Europe, the Californian Cling Peach Advisory Board has not applied to have the provisions of Assembly Bill No. 2286 invoked for the export promotion of Californian peaches. I understand that the levy collected in 1977 by the Cling Peach Advisory Board will not be used to promote exports or subsidise freight, but may be used to stage a national advertising campaign if there is an increased supply of peaches late in the 1978 season. </para>

              <para>and (2) The US Government does not publicise changes in the alert status of its forces. It is concerned that the information could be used to advantage by potentially opposing military forces. There is also the risk that the significance of such changes might be misinterpreted by the public and might thus impart a quite unwarranted sense of danger. I agree with that approach. I do not therefore propose to answer the honourable member&#39;s question in the detail which he has sought I can advise him, however, that there have been no changes in the alert status of US forces at Joint US/Australian Defence Facilities in Australia since October 1973. </para>

              <para>and (2) The Tertiary Education Commission commented on the medical manpower situation in Volume 1 of the Report for 1979-81 Triennium. The Commission noted that in the light of information currently available, there will almost certainly be a higher doctor/population ratio than had been previously predicted. Accordingly, the Commission considered that it would be difficult to justify any further expansion of medical education, and recommended that universities should not increase the intake of undergraduate students into medical courses. In addition, a proposal to establish a new medical school at the James Cook University of North Queensland has not been implemented. Universities have for some time applied strict quotas to the intake of students into this field of study. The Commission however expressed caution in relying on manpower predictions and will be closely monitoring future trends in the provision of medical manpower. </para>

I understand that its report to the Government is now in the final stages of preparation. </para>

          <para>Dairy factory premises are, at intervals, inspected by State officers either alone or in company with officers of my Department During these inspections, establishments are checked for compliance with Code provisions. </para>
          <para>Almost all Australian dairy factories had been inspected under the Code at least once by October 1978. Those not so far inspected include a number of very small establishments and new premises built to Code specifications. </para>
          <para>Progress in implementing the hygiene, plant and equipment provisions of the Code has been most satisfactory. Progress towards implementation of Code provisions covering buildings and structures has been somewhat slower, since full compliance may entail significant modification of existing premises. </para>

          <para class="block">Progress on inspection can only be used as a pointer to progress on implementation and this varies from State to tate. For example, in Tasmania, all second round inspections have been completed and some third round inspections commenced. In Victoria approximately 80 per cent of second round inspections and over SO per cent of third round inspections have been undertaken. Inspection rounds in other States are not as far advanced. </para>
          <para>At their October 1978 meeting, Commonwealth and State Chief Dairy Officers agreed that a full round of joint (Commonwealth/State) inspections will be undertaken in all States during 1979. </para>

In response to a recent approach from Kampuchea to enter into diplomatic relations the Kampuchean Ambassador in Peking was told that Australia attached importance to the maintenance of Kampuchea&#39;s independence and territorial integrity, that we did not rule out the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations in the future and that we wanted to continue to maintain contact through our Embassies in Peking The matter continues to be kept under careful review. </para>

However, it seems that production, storage and distribution of food in Kampuchea has been hard hit by recent abnormally heavy wet-season flooding, which also seriously affected Thailand, Vietnam and Laos.

            <para>The applicants would have been admitted to Australia under the Government&#39;s private overseas student policy. Change of status within policy applying prior to 7 June 1978 enabled students who had successfully completed a course of study and were economically viable or who had married an Australian resident to remain permanently. Current policy requires that a student seeking change of status must satisfy the normal criteria for migration. The Government would prefer such people, having acquired skills, to return to their countries of origin, but the honourable member would be well aware of the persuasive arguments many people advance in support of remaining in Australia. </para>

        <para>The objective of the private overseas student policy is to provide opportunities for the youth of other countries to study in Australia thus fostering good relations and cultural exchanges. This objective, whilst preserving the temporary nature of student entry neither prevents nor directly encourages settlement in Australia by persons eligible under Government policy. </para>
        <para>On successful completion of their studies private students may indicate that their intentions regarding their return home have changed and that they wish to seek the grant of resident status. In considering the categories of applications mentioned it is Government policy to counsel the students in respect of the policy objectives, the undertakings they have signed and when relevant, the interest expressed by their home government in their return. </para>

            <para>My question should be directed to the Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce, but in his absence I ask the Prime Minister Is it a fact that the 30 per cent devaluation of the Australian dollar in relation to the Yen has meant a higher Australian content requirement under the motor vehicle plans than was the intention when the plans were formulated? Is it a fact that the adjustments announced by the Minister yesterday do not offset completely the effects of the 30 per cent devaluation and have left Chrysler Australia Limited and possibly other motor vehicle manufacturing companies paying large penalties for factors over which they had no control? </para>
            <para>It is also a fact that these large penalties may result in a further disastrous loss of employment? Is it true that General Motors-Holden&#39;s Ltd and Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd can now reduce their local content from over 90 per cent to 85 per cent, thus creating more unemployment? Without wishing in any way to support or criticise the changes made yesterday but seeking information, I ask the Prime Minister why the Government has not allowed a full adjustment for the 30 per cent devaluation and why he has allowed the abolition of reversion control procedures? </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The effect of appreciation of the Yen against the Australian dollar has caused difficulties for some companies in meeting their local content obligations under the Motor Vehicle Plan, but it has not caused difficulties for others. Thus it is not a fact that the Yen appreciation has generally caused a higher Australian content requirement as calculated under the Plan rules than when the Plan was formulated. Whilst appreciation of the Yen has caused componentry sourced from Japan to be less economic than at the time the Plan was formulated, conversely it has improved the competitiveness Of componentry sourced from Australia compared to imports from Japan. For some producers this will mean physically incorporating into their vehicles more local components than they had originally envisaged. However, the Motor Vehicle Plan content requirements are not based on meeting specific requirements as to the actual componentry incorporated in vehicles. Content is calculated on a value basis with the decision as to which componentry to source locally being a matter for commercial decision making. </para>
            <para>It should be noted that if there were to be a devaluation against the dollar in the currency of a country supplying components to an Australian car manufacturer, then that manufacturer would be able to reduce his local component sourcing and still meet the local content levels prescribed in the Plan. </para>
            <para>The adjustments announced by the Government on 18 October 1978 recognise the difficulties brought about for certain companies by the rapid appreciation of the Yen and the fact that resourcing of components cannot be achieved quickly because of the necessary lead times involved. </para>
            <para>The Government&#39;s action was in conformity with the Plan&#39;s provisions that circumstances beyond a company&#39;s control which have caused or contributed to its failure to comply with the Plan may be taken into account in considering whether or not penalties should be applied. </para>
            <para>Passenger motor vehicle manufacturers who were affected by major foreign currency appreciations will be allowed to adjust their local content calculation for the purpose of application of penalty duties under the Plan on the basis of a 12 month lag in the application of exchange rates. </para>
            <para>The adjustment will have effect from 1 July 1978 and will expire on 31 December 1979 when all Plan manufacturers will be required to be at 85 per cent company average local content on the basis of exchange rates applicable at that time. </para>
            <para>This action is not intended to eliminate the need for penalty payment by these companies for failing to meet their local content commitments. Any penalty liability which companies may incur for failing to meet their commitments for reasons other than the Yen appreciation will not be affected. </para>
            <para>There is no basis in speculation in the media and elsewhere that employment in the industry will be affected by any penalties for which motor vehicle manufacturers may be liable. </para>
            <para>The Government decided to abolish the reversion control because it has now served its intended purpose. This was to provide a means of avoiding major disruption in the component sector during the phasing period of the present Plan while the local content levels in certain vehicles entered in former plans was being reduced. </para>
            <para>The average local content levels of General MotorsHolden&#39;s Ltd and the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd have already been significantly reduced towards 85 per cent and the opportunities for reversion to overseas sources of componentry have thus become very much limited. </para>
            <para>At the same time the component industry has been receiving substantial additional business from the new manufacturers as they increase the local content of their vehicles in accordance with their commitments under the Plan. </para>
            <para>Reversion control was never intended to be a permanent feature of the Motor Vehicle Plan. This was clearly indicated by the Government when the motor vehicle policy was announced in the Parliament on 30 March 1976 and again in a further statement by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce on 9 June 1976. </para>
            <para>To introduce reversion control as an integral part of the Motor Vehicle Plan would constitute a major change to the Plan; and major investment decisions have been made in the confident expectation that the rules will not be changed. </para>
            <para>The basic thrust of the Government&#39;s motor vehicle policy is to facilitate the development of a more viable and competitive industry by reducing Government intervention in commercial decision making and giving the vehicle builders more flexibility in making their own component sourcing arrangements within the overall 85 per cent company average local content requirement. </para>

            <para>Computers were first introduced into the Australian Survey Office in 1961. The rapid growth in the workload and change in its nature in the late 1960s and early 1970s make impracticable the estimation of staff savings from that date. However, a broad estimate of nett savings in staff has been made for the period commencing with the installation of the latest generation of equipment in the early 1970s. This estimate suggests that overall staff savings could be of the order of55. </para>

The savings arose because of the increased productivity of the computer systems and also because separate departmental payroll and ledger systems were largely eliminated.

            <para>-The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) Selection of persons to fill positions on the staff of the National Aboriginal Conference is entirely a matter for the Executive of the National Aboriginal Conference. In a statement on 18 October 1978 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard</inline> pages 2057, 2058) I indicated that the information concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Anderson&#39;s availability was provided by the National Aboriginal Conference members on the selection sub-committee. Particular information concerning the considerations of the interviewing sub-committee is confidential to the National Aboriginal Conference and an approach will be made to the Executive to ascertain to what extent they are prepared to release the information sought. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In the absence of the Minister for Trade and Resources, I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to the advice and the hopes made clear by the Government in respect of trade with China, particularly in relation to the export of technology from Australia. I ask the Prime Minister Has the Government an attitude on barter arrangements between China and an Australian exporting firm such as those that have existed with a number of British exporters for whom marketing rights in Great Britain were reserved exclusively by China following the use of the original British technology? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The following is in answer to the honourable member&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>China is, of course, anxious to obtain a wide range of westem technology and is adopting a flexible attitude to the means by which it achieves that objective. This includes arrangements where all or part payment for technology is made in goods resulting from the use of the particular technology. The Chinese refer to these as &#39;buy back&#39; rather than barter deals. </para>
            <para>Australian suppliers of technology are free to enter into commercial agreements of this type and the marketing arrangements in respect of Australia or other overseas markets are simply a matter for negotiation between the parties. The Chinese party would of course insist on handling the sale of the product within China. </para>
            <para>As with any commercial trading arrangement involving the import of products made overseas by or on behalf of an Australian firm the Government cannot give any assurance of continued access to the Australian market The import regulations, tariffs etc applicable to these products do not vary amply because there is some Australian involvement or content in their production abroad. </para>
            <para>Although China has paid cash for much of her technology imports in the past, there is growing evidence of payment in kind forming part of her contractual arrangements in more recent deals with European and Japanese suppliers of technology in particular. </para>
            <para>Australian companies contemplating &#39;buy back&#39; deals with China, or any other country for that matter, should take early steps to satisfy the Reserve Bank, Treasury and Customs&#39; officials as to the commercial valuation placed on the goods being accepted as full or part payment for the Australian technology. </para>

              <para>The Government considers the use of Australian flag shipping in overseas trades to be a commercial operation. Other than protection for an Australian flag operator to engage efficiently and to a reasonable extent in overseas cargo shipping which is contained in Part X of the Trade Practices Act, 1 974; no specific direct or indirect assistance is given for the operation of vessels in the overseas trades. However, the Australian coasting trade is reserved under the Navigation Act 1912 to Australian licensed vessels. This effectively reserves the coastal shipping industry to Australian-registered and manned vessels. In addition, the Government&#39;s shipbuilding assistance arrangements enable overseas shipowners to import ships into Australia for temporary periods only when suitable Australian tonnage is not available, and on a permanent basis only after it has been demonstrated by calling tenders in Australia and overseas that the overseas tender price is less than the Australian tender price after bounty. </para>

              <para>The expectation of life at birth for Japan is shown in Table 2. The large increase is due to a very low life expectancy responding to post-war development and an increase in living standards, bringing life expectancy up to the levels typical of developed countries. As demonstrated in Table 2, the period of large increase was between 1947 and 1958 with an average yearly increase of 1.36 years for males and 1.43 years for females. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) It is not possible to state what the current rate of illiteracy is for Australia. The collection of statistics on literacy is made difficult by the problem of the definition of &#39;illiterate*. It is not feasible to apply a single measure of literacy to a total population as this implies that there is a single standard of functional need. I refer the honourable member to the reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic&#39;s</inline> Question Without Notice on illiteracy in the Senate on 14 September 1978, in which I referred to the research in this area carried out in the Sydney Metropolitan area in 1977 by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Judith</inline> Goyen of Macquarie University. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Goyen</inline> pointed out that the establishment of a cut-off point to separate illiterates from literates is quite arbitrary, and determined by the researcher.  Her  study indicated that in the Sydney metropolitan area, 3.7 per cent of adults born in Australia and other English speaking countries, and 43.3 per cent of those born in non-English speaking countries were functionally illiterate. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>While this and other research studies do not provide a complete answer as to the numbers involved, it is clear that the problem of illiteracy is a real one for some Australians and, in particular, for Aboriginals and migrants from nonEnglish speaking countries. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>In the reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> I referred to the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties, and the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants, as a result of which a number of initiatives in research and development are being undertaken. The National Inquiry into Teacher Education established in June this year is charged with the responsibility for examining the effectiveness of techniques of early detection, diagnosis and remediation of learning difficulties. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In response to the report of the Select Committees on Specific Learning Difficulties, which itself was unable to determine the precise number of illiterate adults and children in Australia, the Australian Council for Educational Research was funded by the Government through the Education Research and Development Committee to conduct a national study of literacy and numeracy among 10 and 14 year-olds. In general, the study found no cause for complacency or for immediate alarm and suggested that standards of literacy in these age groups are comparable to the standards in other English-speaking countries. </para>
          <para>Programs for teaching illiterate adults are conducted and/or supported by a number of Commonwealth departments and by the Technical and Further Education Council. These departments and the Council are represented on an Interdepartmental Working Party on Adult Literacy and Numeracy convened by my Department The Working Party&#39;s brief is to examine the provision of literacy programs by the Commonwealth with a view to recommending ways of improving coordination and consultation. The Working Party is expected to report in January 1979. </para>

One such measure was the establishment of the Australian Institute of Criminology, which facilitates the co-operation and the exchange of information between the Commonwealth and the States and provides machinery whereby problems and trends in the criminal law, including those related to computer crime, can be studied and discussed. In addition, my Department keeps an overview of developments concerning crime. I am also informed the Commonwealth Police Force has for some time been conducting regular courses on commercial crime. Officers of State and Territory Forces participate in those courses. Further officers of the Auditor-General&#39;s Department receive training with respect to modern concepts of computer control. It is, I understand, proposed to extend that training to internal auditors in relevant Departments. </para>

              <para>1 ) The emergence of organisms resistant to different antibiotics has given rise to general concern and has been the subject of intense study. Expert bodies in several countries have been convened by authorities, including the World Health Organization to advise on this matter. Educational means, restrictions on prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and stricter control of antibiotic use within hospitals have been employed in Australia. The National Health and Medical Research Council keeps this matter under continuing review. Two specialist groups have been convened by Council to advise on the use of antibiotics with particular reference to their use in animal husbandry. The most recent statement by Council was made at its 83rd Session in April 1977. Council was of the opinion that the use of therapeutic antibiotics as growth promotants in animal feedstuffs could lead to an impairment of their efficacy in the treatment of human disease. This is of concern. The action it is expected will be taken by the States and Territories is that the recommendations of the Council will be incorporated into their legislation. The recommendations were that several antibiotics, including penicillins, tetracyclines, sulphonamides and chloramphenicol should be prohibited from use as growth promotants in animal husbandry in Australia. The necessary amendments have already been made to the Uniform Poisons Standard of the National Health and Medical Research Council to give effect to these recommendations. I have arranged for a copy of the extract from the report of the 83rd Session of Council to be placed in the Parliamentary Library. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>For statistical purposes, persons in the occupationally eligible category include spouses and children as well as the principal applicant. The selection at overseas posts is on the basis of the principal applicant&#39;s possession of skills or qualifications which are both recognised and in continuing demand in Australia. Once eligibility on occupational grounds has been established and all the other criteria for immigration met, these applicants and their families are approved for immigration and issued visas on which the appropriate eligibility category code is entered. A separate code describing the occupational status of each person is also included in that person &#39;s visa. </para>
            <para>On arrival of migrants in Australia, primary officers at the port of entry transcribe visa codes onto incoming passenger cards. This visa code information on these cards is the basis of statistical compilation of details on settler arrivals. In a small proportion of cases, the transcribed data is incorrect or incomplete. These with other sources of clerical errors, meant that no occupational information was available on 419 worker arrivalsin 1977-78 in the occupationally eligible category out of the total of 12,482 mentioned in my earlier answer. A further 95 workers were coded as &#39;not previously employed &#39; and for whom, therefore, no specific occupational classification could be given. </para>

            <para>It is for Permanent Heads of Departments, as part of their responsibilities for the efficient management of their departments, to ensure that all staff are aware of the need to use telephones effectively and economically in the course of their duties. </para>
            <para>In 1970 a model set of administrative instructions on the use of telephones was issued for the guidance of Permanent Heads. The general practice is that departmental internal directories contain instructions on telephone use for observance by all staff. </para>
            <para>Action has also been taken to ensure strict control of the use of STD calls, including the barring of STD access to the extent consistent with departmental efficiency, where practical and economical. </para>
            <para>I am advised by the Public Service Board that while there are no specific guidelines relating to the logging of telephone calls by public servants in the course of their public duties, most departments have their switchboard telephonists log all trunk calls which they connect for staff, both via STD and those booked through the Telecom Truck Line operator. </para>
            <para>The latter calls are also listed on departmental telephone accounts. There is no requirement to keep records of local calls beyond that appropriate to the relevant action file. </para>
            <para>The telephone system is a major aid to efficiency in public service administration as it enables officers and others to communicate effectively. Officers are encouraged to use the telephone where it helps in the speedy and more effective transaction of official business. To place too stringent controls on its use would therefore be likely to be counterproductive. </para>

              <para>and (2) The Oder-Neisse line constitutes the recognised boundary between the Polish Peoples Republic and the German Democratic Republic (GDR). It follows the course of the Oder River from its mouth on the Baltic Coast to the confluence of the Neisse River and then along the Neisse River to the frontier of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (CSSR). The Polish/GDR Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed on 6 June 1950 accorded formal recognition of the Polish/GDR frontier along the Oder-Neisse Line. </para>

          <para>The Oder-Neisse Line has it origins in the agreements concluded between the Allies at Yalta and Potsdam in the closing months of the Second World War.

          <para>The issues of peace and security in Europe, which have included the questions of recognition and acceptance of Europe&#39;s postwar frontiers, have a central importance to global security which has been recognised by successive Australian Governments. These issues have also been central to the detente process and as such have been the subject of frequent multilateral discussion and consultation. The pursuit by the Federal Republic of Germany of what was known as the policy of Ostpolitik led to the successful conclusion of treaties by the FRG with the USSR ( 1970), Poland (1970), the GDR (1972) and the CSSR (1973). While no formal peace treaty has been concluded, these treaties accorded acceptance of the established boundaries of the FRG, GDR and Poland (including of course the Oder-Neisse line) and paved the way for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). This conference resulted in the signing of the Helsinki Accords by thirty-five heads of Government in August 1975. The CSCE consultations, the bilateral treaties which preceded them, and the meeting called to review the Helsinki arrangements in Belgrade in 1977 are the most recent examples of high level consultations on central European frontier issues. </para>

            <para>In his reply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> drew a distinction between a spent fuel repository and a nuclear waste dump. The latter implies final and permanent disposal of either spent nuclear fuel or separated high level waste. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> explained, a spent fuel repository is essentially a secure storage for spent fuel to prevent its theft or other diversion to non-peaceful uses. This does not imply final and permanent disposal and does not involve separated high level waste. </para>

              <para>The Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act empowers, inter alia, a State or Territory Supreme Court to order the examination of a witness in respect of proceedings before a court or tribunal in a foreign country. It is thus an enabling measure. Insofar as the jurisdiction of State Supreme Courts is concerned, the question whether the Act should continue to apply in a State is a matter for that State. Insofar as the Australian Capital Territory is concerned, the procedure for exercising the authority conferred by that Act on the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court is set out in Order 39 Rule 38 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. I am not aware of any difficulties having arisen from the operation of the Act in the Territory and consequently of any need to consider whether it should continue to apply in the Territory. The question whether the Act needs to be altered or repealed having regard to the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters 1968 has not arisen since Australia is not a party to the Convention. </para>

As to the effect of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 on State Parliaments and their competence to amend or repeal Imperial Acts, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has under consideration ways and means of enabling States to exercise legislative powers inconsistent with Imperial Acts notwithstanding the provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. </para>

          <para>7 ) The availability of sophisticated computing equipment means that the scientist can tackle problems which would otherwise have been impossible. Scientific and technical computing facilities are not directed towards obtaining savings in staff numbers, but providing facilities to undertake research problems which could not be contemplated without the use of computers. CSIRONET is also used for administrative requirements. However, in this area it has not been possible to quantify precisely what are the savings in staff numbers as a result of the computerised operations which the Organisation has been introducing progressively over several years. Within the administration there are general indications of savings as staff numbers engaged on salaries and accounts processing have not increased with the increase in general work load and there is less over-time being worked now than in the past. </para>
