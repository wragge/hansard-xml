        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned members and ex-members of the Citizens Forces of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>

          <item label="(">
            <para>1 ) On 14th February, 1975, the then Australian Government deprived the Officers and men of the Australian Citizen Naval Military and Air Forces of the distinctive and historic Decorations and Medals for long service and good conduct, namely the Reserve Decoration, the Efficiency Decoration, the Air Efficiency Award, the Efficiency Medal and Long Service and Good Conduct Medals, awarded for long and meritorious voluntary service in the citizen forces. </para>

            <para>The proposed substitution of the National Medal for these Decorations and Medals varies the principle of selective recognition of efficient voluntary service in the citizen forces in that it recognizes the period of service only and embraces also full time service as well in the defence forces as in the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. </para>

            <para>The Reserve Forces of Australia have been recognized by the present Government as a valuable- and costeffective component of the Defence Forces.

The humble petition of Pastor Peter Mullen and Members of the Full Gospel Chuch at 5 Lefroy Street, North Hobart electors of the Divisions of Denison and Franklin respectfully sheweth </para>
        <para>That the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), has purchased episodes of the American television programme known as S.O.A.P. for screening in Australia on the national network. </para>
        <para>The aforesaid programme was thought to be so pernicious and ethically offensive by the American population that it generated much unfavourable press, and caused no less than eleven sponsors to withdraw their support from the commercial stations broadcasting it. This programme purports to generate irresponsible merriment by shamelessly exploiting the tragedies of adultery, homo-sexuality, transvestism, impotency, incest, crime and senility. Such a program broadcasted on the Australian national network can only be detrimental to the welfare of the Australian society in as much as it will either cause or aggravate problems in the areas of emotional stability, delinquency, harmonious human relations, the unity of the family, and furthermore, the programme is an insult to the Christian creed and to those upholding it. </para>

Frankly, I have nothing to add to the statement that was brought down as to the facts of the matter. I do recall that one radio station in Sydney did use my name. I draw to the attention of the honourable gentleman the fact that the radio station was owned by the Labor Party. If the honourable gentleman is suggesting that I might take legal action against the Labor Party I will certainly bear that in mind. </para>

I do not think that anyone would disagree that Telecom Australia should advertise its services in an effort to build up the use of those services and therefore to reduce the cost to the consumer. However, I share the concern of the honourable member about the extent of the involvement of Telecom in sponsorship activities in respect of sporting events. I have written formally to the Australian Telecommunications Commission asking it to provide me with the rationale behind this approach to advertising. </para>

          <para>- I think that the smear tactic is being employed again today. I have no doubt that the first two questions are only part of a series of questions which the Opposition may well have in mind. All I need say to the House is that these matters have been subjected to a very detailed and exhaustive examination by persons independent of government. I refer to statements which have been issued earlier by Irish, Young and Outhwaite, chartered accountants, who are well known throughout the country. I refer also to comparable statements made by a national firm of solicitors, Mallesons, and I refer to the independent judgment which was a matter of public record by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Steven</inline> Charles, Q.C.

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. In view of the vast publicity given to the recent arrests of persons for alleged social security frauds, what steps has the Minister taken to assure the Greek community that prosecutions directed at individuals do not imply condemnation of that community as a whole and to thank those members of the community who did their duty and assisted the authorities with their inquiries? </para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable member for St George for his question. He, along with other members of the House, has a large community of Greek origin living in his electorate. I think we should make it absolutely clear that naturally enough all members of the Australian community are subject to the law. But, having said that, again I make it absolutely clear that these people who have been charged in relation to alleged frauds with respect to social security payments have been charged as individuals , not as members of any community or as people of any ethnic community background. It is an unfortunate fact that in situations of this nature some parts of the media tend to lay stress on the ethnic background of people involved. I would hope that all areas of the media in reporting instances of this nature would keep in mind the effect that their reports can have on the successful integration of people into the broader Australian community. There is no need for the members of the large Greek community in Australia to feel ashamed of their efforts in relation to the development of Australia as a nation. They make up one of the largest ethnic communities in Australia. They have a very long and distinguished history in contributions to the development of this country. I finish my answer by saying that members of the Greek community in Sydney have distinguished themselves by their efforts to assist the investigation because they, like all other Australians, feel that, if fraud is being perpetrated, they as individuals need to assist the authorities to bring the perpetrators of that fraud to justice, no matter what their ethnic background may be. </para>

              <para>- This was the sort of approach that some honourable members on the other side of the House took to members on this side of the House, and I resented that at the time too. The Minister said that he received the loan on normal commercial terms. Is it a fact that the loan to security ratio was about 83 per cent, whilst the law applying to loans from finance companies, solicitors and trustee company funds provides a maximum loan to security ratio of 66% per cent? Is it a fact that no penalty is involved for early repayment of his loan, whilst the vast majority of Australians who make an early repayment of home loans are subject to a penalty? Is it a fact that at the end of 15 years $43,750 of the principal, or 55.4 per cent of the total borrowed, will still be outstanding on his loan, whereas most Australian families repaying a home loan - </para>

The simple fact is this: These matters have been subject to a more exhaustive examination by persons outside of Government than I recall most other issues have been subject to examination during the whole period in which I have been in government. The statement which has been made, which has been based on the independent assessment of persons outside of this Government, is a matter of public record, and I do not intend to answer detailed questions in the House on that statement which I believe is self-explanatory. </para>

            <para>- Last year I established a working party in my Department to advise on a workable scheme for providing assistance towards the cost of orthodontic treatment for cleft lip and palate and related conditions. It has seemed anomalous to me and certainly to a lot of other people that whilst medical benefits have been payable in accordance with the medical benefits schedule for medical services provided or associated with treatment, they have not been available for the orthodontic services that have been also associated with the treatment. The working party feels that the matter can be resoled by an extension of the medical benefits schedule to include items associated with orthodontic treatment for cleft lip and palate conditions. Associated with this measure would be the operation of specialised clinics in some of the State hospitals. In that regard I have written to State Ministers seeking their co-operation in extending those clinics within the ambit of an extended benefits service. I expect to receive some co-operation from State Ministers in this regard. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Preliminary discussions also have been held with the Australian Dental Association and related societies. The actual implementation of the scheme that we have in mind to overcome this anomaly will, of course, be a matter for decision by the Government at the appropriate time, but I would like to give an assurance to the honourable member and the House, because I have received a tremendous amount of correspondence on the issue, that we have been working very strenuously on what is a very complex problem. There are a wide variety of services associated with the treatment of harelip and cleft palate, but the matter is in hand and I hope it may be resolved before the end of this year. </para>

I listened carefully to the three similar questions that were asked and I permitted them to be asked but in my judgment the question by the honourable member for Batman transgresses the Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>- One of the very real reasons why growers have taken such a strong stand against the live sheep export ban is that they are most concerned, at a time when drought affects so much of Australia, that they should have a reasonable and continuing opportunity to sell those stock at a profit. The live sheep exports to the Middle East have been a vehicle by which many pastoralists have been able to lighten their stock numbers. The circumstances of the request from the Victorian Government are a reflection of the fact that in many areas stock will die in the paddocks unless feed is available or growers are able to export their live sheep. A request has been received from the Victorian Government and that request, in conjunction with other requests for modifications to the present natural disaster assistance arrangements, is presently under scrutiny. </para>

          <para>The difficulty with the proposal is that the availability of fodder has also been affected because of the presence of aphids, which in many areas has meant that lucerne stands have been prejudiced. The availability of fodder- at least of lucerne- is a lot less than it has been in previous years. Drought fodder freight assistance is already available, but the Government is giving consideration to this other proposition. As soon as a decision has been made I expect that either the Prime Minister, in correspondence with the Premiers, or the Treasurer or I, will be making an appropriate statement. </para>

Did Cabinet in March 1 977, on the recommendation of the Minister, appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr G.</inline> N. Crawford-Fish as a director of the Australian Industry Development Corporation with a fee of $5,750 a year and a daily allowance of $125? Further, was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr CrawfordFish</inline> also appointed to a directorship of Commonwealth Hostels Ltd with a fee of $3,450 and a daily allowance of $ 1 2 5 ? </para>

Is the Prime Minister aware that one of the recommendations contained in that report seeks to have all external studies in the State of Victoria concentrated in the Deakin University at the expense of courses currently conducted in provincial colleges or institutes throughout Victoria? Will the Prime Minister give an assurance to this House that the Commonwealth Government will make its views known to the State Government and to the Tertiary Education Commission on its policy of decentralisation and what place the post-secondary education institutes play in provincial areas in Victoria? I instance Warrnambool, Ballarat, Bendigo and the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education at Churchill. Will the Prime Minister advise the House of the significance of the Partridge report to the current inquiry being undertaken by the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training in Australia? </para>

            <para>- I have no doubt that the Williams Committee will take into account the Partridge report which, as the honourable gentleman mentioned, refers only to Victorian institutions. The honourable gentleman has probably had discussions with the Gippsland Institute, just as I have had discussions with representatives of the Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education. My colleague, the Minister for Transport, also has been involved, I think, in helping to maintain and enhance facilities at the Gippsland Institute. The Partridge report was commissioned by the Victorian Goverment for the Victorian Government. In making any judgments on the matter the Victorian Government clearly had in mind that advice to the Federal Government on the development of tertiary institutions comes from a co-ordinated network of advising authorities and the Federal Government determines the funds which will be made available to the various colleges. I think it would be most unfortunate if any decisions were taken or views adopted that would lead to the loss of viability of the decentralised colleges throughout Victoria, which have had to build up their numbers and their courses, sometimes against quite strong opposition from other institutions which are entrenched and of much longer standing. This Government has supported the decentralised institutions not only in Victoria but also throughout Australia over a long period. It would want to continue to do so and would not want to take any action that might weaken those institutions. I do not think I can say anything more at this point because the formal decisions have to be made by the Victorian Government. No doubt we will be advised of them. Of course we will be making our own decisions which will be the ones that carry the financial implications for the development of colleges. </para>

Is it a fact that CSR finds these mills lacking in viability and is anxious to capitalise its losses by selling the mills for $7m? Is it a fact that the Government has agreed to assist CSR by agreeing to advance to the growers $3. 5m at 12 per cent interest? If this is the position, can the Minister explain how the growers would be expected to make mills viable when CSR has decided to leave the area? Is it a fact that for some years negotiations have been going on in secret and the rank and file of the growers know nothing about the transactions? Will the Minister indicate to the House that he supports the viability of the growers in the area and the retention of the mills? What action does the Government propose to take to assist the growers? </para>

            <para>- I am well aware of this issue, as I have been closely associated with the New South Wales canegrowers&#39; executives who have been involved in the discussions and negotiations regarding the transfer of ownership of the mills from CSR Limited to a prospective cooperative arrangement. The reasons why CSR might be selling the mills is not something which I should canvass here; that is a matter for its own decision. But it is a matter of great concern to the producers of New South Wales who depend upon these mills for their livelihood. It is important that these mills do continue in existence and do remain viable operations because the whole welfare and, indeed, the economy of quite a section of that part of the State depends upon the continuing operations of the New South Wales sugar industry. </para>

          <para>I point out that the negotiations and discussions which have been taking place have also been undertaken under the umbrella of the New South Wales Government, which has the prime responsibility for the agricultural activity in the area. I commend the New South Wales Government for the way in which it has been trying to bring about a harmonious settlement to this dispute, which has caused so much uncertainty and doubt for a considerable period of time. I believe that the New South Wales Government has made a request to the Commonwealth Government. This request is being handled by the Minister for Primary Industry. I think I am right in saying that a submission relating to this matter is to be received by the Commonwealth Government for consideration. </para>

            <para>- I most certainly do adhere to the statement I made earlier this year rejecting the notion that this country was in any kind of economic recession. I also affirm the statements that I made. The honourable gentleman of course, as one would expect given his shadow ministerial responsibilities in Opposition, has selectively chosen some of the economic indicators. If he had read my speech to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> luncheon he would have found that not only did I make the statement that he mentioned but also that I made an acknowledgment that there are certain indicators that are less than satisfactory. At no stage since in my present ministerial responsibilities have I denied that there are some adverse indicators so far as the Australian economy is concerned. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the honourable member looks at the progress which has been achieved in reducing our rate of inflation and if he looks below the surface of the December quarter national accounts- I am sure that the honourable gentleman has done that- he will find that they confirm a very strong growth both in government and private consumption. As somebody who has a better than average knowledge of statistics, he would know that one of the reasons the gross domestic product factor in the December national accounts was subdued was the very large stock run-down. When those accounts were released I acknowledged that they were disappointing. Of course they are disappointing, but one has to look below the surface. To ascribe to them a sort of economic debacle as the honourable gentleman tries to do is to misinform this House completely. Of course there are a number of unsatisfactory indicators. On the other hand there are a much greater number of very satisfactory indicators such as the recent statistics on computer sales which were released yesterday. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman is aware that some other statistics will be coming out today. I will not make any comment on them, for reasons which the honourable member will understand. I invite him to look at them, and I invite him to look again at the capital investment figures across the whole of the spectrum for the second half of last year. So what I said before on two occasions I say again: Although there are some unsatisfactory indicators suggestions from the </para>

            <para>- My reaction to the statement by the State Minister for Health is one of astonishment because under the arrangement that I had with the former State Minister for Health an amount of $ 10.92m was to be allocated for stage one of the Launceston General Hospital. We appropriated an amount of $5. 46m in this financial year. I now understand that Tasmania will allocate only $3. 75m, which is $1.71m less than it had agreed to allocate. It needs to know that the unexpended portion of the 1977-78 appropriation will not be carried forward into the next financial year. What this has served to do, of course, under the hospitals development program- a program that we have to assist the States with hospital development- is to deny other States $ 1.71m because Tasmania has not lived up to its obligation under an agreement between its Minister for Health and me. I am sending officers to Tasmania next week to have discussions on this matter in order to find out precisely what the Tasmanian Government intends to do next year. If it continues to break understandings like this we may have to review the arrangement. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Finance: Is it a fact that civilian employment declined by 1.2 per cent in the three months to February 1 978? Does the Minister still believe that the Budget forecast of growth in employment is actually occuring? What rate of employment growth is the target of the present Government? Will the Government increase capital expenditure grants to the States commensurate with their expressed desires for achieving employment growth? </para>

            <para>- The figures for the last part of last year and the first months of this year show a deterioration in employment which, of course, was expected and which, I hope, is understood by everybody here. No doubt the honourable member&#39;s question is based upon what I said yesterday. I invite him to read what I said yesterday when I was referring to the estimates provided in last year&#39;s Budget Papers by the previous Treasurer in which he indicated the targets for the growth of the economy and employment. I say to the honourable member for Cunningham and other members of the Opposition that they are falling into the very serious trap of looking at figures ibr a particular quarter or a particular time of the year and hoping that by repeating those figures they will somehow create a greater feeling of gloom and despondency about the economy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I indicate to the honourable member for Cunningham that when I talk about a Budget I refer to the growth over a year and that cannot be assessed until after the year is over. I am told that figures on unemployment will come out later today. I suggest that they will give a sign of what has been occurring as we move towards the end of the financial year, as I indicated yesterday. I say to the honourable member that he should not be too impatient. He will fall into a trap if he takes a selective set of figures based on a few months and tries to build a story over a whole financial year on them. The last matter as to whether the Government is considering capital expenditure is not a matter on which I shall comment. If the honourable member wishes to know about that he should ask the Treasurer. </para>

            <para>- The sugar industry has had a very difficult time insofar as the price increases granted by this Government have largely helped the millers and the refiners- perhaps the refiners in particular- but the cane growers have received very little benefit. As my colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources remarked in this House the other day, the International Sugar Agreement has been a factor towards stabilising international prices but generally the world prices for raw sugar are significantly below the levels that prevailed only a few years ago. Because of the low domestic price and the low export price, the position in many cane growing areas is becoming quite acute. It was in that circumstance that we dealt as expeditiously as possible with a request from the sugar industry for an increase in domestic sugar prices. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, there were a number of areas where I am afraid that the original submission was quite deficient. There was no indication of profitability, no indication of the cost factors affecting different areas of the industry- the raw sugar area, the millers and the refineries. For that reason we found it necessary to try to get as much information as was available. To a large degree that information has been provided, but there are still quite a number of areas where information is inadequate in relation to the normal assessment that would be made were the matter to be considered by the Prices Justification Tribunal, for example, or some other open forum. The Government has before it at the moment some recommendations from me following the scrutiny of the sugar industry, and I expect that a decision will be taken fairly shortly, possibly next week. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Finance will recall an answer that he gave to a question on 4 April in which he referred to what he termed substantial changes in the pattern of Budget outlays. Is the Minister aware that the share of capital outlays in the Budget has fallen from 20. 5 per cent in 1975-76- the same proportion as 10 years ago- to only 13.5 per cent for 1977-78? Further, is the Minister aware that the public sector accounts for 10 per cent of dwelling completions and about two-thirds of expenditure on nonresidential building and construction? Will the Minister agree that these savage cutbacks in the share of capital to total Budget outlays are directly responsible for depressing the state of the building and construction industry and contributing to the high levels of unemployment in that industry? </para>

            <para>-In regard to the question of Budget outlays, I took the opportunity to indicate to the House in answer to a question the tremendous change in the pattern of what has happened in Australia over the last 10 years. I referred particularly to the acceleration of those changes in the three years from 1973 to 1975 inclusive. If one looks at what has happened over that period of 10 years, there was an extraordinary increase from 1 7 per cent to over 27 per cent in social welfare expenditure, health expenditure almost doubled, and education expenditure trebled. However, in regard to education we have to allow for the fact that there has been a transfer of responsibilities from the State to the Federal area so that, in themselves, those stark figures do not reflect completely the position with regard to education. If one looks at reimbursements to the States, which are of the order of 20 per cent or more, of course there has been a reduction in assistance to industry and capital works. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition referred particularly to the building industry and talked about the depressed state of the economy. The Leader of the Opposition loves to talk about the depressed state of the economy. He will take any opportunity, any set of figures, any comment by anybody, to try to continue the story of gloom and despair that he has been telling ever since he went into Opposition. I do not know why he does not cheer up a little. Let us look at the building industry. Nobody would deny the significance of the building industry to the Australian economy; nobody would deny its significance to employment, but it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition and the industry started to realise that the over-expansion of the industry in 1976 created problems for the industry. When more homes are provided than the market requires, of course there has to be a period of adjustment. We are going through a period of adjustment. </para>
          <para>For the benefit of the Opposition, let me reinforce that point. The Opposition is falling into the error that it fell into when in government. It is too impatient; it will not wait until the true facts are known. The underlying forces within the economy demonstrate very clearly that there are some strong points, and it will not be too long in the future before the sorts of questions that the Leader of the Opposition asks, which are designed to depress further the Australian economy, will be seen for what they are- questions of propaganda that cannot be supported by facts. </para>

          <para>- I oppose the motion on this basis: The papers which have been tabled and which it is now proposed should be printed and published by this Parliament as I understand it comprise 120 pages. They were tabled in the Queensland Parliament. The Premier of Queensland brought <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Milan</inline> Brych to Brisbane. The only reason the Federal Parliament has been asked to publish the papers is that there was then an argument between the Government parties inside the Queensland Cabinet. The Queensland Minister for Health has tabled the papers in the Queensland Parliament. He cannot obtain permission to publish them in Queensland. Why should the Commonwealth pay for this? It is the Premier of that State who has got us into this trouble. The supporters of the Premier now say that he needs psychiatric treatment. I reached that conclusion some time ago. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If the Queensland Government wants to publish those papers, by all means let the Queensland Government do so. But why should we give more publicity to this man who is a charlatan and who is accepted to be a charlatan. Why should we have to pay for this action? The cost involved in printing a booklet on this matter must be quite significant. We are getting ourselves involved in an argument between groups of Ministers in the Queensland Government. Surely we should not take sides in that argument or, if we do take sides, surely the Commonwealth Government should not have to pay for this printing. Why should the taxpayers of Australia become involved in this charade? We have already had the spectacle of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett supplying aircraft to fly voters back from New </para>
        <para class="block">Zealand at a cost of $20 a head to vote for the present Premier so <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Milan</inline> Brych can continue his work on the Cook Islands and no doubt our tax payers are paying for this. The position is becoming quite ridiculous. We are dealing with people who generally are affected with a terminal carcinoma of some kind. These people are being hoodwinked- at least some of them areinto going to the Cook Islands. But surely we should not give publicity to this man so that more people will become involved in the argument. </para>
        <para>The whole point is that only one prominent person, the Premier of Queensland, is keen to start this man off in Australia. The Premier wants to open a clinic for him. He has plenty of money. We have seen in the Press today and yesterday that he is able to raise significant amounts of money personally, quite apart from money which might be provided by the Government. If he has that sort of money let him start a clinic in Queensland, and if he can get registered medical practitioners to work - </para>

As the honourable gentleman would know, if a document is printed as a parliamentary paper it is put in one of the bound blue series and is then available to people as a result of a printing procedure which is significantly more expensive than the procedure involved as a result of the passage of this motion. This motion authorises publication of the paper. It does not involve printing of the paper and is significantly without cost to the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of this motion is that because we as individuals do not necessarily accord with all that is contained within the paper, it is necessary for privilege to be given to the documents so that they can be examined and proper public scrutiny given to them. We are not in a position in which we are verifying the allegations made, but because of the character of the assertions contained in the documents, we believe the public should have the benefit of being able to read them and consider them, and for the members of this Parliament to deliberate upon them. The only way by which this can be achieved is by ensuring that parliamentary privilege pertains to them. The purpose of this motion is that parliamentary privilege will prevail without the necessary expense of having the documents printed. </para>

          <para>- I am concerned about the motion and the methods by which documents are to be given parliamentary privilege. This occurred a couple of years ago in the Senate when statements which were completely without foundation were given parliamentary privilege. Therefore, persons who may or may not have been named in those documents were exonerated in regard to the publishing of libel in relation to the statements they made. If the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> wishes to give the documents parliamentary privilege he should go through the whole exercise of having the paper printed. I do not think he ought to use this device. I am concerned about the use of parliamentary privilege to protect statements which are not made in this House and which are not at this stage relevant to the proceedings of this House. I do not object to public information or the provision of public information. If the Leader of the House wishes to give public information I think he ought to go through the processes which normally take place of publishing the information in report form, even if it is only a report on the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Brych,</inline> and making it a procedure of this Parliament. </para>

        <para>If I write a book in which I slander every person in Australia and come into this House and say that I think the slander is public information, should I be entitled to the protection of parliamentary privilege? I think that is really what it is all about. It is an important issue, but I think we are misusing the forms of this House in seeking parliamentary privilege to cover those documents. If the Leader of the House wants to table them and move that they be printed, that is within his power. To use a device to give them parliamentary privilege is, I think, a misuse of the forms of the House. </para>

I think the concern here is that if papers are tabled and any member of this chamber then sent any of the papers or any part of the papers to any other person, the member may find himself in the position that he is publishing a slander because he would not have any protection of parliamentary privilege. I think the purpose of the motion is to provide parliamentary privilege protection to a member of this House who feels it necessary to provide any of those papers to any constitutent. </para>

            <para>-I would not care to answer that question because I am not responsible for the extent of privilege of some matter of the Queensland Parliament. I am merely trying to inform the House of my understanding of the purpose of the motion. Let me make it clear. This is a matter of great notoriety. No doubt members of parliament have received correspondence on it from constituents and would wish to respond to that by using whatever material is available to them. I think the fear that is entertained by the Minister for Health is that a member of parliament, in serving the interests of his constituent by providing him with information that is available to the member himself, may be rendering himself liable to an action for libel. That would mean that the material that is available would not be distributed by the member. I think that is the purpose of the motion. As I understand it, the Minister can table a paper at any time but if somebody chose to distribute the paper that he tabled it would not have parliamentary privilege. The purpose is to give it parliamentary privilege. </para>

            <para>- I certainly understand the point that it is desired that these papers, which were tabled in the Queensland Parliament, should be privileged. There is a great deal of public interest in this matter. Members of parliament receive correspondence and they want to be able to answer the correspondence with impunity. They will have that impunity if the documents become a parliamentary paper. Surely the whole issue is this: Does that privilege not attach to these documents which were tabled in the Queensland Parliament if the Queensland Parliament orders them to be printed? I overlook the issue of whether there is to be a costly form of printing by putting them in type and book form or whether there will be a comparatively inexpensive form of printing, just by issuing one roneoed copy which anybody is then free to copy in other forms of any kind. There is the very real fear that if documents which are tabled in any parliament in Australia are then to be printed by the order of any other house of parliament in Australia there can be no limit to the damage that can be done. </para>

        <para>An instance has just been given of documents being tabled in the Senate a couple of years ago about members of this House. The members of this House had no remedy at all. They could not be heard. Anybody getting hold of the Senate documents could then make what use he wished of those documents. If a Minister seeks to make a statement, if any member can read a document into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or if the House allows any document to be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> it can be privileged, but at least there is some discipline over what Ministers say in statements, what documents are incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or what material can be read by an honourable member making a speech. Less than two and a half years ago there was a special session of the </para>
        <para class="block">Queensland Parliament and things were said then under privilege about people engaged in a federal election campaign. Nothing could be done about that. It was a gross abuse of parliamentary privilege. </para>
        <para>We are now talking about something being tabled in the Queensland Parliament. If the Queensland Parliament seeks to have that document printed there is nothing that anybody else can do about it- a member of parliament, a member of the public, a person in Australia or a person outside Australia. What is tabled in the Queensland Parliament and printed by order of the Parliament would then be completely privileged. That is the proper place for the decision to be taken. No doubt the Minister has formed a view, and I would not disagree with the view from what I have read or heard about the matter, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brych</inline> is a Cagliostro. If the Minister chooses to take the responsibility of making a ministerial statement on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brych</inline> then he is entitled to do so. I think he would be given leave to make that statement. If he wanted then to read any documents he could. If he were to table documents related to a statement that he made as a Minister, I do not suppose there would be any objection to having those documents printed. The objectionable thing, surely, is in this House ordering the printing of documents which are tabled in another parliament. This is not just a technical objection. It is not a trivial matter. It can have very real implications. We know how often in this Parliament questions are asked about what happens in other State parliaments. Certainly things are said in State parliaments about what happens in this Parliament. I can even remember the situation arising of Governors being given speeches criticising the Federal Government. </para>
        <para>The mischief has gone far enough. Why is it that the Minister- a very fine Minister from what I have seen of him- has made a statement and has tabled documents in the Queensland Parliament, and the normal process of having those documents printed by the order of the Queensland Parliament has not been carried out? I believe that this is without precedent. I believe that it would be a very dangerous precedent to set. We should remember that if we in this House order the printing of documents which have been tabled in the Queensland Parliament and which, for reasons that have been suggested, the Queensland Parliament will not order to be printed, then the same thing can be done about any member of this Parliament. Any member of this Parliament can then table a document and then any other parliament can have it printed. It can give privilege to something which may be completely unfounded and completely defamatory. I believe that this matter ought to be considered further. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>I would be grateful if, for the protection of honourable members, you could make further inquiries into this matter and then give a ruling. There are matters other than the Brych report and the documents which have been tabled in the Queensland Parliament that ought to be taken into consideration. For example, in the last couple of weeks the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gregory</inline> Gowans, Q.C., on the dealings of the Victorian Housing Commission has been tabled in the Victorian Parliament. Clearly, that is a privileged document so far as members of the Victorian Parliament are concerned. If I, as a Victorian member of the House of Representatives, received an inquiry from somebody in Tasmania or Queensland for information about the report and I then send a copy of the Gowans report, does that mean that I am not covered by the privilege which would have been attached to me when I was the member for Melbourne in the Victorian Parliament? I think the extent to which there is reciprocity or full faith and credit as it were about the privilege attaching to a document tabled in another Parliament needs to be clarified. It is a very important matter. It is not a matter that had occurred to me before. Perhaps it had not occurred to many other members. It needs to be clarified and I would be grateful if, perhaps in the next week or two, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> could give a ruling on the matter. </para>

I would not want to make a statement upon which he or any other member might rely to be free to do as he wished, impervious to civil action brought by somebody. The honourable member will have to make his own legal judgment on that. I appreciate the point on which the honourable member is seeking information. I will do what I can to provide him with the information. I am bound to say that I have under request at this time a legal opinion from the Secretary, Attorney-General&#39;s Department which relates to matters of this kind. I have not yet received his reply. He may be as reluctant as I to give a legal opinion. </para>

          <para>- I join in this discussion because I want to make a very personal point. I agree with the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> in his estimate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brych. Mr Brych</inline> is deceiving a lot of people and is tearing a lot of families apart in this country. He is probably bankrupting a number of people. So it is important that the information should get out somehow. I am now confused about the actual situation of privilege. I want to get my hands on the document and distribute it to the dozens of people who write to me asking for advice. I intend to do this even if it means that I end up in gaol. </para>

          <para>- In view of what the honourable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> has said I wish to comment on this matter. I appreciate the views put to the House by the honourable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam).</inline> I certainly did not appreciate how potentially dangerous this precedent could be if it is followed. I ask the Minister- I say with thorough genuineness that he has always behaved as an eminently reasonable person in this House- to defer action on this matter and to consider it further with his colleagues because there will be no end to the sorts of things which can be done once practices of this type are initiated. For instance, it would not be very difficult for an Opposition to produce a document which may be thoroughly spurious and defamatory, to seek to have it incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or tabled so as to obtain parliamentary privilege, to be thwarted in that attempt and then to arrange for the document to be presented in a State Parliament where there was a favourable majority. What I am putting to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> is that I do not believe he has had enough time to consider carefully the points raised by the honourable member for Werriwa. I confess that I did not feel a great sense of mission or concern about this matter when it was initially raised here until I heard the points cogently put by the honourable member for Werriwa. I ask the Minister, who is a man clearly reasonable in these matters, not to proceed with the matter now but to consult his colleagues and consider the matter further. Then, if he really feels determined to proceed with it, he can come back to the House and do so. I am terrified at the sorts of circumstances which could develop from this initiative. We could all live to regret this sort of thing, even within the term of this Parliament. We all know the ploys that some people can use in their efforts to establish a point which has no substance in fact so as to discredit a person. There are many people who do that; it does happen sometimes. I am terrified of the possibilities which could flow from this initiative in the light of the points that have been cogently put by the honourable member for Werriwa. </para>

          <para>- I think the issue raised by the honourable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G.

Anything he said must not be taken to inhibit proper debate in this place where this Parliament has proper constitutional power to debate a matter. I do not think he is questioning the constitutional power of this House to deal with matters of this sort. I refer to Erskine May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice.</inline> On page 173 he refers to breaches of privilege and contempts. He refers to complaints against members or officers in either House; that is the House of Commons or the House of Lords. The concluding paragraph states: </para>

          <para>- I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> on this matter, but unlike the honourable member for Prospect and the honourable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> I have no clear view on the efficacy of the supposed cures of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brych.</inline> As a member of the public I am more or less dependent on the information that comes out. It seems to me that there has been ample time for the facts of this matter to be disseminated in a proper and orderly way within the powers of the Parliament had it been deemed necessary to do so by the Minister responsible. It has yet to be determined for the public whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brych</inline> has a cure. I recognise the great agony that is occurring in the community because of the confusion on the whole subject. It seems to me rather incongruous that when this matter was raised by the Minister responsible in the Queensland Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Edwards,</inline> the Government of that State and the Minister&#39;s own colleagues did not see fit to carry out the process that the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> is now suggesting. Not understanding the medical side of what is involved in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brych</inline> &#39;s alleged cure, I am not satisfied that there is a clear case one way or another because of the dispute in the Queensland Parliament. It seems terribly dangerous that where a sovereign government cannot itself resolve what the correct process ought to be in respect of the reports and information, we, in another parliament, should automatically pick up the matter in dispute from that sovereign government and endorse it, without having seen any of the documents- in this case, contained in the papers that the Minister for Health seeks to authorise to be publishedand without having been told by the Minister anything about the purpose for which he seeks the dissemination of the material. I rather suspect that many of the documents that the Minister seeks to have published are of government origin from another country, probably New Zealand. Therefore, ought not those documents if they emanated from departments of the Government of New Zealand and New Zealand health authorities have privilege or status in themselves? It seems to me that we are overdoing the exercise in having to give privilege of this Parliament to documents from the New Zealand Government and New Zealand health authorities. Ought not those documents- one would expect that they would comprise the majority of the papers before the Queensland Minister- if it is in the public interest to disseminate them, be disseminated automatically without having to be brought in here? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I conclude by saying that, as has been expressed by previous speakers from this side, I see a terrible danger in what would be in effect using this Parliament to rubber-stamp with privilege a batch of papers to which the sovereign government in which this matter has originated, the Queensland State Government, has not seen fit to give privilege. I strongly urge that there be consultation between the Commonwealth Minister and the Queensland Government to resolve this matter and that the Minister report back to this Parliament. </para>

          <para>- in reply- The last comment of the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> really highlights the futility and the stupidity of his argument. This is a matter of great public concern and the exposure of the facts should not be dependent on one Minister or one member of this Parliament conferring with a Minister of another Parliament. I respect the views of honourable members and I understand the reasons for their concern, but I and other members on this side of the Parliament have given serious consideration to what is the right and proper course to ensure that the public is not denied essential knowledge and that the members of this Parliament are not denied privilege so that they may act in the public interest. The matter of whether the Queensland Parliament should print a document is its prerogative. However, this Parliament has a real prerogative to make its own decisions in the public interest. Honourable members of this Parliament are involved in this issue in a real public sense. Indeed, the Commonwealth Government is involved because of its responsibilities for immigration and entry laws, for Commonwealth benefits that are paid for medical services and for general public health. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There is a need for public knowledge on this issue. The public has the right to know the facts and the views that have been put by eminent people. This Brych issue is not a three day wonder; it has been raging as an issue in the minds of many people for many many months and there is much confusion, anguish and concern. It is a very emotional issue; people can fall victim of their concern should any of their loved ones be involved or have cancer. I feel that this Parliament has a responsibility to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that the <inline font-style="italic">public</inline> is warned, that it has the facts, and that health writers, medical writers, journalists and the media have full and proper uninhibited access to what information is available to me and to what information is available to the Queensland Parliament. I think that to deny proper access to that information through a technical argument which in any event I do not think can be sustained would be inappropriate. I shall quote from <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> by Erskine May in respect of the prerogatives of a House of Parliament. Page 173 states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The leading principle which appears to  prevade  all the proceedings between the Houses of Parliament is that there shall subsist a perfect equality between them, and that they shall be, in every respect, totally independent one of the other. Hence, it is that neither House can claim, much less exercise, any authority over a member of the other. Neither House of Parliament can take upon itself to punish any breach of privilege or contempt offered to it by any member of the other House. </para>

            <para>-Yes, sir, I do. Earlier I sought the leave of the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> to make a statement but I was advised that it would be a far more satisfactory way to present this matter as a personal explanation. The <inline font-style="italic">Nation Review</inline> of this week presented a story in relation to the Queensland redistribution with the headline &#39;Cameron Loses Again&#39;. I shall refer now to a story on page 2 of today&#39;s Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail,</inline> a section of which states:   . . a small but powerful group may move to undercut Liberal MP <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> Cameron in his south-east Queensland seat of Fadden. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">These reports tend to give a very real impression that the member for Fadden is no longer capable of arriving at a rational conclusion. As a representative of the people I have no alternative but to use this Parliament today to present the facts as they are in relation to the redistribution. I assure all honourable members that I do not do this with a sense of relish. However, my judgment is being seriously questioned. I do not do this in anger, but rather with a deep appreciation of the privilege afforded me in this place and with a degree of anguish that only those people who have been in this position would really understand. </para>
        <para>A resume of what I shall relate is that a series of events has taken place. This has driven me on in the belief that all is not well. Much must be related to allow others to reach their own conclusions. Because of the time factor, I shall withhold events of minor consequence and shall replace names with a code to avoid implicating those people whose names do not really need to be stated. Initally, I state my unshakeable belief that the system of redistribution as designated under the Commonwealth Electoral Act is so designed to ensure as honest and as fair a redistribution as possible. No electoral Act can completely compensate for the frailties of mankindbias, dishonesty, et cetera- but we try to avoid them and woe betide he or she who is caught fiddling the system. </para>
        <para>Some assertions I shall make cannot be proved and might be subject to denial. I can only assure the House that I shall make no claim unless its truth is thickly veneered with vivid recollection. Actual dates may be omitted because their significance was not apparent in the early stages. Remember, I have spoken inside and outside this chamber on redistribution, so no man can cast the accusation that I am a coward using the highest form of protection that can be afforded in this land. </para>
        <para>To give the House a recollection of the actual machinery dates of the Queensland redistribution, I supply the following information: On 19 April, the Commissioners were appointed; on 20 April, the Ministerial announcement was made in the Senate; on 26 April, the advertisement appeared in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette;</inline> 26 May was the closing date for submissions; 9 June was the closing date for comments on submissions; on 10 August, the Commissioners&#39; proposal was published; 9 September was the closing date for objections; and, on 26 September 1977, the final report of the Commissioners was presented. This is all important, as will become apparent. </para>
        <para>Every honourable member in this place was very much aware for some time prior to the commencement of the redistribution that there had to be a redistribution of seats in the Australian electorate. To present this explanation chronologically, I inform the House of a conversation with a very senior Queenslander in this place early last year. He informed me that he had been subjected to an approach in regard to Queensland&#39;s third Commissioner. He told me that he was &#39;not going to have a bar of them having their fingers in the redistribution&#39;. No honourable member needs to be reminded how sensitive a subject this is to members of the House of Representatives. I was to be assured in January this year, and I accept the assurance, that the appointment of the third Commissioner was not the whim of one man but was a Cabinet decision. Nevertheless, this man&#39;s comment left the indelible impression upon me that he was a power broker as far as the redistribution was concerned. </para>
        <para>It was perhaps during June and most definitely at the latest early July that I heard how the Commissioners allegedly had been informed that the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull)</inline> was dispensable in this redistribution. Yes, this information was secondhand, but the honourable member for Bowman can testify to the truth that at least this claim was strongly stated and that the information had come from the Commission. I paid only a little attention to the claim because I considered it almost inconceivable that a Commission could approach its task in such a manner. Nevertheless the information was fairly well known. </para>
        <para>In August, after the House resumed for the Budget session, I informed the senior Queenslander that it was being alleged that he had been &#39;out to get&#39; David Jull. I clearly recall this senior Queenslander &#39;s response as he raised his right eyebrow and said that he had heard these allegations himself and was rather surprised because he had always believed that Queensland members were &#39;a fairly happy group&#39;. I invite honourable members to recall the size of the report entitled &#39;Copies of the suggestions, comments or objections lodged with the Distribution Commissioners for Queensland&#39;. They will remember that the thickest report for any State lodged with any Distribution Commissioners came from our State. </para>
        <para>One minute after the commencement of 10 August I learned that Cameron and my old seat of Griffith would be parted because of the action of the &#39;three men with a pen&#39;. I accepted it at that time but, at a time of understandable disappointment, I could not help but re-hear the words &#39;not going to have a bar of them having their fingers in this redistribution&#39;. My submission against the Commissioners &#39; proposals, as contained in page 276 of the report, was in this time of stress handed to the secretary of the person who appeared to swing so much power. I wanted him to know my objections in detail. I have no knowledge whatsoever of his drawing this to the attention of the Commissioners and I make no claim that he contravened section 22 of the Act by communicating to the Commissioners the senseless destruction they had rendered, politically speaking, in my then seat of Griffith. </para>
        <para>By early August reports were rife that one of the Commissioners had been so disenchanted with the way the redistribution had been carried out that for two days he refused to sign the report. In early October, in the presence of almost all, if not all, Queensland Liberals gathered at a meeting in this House, the senior Queenslander, after I raised the matter of the Commissioner&#39;s reluctance, snapped back saying: &#39;But he signed the final report, didn&#39;t he?&#39; Errors can be made, but the impression gained by some was that he knew of this. In my mind, he confirmed a suspicion that he, a senior Queenslander, had a firm pipeline to the Commission. </para>
        <para>My suspicions had been mightily aroused when the final maps came out on 26 September. On 26 August this person attended a meeting in Brisbane and claimed that another prominent Queenslander, whose name will be left completely unspoken because there is no point in bringing it in, had rung him and for political reasons had suggested that the name of Mcpherson should go back to a seat which had been named &#39;Gold Coast&#39; when the first maps came out on 10 August. The meeting agreed that the name &#39;McPherson&#39; was the proper name for what had been called &#39;Gold Coast&#39; and that it would suggest that the seat I now hold, which had originally been called &#39;McPherson&#39; should be called &#39;Fadden&#39;. It was left to Parliament to make this <inline font-style="italic">decision because</inline> it was in accordance with the Fox report of 1969, Parliamentary Paper No. 35. Not one suggestion, comment or objection calling for a change of names is contained in the Commissioners&#39; report. Yet it happened. The potential political bomb, which Queenslanders would understand, was defused. At this point of time I was unable actually to prove that anyone had contact with the Commission, but my deep-rooted scepticism will be understood. </para>
        <para>Sometime in October, after the final maps came out, I commenced inquiries into the background of the Commissioners. I learnt that the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in Queensland was a former Divisional Returning Officer for the seat of McPherson. The following is in no way- I repeat, in no way- meant to implicate the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> I checked with that Minister&#39;s office to find more background on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman,</inline> the Queensland Electoral Officer and the Chief Commissioner. Two days after my inquiry I was told by the Minister&#39;s secretary to check with a certain Queenslander because he had recommended <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman&#39;s</inline> appointment following the retirement of Queensland&#39;s previous Chief Electoral Officer. That such a recommendation was made is not extraordinary because governments of all political persuasions are faced with this task. However, it did prove a definite link existed between this senior Queenslander and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman</inline> in the past and that he regarded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman</inline> highly. </para>
        <para>At the end of October and in early November, the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and I made various speeches highlighting an apprehension as to the impartiality and honesty of the Queensland redistribution. No one can condemn us for suspecting all was not right in the State of Denmark. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> on 30 October 1977, at 1 p.m., I had further cause for grave disquiet. A senior contender for the Liberal Party&#39;s nomination for the seat I now hold, whom I shall describe as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr X,</inline> told me how at the request of &#39;a Minister&#39; he had prepared a map of what Queensland&#39;s new and nineteenth seat should be and how, as he said, it came out exactly as I suggested&#39;. He explained to me how he had included a large rural area to discourage anyone from the city from nominating. Some 10 days later in a conversation in my home he amended this claim to the effect that he had not included the Boonah subdivision in his submission because, to quote him, &#39;it was deadly&#39;. I understood what he meant, following the National Party&#39;s high vote in that area. I ask for permission of the House to incorporate in Hansard a transcript of that conversation. It serves to verify that an earlier conversation did take place. </para>

            <para>-During the first conversation <inline font-weight="bold">Mr X</inline> told me how he had put in a copy of his plan to the Liberal Party- this is quite legitimate, and I do not make complaints about him in this speech- in the early stages of redistribution. The Liberal Party did not accept his suggestion for the new seat but somehow, as it turns out, it came closer to the actual seat of Fadden than any submission recorded in the reports. The honourable member for Lilley, the honourable member for Bowman and I have now seen at Liberal Party headquarters his suggested seat. Whilst I concede that one can do anything with figures, I give him approximately 76 per cent for anticipating the final new seat. In comparison with the other submissions he got the high distinction. By this time I was really unsettled. Indeed, even weeks before, I was seriously considering the question of going down with the good ship Griffith. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> can testify to the truth of that. It is history now that I nominated for the seat of Fadden, won preselection against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr X,</inline> and after a hard battle against such a respected notable as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clem</inline> Jones I won the seat. </para>

          <para>More than half of Queensland&#39;s present federal Liberal senators and members who held office at the time of the redistribution, held and still hold the view that the federal redistribution in Queensland was subject to local outside interference. </para>
          <para>Among that group are people whose political fortunes were not affected one way or the other by the redistribution, and who cannot be accused of having an axe to grind. </para>
          <para>The minority group that remains unconcerned and unmoved, is comprised of members whose fortunes either remained intact, or were improved beyond their wildest dreams; and the &#39;fiddler&#39;. </para>
          <para>A regrettable feature is that for more than a decade, when asked about the honesty of federal redistributions, I looked people straight in the eye in reply, in the belief that they were genuinely beyond outside interference. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Electoral Act requires the composition of the Redistribution Commission to include one Commonwealth public servant, one State public servant, and one other person whose occupation is not designated. </para>
          <para>The third person appointed on this occasion in Queensland was a Commonwealth public servant. </para>
          <para>The Act must be amended to exclude Commonwealth public servants from the third position. They are not beyond outside interference, because they are like everyone else, and have a keen eye for promotion. </para>
          <para>Queensland &#39;s redistribution gave the ALP a fair go, but the interferer&#39;s motivation was not to &#39;get&#39; that party. </para>
          <para>I indicated my disgust with veiled comments in the parliament some weeks ago. Now that I am back, and cannot be accused of indulging in a loser &#39;s sour grapes, and my crusade will not endanger innocent colleagues, I feel free to expose the matter when parliament resumes. </para>
          <para>Federal redistributions have been placed on the reputed level of some State redistributions, and I serve warning on those involved that this matter will not rest here. </para>

He, with others, saw the honourable member for Bowman, the honourable member for Lilley and me on 19 January in his office. The senior Queensland Liberal was also present, and much discussion ensued. The senior Queensland Liberal gave the assurance that in relation to the redistribution he had had no contact with the commissioners either directly or indirectly or in any way whatsoever at any time. Quite a firm commitment. We were informed that he had given this assurance to the Prime Minister previously.

In view of the assurance given to the Prime Minister- the statement that there was no contact with the commissioners either directly or indirectly at any time- in our presence and in view of his law officers &#39; advice it is more than understandable that the Prime Minister wanted the matter dropped and my assurance that I would pursue it no more. I declined to give that assurance, and I have no argument with his dismissal of me. Nevertheless, my unpreparedness to give up the chase was based on good reasons. </para>
        <para>I had witnessed my claims torn apart in the early stages on the grounds that I had not supporting evidence by way of statutory declarations or affidavits. Remembering how the senior Liberal had assured the Prime Minister and others at that meeting on 19 January that he had had no contact with the commissioners either directly or indirectly or in any way whatsoever I could not help but be deeply impressed by the following. I was told how at a luncheon in the town of Beaudesert on 26 July the senior Queensland Liberal had explained to those present the details of redistribution and how it would affect them. Honourable members will recall the dates of the Queensland program. This information was conveyed to 1 1 people at that luncheon- who knows at what <inline font-style="italic">other places and</inline> at other times, maybe even prior to that date. That was the case- no contact either directly or indirectly at any time. I found it difficult to accept. </para>
        <para>I shall now read a statutory declaration signed by four of the people who were at that luncheon. A fifth has since declared to me verbally her similar recollection of events. The statutory declaration states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We, the undersigned <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> Beaudesert, in the State of Queensland, do solemnly and sincerely declare that we were present at a meeting held at the Logan and Albert Hotel, Beaudesert on Tuesday, 26 July, 1977 and we have clear recollection of the following being said by the Honourable - </para>

        <para class="block">That is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Y-</inline> as the candidate in the new electorate, as outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr -</inline></para>
        <para class="block">That is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Y-</inline> before the commissioners had even announced the new boundaries. </para>
        <para class="block">This document was signed by four individuals from the town of Beaudesert. I have not read out their names, but I assure the Parliament that they are all highly responsible individuals and were motivated by recent events to present me with this statutory declaration which was signed on 28 March. That luncheon was 15 days before the redistributions even came out. What is more, the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr X</inline> is the man who claimed he was asked by &#39;a Minister&#39;- remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr X</inline> was the man being promoted and presenting himself as a candidateto draw up the map which scored approximately a 76 per cent success rate, without even having knowledge of how State-wide quotas would eventuate. </para>
        <para>The name &#39;Gold Coast*? It was later explained that the reason the commissioners changed the name back to McPherson was because it was a mistake. How does someone anticipate a mistake without having contact, directly or indirectly, at some stage? At heart I would prefer peace at any time. However, when I believe something is wrong I will pursue the matter until I expose it or am satisfied that all is above board. If that which incites others to hunt me into the ground be the exposure of that which seems to be outside the laws of this land, I can make no apology. I only express my sadness that circumstances exist to lead me to conclude that something is so dramatically wrong. </para>
        <para>In conclusion I wish to read an extract from the Logan and Albert <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> a newspaper in Beaudesert. The article refers only in part to the 1977 redistribution. The article does not point any bone at anyone. This is in an editorial in that newspaper. </para>
        <para>As an aside by the way, although it is historical fact now that we have the seat of Fadden through the redistribution of Federal boundaries, it was quite common knowledge even back to the early part of last year that Beaudesert would be withdrawn from its long-standing Gold Coast connections in the Federal scene, and become part of a new electorate which would also include the town of Boonah; common and public knowledge. </para>

        <para class="block">In the telegram <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carige</inline> stated that he had had a disturbing telephone conversation with the Chief Electoral Commissioner for Queensland. At the end of his telegram he invited me to telephone him. I did. He informed me that on 1 December 1977 he had a discussion with a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman</inline> about the National Aboriginal Conference election which was held a week after the State election. There were some problems and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carige</inline> rang <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman</inline> about those problems. At the end of that conversation <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carige</inline> said to him: &#39;I do not know why I should even be bothered to talk to you after what you have done to my seat&#39;. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carige,</inline> whom I rang this morning and who actually took notes of the conversation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman</inline> said: &#39;It is not all my own work. I cannot and will not accept the blame on my own&#39;. He then said: &#39;Others who ought to support you in fact did not &#39;. </para>
        <para>I cannot draw too many conclusions from those words but that makes many honourable members on this side of the House believe that things were far from being above board. The honourable member for Bowman ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jull)</inline> and I have never been convinced that all was well. There are other stories. I have only mentioned one that I cannot prove. There have been several cases where it has been reported that when the public objections, suggestions and comments went in the attitude was that the commissioners had been given an instruction that there were to be no alterations in Queensland. I hate doing anything like this. It distresses me. But I also have an obligation to the laws of this land. I believe that they have been flouted. What has really driven me on is that on the one hand we had a categorical denial that anything had taken place- an emphatic statement of denial that there had been any connection, direct or indirect, at any stage- and on the other we have the continuing saga of little pieces of advice and information coming from various parts of Queensland. We now have a statutory declaration to the effect that even two weeks before the redistribution was announced in Queensland a Minister of this Government- I feel in all fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> I must name the other Minister- walked round the State toting the candidate to succeed him in the seat that he had felt was most suitable. If I have made a mistake and it can be proven that I have made a mistake, I will do what I said I would do in the Prime Minister&#39;s office on 19 January, that is, come in here <inline font-style="italic">like</inline> a man and say that I am wrong. But I cannot believe that I can be so wrong. At this point of time I still cannot come in and apologise to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson.</inline></para>

            <para>- Yesterday during Question Time the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> was asked a question by the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and in his answer the Minister for Finance referred to the growth in employment. It is the distinct recollection of honourable members on this side of the House that the Minister for Finance specifically said that there had been a growth in employment during this year. We understood that to mean during this financial year. I attempted to obtain a copy of the &#39; greens &#39; yesterday from the Minister&#39;s office but was told late last night that the Minister had them in his possession. I checked the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report this morning. What is contained in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> does not accord with my recollection or the recollection of other honourable members on this side of the House.

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave- I wish to inform the House of the decisions taken by the Government to proceed with further development of the tactical fighter force project. Honourable members will be aware that in the Defence White Paper tabled in the House in November 1976 the Government stated that it had decided to proceed now with project development for the acquisition of new tactical fighters. It accepted that, subject to all of the necessary evidence being accessible, a decision on a generic type aircraft would be made in 1976-77 after detailed investigations had been completed. In November 1976 a request for proposals was issued to prospective suppliers of new fighter aircraft. Proposals were received progressively through early 1977 and some were delayed awaiting overseas government clearance until later in the year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposals have been subject to desk evaluation in terms of information provided on performance, cost, delivery schedules, programs for development and for reduction of technical risk, and opportunities for Australian industry involvement. At the same time, the Air Force and the Department of Defence have been actively reviewing the strategic need, the financial programming implications of satisfying it under various options, the level of air capability appropriate for Australia in order to secure its interests, and the phasing by which that capability might be acquired. </para>
          <para>Attention has been given not merely to the proposals given to us by prospective suppliers but also to the emerging option of extending the life of the Mirage aircraft which we already possess. The proven durability of the Mirage aircraft opens the prospect of extending the life of some of the aircraft beyond the early 1980s and, subject to the feasibility and economics of a program of modification and improvement, this creates new possibilities of satisfying Australia&#39;s tactical fighter requirements by a mixture of new aircraft and refurbished Mirage aircraft. </para>
          <para>The country needs not only aircraft with adequate weapons and performance, but also an industry to maintain them, modify them and repair them. The number of countries with the industrial and technological capability of producing at reasonable cost an advanced tactical fighter is shrinking. It has to be accepted that production of such an aircraft by Australia is not a feasible proposition; but Australian industry must receive an adequate share of work and technology arising from the decision to re-equip the RAAF&#39;s fighter force. The involvement of Australian industry will be a consideration when it comes to negotiation with a preferred supplier. In preparation for this stage a range of possible Australian industry programs is being examined. A balance has to be sought which would strengthen the technical ability of Australian industry to support the new tactical fighter through its life at reasonable cost, without extending unduly either the timetable or the cost of acquiring a new type of fighter. </para>
          <para>All these matters must be carefully weighed and examined. As I have said before, I make no apology for the deliberate process of examination that I have had carried out. This project is potentially the most costly single defence project ever undertaken by Australia. The type of fighter chosen for introduction in the 1980s will be in service after the end of this century. Tactical fighter force capabilities encompass air defence, air superiority, interdiction including antishipping capability, tactical reconnaissance and close support of ground forces. It is beyond doubt that the Royal Australian Air Force must at all times possess these capabilities, whether in time of high or low current threat. As with all military skills employing high technology, the lead time for acquiring them is long and the Australian core force must possess them. What has to be assessed, against the strategic situation of the country, is the standard and quantity of aircraft that we need to acquire, how quickly we need to acquire them, and the cost which the community should bear while satisfying other defence needs as well. This of course has been foremost in the mind of the Government in considering the steps that should now be taken in the further development of the project for creating the tactical fighter force in the 1 980s and beyond. </para>
          <para>As I mentioned earlier, we have a substantial asset in the Mirage aircraft which presently comprise our TFF. These aircraft have provided an excellent capability in the air-to-air role, and the aircraft also have an air-to-surface role. We have presently three squadrons and an operational conversion unit. Two of these squadrons are deployed to Malaysia. The capability of the Mirage can be maintained at present levels until the early 1980s. The capability will start to decline thereafter through aircraft attrition. The capability possessed by the country will begin to degrade substantially around the mid-1980s if there were not some acquisition of new fighters and a Mirage refurbishment program. </para>
          <para>While there is still some uncertainty about the life of the Mirage airframe, its air-to-air missiles and its avionics, it now appears that with refurbishment the Mirage aircraft can be retained as a cost-effective component of our tactical fighter force through to the late 1 980s. Even with refurbishment there will be some reduction in the Mirage air-to-air capability by the mid-1980s, but if a new fighter were to become operational in that time-scale in the air-to-air role the Mirage would provide an important complementary capability to that of the new fighter. </para>
          <para>For these and other reasons, which I will mention later, the Government has decided that project development should proceed with emphasis on a new fighter with primary capabilities in the air-to-air role. It is contemplated that aircraft would commence entry into service about 1983 and a first squadron of new aircraft would become operational by about 1985. The Mirage would continue to have a limited air defence capability beyond that time and its surface attack capability would be maintained. Air superiority is to be given priority in the acquisition of a new fighter because of the fundamental importance of this capability, both for defence against air attack, in ensuring the freedom of our own operations, and to enable our surface attack aircraft to operate effectively against an enemy. Priority also stems from the fact that there are several other capabilities in the Defence Force that can contribute to the surface interdiction and close support roles. </para>
          <para>The Government in coming to these conclusions believes that the retention of a threesquadron structure together with an operational conversion unit is a desirable planning objective for the Defence Force. As a planning base the Government considers that the number to be initially procured should provide for a squadron of aircraft, plus training aircraft and a limited number of attrition aircraft. Subject to later decisions on the Mirage component of the fighter force, it could be expected that further procurement would follow later. The Government has decided to confine further evaluation of aircraft to the following air-to-air aircraft: The McDonnell-Douglas Corporation FI 5 and F18A, the Northrop Corporation F18L, the General Dynamics FI 6, the Panavia Tornado and the Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000. </para>
          <para>In order to help the Government confirm a short list of new fighters for the air-to-air role, an overseas visit at senior departmental level will be made within the next few weeks. This team will explore with government and administration elements, future procurement intentions of other countries, production expectations of the contending aircraft and their weapons systems, and possibilities of technological developments. Once the Government is in a position to announce a short list, an operational and technical mission and an industrial mission will be sent overseas to carry out detailed evaluations of each aircraft on the short list. A final recommendation will then be made to the Government on the aircraft to be initially acquired and other associated matters including detailed proposals covering the agreed involvement of overseas countries in an Australian aircraft industry program. </para>
          <para>By about the end of this calendar year detailed proposals of a Mirage refurbishment program should be sufficiently advanced to enable the Government to make an initial commitment to this program. The refurbishment of Mirage aircraft will provide an important stimulus to the Australian aircraft industry. It will assist in the build-up of appropriate skills as a precursor to Australian industry&#39;s involvement in acquiring and supporting in service the new aircraft that is to be selected. </para>
          <para>In conclusion I would like to stress to honourable members the importance and concern with which the Government views this proposal. What the Government has sought is the best way in which to achieve a fighter force appropriate to our needs. The Government is conscious primarily of the need to safeguard this country; to ensure that we maintain the level of air defence capability that we need now and in the shorter term, and that future governments be placed in a position to enlarge that capability in a practical way should unforeseen circumstances in any longer term future make that necessary. In perceiving that necessity for insurance for the future, the Government intends to progress the acquisition of a new fighter, but also intends to conserve and use fully the valuable asset we have in the Mirage IIIO </para>
          <para>The Government assures honourable members that its decision to acquire a new fighter- and I repeat that it is a most costly venturewill be taken in a sequential, deliberate, but timely manner. The steps I have outlined to the House today are intended to ensure just that. I firmly believe that members on both sides of the House will agree with these steps. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>-The announcement by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> has been expected <inline font-style="italic">for some</inline> considerable time. The Opposition acknowledges the need for a replacement aircraft for the Mirage. I am not sure that we accept that the statement made by the Minister fulfils the strategic announcements already made by the Government and the defence role for our armed services set out in the White Paper. There is every appearance in this statement that we are in fact opting for a fashionable air-to-air fighter aircraft rather than a defence capacity aircraft to carry out the roles set out in the White Paper. This has happened before and it is likely to happen in the future. On Tuesday of this week, in answer to a question on notice from the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil),</inline> the Minister made this statement about the requirement of the tactical fighter force replacement: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The primary roles for the TFF encompass air-to-air and air-to-surface capacities. These capabilities include air defence, air superiority, interdiction including maritime strike, tactical reconnaissance and close support. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The statement indicates that these roles have been narrowed in the last few days to a primary air-to-air defence role. We are not satisfied that that fits the statements contained in the White Paper on Australian Defence. I will read the statement that I refer to which appears on page 1 3 of the White Papen </para>
          <para>Any confrontation or conflict would be, initially at least, maritime in character. </para>
          <para class="block">The basic need, as I understand it, of Australian defence strategy is self-dependence and a minimum of reliance on the interference or the availability of an ally to provide areas of defence which are not available to Australia. As I read the document, our defence capacity is supposed to be based on our ability to maintain and provide a major strike capacity in order to increase the cost and thus reduce the probability of any form of incursion against Australian territory. The air-to-air capacity which is referred to tends to presuppose that as a primary defence task we will be involved in air-to-air dog fight roles. I doubt very much whether that is the major and most significant strategic consideration in Australia&#39;s defence role. The Minister for Defence has said that this is potentially- I note the use of the word &#39;potentially &#39;-the most expensive defence procurement likely to be made in the near future. There is one on the &#39;horizon&#39;, if I may use the word, which could be potentially as expensive if the Government eventually decides to adopt that project. </para>
          <para>I wish to present some figures that I have been able to obtain. They are only estimates based on published figures. I will deal firstly with the purchase of a single squadron of FI 5 aircraft because it seems to me that this statement is drawn in relation to the purchase of that aircraft. I have the feeling that the change in the role of the aircraft which we are to procure too neatly fits the change in the decisions of the United States of America on the stages to which that aircraft is to be developed. A strike capacity is not to be provided in the United States version of the aircraft and the strike capacity seems to have been removed from the Australian requirements. Perhaps it is a coincidence but I think that it is too much of a coincidence. The purchase of 25 FI 5 aircraft would involve a program costing of the order of $750m. The purchase of F18A aircraft would cost approximately the same. One would doubt whether there would be any offset procurements available in respect of the F16 aircraft in view of the very wide-ranging offsets already entered into by the company concerned with the Australian Government. The cost for the purchase of those aircraft would amount to $400m to $500m. I turn to deal with the two European aircraft, the Mirage and the Tornado. It would appear that they, along with the FI 8 aircraft, would provide something of a balanced capacity in the aircraft types needed to enhance our defence capacity if our strategic assessment of protecting Australia from an incursion is, in fact, the primary role. The cost of those aircraft would run to about $800m to $900m. That is the position based on the Minister&#39;s statement in which he talks about one squadron of aircraft. I do not confess that the figures I have given represent the actual cost which has or has not been assessed. They are the figures which I can assess. </para>
          <para>If the Mirage aircraft is to be modified, its modification must be in an air-to-air strike capacity. On the information I am able to obtain, the aircraft is not suitable for strike operations. Its attitude and design make it a dangerous aircraft to fly and its airframe life would be jeopardised seriously if an attack type capacity were to be built into the aircraft. The Mirage can be modified to give it a reasonable air-to-air capacity in close combat. But the published reports on recent exercises suggests that while, in fact, the aircraft did well in close air combat with F14 aircraft, the umpires acknowledged that the F14 had wiped out the Mirage long before they had reached a close combat situation. Therefore, it is academic whether any such close combat would take place. </para>
          <para>This statement by the Minister indicates that the Government has opted for a piece of equipment about which I would express extreme doubts as to whether it fits an actual defence role of the significance which the cost of procurement indicates. We believe that the most pressing air need at the moment for the Australian defence forces, given the strategic announcements which have been made about the strategic role which we would expect our forces to undertake, would be an aircraft with a substantial air strike capacity against maritime targets. The Minister talks in his statement of support for a surface operations. But it is doubtful whether an enemy&#39;s attack capacity is likely to be of a fighter or strike aircraft type which would be likely to engage in air-to-air combat. I turn to deal with the vehicle by which weapons are transported to the point of delivery in any modern war. I would think that any nation seeking to enter into an engagement with Australia at least would have access to relatively modern weapons. Such vehicles are likely to be some distance apart and certainly not in a head-on or an individual force attack role. The F18A or the Tornado aircraft at least would provide some degree of capacity for a strike role. But the whole of this statement by the Minister indicates that a decision has been taken that we should have an aircraft which will fill an up-front dog fight glamour role. I hope that is not true. But it is a very major item of equipment. I believe that such an item of equipment must be chosen on the basis of how it fits in with all the defence forces and with what the Government and professional defence advisers see as the means by which the defence of Australia will be carried out. Obviously, we cannot have all of the equipment. </para>
          <para>Recently I read an article by one commentator in which he said that cost should not be taken into consideration. I understand the Minister&#39;s difficulties. We cannot have all the equipment or the types of equipment which we desire. But it is essential that the equipment we have serves the purpose for which we see our defence forces being used to the best possible advantage. I do not see an air-to-air role fighter as one of the major necessities of such a role. I certainly see an aircraft with a strong modern strike capacity being essential. Obviously, the Mirage cannot be modernised for that purpose. The Fill aircraft can be equipped with strike weapons which will give some potential in that area. But 24 aircraft do not represent a major strike capacity and certainly do not represent a major deterrent. The Mirage aircraft has the problem of a range which is not sufficient on Australia&#39;s north and northwest coast to enable it to be fully and effectively operational. It can use only two air bases in that area. I would hope - </para>

              <para>-They are Learmonth and Darwin. I would hope that the Government will consider these aircraft and the statement that the Minister has made. It is a long-term investment which ought to have the support of both sides of the House and which ought to be fully explained and examined. The Government, prior to making an announcement on its decision, should be absolutely certain that we are not buying an aircraft because it fits neatly into what the Services see as desirable but rather that it fits absolutely into what is seen to be essential. That is a difference in the role and the purchase of the equipment which I wish to emphasise. What is essential to national defence in accordance with the best strategic advice that is available to us from all advisers and sources of information? I think 1 can say correctly that no person in this House has the capacity to assess the technical role or ability of an aircraft. We must all depend on the advice that is available. </para>

          <para>I must say one other thing about this statement. The statement mentions five aircraft, two of which are of European origin and two of which, I think, are in the very preliminary stages of design. Recently the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> is reported to have made a statement- the Minister for Defence may deny it or otherwise- that he does not care what aircraft we buy as long as it is American. The statement is on record. I would hope that that policy is not to be a criterion in the purchase of the aircraft. This is a major purchase from an overseas country and it should be negotiated on the basis that is a major purchase. </para>

			<para>In an attempt to increase his influence in Washington the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> has said that he wants an American plane chosen as the replacement for the RAAF&#39;s French designed Mirage lighters. </para>
			<para>According to defence sources in Canberra, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has told the top brass that he does not mind what son of replacement is chosen so long as it is American. </para>
			<para>The PM &#39;s predilections come at a time when Defence Department studies were indicating that European alternatives could be more cost effective than the American planes in Australia &#39;s situation. </para>
			<para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline>apparently, sees his insistence on an American plane as helping to give him extra leverage in his bid to get the US to boost its military strength against the Soviet Union. </para>
			<para>The most likely outcome of his entry into the fighter selection process is that the RAAF will end up with the McDonald Douglas F15, costing more than $20 million a copy- </para>
			<para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline>gesture toward the US on the fighter question comes at a time when some senior defence officials are refusing to endorse his hard-line, anti-Soviet stand. </para>
			<para>In fact, some officials are being remarkedly unrepentent of the views expressed in the official strategic assessment completed late last year and since publicly rejected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> as inadequate. </para>
			<para>A senior defence official, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paul</inline> Dibb, has just gone on public record with an analysis that is distinctly similar in spirit, and sometimes even in direct wording, to the assessment that has been rejected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser.</inline></para>
			<para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dibb</inline>is head of the national assessments staff, which works on medium andlong term studies for the National Intelligence Committee. </para>
			<para>The NIC has a major input into the official strategic assessment documents prepared for Australian Governments. </para>
			<para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dibb</inline>has taken the unusual step of going on public record in a lenghty article in the August edition of the Sydney University publication Current Affairs Bulletin with an article on the balance of power in nonh-east Asia. </para>
			<para>He is a good deal less alarmist in his conclusions than either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> or the Defence Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen.</inline></para>
			<para>Discussing the four powers involved, the US, Japan, China and the USSR, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dibb</inline> says, &#39;No one power is likely to attain strategic supremacy or a predominant position such that the other major powers would succumb to its will or influence&#39;. </para>
			<para>He goes on to say that &#39; there seems to have been more conscious efforts recently to maintain the balance than to upset it, because it is in each of the major power&#39;s interests to see an enduring balance that does not concede pre-eminence to any of its competition&#39;. </para>
			<para>Earlier, in the context of Japan&#39;s relativelylow defence spending, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dibb</inline> cautioned that &#39;to reduce the power of a State to purely military terms is to ignore some important economic and political lessons of the 1 970s &#39;. </para>
			<para>He adds (without commenting that it is very much in line with both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> &#39;s method of analysis) that &#39;some recent press reports have compared Soviet naval forces in the Pacific with the US Seventh Fleet, and have claimed that the Soviet Pacific Fleet has some 755 ships with a total of 1,200,000 tonnes, compared with the Seventh Fleet&#39;s 60 ships of 700,000 tonnes. </para>
			<para>Such a comparison is not very accurate because, in time of crisis, the US Third Fleet, which is also Pacific based, would undoubtedly become involved&#39;. </para>
			<para>Also, he said, &#39;A comparison of tonnage is not a comparison of capability&#39;. </para>
			<para>According to the head of the NAS the Soviet Pacific Fleet consists of almost 400 surface combatants and about 10S submarines. </para>
			<para>But he says that only about 60 of the surface combatants are of destroyer/escort size or larger; the remainder are patrol craft, mine warfare vessels and amphibious units, which are usually deployed in the coastal defence role and for the defence of Soviet merchant shipping in territorial waters. </para>
			<para>In contrast, he says, the combined US Seventh and Third Fleets at full strength have about 80 major surface combatants, plus up to nine aircraft-carriers, and possibly 35 submarines. </para>

          <para>-I have referred to the report, and I think it is right that I should present it to the House. If it is not accurate the Prime Minister has the means by which he can refute it. Based on that report, I must make two comments. The first is that the current decision is not in fact based on a revamping of the original specifications so that they meet the requirements of the aircraft which, I think, the original specifications were designed to meet, rather than our strategic needs. The second is that in the purchase of the aircraft the role of the aircraft must be paramount. The Opposition does not believe that airtoair capacity is the primary need of our defence forces at this stage. The primary need is for an aircraft which can provide strike capacity and some level of air superiority. The likelihood of dogfights over the Australian mainland or airtoair fights being the primary means of any defence operation I believe to be lower in priority than the need to provide a defence capacity which will deter any potential enemy from seeking to make inroads on the Australian mainland. </para>

              <para>-The report which I have just presented relates to the complaint raised in the House on 28 February 1978 by the honourable member for Holt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Yates)</inline> and referred to the Committee by the House on that date. The complaint related to an editorial published in the Melbourne newspaper the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Observer</inline> of 26 February 1978 under the heading of &#39;Political bludgers&#39;. The Committee took evidence from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr P.</inline> S. Isaacson, Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief, Peter Isaacson Publications Pty Ltd, owners and publishers of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Observer,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> L. Armsden, who at the time of publication of the editorial, was editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Observer.</inline></para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The allegations contained in the editorial were examined by the Committee. It was satisfied that they were without foundation. In addition, the Committee considered that the editorial cast reflections upon members in such a way as to bring the House into contempt. The Committee found that publication of the editorial, in having reflected upon members of the House of Representatives in their capacity as such, constituted a contempt of the House of Representatives. It further found <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Isaacson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Armsden</inline> guilty of contempt of the House of Representatives. The Committee recommended in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Isaacson</inline> that, in view of his expressions of regret made before the Committee and his publication of an adequate and acceptable apology, no further action be taken. In the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Armsden,</inline> the Committee recommended that in this instance his demeanour and actions were not worthy of occupying the further time of the House. </para>
          <para>The report of the Committee contains another recommendation of particular significance. The Committee strongly recommended that the whole question of parliamentary privilege should be referred to it for investigation and report to the House. Such reference should be couched in the broadest possible terms, covering such matters as the means by which complaints of breach of privilege are referred to the Committee, the method of investigation of the complaint by the Committee and the penalties which should be available to the House in respect of privilege offenders. </para>
          <para>The Committee believes that such a general review of parliamentary privilege is overdue. In 1966 the United Kingdom House of Commons appointed a Select Committee to review the law of parliamentary privilege as it affected that House and the procedure by which cases of privilege are raised and dealt with by that House and to report whether any changes in the law of privilege and practice of that House were desirable. That Committee presented a comprehensive report to the House of Commons in December 1967. A review of the 1967 recommendations was carried out by the House of Commons Committee of Privileges last year, and the Commons debated the matters and passed certain resolutions in respect of parliamentary privilege as recently as 6 February this year- just eight weeks ago. The Committee of Privileges believes that a similar review of the law of privilege as it affects this House is most desirable and will attract general support. It believes that it is the responsibility of the Parliament itself to undertake such an investigation and commends its recommendation to the House for its early consideration. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-style="italic">Mi</inline>HAYDEN (Oxley-Leader of the Opposition) (2.15)- The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> is an agreeable man- so agreeable, in fact, that he is able to agree at the same time to two conflicting policies on Aboriginal welfare. On the one hand, publicly, he pretends to support Aboriginal welfare programs which are of the same nature as those which the Aboriginal movement presents and on the other, privately, he enters into sleazy, secret deals with the Queensland Government, allowing the Government of that State to maintain raciallybased policies on Aboriginal welfare. Unfortunately it is policies of the latter kind that stick. There is no doubt that the problems that have been confronting the nation in recent times, arising from the Queensland Government&#39;s thoroughly inexcusable and quite unacceptable behaviour towards the missions at Aurukun and Mornington Island, impose themselves on the Minister and his Government because of his fickle and inconstant role as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The secret deals into which he entered and the ground he constantly gave away under pressure from the Queensland Government incited the Queensland Government to act outrageously. </para>
          <para>A wide range of legislative power is available to the Australian Government. It could have been applied with considerable effect in Queensland to establish and preserve the basic rights of Aboriginal people in that State. In no single instance was that wide range of authority adopted. I refer, for instance, to the Aboriginal Land Fund Act, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act, the Racial Discrimination Act, the Aboriginal Lands and Associations Act. Not only did the Government not apply these authorities available to it but also the evidence is that the Minister positively prohibited their use. For instance, the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations has reported scathingly about the racist attitudes permeating the Queensland Government&#39;s Aboriginal welfare policy. It said in an official report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An authority on the Queensland legislation has pointed out &#39;that the administration of reserves has created not independence but a repressive and demoralised dependence&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It went on to point out that the whole administration of Aboriginal welfare in Queensland by that State Government is infected with these racist overtones. In spite of that, not only was the authority under the Racial Discrimination Act not adopted but also the evidence is that the Minister prevented it from being adopted in defence of Aboriginal rights. The authority under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act not only was not adopted but also was prevented from being adopted by the tactics accepted by the Australian Government under pressure from the Queensland Government. For instance, under State legislation it is permissible for the Director of Aboriginal Affairs to take away the savings and property of Aboriginals in Queensland, to cut wages, to control their movements, to deny them the sanctity of their home, and to separate spouses from their families which are left on reserves. These thoroughly unacceptable and outmoded racist principles have been enshrined in the legislation and policies on Aboriginal welfare of the Queensland Government. It is alien to the international conventions that we have adopted. But not once has the Minister taken firm action on these matters. I repeat that the evidence is to the contrary, that is, that the Minister has positively prevented the authority being used. </para>
          <para>I have a copy of a letter which he signed and sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Rowley,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, dated 3 February of this year in which he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Your letter of 7 December 1977 was also the first advice to me that the Commission had taken relevant legal advice in respect of the Racial Discrimination Act. Not having been consulted on a matter of such evident policy significance, I am not prepared to give any assurance that funds would be available. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">By itself that might not have seemed so significant, although it is certainly worrying; but in association with other matters for which the Minister has been responsible, clearly what he was seeking to do was to impose a fiscal discrimination, a fiscal prohibition, on the Land Fund Commission which was very rightly seeking to exercise the authority available to it to protect the rights of Aboriginals in Queensland. That was misleading behaviour on the part of the Minister. He sought to mislead Aboriginals. He sought to mislead the Australian population. He sought to mislead this Parliament by pretending that he was a man of genuine compassion in these matters. </para>
          <para>Another matter concerns the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act of 1976. It was assented to in December 1976. It was an important piece of legislation. It gave Aboriginals the right to incorporate. That meant very simply that for the first time, if the law was effective and they could take it up, they could incorporate and establish land right claims- possess land through the proper processes of acquiring it. But the legislation was never proclaimed. It is not even proclaimed now, although yesterday belatedly, in the face of the miasma that he has made for himself through the craven way in which he has conceded so much to Queensland, he indicated some amendments to the Act. Some 15 or 16 months after his own legislation had been assented to, it has not been proclaimed. The more important thing is that it has not been proclaimed because the Queensland Government objected to its being proclaimed. The Queensland Government resented the principles involved in it coming into practice. On 10 December 1976 it wrote a letter protesting against this matter. Yet the Minister, in September 1977, had the gall to say in replying to a question from the honourable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> that he hoped to proclaim the Act very shortly. He knew then that he had no intention of proclaiming it. Queensland had made sure that the law was a dead letter from the Start. So again he was misleading the </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament and he was misleading the people, including the Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>On the matter of land, which is directly related to that subject I have discussed, he again failed dismally. In 1 977, in the face of resistance from the Queensland Government when the Land Fund Commission sought to acquire land at Archer River near Aurukun- more importantly, near Comalco Ltd- it was indicated that he was considering what the next step ought to be. It was indicated that he considered the matter of great importance. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> said in the Parliament: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Minister for Lands refused to approve the transfer and that is where the matter stands at the moment except that the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs are considering what the next step ought to be. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs knew that there would be no more steps because on 19 January 1977, in a letter to the Prime Minister, the Premier gave the game away. We happen to have a copy of that letter. He indicated that there had been an arrangement- a secret, shoddy deal- between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Queensland Government to ensure that the expectations of the Aboriginal people in this matter would not be met. Furthermore, the evidence of the letter makes it clear that despite the undertaking that the Prime Minister gave that there was concern- by implication, that the Government was still committed to achieving land rights for Aboriginals in this area- when he said to the Parliament that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was still considering what steps to take on the matter, he had no intention of considering the matter further. A letter of 19 January from the Premier&#39;s office in Brisbane to the Prime Minister says in one part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I note the assurances given in your letter of 9 December that your Government will not meet any request from the proposed Council for assistance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This refers to the land at Archer River which I mentioned before. In another part of the letter he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>My immediate concern is that the recent land purchases by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission are in direct conflict with State policies. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We well know what those policies are. The people who moved to old Mapoon mission area were quickly forced out by what can be described as nothing short of coercion on the part of the Queensland Government. They are the policies- policies of assimilation, policies of restriction and policies designed to prevent the Aboriginal people from establishing a clearer sense of cultural identity and the achievement of land rights, freedom and independence; those things which importantly go with acquisition of land and land rights, but more importantly for Aboriginals. The most disturbing part of the letter is that the Premier goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Of course the Commission is quite competent to purchase and to hold the lands involved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In spite of the Commission&#39;s competency and in spite of the concession by the Queensland Government that it was compatible for the Land Fund Commission to buy this land, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was prepared to enter into this shoddy deal which grossly misled the Parliament and the nation. In February 1977, scarcely 2 months later he was giving encouragement and hope in the Parliament to Aboriginal people and to the community who share concern for Aboriginals. The Minister may well be a charming person but on the evidence here he is nothing more than a smiling double-dealer as far as his ministerial responsibility is concerned. He expressed concern about racism and yet he erected fiscal barriers to ensure that the Land Fund Commission would not be able to protect the rights of Aboriginals in Queensland against the incursion of the racist policies of that State Government. He introduced the Aboriginal (Councils and Associations) Act to allow Aboriginals to incorporate their presence so that they could acquire land. The legislation was passed but some 15 or 16 months later he has still not arranged for the legislation to be proclaimed. Indeed, a letter from the Queensland Government of 10 December was obviously the influential force that persuaded the Government not to proceed with this matter. </para>
          <para>On the matter of land acquisition in the Archer River area- a matter of considerable importance to the Land Fund Commission, to the Aboriginal people and to the Minister- he encouraged people as recently as 7 December 1976 to believe that the Government would do something about the matter, when in fact, the evidence is that on 9 December 1976 a letter went from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to the Premier of Queensland giving an undertaking that nothing would be done. A letter dated 9 December 1976 would have been prepared well before that date and would have been the product of consultation between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Prime Minister; that is, before 7 December when the undertaking was given in the Parliament by the Minister. Again he misled the Australian people and the Parliament on several scores. </para>
          <para>I come now to the Land Fund Commission which is in the process of getting its comeuppance because of its efforts to protect Aboriginal people. The penalty it is going to pay arises because it is not prepared to stick to the elaborate fiction that the Minister likes to broadcast that we have a government concerned about Aboriginal rights and welfare. In a letter sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No directive, instruction or advice has been issued to the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission restricting its acquisition program in Queensland. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What the Minister made clear in a letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Rowley</inline> on 3 February is:   . . firstly, that the Commission inform the Minister before entering into any land negotiations in Queensland; secondly, that the Commission provide to the Minister details of any Aboriginal corporation involved in any land projects; and, thirdly, that the Commission not complete any proposed land purchase without first consulting the Minister? </para>
          <para class="block">On the face of it, perhaps these are reasonable requirements in terms of fiscal responsibility but in association with the evidence I have produced of the way in which secret and sleazy deals have been entered into between the Minister and the Queensland Government, fiscal responsibility and fiscal controls had nothing to do with it. What the Minister was seeking to do was to geld the operations of the Land Fund Commission. These are all serious matters. What the Minister sought to do was to hobble the Commission. A letter dated 14 July 1977 is further evidence of this. The Minister wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tomkins,</inline> the then Minister for Lands in Queensland and said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I can assure you that the Land Fund Commission will not be proceeding with negotiations for purchase of Glenore Station. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That communication was conveyed to the Prime Minister by the Queensland Premier. The real reason for this is that the Queensland Government asserts that it is opposed to Aboriginal land rights because it believes that it leads to a dispersion of Aboriginal residents in mission areas and, presumably, it is not able to impose as much control as it would wish over Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>Finally, I refer to a minute of a meeting in the Minister&#39;s office on 14 March this year. It is clear from this that, contrary to what the Minister has been saying, he directed that a Cabinet submission be prepared proposing the incorporation of the Land Fund Commission into an Aboriginal entitlement capital account. It is clear that the direction came from him and not departmental officers. The evidence is that the departmental officers were not happy with the idea. Furthermore, all members who have had experience as Ministers will know that when Cabinet submissions are prepared, any changes that follow are of minor detail. The outline is given to the officials by the Government. Again, the Minister has misled the Parliament and he cannot be trusted. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to hear one of my colleagues say that the speech of the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> was a pathetic performance. Let the judgment be made by others and not by me of the effort of the Leader of the Opposition here today. I say at once that the honourable gentleman does not understand the nature of the legislation establishing the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. He does not understand the way in which the Queensland Laws Racial Discrimination Act, which was passed by his own Government, operates. He really does not understand, let alone refer to correctly, the contents of various documents from which he quoted. </para>

          <para>The Land Fund Commission has its origin in recommendations made by the Woodward Commission. It is a complementary vehicle for giving effect to a land rights policy. The land rights legislation which this Government has passed, following the essential principles of the Woodward report, operates in traditional areas in the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward recognised that there needed to be some other vehicle for providing to those Aboriginals who had been dispossessed an opportunity to obtain land. Therefore the Land Fund Commission can operate, for example, to return to dispossessed traditional groups- that is, groups who still follow traditional customs- land which had been taken from them for the creation of pastoral properties. This has been done for both economic and social purposes in many parts of Australia where a pastoral property has been purchased. The economic purpose is to give the Aboriginals a means of making a livelihood and the social purpose is to return them to their traditional country. The Land Fund Commission also operates in favour of those Aboriginals who have been dispossessed but, today, do not have any traditional links. I think more particularly of those living in rural areas or in cities and towns. </para>
          <para>This Government has provided the Land Fund Commission with funds to operate in all States and, as I indicated recently in answer to a question, provision has already been made in the 1 978-79 Estimates for a continuation of that activity in all States of Australia. The letter quoted by the honourable gentleman which I wrote very recently to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is explicit and accurate to describe the present position. There is no restriction upon the activities of the Land Fund Commission in Queensland. Only one or two weeks ago I was talking to Professor Rowley and he told me that there are a number of properties in Queensland which the Land Fund Commission plans to buy. Some of the properties are freehold and some are not. He will be writing to me about them. I will not name them for fear that some action may be taken to deny the Land Fund Commission the opportunity of acquiring them. </para>

              <para>- The letter from which the honourable gentleman quoted was written barely 10 days ago. I issued general instructions as authorised under the legislation- which I might point out was passed by the honourable gentleman&#39;s Government when in office- and I gave the reason for that in an answer the other day. Let me make it quite plain. There is no restriction on the activities of the Land Fund Commission in Queensland. </para>

          <para>I shall deal very quickly with the two propertiesArcher River and Glenore. I regret to inform the honourable gentleman that the sources of his information have not been able to obtain from the files of the Department all the information that is contained in them.  His  sources of information did not know, and therefore did not tell him, that I went to Queensland on behalf of the Land Fund Commission and on behalf of the Government in order to endeavour to persuade the Queensland Minister for Lands to approve the transfer of Archer River. That is not the act of a Minister as described by the honourable gentleman. I also sought from the Queensland Minister for Lands an understanding of the purposes of the Land Fund Commission. I sought to persuade him that there is nothing sinister in it and that the Queensland Government ought to treat it as a purchaser of property in the same way as it treats anyone else who buys property in Queensland. The fundamental misapprehension of the Queensland Government with regard to the Land Fund Commission is that it believes, contrary to all the evidence, that property purchased by the Commission will become Commonwealth land and therefore will be taken away from the State. Of course that is simply not correct; the Land Fund Commission buys property in the same way as everyone else taking exactly the same title, whether it be leasehold or freehold, as anyone else. I do not know if I have disabused the Queensland Government of that misapprehension but I hope I have. </para>
          <para>That Government gave me further information about Archer River which, as I recall, I transmitted to the Land Fund Commission. The purchase of that property was not proceeded with; not because I did not want to see it proceed but because obstacles were put in the path of the Commission, and for other Queensland Government reasons to which I referred the other day. </para>
          <para>The matter concerning Glenore station has somewhat of a departmental history going back many years. I sought information concerning its background. It was looked upon as an alternative property which Normanton Aboriginals could have made available to them because their own traditional country is tried up. I discussed Glenore station with the Queensland Government. It seemed that on the basis upon which the Queensland Government would have expected the covenants attached to the pastoral lease to be complied with, it simply was not a proposition that could go forward; not because of any desire on my part to deny the Commission the opportunity but because all the evidence showed that it could not proceed. I know that the Land Fund Commission considered its legal position then because some statements were made which indicated that the reason why consent would not be given to that transfer was because it was going to an Aboriginal community. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman may or may not be aware that under the Queensland legislation the Minister for Lands has absolute discretion. The honourable gentleman&#39;s studies in law may not have gone far enough for him to know that there is a very limited area indeed in which the courts will interfere in the exercise of an absolute discretion. I notice that the honourable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> is sitting behind the honourable gentleman at the table. He will be aware of the legal implications of what I say. When representatives of the Land Fund Commission went to the auction to buy Glenore station in November they did so without first having advised me that they would bid at auctionin fact the letter from the  Chairman  was dated 8 December, two days before the election. After the election I returned to find that this property had been purchased at auction but of course it had to run the gamut of the absolute discretion of the State Minister for Lands to consent to the purchase. In what sort of position was I, in order to do anything? Further, the Commission said that it desired legal action to be taken under the Racial Discrimination Act, if that was possible. The answer quoted by the honourable member for Oxley is an answer to that particular aspect of the matter. </para>
          <para>In summary, with regard to the Land Fund Commission, there are no proposals before the Government for the abolition of the operations of the Land Fund Commission for the policy purposes about which I have spoken. Discussions have taken place with my Department, as evidenced by the minute which has fallen into the hands of the honourable gentleman- from whatever source at the moment I do not know. I would have thought that it would have been in the interests of Aboriginal people throughout Australia to look at the possible conjunction of the activities of the Land Fund Commission and the Aboriginal entitlement capital account referred to in the policy statement of the present Government of November 1975 and also to look at that account and its particular nature related to the question of dispossession and dispersal of Aboriginals which, as I pointed out, is the very fundamental purpose for the creation of the Commission along with other activities in this area of the Department and other instrumentalities of the Government, namely the Loans Commission and the grants-in-aid for enterprise purposes provided by the Government. I do not detract for one minute from the kind of ideas that I have put forward for consideration by the Government and the kind of review that is being undertaken in my Department at present because I am quite sure that from that review, and having regard to some of the considerations which I have mentioned, there will be a much better vehicle in the end for giving effect to those fundamental purposes of the Government of which I have spoken. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman referred to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975. I regret to say that on the part of the Opposition there is a complete misconception about the operation of that legislation. It seeks to strike down the very abuses of human rights, of which the honourable gentleman spoke- the discriminatory actions and legislation of the Queensland Governmentbut it does it in such a way that it creates a right in the hands of any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in Queensland to protect himself against discrimination by reason of the provisions of this legislation. So the Commonwealth Government is not required to enforce it in the sense of launching a prosecution, obtaining a conviction and having a penalty imposed because there are no such enforcement provisions in this legislation. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman sought to say that there is evidence that I have prevented action being taken under this legislation. Let me inform him that the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service of Queensland at this very moment is considering bringing action on behalf of certain individuals to recover wages that should have been paid by virtue of that legislation. I had discussions with representatives of the Legal Aid Service only a couple of weeks ago in which I was informed of that intention to embark on litigation. Of course the Legal Aid Service is funded by the Commonwealth. Let me also inform the honourable gentleman for his benefit that a number of prosecutions have been launched in Queensland against individual Aboriginals. The Aboriginal Legal Aid Service on the basis of this legislation has put in a defence and the prosecutions have been promptly withdrawn. That is the way in which this legislation has worked and is working at present. To use the Opposition&#39;s terminology, as inaccurate as it is, it is being enforced in Queensland. That is a protective measure and I applaud the former Government for introducing it and striking down the kind of discriminatory laws which existed then and which still exist in Queensland. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman said that there was some evidence to the effect that I had prevented action being taken under the Racial Discrimination Act arising out of the report of the Commissioner for Community Relations on Queensland. I just do not know what he is talking about because no such action has been taken on my part. The honourable gentleman ought to know what is provided for in the Racial Discrimination Act by way of inquiry and report of the Commissioner for Community Relations. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman mentioned the Aboriginals Councils and Associations Act. I ran into trouble with that legislation. A number of States did not agree with it. Perhaps the honourable member would like to judge why a number of the States did not agree with it. Queensland was one. Western Australia was one. South Australia was one. Victoria expressed some misgivings about it. At two meetings of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council, one in 1976 and one in 1977, 1 had some pretty vigorous discussions with State Ministers. The transcripts are there if honourable members opposite wish to see the way in which I defended this legislation. I was, however, prepared to accommodate the States in two of the issues. One of these the States regarded as being very <inline font-style="italic">important and it</inline> was referred to in the second reading speech which I made when I introduced a Bill yesterday. So quite clearly the case of the honourable gentleman has no substance whatsoever. </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has claimed that I said that the Government had before it proposals to terminate the Land Fund Commission. He uses this quibble against the newspapers which have taken this matter up just as much as we have in this House. It might be a lawyer&#39;s tactic, but it is misleading. What I have said is that the minute shows that the Minister instructed that a Cabinet submission should be prepared by his Department which effectively would destroy the Land Fund Commission and put the whole administration of these matters under his direct political control. </para>

My point of order is that the distribution commissioners in Queensland are the responsibility of this Parliament and the reports of those commissioners are the responsibility of this Parliament. It is unacceptable, so far as we are concerned, for the Minister for Finance now to tell us that we should do away with our rights in this Parliament because he intends to talk to the Press. We demand that a statement be made in the Parliament. </para>

              <para>- It is the view of the Opposition that the Minister should respond in the Parliament. He should not send a letter, as it were, to members of the Parliament by way of the media indicating what his defence may or may not be. The allegations which were made today are the most serious that one could imagine. They go to the very heart of the parliamentary system. They go to the very heart of the integrity and the standing of the Government, that is, they go a very long way, if indeed the journey is not endless. These matters should be canvassed fully in this Parliament. It is thoroughly unacceptable to us for the Minister to seek the opportunity briefly to declare that if we wish to go to the Press Gallery we may be fortunate enough to pick up a copy of his Press statement which gives some sort of explanation of the most challenging sort of allegation which can be made against any member of the Parliament. </para>

          <para>Effectively, what has been levelled against the Minister is the allegation that he has been party to a conspiracy to rig electoral boundaries. It is alleged, therefore, that he has been party to a conspiracy to try to determine the course of the democratic procedures in this Parliament. There can be no credibility left in a government that is not prepared to debate the matter. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> said that at least the Minister for Finance was prepared to go public on the matter. He is not prepared to go public on the matter. Releasing a Press statement does not put him to any public test at all. If he declared that he would hold a Press conference his persuasiveness would be greater, but not sufficient or great enough to be acceptable to this Parliament. The allegations that have been made against him, I repeat, are of the most serious kind. They have to be cleared up. They sully the reputation of the Government. They suggest very clearly that not only is the Minister involved but that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> also has been party to a conspiratorial effort designed to suppress public disclosure and discussion on this matter. </para>

              <para>- I am seeking the suspension of Standing Orders so that this matter can be cleared up. If the Minister says that he is prepared to go public, to make a Press statement, he ought to be prepared to go all the way. He ought to be prepared to discharge properly his responsibilities to this Parliament and to give it a statement of what he intends to do. It is not acceptable to us that tomorrow morning we read the morning newspapers to find his version of the statement. In fact, I suggest that the matter cannot even stop there. The Government has something to hide and the Prime Minister is implicated in this matter. Once again the Prime Minister - </para>

              <para>- Not only that, but the honourable member for Fadden is entitled, as a matter of fair play, to respond to any statement that the Minister might make. He, too, has some rights in this matter. It is not a matter of innuendo. It is not a case of a tissue of inferences. It is a matter of a very forthright series of serious allegations being made in this Parliament that go right to the heart of the credibility and integrity not only of the <inline font-style="italic">Government and the</inline> Minister but of the Prime Minister also. The allegations should be answered in this Parliament or the Minister concerned and the Prime Minister will leave this Parliament tonight with a very serious doubt over their heads. That is thoroughly unacceptable and should not be tolerated. </para>

            <para>- I can assure the Manager of Opposition Business that we are quite prepared for the procedures to flow. One of the difficulties in this matter is that whilst the allegations made in this chamber this morning by the honourable member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> are obviously very serious, they are not new. They are matters that were raised immediately after the election and were under examination by the </para>

        </interjection>
        <para>Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> As a result the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> and the Solicitor-General presented a report to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I have that report, and I propose to table it. </para>
        <para>However, I would point out that unfortunately the Attorney-General today is at a meeting with State Attorneys in Melbourne. The SolicitorGeneral is overseas. Neither of them has therefore had any opportunity, either to examine and consider the assertions made by the honourable member for Fadden today to see whether or not they correlate entirely with the matters which are covered by the report or, to determine whether or not they are prepared to release this document. The document covers almost entirely the assertions made today by the honourable member for Fadden and certainly relates in its entirety to the matters which were canvassed by the honourable member for Fadden when he first raised these matters with the Minister for Administrative Services. </para>
        <para>In those circumstances I table the document which is a report from the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General and suggest that if members of the Opposition examine that document in full they will find that it answers the assertions made against my colleague the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson).</inline> I believe there is no case to answer. If the Opposition wishes to raise the matter in the House it has recourse to the procedures of the House which I know you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> administer with true impartiality. </para>

The other proviso the Leader of the House suggested to me was that the Government would make time available for a specific discussion on this matter on Monday. </para>

              <para>- The matter, although it was a matter of public importance and therefore not debated to the point of a division, has been debated by the chamber. I suggest that the matter is now being substantially repeated by the honourable gentleman. In that case I suggest that it is not appropriate that he now canvass it, although he can do so by way of the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>

              <para>- I wish to speak to the point of order. It became necessary to move that motion because of the challenging statements that were made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He pointed out in the course of his response to my claims that the documents from which I quoted, which are copies of official documents, represented only some of the relevant documents, and thereby sought to argue that the case I sought to present fell well short of that which would have been presented if I had had access to all of the documentation. I am quite happy to have access to all of the documentation. I am even more happy to provide the opportunity for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to establish his case properly by presenting all those documents. On the basis of the relevant documents I have available and from which I quoted today and which he prevented me from having introduced into the record of the House, it is quite clear that the Minister has been misleading the Aboriginal people, the Australian community and this Parliament, and that he did that again today. </para>

              <para>-Order! The honourable gentleman will speak to the point of order. In fact, I have heard enough from the honourable gentleman to rule on the point of order. This issue is not the same as the issue that was before the House earlier to day. Before the House earlier today was the discussion of a matter of public importance. This motion is different because it calls for the suspension of Standing Orders and the production of documents. Therefore I will admit the motion as being in order. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill to amend the income tax law will introduce measures to counter tax avoidance and give effect to a number of Government policy initiatives that have already been announced. </para>
          <para class="block">These policy initiatives include the new concession to allow shareholders a rebate of tax for share capital subscribed to companies engaged in off-shore petroleum exploration and development activities. The 1977-78 Budget decision to liberalise the income tax deductions for gifts of works of art and comparable property to public libraries, galleries and museums will also be given effect by the Bill. The measures against tax avoidance are wide-ranging and are an important step in our program to strike down tax avoidance arrangements. </para>
          <para>As a Government, we simply cannot accept a situation where the actions of a few can jeopardise the wellbeing of us all. Not only do these practices make the Government&#39;s basic task of economic management more difficult, but also they can seriously jeopardise our program of tax reform designed to reduce the overall burden of taxation. Furthermore, it is particularly unfair when, in many cases, the persons involved in these schemes are the ones best able financially to accept their tax liabilities. It would be idle to imagine that tax avoidance in all its forms will ever cease. There is a flourishing tax avoidance industry in all corners of the world and plenty of talent available to devise schemes of avoidance. It has long been recognised that it is reasonable for taxpayers to so organise their affairs as to minimise liability for taxation. However, the Government believes that some techniques of tax avoidance are so blatant, contrived and artificial as to go beyond the bounds of reasonableness. </para>
          <para>There may be no absolute community standards by which particular forms of tax avoidance may be judged. I would not pretend to be able to offer a complete definition. I do, however, assert that some of the schemes which have been practised, and are the subject of this Bill, are clearly at odds with the general welfare of the community. It does no credit to those concerned to be involved in a scheme where of $10,000 claimed as a deductible gift, just $120 is enjoyed by the charity concerned, with the promoter of the scheme benefiting to the extent of almost $ 1 ,400. Nor, I think, would it be regarded generally as reasonable tax planning for a group of people to contrive, through trading in and dividend stripping of shares, to transform what is undoubtedly a profit of $5,000 into a deductible loss, for tax purposes, of $970,000. Taxpayers and their advisers do have a responsibility as to the lengths they go in exercising legal means of minimising tax payments. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para>
          <para>Against this general background, I turn now to the anti-avoidance amendments that are a feature of this Bill. The matters covered under this head are schemes involving the creation of tax losses through the issue and subsequent sale of bonus shares, abuse of the gift provisions, creation of artificial share trading losses, dividend stripping, artificial acquisition of &#39;primary producer&#39; status for averaging purposes and steps to avoid tax on undistributed income and tax on dividends. </para>
          <para class="block">Bonus shares </para>
          <para>The amendment relating to bonus shares has been made necessary by the legal interpretation applied in the well-known Curran case. The essential elements of the Curran schemes are that taxpayers who seek to be treated as share traders can artificially create a tax deductible loss which can then be offset against their normal taxable income. For example, a person may pay $ 1 90,000 for shares with a face value <inline font-style="italic">of$ i</inline> 0,000 and, after accumulated profits attaching to those shares have been capitalised by the issue of bonus shares to a face value of $190,000, the total parcel of shares is sold for $ 1 95,000. Under a Curran scheme the person claims to have incurred a loss of $185,000 whilst, in commercial terms, a profit of $5,000 has in fact been made. These schemes can be used to create whatever loss is required by a taxpayer to eliminate tax liability completely. </para>
          <para>The Bill does not disturb the rules that an individual shareholder who is issued with nonredeemable bonus shares paid up out of capital profits is not taxed in respect of the receipt of those bonus shares, or that a resident company is not taxed in respect of any bonus share issued to it. The amendment proposed in the Bill will mean that, in calculating the taxable profit or loss on disposal of shares by a share trader, the only cost attributed to a bonus share, where the shareholder is not taxable in respect of its receipt, will be the part of the cost of the original shares that is fairly attributable to the bonus shares. </para>
          <para>I draw particular attention to one aspect of the amendment in relation to bonus shares, namely, that the amendment will apply to bonus shares allotted after the Budget date of 1 6 August 1 977. The Government has decided to adopt this application date because of the extreme gravity of the situation involving bonus share schemes. Precise quantification cannot be made, but all the indications available to the Government are that hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue would be lost if the amendment were confined to bonus shares allotted after today. Not only would many high income earners be freed from tax in 1977-78, but also a number would not pay tax for years into the future because of large carryforward losses they have sought to create by schemes of this kind. </para>
          <para>In deciding that this amendment should apply after 16 August 1977 the Government recognises that retrospectivity is involved. On this occasion we make no apology for acting retrospectively to protect the public revenue. Generally, the Government has supported the view that the rights of taxpayers under existing legislation should not be altered retrospectively. However, the Government believes that whilst it is generally the case that the public interest can best be served by not applying tax legislation retrospectively, on this occasion the public interest requires a departure from this general practice. The Government&#39;s decision reflects its view that the abuse represented by the Curran type schemes is so blatant and of such a magnitude that it constitutes a serious detriment to the general body of taxpayers. </para>
          <para>The Government also had in mind that it was doubtful whether any person entering into a Curran scheme in recent months could genuinely have believed that there was no risk that his or her enjoyment of the benefits of the scheme would remain totally immune from retrospective legislation. This is especially so in light of the clear warning against tax avoidance given in last year&#39;s Budget Speech. In fact, some promoters of these schemes have offered &#39;money-back guarantees&#39; in the event of the schemes being retrospectively struck down. It is important to emphasise that the amendment will not be retrospective to earlier financial years. The effect is that losses generated by allotments of shares under Curran schemes from and after 17 August 1 977 will be denied deductibility against income earned during this and subsequent financial years. </para>
          <para class="block">Gifts </para>
          <para>The abuses of the gift provisions against which this part of the Bill is directed all have the common feature that the donor seeking a deduction for a gift to one of the funds or institutions referred to in the gift provisions of the law does not, when the reality of the situation is laid bare, really make a gift of anything like the amount or value for which a deduction is claimed. Correspondingly, the charity does not enjoy anything like the full amount or value of the ostensible gift. Under one gift scheme the donor seeks a deduction for a $ 10,000 gift that is made to an institution, $ 1 ,500 of the amount coming out of his or her own funds and the balance of $8,500 being lent by the promoters of the scheme. The institution, pursuant to an overall arrangement, pays the promoters a procuration fee of 98.8 per cent of the gift, leaving it with $120 out of the $10,000. The procuration fee puts the promoters in funds not only for their $8,500 loan to the donor, but provides them with a substantial fee. In practical terms, the donor does not have to repay the $8,500 loan. </para>
          <para>In further schemes of the same kind the gift to the charity is a note or debenture which, despite the claim for a deduction of its face value, is rendered almost worthless by subsequent, prearranged, changes in its terms and conditions. The charity receives cash from the sale of the note or debenture at its reduced value, and the diminution in value accrues to the donor or his associates. Plainly, the Commissioner of Taxation is resisting claims through these shoddy schemes for deduction, made under the law as it stands. However, as the courts may find that the nominal rather than the real gift is deductible, the Government proposes to put the matter beyond doubt in relation to gifts made after today. I stress that the amendments will deny any deduction for a future gift only when made in tax avoidance circumstances of the broad kind to which I have just referred. Genuine gifts made in ordinary circumstances to the funds and institutions concerned will not be affected. </para>
          <para>A closely related exploitation of the gift provisions is also being dealt with in the Bill. This concerns practices whereby a donor gives a work of art, or money to buy a work of art, on the condition or understanding that the donor or a relative or other associate may have possession of the work. Generally, there will be no deduction for gifts of this kind made after today. However, if the gift is one that qualifies under the liberalised provisions to which I will refer later, a reduced deduction will be allowable. In such cases the deduction will reflect the full value of the work as discounted for the benefit that flow a from retaining possession and enjoyment of it. The Bill further provides that, where there is an arrangement that the donee will use a gift to acquire property from the donor or an associate, there will be no deduction. </para>
          <para class="block">Share Trading Losses </para>
          <para>The Bill has the broad objective of preventing deduction of &#39;manufactured&#39; or artificial losses from trading in shares, by enabling the taxable profit or loss to be calculated on the basis of the commercial realities of the transaction concerned. Honourable members will recall that amendments were made last year to counter avoidance schemes in which elections were lodged under section 36a of the Income Tax Assessment Act so as to create artificial share trading losses. The measures now brought before the Parliament supplement the earlier amendments. </para>
          <para>Schemes of this kind are very involved. They require a number of intricate and contrived steps. Under one scheme, a partnership of taxpayers buys shares to which there are attached very substantial undistributed profits in liquid form, usually cash in the bank. The partnership is a share trading one, which means that its taxable profits or losses from share trading are allocated to the partners and are reflected in their individual assessments. Although the shares that the partnership buys would be very valuable to it if they were purchased in a straight- forward manner, the partnership in fact pays only a nominal amount, as it is part of the pre-arranged plan that the company concerned will issue specialclass shares to an associate of the promoter from which the partnership bought the shares and will pay its previously undistributed profits as a dividend to that associate. For example, a partnership buys shares for $25,000 that are worth $ lm and the dividend that is paid on the special-class shares is $970,000. The partnership then sells the stripped shares for $30,000, making a commercial profit of $5,000. It claims, however, a loss of $970,000 on the basis that a provision of the law deems the partnership to have acquired the shares for their then basic value of $ 1 m. </para>
          <para>Another variant of the scheme relies on the general deduction provisions of the law. A share trading partnership buys shares for $ 1 m which it later sells for only $30,000, because the worth of the shares has been stripped away by payment of a dividend of $970,000 to another company. The dividend cannot effectively be taxed in the hands of the recipient company because that company is a straw company and has no realisable assets after the scheme is carried out. The partners claim for tax purposes to deduct the $970,000 loss but, and here is the point, they do not in reality have to bear the loss or any part of it. This is because the partnership has been lent money to acquire the shares under an arrangement whereby the loan is in fact not repaid. In the jargon of the trade, the loan is collapsible. Schemes of this kind have not been tested before the courts. I expect that this will happen in due course because the Commissioner of Taxation will be vigorously resisting them. However, the Government proposes to put the matter beyond doubt for relevant acquisitions of shares taking place after today. </para>
          <para class="block">Dividend Stripping </para>
          <para>In this avoidance scheme a company buys shares in a company with accumulated profits; strips these profits by way of dividend and subsequently sells the stripped shares, thus recouping itself for the initial share purchase. In 1972 the law was amended to prevent a company from both deducting the apparent loss on sale of the shares and being allowed an intercorporate dividend rebate on the full amount of the dividend paid. Those amendments limited the rebate to the net amount of the dividend after offsetting the cost of the shares and any other deductions associated with the dividend. </para>
          <para>Dividend strippers have found a way around the 1972 amendments. While one company receives the stripping dividend, it is an associated company or trust that incurs the apparent loss. In these circumstances there is no basis in the present law for offsetting the cost of the shares against the rebatable dividends To overturn this variation of the scheme it is necessary to provide that, where a company receives a dividend in the course of a stripping scheme, and it is a part of the scheme that an associate takes the apparent loss on the sale of the shares, the company that receives the dividend is not to be allowed any rebate in respect of the dividend. This amendment will apply to dividends declared after today. </para>
          <para class="block">Re-imbursement Dividends </para>
          <para>A private company is liable to tax on its undistributed profits if it does not pay sufficient dividends to its shareholders. In respect of business profits, a private company is allowed to retain 60 per cent of its profits after company tax, and is required to pay the balance as dividends to its shareholders if it is not to pay the undistributed profits tax. Under one current scheme of avoidance, the payment of dividends to shareholders is illusory. The company does pay or credit dividends to a shareholder but is not put out of funds by doing so. One reimbursement technique is for the shareholders concerned to put broadly equivalent funds into the company, for example, by subscribing for redeemable preference shares that, after payment of a one-and-for-all dividend, carry virtually no rights. The shareholder receiving the dividend is not taxed on it because the special class shares are sold at a loss which is offset against the dividend. </para>
          <para>Under another technique, dividends are credited to a shareholder but the amount is not actually paid to the shareholder but is used to pay up an almost worthless share or debenture. The shareholder in this scheme is an institution whose income is exempt from tax and a small fee is paid for its services. Dividends declared after today under schemes of this kind will not be taken into account for purposes of tax on undistributed income. </para>
          <para class="block">Abuse of Averaging Provisions </para>
          <para>A decision of the High Court given at the end of last year has made it necessary to amend the law so that the averaging system applicable to primary producers is not available to people who have no real stake in a primary production business and have become a beneficiary in a primary production trust simply to gain the benefits of tax averaging. The averaging system is applicable to taxpayers who directly or as a beneficiary of a trust carry on a primary production business. The court case arose out of an avoidance scheme by which thousands of beneficiaries were each given a $1 share of income from a primary production trust. The Court held, in a test case, that one of these beneficiaries thereby qualified for tax averaging for his entire income. </para>
          <para>Plainly, that is not a situation in which averaging should apply. Our proposed amendment is confined in scope to the special provision applicable to beneficiaries in primary production trusts. If the beneficiary&#39;s share of income of a year is $1,040 or more, the law will apply as it does now. If, however, the beneficiary&#39;s share falls short of this figure, averaging will not apply unless the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied that the beneficiary&#39;s interest was not acquired primarily for the purpose of attracting the averaging provisions. Beneficiaries in primary production trusts of the traditional kind will not be affected by the amendment. Where it is applicable in relation to avoidance schemes of the kind I have outlined, the amendment will apply in the determination of averaging entitlements in 1978-79 and, for people who enter into such schemes after today, in the current financial year. </para>
          <para>

            <para>- The provision in question was enacted some years ago to cater for circumstances not commonly encountered. At the time, leaseholders were entitled to deductions for capital expenditure on leasehold improvements. It was therefore appropriate that where a taxpayer was granted a right by a government authority to construct and maintain an undertaking of public utility, and to earn revenue from it, the taxpayer could deduct over the life of the franchise the capital costs incurred in the project. However, the law was amended in 1964 to withdraw the deduction available to lessees for the cost of leasehold improvements. It is now anomalous that taxpayers who can arrange to be franchise holders can deduct costs not deductible to taxpayers who build on leasehold or freehold land. The deduction for franchise holders is being withdrawn in relation to capital expenditure on franchises granted after today. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Shareholder Rebates </para>
          <para>On 24 August last year the Deputy Prime Minister announced in this House a number of decisions made by the Government after considering ways of assisting the development of gas fields on the North West Shelf. The decisions included the provision of three very important taxation concessions. Two of these, the general extension by two years of the 20 per cent phase of the investment allowance and the inclusion in allowable capital expenditure of the cost of natural gas liquefaction plant, have already been carried into legislation. </para>
          <para>The third concession is the shareholder rebate scheme. By this Bill, shareholders who, after 24 </para>
          <para class="block">August 1977, subscribe share capital to a company holding a registered interest in an offshore licence or permit, will be eligible for a tax rebate. The rebate is available only when the company lodges a declaration with the Commissioner of Taxation that the moneys are earmarked for expenditure on exploration or development of an off-shore petroleum field. A corollary of this will be that the company will forgo its own right to deductions for the expenditure under the petroleum mining provisions of the income tax law. The scheme therefore permits the transfer of tax allowances for eligible expenditure from a petroleum mining company to its shareholders. </para>
          <para>The Bill puts into effect the policy decision outlined in the earlier statement by the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony).</inline> The new scheme draws very much on the earlier concession under section 77d of the Income Tax Assessment Act under which shareholders were allowed deductions for capital subscribed to mining companies. However, experience with that concession led to the Government&#39;s decision to provide strengthened safeguards against exploitation of the new concession when no real contribution to exploration or development is made. </para>
          <para class="block">Liberalisation of Gift Provisions </para>
          <para>It was announced in the last Budget Speech that there would be a liberalisation of the gift provisions of the income tax law as they apply to gifts of works of art and comparable property to public libraries, art galleries and museums. The Bill implements that undertaking effective from 1 January 1978, and for a trial period of three years. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> I am delighted that the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> shows such a conspicuous interest in tax avoidance matters. At present, the deduction for gifts of property to specified funds and institutions is limited to property purchased by the donor within the preceding 12 months, and to the lesser of its current value and its cost to the donor. The Government considers that there should be some changes in these rules to encourage people owning significant works of art or other items of cultural property to donate them for public display. </para>
          <para>Details of the Government&#39;s policy are contained in a statement by the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> on 30 December 1977. The essence of the trial scheme, however, is that a taxpayer will be eligible for a deduction for property that has been held for any length of time and, in general, the deduction will be an amount equal to the market value of the property. Claims for deductions will need to be supported by valuations from approved valuers and a committee established with the co-operation of the New South Wales and Victorian governments will approve valuers for this purpose. </para>
          <para>The Bill also introduces a deduction for gifts to the Australiana Fund. This Fund is set up to facilitate the making of gifts of cash and works of art, including furnishings, for the fitting out of Government House, Admiralty House, The Lodge and Kirribilli House. Gifts to this Fund will be allowed on the same extended basis as proposed for gifts to public libraries, art galleries and museums. I mention here that the Bill brings up to date the gift provisions as they apply to gifts to the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory national trusts. The Northern Territory body has been re-constituted and the Australian Capital Territory body has been made a separate entity, instead of being a branch of the New South Wales trust. The amendment means that gifts to the national trust of each State and internal Territory will be tax deductible. </para>
          <para class="block">Isolated Children&#39;s Allowance </para>
          <para class="block">Another change to be made by the Bill will benefit taxpayers who have dependent children for whom payments are made under the isolated children&#39;s education assistance scheme. In 1973 these payments were made exempt from tax in the hands of the recipients. However, they continued to constitute separate net income of the children for purposes of calculating entitlement to the zone allowance and other rebates. That can have the effect of reducing the rebates available to the parents of the children and the Bill provides that the allowances are not to be taken into account as from 1 July 1977. </para>
          <para class="block">Vocational Training Scheme </para>
          <para class="block">Payments under the former regular servicemen&#39;s vocational training scheme are also dealt with by the Bill. These payments are akin to payments under the National Employment and Training scheme which were made subject to income tax in 1975. Payments under the vocational training scheme are correspondingly being made taxable with effect from the scheme&#39;s commencement on 1 February 1978. </para>
          <para class="block">Current Year Losses </para>
          <para class="block">There is yet another area of avoidance that it has not been practicable to make the subject of proposals in this Bill but which is of such importance that the Government has decided to announce amendments effective as from today. The term current year losses is a convenient shorthand description of it. Honourable members will know that the law contains a number of highly complicated provisions developed over the years to counter equally complicated arrangements for trafficking in tax deductible losses incurred by companies in prior years. In essence, a company may not deduct against income of a year a business loss incurred in a prior year unless throughout both years either the same persons beneficially owned more than 50 per cent of shareholders&#39; dividend, voting and capital rights, or the company carried on the same business after a disqualifying change in shareholdings as it carried on before the change. The essence of current schemes is that losses incurred by a company while under the ownership of one set of shareholders are sought to be offset against profits earned in the same year under another set of owners. </para>
          <para>The arrangements have two basic forms. In one type, a company that has in the early part of an income tax year traded unprofitably is sold to a new group of shareholders who in the second part of the year inject into the company income that is offset by the losses of the early part of the year. The other form is the reverse of this. A company that has traded profitably in the early part of a year is sold to another group which creates artificial losses. These losses are set against the income earned by the company in the early part of the year under the original proprietorship. Honourable members may have noticed heavy advertising in the Press of schemes of this kind. The principles governing deduction of prior-year losses being a settled part of the law, the Government sees no reason why the same principles should not be applied to govern the deduction of current year losses. We propose that the law be amended accordingly. </para>
          <para>The new provisions will work along the following lines: The existing provisions of the law for determining whether there has been a sufficient continuity of ownership will be applied. If there is a disqualifying change in ownership, the new provisions will not apply if the company satisfies the &#39;same business&#39; test that now applies in respect of prior year losses. Where, however, the company fails both tests, its taxable income of the year will be calculated by treating the two parts of the income year as if they were separate years. Where these separate calculations show a taxable income in one part of the year and a net loss in the other, the amount of the loss will not be offset against the profit. The proposed legislation will apply the same principles where there is more than one disqualifying change in the course of the year. The proposed current year losses amendments will be applicable to all situations where a disqualifying change in ownership occurs after today. </para>
          <para class="block">Technical Amendments </para>
          <para>The Bill also contains some other more technical amendments of a significant kind, notably those dealing with the transfer of mining capital expenditure deductions from companies to their shareholders, aspects of the anti-dividend stripping provisions and the averaging system for primary producers as it applies in the context of the new standard rate personal tax system. All the provisions of the Bill are explained in the usual explanatory memorandum that is being circulated to honourable members. Due to the complex technical nature of the legislation the Government does not intend to resume the debate on the Bill for at least a few weeks to allow adequate opportunity for comment on the technical aspects of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Service housing in the Moorebank, Holsworthy and Anzac Village areas has been provided by the New South Wales Housing Commission under Commonwealth/State Housing Agreements and directly by Commonwealth purchase or construction. </para>
            <para>Prior to 1 966 it was not the practice of Housing Commissions to build houses for servicemen to the Services&#39; Scales and Standards of Married Quarters. </para>
            <para>However in 1966 the Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement was amended to permit State Housing Commissions to build houses to those Scales and Standards. </para>
            <para>In 1 972 the Government agreed to an upgrading program for houses throughout Australia built prior to 1966 under CSHA arrangements to bring those dwellings as far as practicable up to current Scales and Standards. </para>
            <para>That program has been largely completed. </para>
            <para>In respect of the Moorebank, Holsworthy and Anzac Village areas the total Army housing stock is 2040 dwellings of which 1430 were obtained under CSHA arrangements and 6 10 by direct Commonwealth provision. </para>
            <para>The 1430 dwellings provided under CSHA arrangements include 810 constructed before 1966 which require substantial upgrading and 120 which require marginal upgrading. The balance are generally in accordance with Scales and Standards. </para>
            <para>All the pre- 1966 houses except for 310 have been upgraded or are in the process of upgrading. Improvements to the 3 10 are under consideration. The deficiencies by comparison with Scales and Standards include such items as carports, lock-up sheds, paths and drive strips, clothes hoists, hot water systems and insect screening. </para>
            <para>The post- 1966 dwellings require less modernisation and a program of improvements is being considered. </para>
            <para>In relation to Commonwealth owned married quarters, 260 of these are of the pre-fabricated type erected mainly about 1956. Although their condition varies from dwelling to dwelling it is doubtful whether it is economic to spend any significant sum on their modernisation. The alternatives of rehabitation or disposal are under consideration. </para>
            <para>As to the balance (350) of the Commonwealth owned dwellings, they are generally of a better standard than the other dwellings but nonetheless some of these require improvement to bring them up to standards and a program to do this is being considered. </para>

        <para>There are two cases in Victoria where patients lodged applications for replacements to their &#39;Canadian hip&#39; prostheses nearly 9 months ago. In both cases immediate replacement was not considered necessary by the Rehabilitation and Artificial Limb and Appliance Centre technical staff as satisfactory repairs could be made. Neither patient has been immobilised and production schedules indicate that the manufacture of one patient&#39;s prosthesis will commence shortly. The Department has been unsuccessful in its attempts to contact the second patient. </para>

            <para>) As many amputees are aged or ageing and suffer from other ailments, there are some whose fittings are delayed beyond the figures quoted in reply to part ( 1 ) because of factors outside the control of the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Service, such as: amputee&#39;s general health, the condition of the amputee &#39;s stump, the unavailability of the patient, a difficult fitting, availability of experienced staff in complex fittings. </para>

        <para>In those instances where an amputee requires a replacement limb, repairs are often effected to the existing limb to keep the amputee mobile, should a waiting time be involved. </para>
        <para>Action has been taken to reduce the longer waiting times in Victoria by the creation of a number of new positions and the temporary transfer of artisans from other Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres which are in a more satisfactory work-load situation. The position will improve as new staff become fully trained. </para>
