          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Menzies was born 83 years ago in the small Victorian town of Jeparit. By his own ability, his own determination, his own courage and his own will he became one of the greatest Australians this nation has brought forth.  His  towering influence helped to mould this nation. He stood uncompromisingly for the abiding traditions and values of Australia.  His  temporary defeat in 1941 served only to lift him and to reveal his extraordinary resources of energy, the strength of his beliefs and the fortitude of his spirit. He led Australia through the boom years of the 1950s and into a period of unprecedented national development in the economy, industry, agriculture, the arts and learning. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline>rise to eminence was meteoric. In 1917 he graduated in law from the University of Melbourne with great distinction and one year later- at 23 years of age- he was admitted to the Bar. Within a remarkably brief period at the Victorian Bar in which his practice ranged over industrial, common and constitutional law Menzies built a formidable name as a brilliant legal intellect and an outstanding advocate.  His  greatest triumph as a young barrister was his remarkable appearance in 1920- at 25 years of age-in the celebrated Engineers Case. After that historic case, in which he successfully stood alone against several notable King&#39;s Counsel, he appeared in many famous constitutional cases before the High Court and the Privy Council. This outstanding constitutional lawyer had few rivals and in 1929- at 34 years of age- he became Australia &#39;s youngest King &#39;s Counsel. </para>
          <para>In all <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> days his love for the law never waned. But it was no narrow interest. For him law and civilisation were inseparably bound together. Opportunities to speak and write on law and public affairs were always welcome to him. At the age of 72, when most professional scholars have put down their pens, he made a distinguished contribution as scholarinresidence at the University of Virginia, where he lectured on the Australian Constitution with all the authority, clarity and wit we knew so well. It is scarcely surprising that a man of such formidable talent for the law and such high regard for its sanctity should be chosen to serve as Attorney-General in both the State and Federal spheres or that he should have distinguished those ministries with his commanding legal experience. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>turned to politics in 1928. He first entered the Victorian Parliament, where he served nearly six years. Characteristically, he quickly made his mark as parliamentarian and Minister, holding several portfolios, and within four years, at the age of 37, he became  Deputy  Premier. In 1934 he contested and won the seat of Kooyong and held it for the next 32 years.  His  unfailing interest in his constituents and his commitment to them earned him their loyalty, their trust and their admiration. Immediately upon his election to Federal Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was appointed Attorney-General and Minister for Industry, portfolios he held until 1939. In that year -just five years after his election the the House of Representatives- he became Prime Minister.  His  first Prime Ministership was from 1939 to 1941, and in that time he administered the portfolios of Treasury, Defence Co-ordination, Trade and Customs, and Information. These were years of extraordinary activity in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> had achieved what for many men would have been the work and ambition of many lifetimes. But his finest years were yet to come. </para>
          <para>History has recorded that the United Australian Party splintered, turned from its leader and fell apart. Inevitably there was a change of government. The trials of these years may have left most men embittered and unnerved. They served only to spur Menzies to embark on a program of reshaping, rebuilding, remodelling and reassessing the needs of those Australians who had pinned their faith to a Liberal alternative. He struggled with adversity and won. From the ashes of the United Australia </para>
          <para class="block">Party and through the vision and undaunted determination of one man- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menziesthere arose the Liberal Party of Australia. This was a party which he designed to serve all Australiato govern for all Australians- owing no special allegiance to any group or section. </para>
          <para>He travelled Australia&#39;s length and breadth persuading and inspiring. In 1949 he triumphed. The Liberal and Country parties won office and remained undefeated for 23 years. That period is now a matter of history. Above all, it is the history of Menzies. </para>
          <para>Menzies&#39; return to the Prime Ministership in 1949 came at a time of great domestic and international uncertainty. Depression and war had had a devastating effect. The world was tired of conflict, fearful for the future. But for Menzies these were to be the years when all that he had passed through was simply preparation for his finest hours. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>great task was to restore the confidence and stability of a nation recovering from the rigours and the distress of war, and this he did. Drawing on his considerable will, knowledge and experience, he guided Australia for 16 years with the steadfast hand of a leader sure of his ground and sure in the judgment of the Australian people.  His  years of strong and stable government gave strength and confidence to this nation, to the Australian people, and set this country firmly on a course of recovery and uprecedented development. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>was recognised by all as one of the Queen&#39;s men. He saw clearly the place of the Crown in the Australian body politic, and stood by the principles of constitutional monarchy which are the fundamental base of our political life. Many people will recall  Her  Majesty&#39;s first visit to this country in 1954 and how she was escorted with dignity and with a profound sense of the occasion by her Australian Prime Minister to the opening of this Parliament. We are all honoured by the gracious tribute  Her  Majesty has now paid to her former Prime Minister. It will be a source of comfort to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> family. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline>rich sense of the nation&#39;s history, his vision of its vast potential, his evident love for its soil and its people, his presence and his eloquence ensured that Australia&#39;s place in international affairs would become more firmly established, more widely known. He was one of the Commonwealth&#39;s most eloquent spokesmen, and in time became one of her best loved statesmen. He attended the Prime Ministers&#39; Conferences in London, striving through difficult and changing times to consolidate Commonwealth ties and to strengthen Australia&#39;s relationship with Britain.  His  admiration and respect for the country that had fathered the traditions of the rule of law, the country of Blackstone, of Milton, of Shakespeare and of Burns, earned him a special place in the hearts of the British people. Undoubtedly, the stature of Australia&#39;s Prime Minister during these years greatly added to the international prestige and influence of this nation. </para>
          <para>His attachment to the Commonwealth did not blind him to the changing reality of new international horizons. As one of the founders of ANZUS and the South East Asia Treaty Organisation, he was fully aware of the need to consolidate Australia&#39;s natural bonds with its neighbours. He was equally aware that we should retain our relationship with the more powerful and more distant nations of the world. He conducted his relationship with both the new and old friends with ease and assurance. His loyalty and reliability was never in question and he brought his great authority to every council. He earned the respect of all. </para>
          <para>Upon his retirement, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was invited to name two achievements for which he would most like to be remembered. He nominated his Government&#39;s encouragement of tertiary education, something in which he had had a close personal interest, and the development of the national capital. Learning was for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies the cardinal privilege and his consuming passion because he believed that where there was learning there could be wisdom. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> established the Australian Universities Commission and encouraged the growth of the Australian National University. He was convinced that all Australians should have opportunities to share in a full educational experience and his Government presided over a vast expansion in tertiary education in this country. Again, it was characteristic of his pride in the nation that he should wish to enhance its capital. The Canberra of today, the city of lakes and fine public buildings, is a great and enduring monument to his vision. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>such were the achievements and stature of the man that it was to be expected that some would say he was a distant political figure, but he won the respect not only of his political supporters but also of those who never voted for his Party. To his friends he was a warm and delightful companion. To those who served him he was always courteous and considerate, and to his family he was a constant symbol of devotion and love. He endeared himself to Australians from all walks of life by his love of cricket and, in Victoria by his support of the Carlton Football Club. </para>
          <para>Australians will have many memories of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies: Memories of him as a Prime Minister who led this country for 16 consecutive years; memories of him as a Prime Minister who strove to enrich the resources, the opportunities and the talent of this nation; memories of him as a Prime Minister who cemented and extended our relations with Britain and the Commonwealth; memories of him as a Prime Minister who continued to nurture our relations with other allies such as the United States of America; memories of him as a Prime Minister who saw the need for and fostered the highest standard of professionalism and intergrity in the Public Service; memories of his consumate skills as an orator, his mastery as a political tactician, his unerring sense of political timing and his integrity. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>anyone who had the pleasure to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> speak will remember his devastating wit. He had the rare ability to make a jibe at his own expense. He once recalled that on the previous Sunday he had read the lesson at the Presbyterian Kirk, a reading which had included the Ten Commandments. &#39;To a practising politician&#39;, he said, &#39;I know of no document more disturbing- unless it be the Sermon on the Mount&#39;. But, above all, his. parliamentary colleagues will remember him for his abiding belief in our great democratic principles, in the central role of Parliament and in the rule of law. He was a champion of the concept of responsible government in the Westminster tradition. Over many years he strove to develop our Cabinet system into that which we know today. </para>
          <para>In the past few days I have received numerous messages of condolence and sympathy from leaders around the world.  President  Carter has referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> as &#39;a great statesman whose leadership and influence extended far beyond Australia&#39;. Prime Minister Callaghan has written of  &#39;His  courage, his devotion to duty and his wisdom (which) have ensured him an honoured place in the history of our time &#39;. There is one message which I should like to read in full, for it captures in essence the feelings expressed by many during the last week. It is from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lee</inline> Kwan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, and reads: </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>in 1937 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was created a Privy Councillor. In 1951 he was created a Companion of Honour. In 1 963 the Queen created <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> a Knight of the most ancient and most noble Order of the Thistle. In 1965 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1966 after his retirement from politics, he was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, following in the path of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Winston</inline> Churchill. In 1976 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was created a Knight of the Order of Australia- the first Australian to receive that accolade. </para>
          <para>The honours showered on him over many years are a fitting tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> stature as an Australian and Commonwealth statesman. As generations pass it is easy to forget those who have gone before. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies has left an indelible mark upon countless facets of Australian life. He will be remembered as a leader, a statesman, a scholar, an ally, a friend, and to his family as a loving and devoted husband, brother and father. He gave to each of these roles the full measure of his being. To this one man- Robert Gordon Menzies- Australia owes an immense debt. It is a debt which future generations of Australians can honour by holding fast to the virtues he brought from his forebears and carried into his life- the virtues of sincerity, integrity, loyalty, steadfastness and courage. And we can honour him by following his example of unstinting service to this nation, serving all the people and working to reinforce those fundamental values which unite us as one nation, as one people. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> would wish to be honoured by no more than this. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> we are in the midst of mourning Robert Gordon Menzies, but we should also console ourselves that here was a great man who left a great name for himself and for this country. What more can we possibly ask of any citizen than this? </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gordon Menzies became in his lifetime what few people ever achieve. From a modest family background he became an outstanding student and an eminent practitioner at the Bar. He achieved early entry to the Victorian Parliament, and became a remarkably young  Deputy  Premier of the State of Victoria at 34 years of age. He proceeded to the national Parliament, immediately entering the Ministry, and became Prime Minister at the still young age of 45 years. From 1949 to 1966 he served a record unbroken term as Prime Minister. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Regardless of the differences which one might have had with his political views and policies, one has to concede- I do so in generous measure- that in those 17 years of service as Prime Minister of Australia he proved himself to be a masterful political tactician and a shrewd and effective parliamentarian. The course in the national Parliament from his entry in 1934 up to 1949 was not without its hurdles for him, nor would anyone suggest he found it, nor even caused it to be, uneventful. The period from 1941 to 1949 must have been a somewhat fretful one for him in many ways. It was, however, in this period that he so successfully refashioned the disintegrating conservative political forces in this country into a cohesive and lasting political party- the Liberal Party. It was a remarkable achievement and now, some 30 years after its formation, that Party continues to function with the longest continuity of public service of any conservative national political party in the nation&#39;s history. Another of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies&#39; important political successes was to draw the Country Party into a lasting national coalition with his Liberal Party. </para>
          <para>These were no small achievements, especially for a man whose sharpness of intellect gave him, according to record, an impatience with so much of the time consuming, mundane, but important basic organising and arranging which is part of the political scene. The period 194 1 to 1 949 gave him, it would seem, time to reflect on his earlier political setbacks and to regenerate his political thinking and tactics. When I entered this Parliament after the 1961 election the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies was then close to the end of a long and significant career. He had just survived a remarkably close election. I remember the period well. It was not only the time of my first election to this House but also the occasion of the rather novel experience of discovering, on the good advice of the then right honourable member for Kooyong, that the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> was &#39;magnificent&#39;. </para>
          <para>I leave the history of the late former right honourable member for Kooyong &#39;s service in public office, spanning nearly half a century, to those better qualified than I am to write, more fittingly, as a suitable epitaph to a long and notable career. I restrict myself to those last five years during which he served in this Parliament while I was here. One&#39;s recollection is of a big, robust man who obviously revelled in the action of the parliamentary scene. This was the period of serious economic rethinking after the 1961-62 recession when the Vernon Committee of Inquiry was set up to recommend on the development of future economic policy. Re-equipment of the Air Force with a new tactical bomber was entered into as a matter of great urgency. The controversial commitment to the Vietnam war was made. Some initiatives were also undertaken in the field of education. </para>
          <para>Right to the very end of his parliamentary career the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies was in the thick of public debate over measures he proposed or had undertaken. He was never faint hearted; nor did he hesitate to put his case firmly on the issues he took up. Perhaps the most enduring recollection I have of him, apart from his readiness to enter into the rough and tumble of parliamentary exchange with a quick and entertaining verve- I seem to recall being bruised a few times in such unwise encounters in my earliest years- was his clear, consistent and impressive devotion to the parliamentary institution. In this, I believe, he displayed a respect for the parliamentary system since lost but which could well be rescued with advantage to its reputation and influence in the community. </para>
          <para>Let me quote the comment of one observer of the late and former right honourable member for Kooyong: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Menzies was one of the most effective politicians in Australia &#39;s history. He had a way of identifying the attitudes of the average Australian and appealing very vividly, clearly, and incisively to those attitudes, showing a skill and understanding that I didn&#39;t suspect he had. </para>
            <para>He didn&#39;t appear to have the common touch. I thought he was consciously or naturally aristocratic and it surprised me to find out he had an ability to know what the average man felt. I don&#39;t know how he did this, but I would say he had a good deal of natural flair for it. </para>

          <para class="block">The quotation is important because it comes from a man whose political values were as different from those of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies as is the quality of chalk from that of cheese.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline>funeral last Friday was a remarkable occasion for this nation. We saw people from throughout Australia and from around the world pay a triumphant tribute to this great man. Thousands of people lined the streets. Many of them expressed their sorrow. The remarkable thing about that occasion was that it was some 12 years after he departed from political life. As we all know, most politicians are forgotten the day after they retire. Not <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. He had welded for himself a lasting place in the history of this nation. It is a matter of history that the close relationship which everybody knows existed between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> and my party in the 1950s and the 1960s had been, in earlier years, not always a happy one. There is no doubting that the relationship between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> and the Country Party during the years of the coalition in the 1950s and 1960s was a matter of great significance to him and, I believe, to Australia. I think it is worth recalling some of the things he said to the nation on the day he retired from office, on 20 January 1966. He referred to the immense loyalty he had enjoyed from both partiesthe Liberal Party of Australia and the Country Party- and went on to say: </para>

          <para class="block">There are people who tried to deny the magnitude of the contribution that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies made to Australia while he was Prime Minister. They bring forward the fatuous argument that there is nothing of real significance for which he can be remembered. That is obviously untrue. Australia&#39;s progress in fields such as education, national development and trade during the Menzies-Fadden and the Menzies-McEwen period makes that quite clear. If these critics are saying that Australia under Menzies lacked drama, lacked division and lacked instability, if they are saying that Australia under Menzies enjoyed solid economic and social progress, enjoyed political stability unmatched in any other country, enjoyed full employment and enjoyed inflation rates which, if we had them today, would make us the envy of the world, these critics are unconsciously pointing to the things for which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> deserves to be remembered. </para>
          <para>No other Australian has occupied the place that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies held. Whether people were for him or against him they regarded him in a way in which no other Australian has ever been regarded. I think the only way to describe his unique place in Australian life and history is to say that he was an institution. The meaning of the word institution in this context is very simple but I think it is appropriate. It means a familiar object. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was a familiar object. To many Australians he was the government. He was the rock on which our stability and our security were built. To the world, Menzies was Australia. To those who knew him personally there are many memories one could reiterate today. I go back to when I was a young school boy, having to view some movies of his travels overseas. I recall them as not being very exciting. I remember him most as  Chairman  of Cabinet. Many stories are written about him being a very frightening man; certainly he was a taskmaster. Whenever he placed responsibility on Ministers he expected them to perform. He was very humiliating to a Minister who had not done his homework and tried to bluff his way through. He inculcated into members of his Ministry the need for integrity and honesty which I believe will last for a long time in the Australian political scene. </para>
          <para>I remember clearly his great interest in the development of the national capital while I was Minister for the Interior. Modern Canberra is greatly indebted to him. Canberra was stagnant for years and years until <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies decided that this was the national capital and needed to be reflected as such to Australia and the world. He took upon himself the responsibility of a revived Canberra by developing the lakes and bridges, building the National Library and making it the great capital which it is today and of which we are all proud. I shall always think of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies as being a Queen&#39;s man.  His  allegiance to the Queen and his readiness at all times to defend the monarchy was something for which he deserves great credit. He was not defending the monarchy because of any personalities, but as a lawyer and as a person who understood the Constitution of Australia. He knew that, inherent in our democratic system, in our parliamentary way of life and in our common law, it was necessary to recognise the monarch if we were to preserve that system. When I visited him on one occasion during his retirement I quite clearly recall him telling me about the various other types of parliamentary systems around the world and finishing his remarks by saying: &#39;Give me another one that is better than ours. If it is not, why should we want to change our situation?&#39; </para>
          <para>No tribute, no testimonial, to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> would be complete without reference to Dame Pattie. Like so many of us in Parliament who rely heavily upon our wives, so did <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. Dame Pattie was the perfect example of what  a  parliamentarian&#39;s wife should be. She gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies strength, encouragement and support in the heavy duties and onerous responsibilities he had as leader of the nation. To her I pay a great tribute. On this sad occasion I express sympathy on behalf of all the members of my party and myself. I should like Dame Pattie to convey those sympathies to the members of her family. </para>

            <para>-I think it is fair to say that I knew the late right honourable member for Kooyong for longer than any other person in this House. I certainly knew him as far back as 1934 when he was a practising lawyer. I remember him from before I became a member of the firm Allen Allen and Hemsley. </para>

          <para class="block">They acted for the Legislative Council, the Upper House, in New South Wales to prevent its dissolution. And that the Governor of New South Wales had the power to dismiss <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> T. Lang, the Premier. We acted for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Trethowan</inline> and others of the Upper House who were the petitioners. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> gave advice to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Dudley</inline> de Chair which was contrary to the case we supported. For once we won. The Upper House survived. </para>
          <para>I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> in other capacities. The firm handled one of the most important patent suits of all time. So much royalty was involved for our clients that we took the case from various State courts to the Federal court and then to the Privy Council. During that case I was informed that R. G. Menzies was slowly but surely convincing the Lords Justices of Appeal, the Privy Council, that there was no invention which could be patented. Sure enough, regrettably, he turned out to be right. I did not like him for a long period but had to swallow my pride subsequently. I believed at that time-I believed so more strongly later on when I was associated with him as a minister- that he was, with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon, one of the two greatest jurists ever produced in Australia. He was a delight to listen to in the courts. He was always persuasive and he always had charm. It was to be said of him that he usually won. Those were my first experiences with him. </para>
          <para>I then had a passing acquaintance with him when the Liberal Party was being formed. The United Australia Party organisation in New South Wales had disintegrated. Two Liberal Parties were formed and later merged. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> then took control and amalgamated them and other like-minded parties in other States spread throughout Australia into one organisation. </para>
          <para>I come now to the Parliament itself. Naturally I knew of his contribution in the banking case, one of the great cases in Australian history. In the House <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> paved the way for the defeat of the Chifley proposals for bank nationalisation. The final decision again came from the Privy Council. I remember when the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was being debated in the House. I was sitting where the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> is sitting now waiting to answer the Labor Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Harrison came in and said: &#39;Can I have a look at your notes, son?&#39;. He then painstakingly tore up all the notes and said: This will be your moment of trial; and one of decision. You are rotten when you read but not too bad when you speak without notes&#39;. After that speech I was invited by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> to join the </para>
          <para class="block">Cabinet. I had to wait for some weeks, during which time I was informed on a couple of occasions that somebody else might be appointed in my stead. Then I received advice from a Cabinet Minister. I went to Ezra Norton of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> and sought his support. Within a couple of days I became a member of the Cabinet. I say that in the presence of my colleagues to let them know that I learned in those days that there always is someone able to give us guidance of a very helpful kind. </para>
          <para>I remember the morning he asked me to become a member of the Ministry. I was at the Balmoral Naval Base. He said that I would be Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air. Somewhat reluctantly I said: &#39;That does not appeal to me very much, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. What</inline> is wrong with the Treasury?&#39; I thought that he would have a fit of hysterics, but he replied: &#39;I don&#39;t think I would have the courage to talk to dear old Artie about that&#39;. I managed to survive in those years as Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air, I do not know how, because on at least three occasions I made major and successful decisions without informing Cabinet. As an example, I allowed the war criminals from Manus Island to go back to Japan without informing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert,</inline> and I gave approval for a &#163;2 program for the Sydney dockyard without telling the Cabinet but with the approval of the Treasury officials. I can assure you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> they were memorable days. I stuck it out, but only because I had the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Fadden and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Harrison. </para>
          <para>I do not want to proceed on that line for too long, but I want to give the reasons why I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> must be remembered and what his main achievements were. First, I must stress that he changed the outlook of the Commonwealth Parliament to the Constitution. Some amendments had already been made through placitum (xxiiiA) of section 51 of the Constitution, the Evatt amendment which dealt with social welfare and health services. Apart from that, in those days the Federal Parliament was truly a Federal Parliament and did not believe in interfering where the rights and responsibilities were obviously those of the States. Slowly but surely <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> changed this attitude. One of the great constitution changes, therefore, was that over a wide range of activities <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> took action which I believe involved and ensured development and growth in Australia and, through that, set us on the road to achieving a unity that otherwise could never have been achieved or achieved so quickly. </para>
          <para>There was his attitude to education, which he liked to take pride in himself as his greatest achievement. I put it no higher than third because there were other things that he did as well. I can remember Artie Fadden coming into Cabinet and saying: &#39;What do you think, mates? I have to announce that we are giving aid to the church schools in Canberra, and he did not even tell me before he left&#39;. I can also remember that in a Cabinet meeting I was pressing strenuously to get aid for independent schools and it looked as though I had lost. I was supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick. Suddenly I mumbled: Wouldn&#39;t it be a wonderful thing, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, if</inline> when you go to the Christian Brothers in Waverley you give them aid for their libraries and their science blocks?&#39; He said that that was a wonderful idea. A couple of days later we had the wonderful announcement. The Prime Minister will know that the Federal Government then went on to provide aid for independent schools. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>was a remarkable man, and I must stress that no one paid greater attention to employment and unemployment than he did. He established a totally new attitude to unemployment, and as Minister for Labour and National Service I was aware of this. If he saw the rate of unemployment growing to around 1 per cent close to the Christmas period, we would meet to see what we could do to ensure that it was kept low. The matter of pensions was another of his great preoccupations. In those respects he was a remarkable man. Above all, he had an instinct for economic trends. On at least two occasions he took independent action to ensure that changes were made which improved the trends in the economy. He acted despite the opinions given by the Department of the Treasury and despite the opinions that had been accepted by other members of the Cabinet. </para>
          <para>In regard to foreign affairs, we lived in times that were temperamental and tempestuous. I remember when he was either in the United Kingdom or going through to Canada and he was asked to be the  chairman  of the committee dealing with the Suez crisis. Available members of the Cabinet were asked to meet in the British Empire Society- he had asked six or seven of us to be there each with a telephone- to discuss the chairmanship with him. Despite what has been said, we strongly urged him, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Fadden, not to do so. We felt that on occasions such as that one is likely to be undermined. That is exactly what happened. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was Prime Minister during the time of the Korean war; he was Prime Minister during the time of the conflict in South East Asia. He and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Percy</inline> Spender were responsible for ANZUS and the </para>
          <para class="block">South East Asia Treaty Organisation. The international changes in those days were of a kind that other than during world wars we had not had to face before and have not known since. </para>
          <para>As a man, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was a person of considerable charm. If one had the good fortune to divorce oneself from politics and go to dinner with him you would find a person of kindness and charm. He loved laughter; he loved pleasure; and he loved children. I remember him suggesting to me that I should read Beatrix Potter&#39;s books, and I did. At his suggestion they were the first books I gave to my children when I thought they were able to understand. I must speak of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> as an unbelievably remarkable person, a very great man. He was probably the most eloquent  speaker  I have heard. For all these reasons I am glad that I have been able to associate myself with the Prime Minister and other people who have spoken from this side of the House. I must also pay my tribute to Dame Pattie. Wherever <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> went one could be certain that Dame Pattie would be there as his helper and counsellor. She would make certain he remembered young children and the women of this country whenever major decisions were being made. </para>

I cannot refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> as a former parliamentary colleague because my election to this House took place shortly after his retirement in 1966. My personal association with him commenced when I became the vice  chairman  of the Kooyong electorate committee on which I served during the last few years of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> term as member for Kooyong. I am indebted to the advice and guidance which he so generously gave to me at that time as well as subsequently, upon my election to this House. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies will rank as one of the great Australians of this century.  His  formidable achievements as statesman, parliamentarian, jurist and administrator have been referred to by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and other speakers. </para>

          <para>I take this opportunity to pay my tributes to those achievements and, as  deputy  leader of the party which he founded, to recognise the formidable contribution which he made to the nation. I also pay a particular tribute to Dame Pattie Menzies.  Her  support for and encouragement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> were unfailing, and her graciousness was unmatched.

I believe two factors above all others should be emphasised: Firstly, his absolute integrity which has never been questioned and has always been an example to new members of this Parliament; and, secondly, his vision for Australia and all sections of the people. We all recall so well the words that I think can truthfully be applied to him: &#39;He walked with kings yet kept the common touch &#39;. </para>

          <para>The great strength and the inner power which came from the support of Dame Pattie Menzies and the home influence are examples to all of us in this day and generation. We watched that lovely person as she entered the church, sad and yet so serene, with proud memories of the achievement of her partner. From that I believe we all realised that here was part of the strength of the man whom we honoured on that day. All these things were bound up in the certainty of a great reformed faith which set the foundations for community responsibility and service to the people. Much has been said and I do not want to labour the point but I pay a tribute to a friend, a colleague and a true son of Australia. I join with others in sending condolences and prayers to Dame Pattie and her family at a time when they must be proud of the one whom they loved and who served this country. </para>

He made a tremendous contribution to it personally and through this chamber. Those of us who sat here with him recall the degree to which he dominated this place by his oratory and the manner of his parliamentary performance. I believe that, perhaps more than in his performance within the chamber, his contribution to Australia lay in the manner in which he presided over successive governments that developed this country into what it is today. Abroad he was seen, admired and respected as the epitome of this country at a time of change. As my leader has said, Dame Pattie was the epitome of the perfect wife of a parliamentarian. She is a wonderful person and all honourable members admire her greatly, both in her fortitude, in her present sadness and in the way in which for so long she helped <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> in the performance of his public and private duties. To her and her family I would also like to extend my personal sympathy. </para>

            <para>-Only a handful of honourable members from this side of the House here this afternoon were members during <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies&#39; term of office. Over the long period in which I knew him and the longer period in which I knew of him, I always regarded <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, both privately and publicly as a gracious person. One would not ordinarily apply that term to someone who was such a vigorous political opponent. I recall that on the first occasion on which I used that term about him in my electorate I was chided by my political supporters. But he was accessible to people from our side of the House who wanted to approach him as the Prime Minister or on some parliamentary matter and on such occasions he was gracious in dealing with the matters placed before him. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I recall approaching him during a period in the development of Aboriginal advancement policies and asking him to see the Aboriginal people themselves so that they could discuss the matter with him, He agreed to do so. He concurred with the idea that their fares ought to be met. He met them in the Cabinet room and they had a lengthy discussion. I learnt a technique of politics from that. I saw on that day, for the first time, that he actually saw this as a matter in which he should deal with the people directly, in a personal, human way. That does not mean that he did not often deal with other matters in that way. In politics it is terribly important to remember that human issues can only be learned and discharged by actual human confrontation and consultation. So, on a day such as today people are inclined to remember all those acts of grace and those matters on which they concurred over the long period of association with him. </para>
          <para>There is likely to be built up an aura of nostalgia about the period in which I entered this Parliament. It was a time of great tumult in Australian politics. I hope that when people remember the current period they will think of those who sit here today in a parliamentary sense in a similar way to the way in which they think of the people who were here when I came to office. I refer to people on the other side of the House such as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies himself, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Fadden, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Harrison and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> and to people on our side such as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt,</inline> Arthur Calwell, Reg Pollard, Eddie Ward, Leslie Haylen and Allan Fraser. I consider them to have been men of great parliamentary stature. I hope that when people look back in 20 or 30 years&#39; time they will see that we had <inline font-style="italic">people of</inline> that stature. </para>
          <para>I would say that the evaluation of him from my side of politics would be that his contribution to the Australian scene was stability. He was a man with a conservative nature.  His  objective in politics was to continue the status quo with amendments. I would say from this side of the House- perhaps many of his friends from the other side would say it also- that the amendments to the status quo were driven on him, accepted and carried through, often as tentatively as possible. However, the point was made here this afternoon by someone on the opposite side of the chamber that at least he did expand the area of activities of this Parliament. He did that gradually but it happened. I suggest that some of the things which are happening now represent a reversal of that trend. </para>
          <para>We need to remember, however, that his life was not one of total victories. He had lost touch with the Australian psyche when he left office in 1941. That was not a temporary situation; it was eight years before he came back into office. It should be remembered that in the great tumult of the early 1950s and the confrontation in the community over civil rights, and in particular over the Communist Party Dissolution Bill and so on, he locked horns with another very great Australian in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt.</inline> On that particular issue <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> was the victor. But that is the way politics goes. Early in his political career I think <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was pretty ruthless in the pursuit of his aims. In later years, during my time in the Parliament, he mellowed. He was the master of the scene. He was a giant amongst his contemporaries, particularly those who sat on the same side of the House as he did. That is no reflection on those people because he was a long survivor. </para>
          <para>On this occasion I recognise that the Menzies family has lost a person who must have meant an enormous amount in the family life. He meant a good deal in Australian life also. I think that one of the factors of our democracy is that we feel that even those who are on the side of politics different from our own, even those who in the political sense we hold in great contempt or hatred, are part of our own lives. So this afternoon I record my regret at the passing of a gracious Australian, a man who I think held more to stability than to progress. I think that is the way in which he will be registered in the record books. But he was a man who, whenever faced with a proposition at close quarters, would decide both on the side of justice and on the side of mercy. I think we should remember that one does not win much in the political scene in Australia unless one pursues one &#39;s aims with persistence, and often with ruthlessness. I think they were characteristics which he had. But, as I say, they were tempered with acts of grace, whenever the occasion arose, in dealing with his colleagues. On afternoons such as this I heard him pay compliments and tributes to people about whom I could think of little to say. </para>
          <para>I know that these remarks will be passed on to his family, members of whom I know. I recall occasions when his grandchildren met him outside Parliament House. Those occasions gave one a different picture of the man in his family life. I recognise that on occasions such as this we make evaluations which are probably clouded more with nostalgia and regret than with objectivity; but I have no doubt that, even those who hold the political views that I do, which are in vigorous opposition to those he held, will still register their regard for those achievements of which we approve and even, in many cases, some of which we disapprove. </para>

            <para>-I shall take only a few moments of the time of the House in supporting the comments that have been made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> and the other speakers who have made a contribution this afternoon. I was privileged in three parliaments- the nineteenth, the twentieth and the twenty-second parliaments, between 1949 and 1958- to sit in this place behind the former right honourable member for Kooyong, Robert Gordon Menzies. I agree with all of the comments that have been made because most of them have been made at the personal level, having regard to personal contacts. I felt that my contribution might be of a slightly more personal nature by my pointing out that, apart from his greatness, apart from his statesmanship, apart from those great qualities to which we have paid respect this afternoon, he was a very human person. He had a great sense of humour. He was not without some familiarity with personal physical suffering, and in his family life from time to time he was subjected to great stresses that were tragic in their nature. I say this because I know that these pressures had to be faced coincidentally with the great struggle to lead this nation of ours along the proper path. He also had to sustain his family. He had the support of that great lady, Dame Pattie, whom the great majority of people who have known her will always respect. I can say that over the many years since 1949 I have never heard one single word of criticism of that magnificent lady. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I have said, the former Prime Minister was a man with a great sense of humour. He was a raconteur and after dinner speaker par excellence. On suitable occasions he could talk to members of the Parliament about great figures in other parliaments, such as Lord Birkenhead. He talked about cricketers with an affection that was unrivalled. In my judgment he understood so much about the game of cricket that one would believe that had it been possible for him to be a cricketer, he could have known distinction in that field. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>I hope that you will convey my comments to Dame Pattie and to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> family. He lived to a great age, after all, from 1894 to 1978. It was with great satisfaction that he would have witnessed his own family growing up and expanding, the growth and the development of his grandchildren and his family embarking upon a road of distinction. I am happy that that is the case, and I am sure we all are. </para>

            <para>- As the present member for Kooyong I naturally wish to be associated with the motion and to confirm again my sympathy to Dame Pattie and the Menzies family. Over the last week very many tributes have been paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert,</inline> both in Australia and overseas. It is worth remembering that had he not outlived most of his distinguished contemporaries there would have been even more tributes from eminent sources. Three of his outstanding characteristics in my view are worthy of particular mention. Firstly, I refer to his political courage, his willingness to take unpopular courses, to express unfashionable views and even to undertake tasks for which the chances of success were less than even, because he thought it was necessary and right. Secondly, I refer to the breadth of his political perspective. There have been few Australian politicians less parochial or less constricted by ideological blinkers. In international politics he brought Australia into a larger league, not stridently, not raucously, but with a realistic appreciation of how we could fit into such a larger scene. Thirdly, I refer to his respect for language in politics. By this I mean more than that he made great speeches. In his speaking, in his writing, in his thinking about politics <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Robert was concerned to match words to substance, to mean what he said, to say what he meant, to respect his audience. In a world in which rhetoric threatens to become an end in itself, in which public relations threaten to displace substance and jargon constantly presses on good English, this is not a negligible virtue. </para>
          <para>In the Anglo-Saxon tradition I believe we have been taught to think of conservatism and liberalism as alternative and opposed positions. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies&#39; career is a salutory reminder that they are not necessarily so. He was certainly conservative, somebody who valued what was tried, tested and familiar. But what he wanted to conserve were essentially liberal values and liberal institutions.  His  commitment to those values was not doctrinal or theoretical; it was based on long experience and the fact that they had evolved gradually and were the products of a particular historical tradition. It was a fully earned commitment, immune to changing fashion and confident in itself. In substance, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies combined all the essential qualities of leadership: Courage, judgment, integrity and dedication. Such qualities are frequently found in part in other men; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> had the rare combination in full. </para>
          <para>It is no exaggeration to say that there is a particular grief in the minds and hearts of the overwhelming majority of people who reside in the suburbs which make up the electorate of Kooyong. Constituents felt great pride in the fact that they were represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. To many members of parliament that would be the highest accolade. On all occasions either when one was with him in that electorate or when one listened to the views that were expressed quoting him one felt great pride flowing through the constituents of his electorate. It is fair to say that he in turn felt great pride in representing them throughout his 32 years as their member. </para>
          <para>I shall always be in the debt of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies for his original interest in me when I was only a law student and standing as a condidate for the former seat of Yarra, which continued through the various positions I held as either  President  of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party or a member of this Parliament. It was of course an honour to know him, it was an honour to receive his advice, and it was an honour to follow him in this Parliament. </para>

            <para>-I rise to record a tribute on behalf of my constituents in the Mallee electorate to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gordon Menzies. On 20 December 1894, R. G. Menzies was born to his storekeeper parents, James and Kate Menzies in the rear of their shop in the small north-western Victorian town of Jeparit. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> years in Jeparit were spent attending primary school at the small rural school where even in those early years his schoolmates today remember his aggressiveness at play and his ability and eagerness to participate in public discussion and debate. The influence of his family in developing an interest in and finally an ambition for a political career must have been significant.  His  father was a  president  of the local shire and ultimately became a member of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, serving as the member for Lowan. One of his father&#39;s brothers also served in that Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sydney</inline> Sampson, who was his mother&#39;s brother, also served from 1906 to 1919 as a member of the House of Representatives for the electorate of Wimmera, an electorate geographically identical to the electorate of Mallee that I now represent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Menzies was Prime Minister of Australia during this nation&#39;s period of greatest growth and development. Political commentators and historians may wish to argue the effects of his influence upon the factors in this period but no one can deny his capacity of intellect and ingenuity and his effect on administrative stability. In these matters he has not been surpassed in Australian politics. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies has had, and will have, many monuments erected in his honour. But the most enduring monuments and achievements, however, will not be represented in granite or by plaques. The development of Canberra as the nations capital and the extension of Commonwealth responsibility into the field of education, particularly at the tertiary level, must rank as enduring policy achievements. </para>
          <para>On Tuesday, 16 May, the councillors and staff of the Dimboola Shire meeting that day in Jeparit adjourned to the Menzies memorial erected in 1966 by the community to honour this small town&#39;s famous son. In a short ceremony the community of today recognised a man of stature who became a great national figure and a world statesman. It recognised a lifetime of public service and the loyalty and personal sacrifice of this great man&#39;s wife and family. To Dame Pattie, her son and daughter and to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> 10 grandchildren, the people of the Mallee and the Wimmera express their sincere condolences. </para>

Much attention has been given, and properly, to his role as Prime </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Minister and statesman, but I want to talk of his belief in the role of private members in this place. He had a passionate belief in the responsibility and the role of individual members of the House of Representatives. He regarded himself as a constituent, and felt that lus views, which were still strong and current, were no more important than anybody else&#39;s views. That is the measure of the man. I am grateful for his interest in me as his local member. A man of his status and experience need not have taken an interest in the new local member but he did. </para>
          <para>He had a great belief in this House. He was a child of it. He became a giant in it and we talk of his legend today. He was a humble person. There was a story in last Saturday&#39;s Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> by journalist Bruce Wilson who recalled getting <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> autograph at the Windsor Hotel as a young man many years ago. I know of another story, that of a 12 year old girl who drove him up and down the elevator at the Windsor on two or three occasions, with an anxious mother waiting. That was the measure of the man again, that he would let this little girl take him up and down in the elevator. I know that story to be true for the girl is now my wife. </para>
          <para>He had a continuing interest in current events, in the progress of Australia and the future of Australia. I am sorry to say that, whilst I agree with what most of the honourable member for Wills said, he was wrong in one regard: <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies was still current.  His  thoughts were still current.  His  belief was in the future of Australia. But, whilst he had those views, he was not anxious to impose them on anybody; they were there for those who wished to benefit from them.  His  belief in this House lasted with him until the very end. When he had finished his day&#39;s reading he listened to the broadcasts of this House.  His  interest in this place was paramount and with him to the very end. The spirit of Menzies was rekindled last week. Let us reflect in the weeks and months ahead and consider an appropriate national memorial or monument to him. Finally I refer to his family. In doing so <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I note that his daughter Heather and three of his grandchildren are in the gallery here today. It is not easy for the family of a public figure to share that public figure with the nation, but I thank Dame Pattie and his son Ken and daughter Heather for allowing the nation to share their sadness and to pay tribute to its famous son last Friday. </para>

          <para class="block">Pattie and to his family. I had the honour to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> for the first time when I, too, was 12 years old. Like most of my colleagues here I grew up during the Menzies era and he always remained for us the brightest star in the Australian firmament. While we can- in fact, mustleave history to judge his works and deeds, there can be no doubt that he has earned a lasting place in the hearts of the vast majority of the Australian people. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> walked in no man&#39;s shadow. He was the quintessence of an outstanding national leader, a man of whom we could be and were immensely proud. </para>
          <para>Last Friday week in Sydney we inaugurated an oration, given by Lord Hailsham, in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> name.

The citizens of Ballarat held a memorial service for Robert Gordon Menzies last Sunday evening in the church in which he worshipped as a boy. It was a fitting service for several reasons, but particularly because much of Robert Menzies&#39; formative years were closely linked with Ballarat and district, and throughout his entire life he continued a close association with and appreciation for the city. It is to this association that I would like to refer briefly today, because Robert Menzies&#39; grandfather settled in Ballarat on his migration from Dumfries in Scotland in 1855, and it was in Ballarat that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> father was born.  His  mother was also from the district.  Her  name was Kate Sampson. She was born in Creswick, a small town only 10 miles from Ballarat. <inline font-style="italic">Robert</inline> Menzies&#39; family lived in Ballarat for many years, his father being a coach painter at that time. His three elder brothers and sister were born there. His parents did not in fact move from Ballarat until about two years before his birth in 1894. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Several of Robert Menzies&#39; early school years were spent in Ballarat. He attended Humphrey Street primary school, which still exists and which is only 200 yards from my electorate office. He then attended Grenville College before winning scholarships to Wesley College in Melbourne and from there to Melbourne University. While attending school in Ballarat he lived with his widowed grandmother in a small cottage in the centre of the city. Robert Menzies was in later years a very frequent visitor to Ballarat, a city of which he said &#39;I always come to with pleasure and leave with reluctance&#39;- a city of which in his book <inline font-style="italic">Afternoon Light</inline> he said &#39;had many years ago developed a civic sense of beauty, the products of which are still notable &#39;. </para>
          <para>I had the privilege of working within close range of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies during the final two years of his Prime Ministership, when I was private secretary at that time to his much-loved and loyal  deputy,  the late Harold Holt. Even though I was a young and very junior cog in the machine of government at that time, I shall always recall with great gratitude that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies still took the trouble to speak to me when he saw me. He was the same with all his own staff and with all those with whom he came into contact. In passing, on this occasion I would also like to extend my sympathy to Miss Hazel Craig who was a devoted secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies over a very long period. </para>
          <para>Whilst mourning the passing of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert,</inline> I do not believe that this should be a time for grief; rather, I believe that this is a time for pride and for giving thanks. As a citizen of Ballarat, I take pride in the fact that Robert Menzies&#39; life was so closely linked with my city. As a citizen of our nation, I give thanks that we were blessed with having in our midst a man of such ability, wisdom and dedication to improving the well being of all the citizens of Australia. He was a man to whom all Australians will say &#39;Thank you. We will not easily forget you because it is unlikely we will see a man of your stature in the fullest meaning of that term pass our way again for a very longtime&#39;. </para>

Australia has lost a great statesman.  His  family has lost a husband, father, father-in-law and grandfather. Many thousands of Australians have lost a true friend, and a number of present and former members of Parliament have lost a former colleague. As I look around this House, it is with the realisation that a significant number of members from both sides of the House grew up under the Prime Ministership of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gordon Menzies. This wonderful man gave so much to Australia. The debt and gratitude that this nation owes are beyond measure. The most notable achievements included sound government after a terrible war, the rebuilding of Australia&#39;s war torn industries and the development of Australia&#39;s newly discovered riches. </para>

I add my deepest sympathy and prayers to those offered to Dame Pattie Menzies and her family at this time of sorrow. I wish that my few words be added to those already spoken here today.

            <para>-It is unusual for a  Speaker  to accord himself the privilege of speaking in the House, but I do so today on a rather special occasion, as we all know, to support this motion of condolence. I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies when I was a young candidate in Fremantle, aged 22. He went out of his way to enable me to speak to an audience which was larger than I had ever seen before, let alone spoken to. He encouraged me and won from me an admiration for hum which lasted his life. I spent time with him in Melbourne Scots, a very fine organisation I will have the House know and one which is dear to me. Other people feel as deeply about it, including leading politicians such as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Premier of Victoria. They were very pleasant times for us all in the company of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It was my privilege to serve in his last Ministry. He had the wisdom, some would say, or he made the mistake, others would say, of asking me to be his Attorney-General. He telephoned me and said: &#39;Billy, would you be willing to be my Attorney-General?&#39; I hesitated for about a millionth of a second and answered yes. So I was able to serve him, learn from him and carry my admiration to new pupils. He was a great man in the Cabinet. He did not dominate it other than by his sheer intellectual capacity. He gave leadership in the Cabinet. He gave leadership to the Ministers and the Parliament. Outside the Cabinet room, the ante-room was a place to which Ministers liked to go and hear from him the lore of the Parliament. Much was to be learnt there from him, for he was a great parliamentarian. This chamber had a deep significance to him in the constitutional sense, in the political sense and in the national sense. It was here that he was at his best, He recognised the importance of the institution of Parliament for the maintenance of the political stability of the nation, and he contributed to the development of this Parliament in a way which all of us might emulate. </para>
          <para>As a parliamentarian, he deserves our thanks and appreciation. He deserves that thanks and appreciation as a national statesman. As human beings, we might remember that the greatest achievement that Australia had was during the 1950s when we evolved social standards, industrial standards and achievement standards of a kind that we had not known for a century. One needs to go back in history 100 years to the decade of the fifties of the last century and the great gold rush to find any comparable period of growth and development of the nation. In the 1950s, under his leadership, the foundation which will carry us through into a great nation of the next century was built. So much of this is due to him and his understanding of the need for Australia&#39;s social patterns to expand, diversify and to be enriched by the great migrant flow that came to this country under his national leadership. </para>
          <para>I had the privilege also to know his wife, Dame Pattie, a very dear lady and one who can give the same example to the wives of parliamentarians that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies himself gave to members of Parliament. I support the motion. I ask that honourable members show their approval of the motion by standing in their places. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave- The question has arisen as to the way in which, as a nation, we might best mark and commemorate, now and for posterity, the great contribution of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gordon Menzies to the nation. There has already been enthusiastic and helpful discussion on this by some public figures and by some newspapers, and I am indebted to them. A preparatory committee has already begun work, directed to the creation of a special appeal and fund to be known as the <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies Memorial Trust, and I am happy to announce to the House the general direction and scope of the arrangements that are in mind. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The appeal will be established on an Australia-wide basis, and the funds resulting will be applied to objectives of a practical and continuing kind within the particular interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. He had no static view of Australia and he would wish, as those who contribute will, that the funds should be spent in terms of future benefit to Australia. The objectives are still to be finally determined, but it can be said already that the fund will be designed to assist Australians of all ages- but especially the young- to obtain in serious and worthwhile directions, academic training or practical experience or opportunities to compete which they might otherwise be unable to obtain. </para>
          <para>Some of the particular interests identified with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies and which might therefore be drawn within the purposes of the fund are the law, with particular reference to constitutional matters and Federal-State relationships, studies concerned with Australia &#39;s role within the British Commonwealth and with Australia-Britain relations; studies of Australia and the United States; studies of relations between Australia and the Pacific nations. Another possibility which would have been of interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies and from which major benefit would accrue is to bring to Australia for public meetings or special consultations, speakers of distinction or young persons of promise and interest to us. </para>
          <para>There are two other matters at least, one is the development of skills in the use of the English language, since we all know he loved the English tongue. The other is sport of many kinds because as he watched it and took interest, it gave him a particular and agreeable relaxation and companionship. </para>
          <para>Although much more discussion will be needed, I am able to say now that the appeal and the fund will be under the authority of a national committee and a series of State committees. </para>
          <para>It is my honour to have been asked to accept the office of National President. Leading Australians will be invited to accept office with me in connection with the Trust. It will be necessary, in addition, to have a strong and operative executive national committee and a series of State executive committees. </para>
          <para>I am pleased to announce that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Vines has accepted office as head of the national committee with the title of National General <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman. Sir William</inline> Vines has a high record of achievement in Australian commercial and agricultural communities and of service to government, both Commonwealth and State, involving all political parties over a long period. He will be assisted as  Deputy  National General  Chairman  by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Leonard. </para>
          <para>The other members of the Executive Committee will be similarly distinguished people, representative of the States as well as the Commonwealth, and, it is hoped, from a variety of callings and backgrounds. To assist this Committee, a distinguished public servant and close confidant of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> for many years- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting- will be co-ordinator. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Menzies was the leader of one political party. But he was, at the same time, a representative and a leader of all the people. He sought to serve the whole community- as the fund now in mind will do and in fact must do. </para>

            <para>However, the definitive regime which the honourable member refers to is presently being negotiated by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. It was agreed at the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in London last year that a Special Consultative Meeting be convened in order to elaborate a draft definitive regime. This meeting began its work in Canberra from 27 February-16 March. It will continue its task in Buenos Aires in July. Our discussions on the regime for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources have consequently been confined to the Antartic Treaty Consultative Parties. </para>

          <para>Los Angeles- Since the Consulate-General was closed in June 1976, the expansion of Australian consular, trade, information and general political activities in the United States has meant that the Consulates-General at San Francisco and Chicago which took over the areas previously handled from Los Angeles have borne a disproportionate responsibility which is now judged handled better on the spot. </para>
          <para>In 1976, Southern California&#39;s trade totalled$US17.3 billion (about the same as Australia&#39;s total trade) and 66 per cent of it was with Asia from where we face intensive and growing competition which needs to be met. </para>
          <para>The problems associated with obtaining visas by mail from San Francisco have had some impact on our tourist potential in Southern California. The additional burden on the Australian Tourist Commission in Los Angeles needs to be relieved. At present, about 4,700 seats are available each week on flights from Los Angeles to Australia. Australian tourism to the United States (with associated consular work) is expected to increase dramatically in the next few years. </para>
          <para>A major world exposition is to be held at Los Angeles in 1 98 1 in which Australia will need to participate if it intends to bid for the venue of Expo 88. An office of substantial status will need to be established at Los Angeles well before 1981 to provide preliminary facilities for the Australian Exhibit Organisation. </para>
          <para>UNESCO- UNESCO is a major international organisation with more than 140 member governments and significant activities in almost every field of education, science, the social sciences, culture, communications and development. The scope of UNESCO&#39;s programs has been steadily increasing and the extent of our own involvement in these programs has widened significantly, particularly in the Asian and Pacific region. The appointment of a full-time Ambassador will assist Australia &#39;s contribution to the development of UNESCO&#39;s future programs and help ensure that our own growing interests in these programs are reflected in them. UNESCO is the most politically sensitive of the UN Specialised Agencies and the political aspects of Australia &#39;s role in the Organisation have assumed increased importance. It is appropriate that this and the other factors noted above should be recognised by the appointment of a full-time Ambassador to UNESCO. </para>
          <para>On the withdrawal of the previous full-time Ambassador to UNESCO late in 1976 his functions reverted to the Ambassador to France. </para>
          <para>Since that time significant areas of consultation and cooperation have opened up between Australia and France and continue to develop steadily, including our relationship with the European Communities, nuclear matters, cultural relations, defence exchanges and our interests in the South Pacific, Antarctica, the Middle East and Indochina. As a result, the Ambassador to France cannot without prejudice to his principal functions give to UNESCO the attention that its importance in the international community and its significance to Australia deserve. </para>

            <para>The Department of Education has six positions of Assistant Grade 1 located in Darwin locally designated Home Liaison Officer. The work of these officers involves considerable contact with non-English speaking parents of students attending schools. These parents are mainly of Greek, Italian and Timorese origin and competence in any of their languages is stressed as a desirable qualification for recruitment purposes. Preference is given to applicants with the appropriate language skills. Where it is not possible to recruit persons with the appropriate language skills then every effort is made to appoint persons who can effectively communicate with non-English speaking parents despite the lack of competence in the parents &#39; native language. </para>

            <para>Most countries accepting refugees for permanent settlement from Indo-China and East Timor are developed countries and therefore would not require financial help from Australia. </para>
            <para>Australian bilateral assistance to developing countries who may have accepted refugees from Indo-China and East Timor is not specifically aimed at helping those countries resettle refugees, but is intended to promote their economic and social development. </para>
            <para>Most of Australia&#39;s financial contributions to help with the care and re-settlement of refugees have been channelled through the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which has a mandate to seek solutions to the problems of refugees. Australia makes regular annual contributions to UNHCR and in 1978 Australia will contribute $740,000 to UNHCR &#39;s General Program from which UNCHR&#39;s worldwide refugee activities are funded. Funds are allocated from this source for assisting refugees including those from Indo-China and East Timor. </para>
            <para>Immediately after the cessation of hostilities in IndoChina Australia contributed $4m to UNHCR programs in Indo-China in the period 1974-75. More recently, Australia has made substantial contributions to UNCHR&#39;s Special Program for Indo-Chinese refugees in Thailand and other countries in Asia, including the boat people. In 1977, Australia contributed $ 1 m and in 1 978 $ 1 .3m. </para>
            <para>Australia also gave $250,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1975, and $250,000 to the Indonesian Red Cross in 1 976 for the relief of refugees in East Timor and Indonesian Timor. </para>

            <para>None of the States have introduced changes in their birth and death notification forms so that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders may be separately identified. Several of the States, however, have suggested that they will follow the Federal Government&#39;s lead in this matter. In this connection, the Minister for the Northern Territory has advised the Minister for Health that appropriate amendments to birth and death notification forms in use in the Territory could be effected by administrative action. Accordingly, the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages in the Northern Territory is in the process of adjusting the information sheets so that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders may be separately identified. An amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Registration of Births and Marriages Ordinance 1963 is required to enable Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to be identified. My colleague the Minister for the Capital Territory has informed me that a Bill for an Ordinance is being drafted for presentation to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. </para>

            <para>In conformity with the practice of previous Governments, the matters considered by Interdepartmental Committees and their reports are not normally made public. The scheme adopted by the Government applies only to public art galleries, libraries and museums. In response to a question from the honourable member on 13 April 1978 I indicated that difficulties would arise in drawing the line in relation to tax deductions if the scheme was extended to include public places and buildings. </para>
            <para>I believe it would be beneficial to the community however, if the institutions participating in the scheme of Tax Incentives for the Arts were to set aside suitable material from their collections which would be available for display in parks, squares or buildings open to the public. </para>
            <para>A proposal for an Art Bank, which I am currently considering, might be a better medium for assisting greater public access to works of art and other cultural material. I hope that we can advance the establishment of an Art Bank in the ensuing 12 months and I will ensure that the honourable member &#39;s suggestion is carefully considered. </para>

            <para>The net reduction estimated at the time of the Budget is more than accounted for by the run-down in expenditure on housing by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission and the functional re-classification for budget purposes of some other expenditure on housing in the Northern Territory. Expenditure on housing that is financed from the allocation in 1 977-78 to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is accounted for under the General Public Services function rather than the Housing function. </para>

The Technical Committee established to undertake relevant technical examinations has recently completed a report and the Working Party, which is co-ordinating work and policy advice on this matter, is in the process of assessing that report.

              <para>My Department has received from the World Health Organisation a draft document entitled &#39;Environmental Health Criteria for Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD)&#39;. While the document contains references to conflicting reports concerning possible association of the substance with alleged still-births and congenital malformations in Vietnam, it does not contain any confirmed report of deaths or defective births from environmental exposure to the chemical. It should be pointed out that TCDD is not used as such in weedicides nor is it used as such commercially. TCDD occurs as a contaminant in 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, a chemical used in the production of 2,4,5-T. The National Health and Medical Research Council at its Eightieth Session in April 1975 recommended that 2,4,5-T containing more than 0.1 mg/kg of TCDD should not be permitted for use as a herbicide in Australia. Analyses since then have shown that these levels are not being exceeded either in preparations containing 2,4,5-T or in the raw substance. </para>

              <para>It was suggested in April 1977 that the occurrence of clusters&#39; of neural tube defects in the South Taranaki, Northland and Waikato areas in New Zealand were related to the use of 2,4,5-T. This was investigated by the New Zealand Department of Health in consultation with experts in genetics, pathology, pharmacology and toxicology. It was concluded that there was no evidence to implicate 2,4,5-T as a causal factor in human birth defects. The report on this matter was examined by my Department. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The total value of capital works committed or expected to be committed to construction by the Department of Construction in the first six months of 1978 is approximately $269m. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>This figure relates to the programs undertaken by the Department of Construction for all Civil Departments, the Defence Department and the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, but does not include programs for other authorities, and some of which the Department may carry out on an agency basis. </para>
          <para>In addition the total value of Capital Works committed or expected to be committed by the National Capital Development Commission in the first sue months of 1978 is approximately $35m. This figure includes that part of the NCDC works program undertaken by the Department of Construction. </para>
          <para>No information can be given for the remainder of 1978 as the works programs for the 1978-79 financial year are now being formulated. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>This part of the honourable member&#39;s question involves a very large volume of detailed information. As indicated by the magnitude of the figures I have quoted in ( 1 ) above a great number of individual projects is involved. There are approximately SOO major projects each of a cost exceeding $15,000; in addition there are of the order of 1,000 minor works. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>To collect and assemble this information on an Australian wide basis would be a major task involving a considerable administrative effort in time and cost, which I am not prepared to authorise. As a measure of assistance however I would refer the honourable member to Budget Paper No. 5 the &#39;Civil Works Program&#39; which covers the wide variety of works involved in excess of $40,000 for the financial year 1977-78. </para>
          <para>If the honourable member wishes to know details of any particular project, I will be pleased to provide further information. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>It is not possible to accurately quantify the new employment that will be generated by the above works programs as: </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The level of on-site employment on projects varies significantly throughout the currency of each project. For example the largest single project commenced in March 1978 is the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory (ANAHL) at Geelong. As this project gathers momentum it will directly employ at various stages an estimated 200 to SOO men on-site. </para>
          <para>It is not possible to assess the secondary employment these projects will generate in the supporting industries and factories. </para>
          <para>In broad terms on average rates the commencement of some $269m in the first half of 1978 will require something in excess of 5,000 man years on-site. The new employment component to a large extent depends upon the volume of current programs coming forward and the replacement of old works being completed. </para>
          <para>A better way to quantify the situation is to compare the program for this financial year with the last. In 1977-78 the Department will have commenced new works totalling some $380m. This compares with commencements of $240m in 1 976-77. Even excluding the ANAHL project this represents an increase of $59m or 25 per cent. In real terms there is an increase of about 1 7 per cent. </para>

              <para>In 1964 it was estimated that there were 975,000 Tamils of Indian origin in Sri Lanka. These people were descended from Indian Tamils taken to Sri Lanka during the latter part of the 1 9th century as plantation labourers and are distinct from the Sri Lanka Tamils whose forbears have inhabited parts of Sri Lanka for centuries. Sri Lanka &#39;s Indian Tamils are stateless persons. In agreements between the Indian and Sri Lankan Governments signed in 1964 and 1974 it was agreed that of these 975,000 Sri Lanka would grant citizenship to 375,000 (plus their natural increase) and India would agree to the repatriation to India and grant Indian citizenship to 600,000 (with their natural increase). This has been taking place in a phased program over a number of years. The decision on whether to seek Sri Lankan citizenship or repatriation to India is one for the individuals concerned to make, there being no provision for compulsory repatriation. </para>

            <para>My Department does not compile statistics on a basis which would enable an answer to be provided to the honourable member&#39;s question. To undertake a special exercise for this purpose would require a major resource allocation which, having in mind the current commitments of my Department, I am not in a position to authorise. </para>
