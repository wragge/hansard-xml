        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>To the Honourable  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That it is necessary for the Commonwealth Government to renew for a further term of a least 3 years the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974-77, renewed for one year expiring on the 30 June 1978. </para>
        <para>The demand for dwellings has not slackened as the waiting list (all States) of 12,060 single and 4,120 couples as at the 30 June 1977 showeth. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners respectfully draw the attention of the Commonwealth Government to the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons&#39; Housing 1975 under the Chairmanship of the Rev. K. Seaman (now Governor of South Australia) which recommended additional funds to State housing authorities to meet the demand for low-rental accommodation in the proportion of $4 to $ 1 with the proviso that the States do not reduce their existing expenditure and </para>
        <para>That the Act include married pensioners eligible for supplementary assistance and migrants as specified by the Seaman Report and that particular consideration be paid to the special needs and requirements of the prospective tenants in the location and design of such dwellings. </para>
        <para>Furthermore, your petitioners desire to draw the Government&#39;s attention to the hardship of many pensioner home owners caused by the high cost of maintenance. </para>
        <para>The Social Security Annual Report 1976-77 shows that 24.6 per cent, or 283,000 home owning pensioners, have a weekly income in excess of the pension of less than $6 per week. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners strongly urge the Commonwealth Government to establish a fund whereby loans can be made to means tested pensioners for the purpose of effecting necessary maintenance to their homes. Such a loan to be at minimal interest rates sufficient to cover administrative costs and to be repaid by the estate upon the death of a single pensioner before probate or upon the death of the surviving spouse in the case of married pensioners or where two pensioners jointly own the dwelling. Administration to be carried out by local government bodies. </para>

        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of Gunter Alfred Wilhelm Rose, respectfully showeth that since the introduction of Medibank, on July 1 1975, the German Insurance Companies have stopped paying their monthly contributions of DM 1 1 5 to German pensioners residing in Australia. This money was provided so that those people could privately insure themselves and pay for medical prescriptions. We note that our Australian health funds, HBA, ANA, Manchester Unity et cetera have to meet their liabilities. It is for this reason, that we protest that a foreign health fund should be exempt from meeting its liabilities, at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that our gracious Government and the Government of West Germany, will reach an amicable agreement which will justly foot the bill to the insurance company that received the premiums. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I refer him to the Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Bill 1978, introduced into the Queensland Parliament on 26 April. I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that, under this proposed legislation, the Queensland Government can amend the shire boundaries of Mornington Island and Aurukun, that after the formality of contact with the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs it can dissolve those councils unilaterally and that it can reserve areas within those shire boundaries for the purpose of mining. Furthermore, is it a fact that under that legislation, the Queensland Government retains full control over mineral exploration and development within those areas and that the by-law making authority of the councils can be modified by the views of co-ordinating and advisory committees set up in respect of each shire area and that three of the four members of each such committee are Government Ministers? Will the Prime Minister indicate in the firmest terms that this legislation is thoroughly unacceptable and further indicate to the Parliament what steps the Government has in mind and when it can make a full statement to the Parliament as to what action it will take to protect the rights of Aboriginal people at those two places? </para>

I only hope that I can assume a view from the Leader of the Opposition, and indeed all members of this Parliament, that what every person in this Parliament will be concerned with is the well being of the Aboriginal people and will not seek to make political points merely for the purpose of making such points. </para>

I shall discuss that matter with the honourable member later. May I simply say that the matter which he raised in this House earlier has been the subject of some discussions between myself and the Commission? There is a difference between myself and the Commission over the nature and extent of the Government&#39;s commitment made at the last election where the Commission believed that the promise to extend the free line plant entitlement from 12 kilometres to 16 kilometres should be with respect only to those areas which are programmed for conversion to automatic within two years or where there is already an automatic exchange. The Government&#39;s view is that the commitment should be fulfilled without qualification. I have put that view in writing to the  Chairman  of the Commission, and I await a reply. </para>

            <para>- I think the policies of the Government in relation to inflation, activity and employment are well known. We have stated on many occasions that if there is to be a long and sustained improvement in the Australian economy inflation must be overcome as a prerequisite to renewed confidence, renewed investment, renewed employment opportunities and a greater level of activity within Australia for Australian corporations, enterprises and farms. In recent days we have seen the very plain results- the very marked success- of that policy in consumer price index figures which are better than they have been for many, many years. That represents a very marked improvement and has been widely acclaimed throughout the community. I would have thought that the honourable gentleman would have been very much aware of that. </para>

          <para>I think it might be too early to comment on what has happened at the International Monetary Fund because I have not yet had a full report of that. The Treasurer may well have.

In its conclusions the report states in part: </para>

            <para>During the same period, the rate of inflation, which has been the main focus of policy attention, has been approximately halved and is now running at a rate of around 8 or 9 per cent.

              <para>- If the honourable gentleman asks a question for which he does not like the factual answer, so be it. He must have that on his own head. If the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had been aware of the consumer price index figures, which were released last week when that body was writing its report, I have no doubt that the report would have been much more favourable towards Australian policy than in fact it was. It needs to be understood that the report was issued against that background. </para>

          <para>The honourable member also asks me about the nature of discussions which were held with the Prime Minister of Japan and with other Japanese Ministers. I emphasised on a number of occasions that those discussions were not in relation to bilateral matters which, important as they are, had been discussed by a number of other Ministers, including the  Deputy  Prime Minister, and which will be resumed at the joint ministerial discussions which will take place in Australia in June. For the first time, the discussions with Japan were on the basis of the broader international economic issues and the broader international trade issues which we recognise as vastly important to Australia. Surely every honourable member in the House will know that Australia &#39;s task in achieving economic recovery will be so much easier if there is a general growth and expansion in world markets and world trade. Japan also is highly dependent upon trade and access to markets. The major focus of our discussions was the totality of what was happening in the world economic and trade scene. </para>
          <para>It is not unnatural that that should be so. This is because of the close relationships which exist between both countries, because of a close involvement with world trade and also because of a number of formal and informal discussions which will take place throughout this year which could well set the pattern for what happens in the world trade scene for the next 10 years or towards the end of this century. If the wrong decisions are taken at the Multilateral Trade Negotiations and if there is no progress on north-south issues in relation to the common fund, there will be increasing bitterness and increasing concern towards the end of the year which could lead to a much slower growth in world markets and to a much greater move towards protectionism, especially from the European Economic Community and maybe also from the United States of America. It was against the background of expressing the need and the importance of achieving results in these international forums that the discussions with the Prime Minister of Japan took place. I believe there is a remarkable identity of view and identity of concern between Japan and Australia. </para>

              <para>- I think the honourable gentleman might have given credit to his colleague, the honourable member for Adelaide, for asking a question which was important and which therefore deserves a considered reply. I am seeking to give him that reply. These matters are of concern to the Parliament. The Parliament and the shadow Minister who asked the question have a right to an answer. Australia and Japan have agreed to co-operate to the maximum extent in international forums. Where our officials are attending common meetings of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations or meetings of sub-groups of the MTN, there will be close liaison and close consultation. It was a Japanese suggestion that when the joint ministerial discussions take place next month in Australia a continuation of discussions and cooperation on the broader international issues should be high on the agenda so that the agenda will deal not only with bilateral issues which have broadly filled it on past occasions. I have no doubt that when those ministerial discussions take place, bilateral issues will have a very important and vital place. I think that the value of those ministerial discussions will be enhanced by Japan and Australia continuing the dialogue and deepening the co-operation on the broader international issues. </para>

          <para>It is vitally important to try to make the trade negotiations that have taken place this year a success. This is so on two counts: A success of the negotiations would prevent a reversion to protectionism amongst a number of countries and at the same time, not merely being content with that negative advantage, we could work towards positive results. The other point which Australia was stressing, and which I believed is accepted by Japan, was that to achieve positive results commodities and agriculture must be included. If honourable members look at the 40 per cent linear tariff reduction proposal, they will see that, in fact, it covers less than 20 per cent of world trade. We must exclude all the intra-European Economic Community trade. The proposal involves an average tariff of about 10 per cent from 1980 with a half per cent reduction each year. Nobody can really see that as providing the major expansion of markets or market opportunities that the world requires at the moment. If the negotiations are to be successful therefore, agriculture will have to be included, contrary to past occasions when agriculture has ended up by being excluded. Again, I believe that in these matters there is a remarkable identity of view between Japan and Australia. Knowing that, we can each work more effectively towards a responsible conclusion. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Prime Minister a question supplementary to that asked of him by the honourable member for Adelaide. Is it a fact that a report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in April of this year was intensely critical of the trade barrier policies of the Australian Government? Is it a fact that research work, especially that carried out by the Industries Assistance Commission, shows that Australia has the second highest average level of protection in the world? Does this imply that the Prime Minister intends to reduce dramatically the trade barriers which this country has erected? If so, will he indicate clearly the nature of the reductions and the areas where the reductions will fall? Futhermore, in view of his criticisms of the European Economic Community for not accepting Australian primary produce exports, can we expect that the same sort of barriers which exist against the importation of New Zealand dairy products and meats will be dramatically reduced and that a cause for complaint from countries such as Fiji about total prohibitions against the importation of sugar will be considered sympathetically? In short, is the Prime Minister recommending on a very short term basis a substantial and dramatic recasting of the protection policies of the Government? </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman has been in the forefront of the free trade movement in the Australian Labor Party. We know also that he was significantly responsible for that infamous Rattigan report in 1973 or 1974, which was going to indicate to what extent unemployment would be increased when tariffs were reduced by 25 per cent across the board. The present Leader of the Opposition connived with the then Prime Minister in keeping that report secret. I am advised that it was not even given to their colleagues during a Cabinet discussion. The report indicated plainly that unemployment would increase by tens of thousands. Quite plainly implicit in the honourable gentleman&#39;s question is a preparedness to adopt the same kinds of policies over again. Whether it will be Bellyache Bill or Unemployment Bill, I do not quite know. </para>

            <para>- The Government is very concerned about the increased evidence that has become available to it of abuse of social service benefits and allegations of abuses in the areas of social security benefits, health benefits and education allowances. It is utterly intolerable that people should wilfully defraud the system at the expense of other taxpayers in the community. The Government has given consideration to a number of measures. Indeed a number of actions have already been taken in the social security area to lessen the opportunity for fraud. A number of actions have also been taken in the health insurance area to uncover cases of fraud and to deal with them. However, the Government has decided to send officials overseas to cany out investigations of provisions that have been implemented in other countries to stop fraud and abuse. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Suggestions have been made that people who are receiving benefits should be identified as a means of reducing the possibility of fraud. The Government is not committed to that policy but it will be looking at what has been done in that regard in other areas. One thing that is certain is that the Government is not prepared to stand by and allow fraud and abuse to take place in the areas of social service benefits, health insurance arrangements and education allowances at the expense of the rest of the community. In other words, we are not going to allow a minority of the people to bludge on the majority. </para>

I will find out whether I can give to the honourable gentleman after Question Time a fuller answer than I am about to give. I can assure him that over a considerable period of time a number of government departments, including the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Resources, as it now is, and its predecessor departments, have been involved in an on-going fashion in analysing the economic implications to Australia of the development and sensible exploitation of our uranium reserves. I am sure that the honourable gentleman and other members of the House are aware of the number of projections that have been made in relation to the economic potential of Australia&#39;s uranium reserves. I shall make inquiries whether a more precise study of the kind referred to by the honourable member has been undertaken, and I shall advise him of my findings. I think the customary practice, of which the honourable member would be aware from his previous ministerial experience, is that a large number of the advisings of this character is properly confidential to government. In any event, I shall make further inquiries for him and let him know. </para>

            <para>- I do not suppose one could say that the Government has received the fullest co-operation from all Premiers in relation to the matter about which the honourable gentleman asks. But it is interesting to note that in the period before there was a prospect of State governments having access to income tax as a means of raising or lowering their own revenue they all very much wanted that proposition to be put into effect. They all said: &#39;We must have access to a major growth tax; that ought to be income tax. We need that so that we can be masters of our own houses and make our own decisions as sovereign State governments&#39;. My Government took very seriously indeed those expressed views of virtually all the States because we believe that they ought to make their own decisions and ought not to have the capacity to hide behind the broad statement that the Commonwealth does not provide enough money for this or for that. Therefore we are bringing forward legislation to implement Stage 2 of the tax sharing proposals. That legislation will be passed through the Parliament. Then it will be entirely the responsibility of the States to decide what they do with its provisions. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline>appealed to a number of other Premiers for support in his opposition to the proposals. He received a very short answer from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court who pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> knows as well as anyone else that the machinery the Commonwealth proposes is entirely at the discretion of the States. He also knows that the Commonwealth is committed to taxation reductions. Indeed, even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> in South Australia had made it plain that South Australia would not join in with the opposition of the New South Wales Government. But there is one thing that puzzles me about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran;</inline> he is always talking about more tax cuts and lower taxation. He says that he is an advocate of lower taxation. It is perfectly plain that under Stage 2 of our federalism proposals he would be able, if he wished, to offer all New South Wales taxpaying citizens a 1 per cent, 2 per cent, 3 per cent, 4 per cent, 5 per cent or whatever percent rebate that he wanted. As a result of the generosity of the general tax arrangements we have made with the States, he would be well able to do just that if he were really sincere in his wish to lower the taxation burden on the Australian people. </para>

            <para>- The implication in the question asked by the honourable member for Prospect, of course, is that every pensioner who enters a hospital will make a patient contribution. That, of course, is a blatant exaggeration. Let us put the question into perspective. All of the State Ministers for Health, all of their officials and my officials, as well as myself, have been looking at the prospect of ensuring that there is proper use of resources within the public hospital system. As the honourable member for Prospect would know, there are quite a number of nursing-home type patients in our public hospital system, and they are there because there is not adequate facility for them in nursing homes. Most of the State Ministers- indeed, most of the officials who have a responsibility for the administration of the hospital system- agree that such long-stay patients who would otherwise be in nursing homes should receive the Commonwealth benefit or a benefit from an insurance fund as a nursing home patient and that, therefore, the patient would make a contribution out of his or her pension towards that stay in hospital. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member might be interested to know that his counterparts in the New South Wales Labor Government are not averse to that idea. The honourable member might be like the Irishman who believes he is the only one in step. So quite clearly there is an awareness and a willingness on the part of most Ministers- indeed, all hospital administrators whom I have met- to recognise and to face up to the problem of ensuring that the resources of the hospital system are used to the best advantage and that the nursinghome type patients who are in hospital for longstay purposes make a contribution towards their board and lodging, as they would do if they were in a nursing home. </para>

            <para>-One thing which is important in any country is confidence both in the future and in what is happening. Just as that is important for a country as a whole, it is important also for a particular manufacturer. If statements that a particular firm is in trouble have any credibility, quite plainly they would affect the current sales of that firm. I am quite certain that <inline font-style="italic">recent sales by</inline> a notable motor manufacturer in South Australia would not be affected by statements by the Leader of the Opposition, because those statements in fact have no credibility. But that does not destroy the fact that statements of that kind are totally irresponsible and appalling. Those statements have been rejected by the company and by the South Australian Government through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran.</inline> I am not at all surprised that they were rejected by both, because such statements would affect the company and would affect employment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>These statements are typical of what we have come to expect from the Leader of the Opposition. We know quite well what he has been doing. He has been trying to talk down and destroy the value of the Australian dollar; he has been trying to talk down and destroy the position of Australia&#39;s balance of payments. Now, through his statements in relation to the Chrysler organisation, he is trying to talk down Australian investment and employment. No wonder the Austraiian Labor Party worries about a certain lack of support in some areas. I do not think Australians like a bunch of whingers or people who can only belly-ache from one day to the next. I refer the House to a report in which the Australian Labor Party was involved, which was prepared by a committee headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> Its secretary was one of the Labor Party&#39;s bright new members of Parliament, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Neal</inline> Blewett. </para>
          <para>In a brief report to the Executive a week ago <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Blewett</inline> said that the committee had identified a number of particular groups and areas which appeared vital to Labor&#39;s recovery. These were the peripheral States of Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. The areas which are considered vital to Labor&#39;s recovery are of course the areas in which Labor has no support at the moment. The report went on to state that rural voters, women voters, future trends amongst white collar voters, declining solidarity of blue collar working support and middle aged voters were the weakest cohorts for Labor. If the honourable gentlemen had tried to find a section of the Australian community where support for the Australian Labor Party was strong they would have had a blank piece of paper in front of them. It is no wonder that we have the constant belly-aching, which comes from the Leader of the Opposition, with no pride in Australia and no pride in Australia&#39;s nationalism. </para>

            <para>- I am not fully aware of the study to which the honourable gentleman refers. However, my Department has access to a number of studies and a quite considerable amount of information that leads one to believe that uranium mining has, in fact, increased the incidence of lung cancer. I responded to a question on notice from the honourable member for Prospect and provided him with what information was available to my Department. The honourable member will recall that when the Australian Labor Party Government was in office the Department of Health was instructed to draw up a code for the mining and milling of uranium ores and the Government regards that code as being probably the most advanced code of its type in the world. It was prepared in association with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and it draws upon the most modern scientific advice available and ensures that uranium mining in Australia will be undertaken in accordance with the strictest code that has ever been applied. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Whilst one would be foolish to assume that the mining of uranium is without danger- no mining occupation is free of danger- one would assume that as a result of the application of the code that was drawn up during the term of the former Labor Government and adopted by this Government the dangers and extent of lung cancer or any other type of cancer would be lessened. I will take the trouble to draw my Department&#39;s attention to the report referred to by the honourable member and let him know the Department&#39;s view in due course. </para>

            <para>-It is no secret that there have been differences between successive Australian governments and the Maltese Government over a number of aspects of our bilateral relationship. The Maltese Government feels that Australia should make significant contributions in the form of aid to Malta&#39;s economic development and the Maltese Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mintoff,</inline> has publicly criticised the Australian Government for allegedly refusing to receive high level delegations from Malta. Naturally the Australian Government regrets that these criticisms have been made in a highly charged public atmosphere and in a manner which, frankly, has served further to exacerbate the differences. The suggestion that Australia owes Malta assistance because of the contributions made to our development by large numbers of Maltese immigrants I find hard to accept. </para>

              <para>- It ought to be obvious. I recognise the interjector and I realise that he has no comprehension whatsoever of Australia&#39;s development assistance programs. Quite frankly, there are many countries that must be considered ahead of Malta in determining which country is to be the recipient of our large scale aid programs. We readily acknowledge the contribution of those who have come to Australia from Malta. Fine contributions have been made by the Maltese community in this country. I would be surprised if the members of that community thought that that ought to be the criterion for the determination of Australia&#39;s aid programs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mintoff</inline> has also drawn attention to the imbalance of bilateral trade in Australia&#39;s favour. Australia is a multilateral trader, as are most countries in the world, and we seek to balance our trade multilaterally. Nevertheless, I am informed that the Department of Trade and Resources is continuing to assist Maltese efforts to increase exports to Australia and to encourage Australian investment in Malta. </para>

We have indicated that we would have been pleased to receive a delegation at a more convenient time. Any suggestion that we rejected outright proposals for visits is quite incorrect. The Australian Government would like to see its relations with Malta restored to their former warmth. That is more likely to be achieved by quiet diplomacy than by a public exchange of grievances. Official channels exist for this to be done and it is to be hoped that they can be properly utilised. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Home Affairs. Is it a fact that before making a decision on the funding of the film <inline font-style="italic">The Unknown Industrial Prisoner,</inline> the Minister received a unanimous recommendation from the Australian Film Commission in favour of the funding? Why did the Minister ask the Commission to review its advice? Did the Commission provide a second report, supported by advice from two well known, highly successful commercial film producers, again recommending funding of the film on the grounds of both artistic and commercial viability? In view of this consistent, broadly based advice, on what grounds has the Minister decided to censor Film Australia? </para>

              <para>-Just a minute Little <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Echo;</inline> wait until the answer comes through. The fact is that under the Australian Film Commission Act one of my, perhaps, unenviable tasks is to approve of every film produced by Film Australia. That means, of course, that I have to give consideration to every film. In approaching that task I do not regard the Minister as being a rubber stamp and I do not think this House would expect me to be a rubber stamp. On the other hand I do not have a view that Film Australia cannot produce a feature film. If it wishes to produce a feature film that in itself is no basis for an objection to its doing so. Again, if it is going to produce a feature film which will be shown in public cinemas, there ought to be a special reason for its doing so instead of the private sector doing it. That is a consideration. I do not think the honourable gentleman would disagree with that proposition. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>If Film Australia feels that there are special reasons for making a feature film, it seems to me that if the purpose is to show the private industry that it can make a serious film on a serious subject and have it receive popular acclaim through the box office there ought to be a reasonable chance of its receiving such acclaim. Again I hope the honourable gentleman would not disagree with that proposition. I say at the outset that no so-called political censorship whatsoever was involved in this matter. I purposely did not see the script. I saw a synopsis of this film and throughout the whole matter I relied entirely on advice which was given to me by the Australian Film Commission or on documents supplied to me by the Commission. </para>

          <para>I pointed out at the beginning that I took the view- I stand by it- that for a feature film to be produced for public movie presentation there ought to be a reasonable chance of it being commercially acceptable through the box office. After looking at those documents I wrote to the  chairman  of Film Australia and asked the organisation to reconsider its decision. The Commission told me by the way that the film had been approved unanimously. It may have been approved unanimously in the sense that all those present at a meeting had approved it, but in fact one person was away at the time. He was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Burke</inline> who was present at the meeting after I asked the organisation to reassess it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Burke</inline> represents Roadshow Cinemas which is Australia&#39;s largest distribution organisation and one of Australia&#39;s largest exhibitors.

              <para>-Those remarks of the honourable member for Denison are absolutely accurate. The people of Australia should be reminded that the aura of responsibility of the current Leader of the Opposition is a mere facade. This is shown by direct reference to his performance when the Australian Labor Party Government was in power. As a senior Minister in the Whitlam Labor Government, he must share responsibility for all its disastrous policies. More specifically, as Minister for Social Security, he initiated massive increases in health and welfare expenditure which the nation could illafford. In 1972-73, expenditure on health and welfare was $2.88 billion. By 1975-76, this expenditure had expanded to $8 billion. Of more significance, expenditure on health and welfare, as a share of total government expenditure, expanded from 28.3 per cent in 1972-73 to 36.7 per cent by 1975-76. The Leader of the Opposition also engineered the Medibank rip-off which created an environment for the massive explosion in health costs. Then, as Treasurer, he expanded Government spending by 23 per cent. </para>

              <para>-The Leader&#39;s performance, as demonstrated by his statement on the car industry, is essentially negative and destructive, out of touch with reality and out of touch with the Australian people. He has sacrificed Australia&#39;s national interest in the pursuit of a partisan political interest. This statement on the car industry follows earlier encouragement of speculation with regard to Australia&#39;s exchange rate for the dollar. That was roundly condemned as disgraceful behaviour on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. However, notwithstanding the continuing story of gloom and despair that the Leader has been telling ever since he was banished to the Opposition benches by the Australian people, he has failed to make any impact either inside or outside the Parliament with his attacks on the policies of the Fraser Government. As successive months and quarters pass, the Fraser Government&#39;s economic strategy has been demonstrated by the available statistics to be absolutely correct. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Having failed to make any impact in dealing with policies, the Leader turned to buckettipping, firstly concerning the stand of the Prime Minister over computer contracts, and secondly over the legitimate business interests of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. But these merely compounded the Leader&#39;s failure to make any impact on the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Hence, hoping that people outside Parliament would be, perhaps, more gullible, he embarked on what he called a &#39;get-to-know&#39; campaign. The first &#39;get-to-know&#39; exercise was a visit to the Ford Motor Company&#39;s plant at Broadmeadows. On the completion of that visit he made a totally unjustified attack on the Fraser Government&#39;s manufacturing industry policy, with particular reference to motor vehicle manufacturing. During his statement to the assembled Press conference he blithely announced that one manufacturer had his back against the wall and might well go under and that it was inconceivable that the Government should allow several thousand people directly and indirectly to suffer without further government intervention. Other comments by the Leader made it plain that he was referring to Chrysler Australia Ltd, based in the electorate of Kingston in Adelaide. Apart from anything else, such a statement outside an opposition company&#39;s plant reveals the man&#39;s ignorance. In addition to owing Chrysler an apology, the leader owes the Ford Motor Company an apology for causing it such embarrassment. </para>
          <para>I am not sure about the nature of this so-called get-to-know&#39; campaign of the Leader. If it is meant to be that the Leader is aiming at getting to know more about, for example, the motor vehicle industry, he has more to learn than a Leader of the Opposition should have to learn. On the other hand, if the &#39;get-to-know&#39; campaign is aimed at management in industry getting to know him, I can assure him that from the reaction following his statement, management in the vehicle industry has absolutely no wish to know him. The Leader has revealed complete ignorance of the motor vehicle industry, and he has not even done it with eloquence, rather with partisanly motivated political malice. It was Hayden &#39;s clanger, as one newspaper headline termed it. </para>
          <para>In particular, the Leader is ill informed about Chrysler&#39;s current position and future prospects, which I will mention in a few moments. Equally amazing was his demand for further heavyhanded government intervention. Motor vehicle manufacturing in Australia is basically sound and is improving its position. It has overcome many of its problems, although some remain to be tackled. Since coming to office the Fraser Government has adopted a consistent approach to this industry. The history of the industry highlights the folly of government intervention and control in private enterprise. It is incomprehensible that the Leader, like Oliver Twist, should ask for more. </para>
          <para>The policies of the Fraser Government at three levels have gone a long way towards overcoming the industry&#39;s problems. These policies, widely known and well supported in the community, need only brief summary in today&#39;s debate. Firstly, the Government&#39;s overall approach to economic management has stabilised costs in industry and restored confidence, as once again demonstrated in the recent consumer price index figures. Secondly, polices of more specific benefit to manufacturing industry, such as the investment allowance, have further assisted this important sector of the economy. The Government&#39;s White Paper on manufacturing industry clearly points the way to the future and directs attention to modernisation and the need for the restructuring of industry. The Crawford Committee will produce recommendations for government action in this regard. </para>
          <para>At the third level the Fraser Government, soon after coming to office, instituted a policy of 85 per cent local content for vehicle manufacturers in Australia, combined with a 45 per cent tariff on imported vehicles and parts. This lower local content allows manufacturers to rationalise the source of their components and to become more competitive against imported vehicles. The industry has been further supported by the institution of quotas, reserving 80 per cent of the local market for local manufacturers. Hence, at three levels the Government has provided a consistent approach to establish a prosperous environment in which the motor vehicle industry can nourish in the future. </para>
          <para>The Leader well knows that the Government has been pursuing policies of significant benefit to motor vehicle manufacturers. Only six months ago he stated in this very House with reference to Ford Australia that motor vehicle manufacturers were being generously treated by the Fraser Government. He accused the Ford Company then of remitting excessive profits to its parent Company in the United States. At that time he sought Government intervention in the form of a special tax to hinder that profitability. Now, only six months later, he would have us believe that the motor vehicle industry is in such dire straits that it needs extra Government intervention to help it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brian</inline> Inglis, Managing Director of Ford Australia, had to correct the leader&#39;s ignorance six months ago. Ian Webber,  Deputy Chairman  of Chrysler, and Des Corcoran,  Deputy  Premier of South Australia and a Labor Party colleague, has had to correct the Leader&#39;s ignorance on this more recent occasion. Of course, this complete about-face within the short space of six months reveals the Leader&#39;s attitude on both occasions for what it is, namely a thinly disguised partisan political sham which totally destroys his credibility. The Leader knows that the Government&#39;s policies are correct and are leading to prosperity in the industry. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member for Adelaide had better be careful with his interjections, because I know what the industry thinks of his policies and attitudes. The continuing problems of the industry are not a consequence of Government policy but of other factors. Some of those factors the Leader of the Opposition ought to be able to do something about if his concern for the industry is genuine. A major continuing problem of the industry is industrial unrest. That has been reflected in a variety of ways recently, such as in the recent demand for a wage increase of $25 a week by the trade unions involved in the motor industry; the attempt by the Vehicle Building Employees Federation to usurp the role of management to determine employment in the industry; the Victorian power strike, which hindered productivity for motor vehicle manufacturers; and continuing industrial sabotage which occurs in motor vehicle manufacturing plants. The Leader would much better serve the interests of the industry if he used his influence to establish a more rational attitude among his Labor movement colleagues in the car industry unions.  His  misleading statements about the state of the industry are only detrimental to its future prosperity. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In general, and with particular reference to Chrysler Australia, the Leader&#39;s statements are misleading and irresponsible. Ian Webber, the  Deputy Chairman  of Chrysler, summarised what ought to be the attitude of this House to those statements when he said: &#39; Hayden &#39;s remarks are not worthy of comment except to say that they undermine confidence in the Australian car industry, with consequent effects on employment and economic recovery&#39;. The honourable member for Adelaide, who is shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce, ought equally to be condemned for statements that he made on a recent radio talk-back program when he criticised multinational companies on the basis that Detroit was making a decision to close down a plant in Australia. The impact on confidence in Adelaide, which is already struggling under the millstone of the Dunstan Government, is clear from its effect on retail stores. I understand that Myer&#39;s sales were down $330,000 in the week following the Leader&#39;s blatant misrepresentation of Chrysler&#39;s situation. So the fact is that the broad consequences of his statement highlighted the Leader&#39;s irresponsibility on the basis of his being so inaccurate. </para>
          <para>The plain fact is that Chrysler is functioning successfully. Its initiative in developing the Sigma, the best new car on the Australian market for years, has guaranteed Chrysler&#39;s continued viability in Australia. That is demonstrated by reference to sales figures for the Sigma. In January 1085 were sold, in February 1820, in March 1966, and in April 2375, demonstrating a dramatic and continuing improvement in sales for the product. That statement is further enhanced when one notes that in March there were 2 1 selling days and therefore average sales were 94 a day, and in April, with only 19 selling days, average sales were 125 a day. So in the space of just one month sales of the Sigma increased by one-third. Strength of that sort in the marketplace is hardly the showing of a manufacturer who is going to the wall, as the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe. </para>
          <para>The impact on the market of the Scorpion sports sedan and the Sigma station wagon is yet to be experienced. Chrysler expect a demand for some 300 to 400 Scorpions a month, whilst normally one station wagon is sold for every two sedans. On the basis of current trends and its projections Chrysler confidently expects a vast increase in sales. In fact, the company believes that it will achieve easily its initial sales projection of 30,000 vehicles a year for the Sigma. Indeed, in South Australia in March Chrysler ranked second in sales to General-Motors Holden, outselling Ford and, as this advertisement I hold states, it is now pursuing the General as it heads for market leadership in the Australian motor vehicle market. </para>

              <para>- He is always knocking South Australia. He knocks Chrysler quite often too. The successful market impact of the Sigma will be multiplied with the release of the new model Valiant. The Valiant has been significantly upgraded, with improved suspension and handling and an electronic lean burn ignition system which will give pre-emission control fuel economy for that motor car. </para>

              <para>- It will have good tyres too. It will be a good motor vehicle and will make a significant impact on the market. This vehicle has been well received in the motoring Press and should achieve a substantial market share. Chrysler also has other new products in the pipeline which for security reasons obviously it has not yet made public. So the company&#39;s market prospects are extremely healthy. </para>

          <para>Chrysler&#39;s investment program further gives the lie to the Leader&#39;s claims. In the last two years, $45m has been invested in getting the Lonsdale engine plant under way to produce locally the renowned Astron 2-litre engine. There also has been investment in plant to produce the Sigma at an 85 per cent local content level. Negotiations are continuing for equity investment by the Japanese Mitsubishi organisation which will further strengthen the company&#39;s capital base. Mitsubishi is hardly likely to consider investing in a venture that is going to the wall. Chrysler has also won substantial outside contracts for the supply of goods to the motor industry. For example, it has a $20m contract over 5 years with the Nissan company to supply engine blocks and engine parts. Certainly there has been a retrenchment of 1002 employees at Chrysler this financial year, but if the Leader of the Opposition thinks that that reflects the impending closure of the plant, that highlights his ignorance of the industry. </para>
          <para>Over the period of those retrenchments, production at Chrysler&#39;s plant increased from 160 units a day to 166 units a day. Chrysler has commendably directed its attention to rationalisation for more efficient and economic production to ensure its survival as an Australian manufacturer. The need for rationalisation and efficiency is something about which the Leader of the Opposition often makes statements, and he is to be commended for that. Rationalisation and improved productivity are essential for the survival of the motor vehicle industry in Australia. Having preached that, the Leader of the Opposition can hardly claim that its occurrence indicates the company is going to the wall and still retain his credibility. </para>

              <para>- He has no credibility at all, as the honourable member for Denison says. The employment situation also reflects changes in the model mix as a result of consumer preference for 4-cylinder cars. The Leader&#39;s irresponsible statements, by destroying confidence in the Valiant, will have hastened the shift to 4-cylinder vehicles and therefore further damaged employment in the industry. </para>

            <para>- My sin is not what I said but the fact that I exposed the Government&#39;s deficiency in another area of national economic responsibility, another serious defect in government administration. The motor vehicle industry in this country today is a potential disaster area. If it is to be saved substantially, it requires much more off-setting action than the Government has given any indication that it is prepared to undertake. I make no apology for criticising shortcomings in government administration wherever I see them. That is my responsibility. Should I fail to do that I fail in my responsibility not only to my party but also to the Australian community. I go further than that. I have consistently outlined the sorts of things that we will undertake when we are in government to expand the economy in a moderate and carefully controlled way so that the sort of malaise which is debilitating it now can be overcome. Inflation could be brought down consistent with an improvement in the unemployment situation and a pick-up in business activity. I repeat that I make no apologies for being a consistent critic where I believe that criticism is justified, and I will continue to do so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Moreover, having made criticisms on major points, and in spite of the fact that in a craven way the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> seeks to invoke national responsibility and suggest that there is some lack of patriotism involved in raising these matters, I am reassured to find that I have been proved consistently correct. I pointed out in 1976, and I might say that I did it with a great deal of melancholy, that unless the Government took immediate action the rapid deterioration in our external balance would become a very serious matter. I predicted that it was inevitable, through neglect, that there would be a substantial devaluation. I did that not because I wanted to- I believe that I had sat quietly for too long and had forsaken my responsibility in this matter- but because I recognised that action would have to be taken. I was not the only person to say it publicly, and that is lost sight of. </para>
          <para>I was somewhat flattered to hear all of the credit extended to me by Government spokesmen as to how much power I have over the community when I make a comment on economic matters. One would think that a comment from me alone is enough to change the whole economic destiny of this country. But I was helped by one other person. The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> made a similar comment at about the same time, and let us bear that in mind because it is on record. He pointed out the weakness of the balance of payments and the problems which were arising as a consequence of that. I was proved right then and I was justified in taking the action that I did, the sort of action that comes from the sheer frustration of recognising that this country is administered by a totally incompetent group of people who do not understand even fundamental economic principles. </para>
          <para>The cost of this Government&#39;s administration is too great to bear. The cost in the coming year of lost production in this country as a result of the Government&#39;s economic policies will be of the order of $6,000m, and to that can be added the cost of unemployment benefits of about $ 1,500m. I would have thought that the reports this morning of the International Monetary Fund would have a rather sobering influence on any thinking group in the community. There is no evidence that the warning heralded by the International Monetary Fund has yet reached or will ever reach this Government. It is determined to drive this country deeper down the vortex of depression. I indicated that the wages-prices freeze taken on so impulsively by the Prime Minister in that conventional style of his that unnerves so many thinking people in the community, and even the few of them among his own Ministers, would be aborted in a very short time, and it was aborted in six weeks. I make no apologies for pointing that out either. Similarly, I pointed out early last year that our external account was in a weakening position and that the Government ought to move to borrow overseas, to revalue gold, and to make a firm statement as to its intent in regard to the protection of the Australian dollar. I believe now, as I believed then- I have believed this consistently in the intervening period- that if that had been done confidently and firmly by means of a comprehensive statement we would not have the problems that we are facing today in relation to the external account. It was the grudging and the unsure way in which the Government approached this matter which led to uncertainty in the community generally. </para>
          <para>I am not alone in raising this issue. The honourable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chapman)</inline> has raised it in the Parliament today. If he is concerned about the financial viability of Chrysler Australia Ltd, I pose one simple question to him: Why has he raised the matter in this Parliament? Is he as hypocritical as his colleagues who in 1976 condemned me for raising the likelihood, or the inevitability, to put it more properly, of a devaluation. Those honourable members rose in this Parliament and said: &#39;That is the sort of thing which will undermine the Australian dollar&#39;. They did the very thing that they claimed was wrong. It is being done again. There is the culprit. It is the honourable member for </para>
          <para>Chrysler, as he is generally known in the community, the honourable member for Kingston, who raised this matter today. If he were genuinely concerned about the financial strength of Chrysler, he would not have raised it. It is nothing more than political posturing. He has seen the opportunity to grab a platform and he has sought to make a little bit of mileage out of it. </para>
          <para>The other observation I want to make- it is highly pertinent to do so when discussing these matters- is that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has not joined in this debate. He never does. He is quite adept at Question Time at ignoring the questions which are directed to him, rambling widely and irrelevantly in his answers; but when it comes to defending his own Government he will never, if it is possible to avoid doing so, face up to that challenge in the Parliament. I ask honourable members to reflect on all of the occasions in the two years- 1976 and 1977- when motions of great importance, going to the very heart of the integrity and standing of this Government, were raised in the Parliament. I refer to matters of public importance and motions of censure against the Government. Inevitably the Prime Minister sought to absent himself from the Parliament. He is no debater. He has no confidence in his ability to mobilise an argument in defence of what the Government is doing. I must say that it would take much more than reasonable average ability to be able to do that. </para>
          <para>I say that I am not the only person who is expressing concern about the motor vehicle industry. As the honourable member for Chrysler does not care to take on board seriously my views, let us look at what the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> had to say recently. It said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As is now well known 1977 turned out to be an abysmal year, -   for the motor car industry &#39; can be added-   . . the worst for the industry in five years, and culminated in the biggest loss ever recorded by a motor company in Australia when Chrysler posted a deficit of $27.8 million and the first loss ($8.4 million) ever recorded by General MotorsHolden &#39;s since it began manufacture in the 1940s. </para>
            <para>If the same conditions prevail for the remainder of 1978 the industry will be in dire straits. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am quoting nothing more than what informed commentators are saying publicly: The motor car industry in Australia is a potential disaster area. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Chrysler must have been chewing poppy seeds before he prepared his speech. He threw away such classic lines as: &#39;The motor vehicle industry is sound and improving&#39;; and: &#39;The Government&#39;s approach will allow the motor vehicle industry to flourish in future&#39;; and &#39;Government policies are correct and are leading to prosperity in the industry&#39;. No one else believes that, least of all the people in the industry- either the industrialists or the members of the industrial movement. Let me again read from an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> in March of this year. Speaking specifically about Chrysler, it said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>All the indications are that it will be a most expensive funeral for at least one vehicle builder. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was said long before I made the comment I made. I shall come in a few seconds to the comment I made. Before I do that, let me indicate to the honourable member that the people who work in the industry are gravely alarmed. About 250,000 jobs directly and indirectly are dependent upon the health of the motor vehicle industry. It is particularly sick now. Employees in the industry are wanting action. People in the honourable member&#39;s own electorate who are employed by Chrysler, employed in the industry, have so much confidence in him and in his ability to understand their problems and the problems of the industry that when they came here a fortnight ago making representations on behalf of their industry to Opposition members, seeking us to raise the matter in order to get the Government to take some action, they indicated to Opposition members that they would have no truck or that they would have no communication with the honourable member for Chrysler, because they do not believe that so far he has been able to represent them adequately, or the industry effectively. So much for the standing of the honourable member for Chrysler! </para>

          <para class="block">So much for all the prosperity; so much for the solid basis upon which the Government seeks to establish a motor vehicle industry in this country. The industry has been set back, and set back severely. Chrysler&#39;s loss in 1977 was expressed in terms of the number of vehicles sold falling by in excess of 4,000. Every motor car manufacturer today is suffering the problem of idle capacity. Every motor vehicle manufacturer today is enduring the problem of stock-piling, of production that cannot be sold. If the honourable member thinks that things are so good, let me now quote from an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> I quote these sources to indicate that it is not me alone who has all this power over the thinking of the community. There are informed people outside who see through the patent hypocrisy of members of the Government as they posture about on great issues such as the motor vehicle industry and its depressed condition and who recognise that the Government is doing nothing more than posturing and that there is a need for action. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> had this to say about Chrysler&#39;s financial results:  . . increased costs due to abnormally high stock inventories, depressed consumer confidence and buyer resistance to unavoidable price increases. </para>
          <para class="block">Everything that I have been saying is on record. One of the problems with the motor car industry, taking on board the article to which I just referred, is the enormous increase in the cost of a motor vehicle. In 1975 the average motor vehicle cost the equivalent of 35 weeks&#39; average weekly earnings. In 1978 it is expected a motor vehicle will cost 45 weeks&#39; average weekly earnings. That is a substantial increase. It is a 30 per cent increase in the cost of a motor vehicle. No wonder people are not buying. Buyer resistance is settling in. One of the major influences in the cost of motor vehicles being pushed up is the very high cost involved in companies carrying idle capital equipment and carrying at very high cost production which is being stock-piled. </para>
          <para>I come to my comments in Melbourne. What I said was that the industry was in difficulties and that, in the absence of government action to assist the industry, one manufacturer could- I repeat, could- go to the wall. Action must be taken. I recommend that there should be a substantial and permanent reduction in the rate of tax imposed on motor vehicle sales in this country. Reducing the cost of motor vehicles is one of the effective ways by which these motor vehicles could be moved out of stockpile, production could pick up again and jobs could be guaranteed. That is what I am arguing. </para>
          <para>I am arguing also that government can, as we did when we were in government, take a number of specific measures to guarantee the viability of an organisation such as Chrysler. Chrysler is about to go into a joint venture with the Mitsubishi organisation. I challenge the Government to deny that it is considering, as a special concession to Chrysler and Mitsubishi, a reduction in the Australian content plan; that is, there will be a greater proportion of imported equipment at the expense of Australian jobs. That way sales might go up temporarily, but the number of jobs will go down and ultimately the recession will be far worse. </para>

            <para>-The motion draws attention to statements made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and censures him for his mischievous and misleading public statements. He has repeated them today. He has added to them. He is creating even greater difficulties for the industry about which he claims he is concerned. He criticised the honourable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chapman)</inline> for raising the matter in this House. The Leader of the Opposition is the one who initiated the debate and caused and exaggerated the difficulty being faced by the car industry. He seeks to be a prophet of doom and then to bring about the doom and gloom which he phophesied. He is critical of those people who want to draw to the attention of the public the irresponsibility of his actions. </para>

          <para>In the last statement he made this afternoon, when he suggested that a solution to the problem would be a reduction in the rate of sales tax imposed on motor cars, he was again creating mischief because as a result of that statement speculation will run through the community. He, as Leader of the Opposition, has put forward this suggestion. As a result of his actions car sales over the next few weeks could fall significantly. The Leader of the Opposition was a member of a government which undertook a series of actions which were damaging to the motor car industry and other industries. The Leader of the Opposition was a member of a government which reduced tariffs by 25 per cent. He was a member of a government which took that action in the face of a report which indicated that there would be a substantial reduction in employment as a consequence of that action. He now makes statements concerning the established motor car manufacturers in Australia, indicating that one manufacturer in particular in his view could be in difficulty. </para>
          <para>What he fails to do now is what he failed to do when he was a party to the tariff reduction of 25 per cent, namely, to understand the implications of his statements to a significant, settlement region area of employment. If we look at the consequences of the 25 per cent tariff reduction we find that unemployment was increased in a number of small settlements, in country towns, in Tasmania and in other areas away from the major cities of Melbourne and Sydney where there were no or very few alternative job opportunities. In calling into question the viability of the motor car manufacturers of Australia and in pointing in particular to Chrysler Australia, whose one industrial plant in Australia is in South Australia, the Leader of the Opposition is undermining the economic viability of metropolitan Adelaide and of South Australia generally. This is one of the most serious consequences of his statements. This indicates that this House would be quite justified in declaring those statements to be utterly and completely mischievous. The difficulty which his statements could cause in metropolitan Adelaide is of very great proportions. He, along with the South Australian Government, is slowly- and, in more recent times, quickly- taking away the confidence of private industry. </para>

              <para>- They cannot deny those facts. All the statistics indicate that the industrial base of South Australia and of Adelaide in particular is being seriously weakened now by a combination of the actions of the Leader of the Opposition here and of Dunstan, the South Australian Premier. </para>

          <para>If we look at the employment figures for South Australia we find that there has been an astounding drop in employment in manufacturing industry. Although this reflects in part an Australiawide trend, the drop in employment in South Australia has been accentuated by the actions of Labor politicians, in particular by supporters of the South Australian Dunstan Government. The disappearing confidence which is being brought about by that Government is being accentuated by the activities of the Leader of the Opposition, who has failed to appreciate and understand the regional implications of his statements. </para>
          <para>On the other hand, the Fraser Government has recognised the importance of regions and in its amendments to legislation concerning the Industries Assistance Commission has required that body, in examining any tariff changes, to take account of the impact on employment in significant population settlements- a unique, new and significant move. The efforts of such a body could be brought to nought by irresponsible statements such as those which we recently heard from the Leader of the Opposition. He, along with his colleagues in the South Australian Parliament, is creating a serious situation for South Australia. Recently an article entitled &#39;Spartans are at Adelaide&#39;s walls&#39;, appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review.</inline> The article stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>South Australia is facing an industrial slow down, highlighted by slack investment, losses or retrenchments in the vital whitegoods area and acres of unsold new cars. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In recent weeks we have found the Leader of the Opposition accentuating the causes of those problems and supporting the irresponsible activities of the South Australian Labor Government, which is bringing about the loss of confidence of business leaders in metropolitan Adelaide, a flight of capital and a significant movement of people away from metropolitan Adelaide and, as a result, is causing not only a down turn in the industries directly affected but also a significant fall in job opportunities in related industries as far afield as the housing industry. </para>
          <para>Let me return to the article in question which appeared recently not only in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> as a report by Christopher Jay but also in papers in metropolitan Adelaide. It is important that the people of South Australia realise that their past prosperity is being destroyed by the Dunstan Government and that the destruction by that Government of the economic viability of a community of 800,000 to 1,000,000 people is being promoted by the gloom and doom of the Leader of the Opposition. Let us look at what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jay</inline> had to say about the housing industry in South Australia. Reporting on a recent conference which had been held, he spoke of papers which had been presented at that conference, and which contained projections of reduced housing demand in various parts of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jay</inline> referred to a conversation with an official of the South Australian Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jay</inline> reported: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But when the results were being digested later in the day, one South Australian official confided cheerfully that on some projections Adelaide hardly needed to be building any new houses at all at present. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This prophet of doom, having pointed the bone at Chrysler Australia Ltd, will now set about with the same missionary zeal he displayed in his forecasts of doom in relation to devaluation and our overseas balances, to bring in reality the death of that organisation. Insofar as he achieves that goal the implications for metropolitan Adelaide and the people of South Australia are vast indeed. The time is coming fast when those people must recognise that the Leader of the Opposition and his socialist colleagues in the Government of South Australia are destroying the lifestyle that the people of South Australia have enjoyed since the Liberal Government was in office in that State. </para>
          <para>It is important that the people of South Australia appreciate that the typical socialist technique is to apply the tourniquet treatment. Let me illustrate this by drawing the attention of the House to the State Labor Government&#39;s promotion of so-called industrial democracy. The hard liners in the Labor Government of South Australia would compulsorily have union and Government representatives on boards, leaving the shareholder representatives in a minority. Every now and again the Premier tries to call people together and say: &#39;Look, we do not really mean what we say&#39;. That releases the tourniquet for a while. People relax but the tourniquet is not fully released. In a few months the Premier again will make a statement which is consistent with his party&#39;s policies. So, as a result of those statements and of the concern they cause amongst industrial leaders and business enterprises in South Australia, those enterprises go not off-shore but off-State. They leave South Australia. They move their headquarters to other States. Perhaps the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> who I heard interjecting earlier, would not mind this because he is pursuing his own vested interests. He would like to see an expansion of the enterprises of the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd and he knows that they will expand if he can encourage the Leader of the Opposition to prophesy doom concerning Chrysler&#39;s manufacturing plant in South Australia. Let members of the Labor Party deny that a possible conspiracy can be assumed from the irresponsible statements made by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>In South Australia manufacturing industry has been a very significant employer of labour but over recent years, as a result of the policies of the Dunstan Government, job opportunities in manufacturing industry have declined rapidly. The slack has been taken up to some extent by government employment and South Australia has the highest percentage of government employees of any State. But that situation has been brought about because of the temporary availability of the proceeds of the sale of the State&#39;s railways. There is not much more of the farm that can be sold, nor are there any buyers who would pay the sort of price that Whitlam paid for those railways. Of the South Australian Government &#39;s Budget of $ 1 , 171m, an amount of $5 30m is spent on salaries. The  Deputy  Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran,</inline> recently said that a number of new factories and businesses had been established in South Australia in the last 12 months. I call upon him to give a detailed list of the names and number of employees of those industrial establishments. I call upon him also to identify the number of establishments which have closed or which have reduced their work forces. I am concerned to know that in recent weeks surveys are tending to indicate that the number of job opportunities available in manufacturing industry in metropolitan Adelaide has been declining rapidly. This situation is becoming permanent. </para>

              <para>- As my colleague says, the jobs are going interstate. They are being replaced by machines and capital is leaving also simply because in South Australia we have a socialist Government which enters and takes over industry. The South Australian Government has expanded its insurance corporation; it has entered the clothing hardware industry and it has indirectly entered other industries, through the mechanism of the State Bank of South Australia and the Savings Bank of South Australia, by imposing non-banking conditions on the circumstances under which loans will be made available. It is time we recognised that the statements of the Leader of the Opposition are causing mischief to the development and expansion of South Australia and that he has conspired in this action, either directly or indirectly, with his colleagues in the State Government. The sooner this House recognises that the industrial viability of metropolitan Adelaide is threatened by members of the Labor Party, the sooner it can adopt policies which will ensure that Adelaide can continue to expand and to provide the opportunities for employment and lifestyle that the people of that State, through their hard work in the past, deserve now and in the future. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">South Australia. I must say that if my name were Ian Cameron Bonython Wilson I would also be a little disturbed about a Labor government in South Australia. The Australian Labor Party does not have to rebut the statements made about the Government of South Australia. The electorate of South Australia does that very convincingly every three years when a substantial number of South Australians overwhelmingly return the Dunstan Government to administer that State. We do have a very good lifestyle in South Australia. For 1 3 years- after the next election it will be 16 years- the Dunstan Government has given South Australians a lifestyle which I believe is superior to the lifestyle of people in any other part of Australia, especially those who have to live under the regime in Queensland. </para>
          <para>This is an extremely interesting debate. The honourable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chapman)</inline> has introduced a censure motion dealing with the Government&#39;s concern that someone should say something about the car industry which in one way or another may be interpreted to mean that the car industry is not going all that well and that the Government may have to take further action in relation to the industry. We should all be shocked and surprised that a leading politician in this country should say something about one of the major employers in Australia. There are very few bigger employers in Australia than in the automotive and associated industries. But we are all to remain silent about them. No one is to say anything about them. The National Country Party can bleat all day about the beef industry and Government supporters can do all they like for the lawyers and doctors but we on this side of the House are not to say anything at all for the employees of the automotive and associated industries. A very strange- although it is becoming quite traditional- attitude is taken by the media in this country to whoever holds the position of Leader of the Opposition or Leader of the Australian Labor Party. For ten years the monopolised media in this country utilised its enormous power, a power not allowed in any other country, to try to destroy one of the finest politicians in this country- Gough Whitlam. Now they have started on Bill Hayden. Bill Hayden raises a question about the future of the car industry. All of a sudden Rupert Murdoch locked up in New York and Warwick Fairfax sitting out on Double Bay with his quarter of a million dollars handout from John Fairfax and Co. become very disturbed, because Bill Hayden asked the question. It does not matter whether anybody on the Government side of the House raises the matter. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Sturt talked about the car industry. There have been so many plans for the car industry that those of us who have been here long enough are getting dizzy from talking about it. The honourable member for Kingston said in one of his strange statements that the car industry does not want anything to do with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and that it has completely debarred any further discussion with him. I carry with me this week an invitation from Chrysler Australia Ltd and General Motors-Holden&#39;s Ltd to shadow spokesmen on this side of the House, together with the Leader of the Opposition, to meet with the management to talk about the future of the car industry. Things are going on in the car industry about which employees and the Opposition in this Parliament are entitled to know. We are not going to be made silent by the honourable member for Chrysler coming in here and asking that we carry a motion of censure against the Leader of the Opposition for discussing an industry that has as its responsibility the employment of something like 100,000 people. We are talking about an industry that at the moment is producing a smaller number of vehicles than it did two years ago. On the figures that were predicted two years ago, the Australian car industry would have 80 per cent of a market of something like 620,000 units in 1978. That is small enough by world standards. A few years ago there would have been three manufacturers splitting up 80 per cent of 620,000 vehicles. Today, because of the Government&#39;s car plan we will have in Australia five manufacturers producing 80 per cent, not of 620,000 units, but according to Chrysler&#39;s predictions 530,000 units. So the total domestic market is getting smaller and an increased number of manufacturers is coming into the field to supply the Australian domestic market. Obviously it is a ground for trouble. It is the ground for trouble in the original plan that was adopted. </para>
          <para>I say again that to have such a small domestic market with the number of manufacturers that has now been invited under the protective umbrella of the Australian scheme is a recipe for problems. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has said, all the problems have not been thrashed out and there will be greater trouble unless the Government sits down and is honest with all the industry and with all the representatives of the employees. For this statement, the newspaper proprietors and the Government go almost insane. They say: &#39;How dare you say anything about the motor industry? You can talk about the neutron bomb or the beef industry or anything you like but do not start speculation about the car industry&#39;. </para>
          <para>Just two and a half weeks ago a representative group of nine employees came to Canberra to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch. Mr Lynch</inline> was very good; he gave them an hour and a half in which to discuss the problems of Chrysler. The main objection of the employees of Chrysler is that they are being left out in the dark. They do not know what will happen. Chrysler used to work with 4,500 employees. Now it is working with 2,500 employees. </para>

              <para>- They want to know what is going on. This is the way in which the multinationals operate. The honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> is quite right. The Australian people are just strung along by the way these people operate. Chrysler Australia says: We cannot tell you, we are not involved; it is Chrysler Detroit with Mitsubishi which is involved&#39;. So the people in Detroit are talking with the people in Tokyo about what will happen to the people who live in Adelaide. Now we are not supposed to say anything in the National Parliament about it. Honourable members opposite can sit around playing the role of the mute on these questions but they can rest assured that we are going to speak out on the questions which are alive- the political and industrial questions which are of major consequence to the people of Australia. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We think that it is only decent that the companies involved, Chrysler and Mitsubishi, should tell not only the employees but also the Australian Government- and the Australian Government should make it clear to everybody in Australia- what will happen. No single attitude has been adopted by the car industry. If we talk to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brian</inline> Inglis or Ian Webber or the people from the various industries, they will all give us their lines. There are five manufacturers and they will adopt on occasions five separate lines towards the industry. We cannot sit down and talk on the basis of one group attitude. Nissan and Toyota, the latest additions to the car plan, have a totally different attitude to what they want of Australia than does GMH and Ford. Chrysler is somewhere in between. </para>
          <para>We know, as does everybody who examines the car industry, that changes will have to be made. But why should we make the workers of Chrysler, Ford or GMH the sacrificial lambs? </para>
          <para class="block">The honourable member for Kingston asks why the workers in the car industry are asking for more money. He says they are only causing industrial unrest. </para>
          <para>It may interest members of the national Parliament to know- these things are sometimes a little foreign to us- that when the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, and I visited Ford two weeks ago, we sat around a table for a bit over an hour with 10 employees of Ford. They take home on average the magnificent sum of $135 a week; $ 1 35 a week is the average take home pay for the worker at Broadmeadows. Honourable members opposite want to know why they are putting in for pay increases. I will tell them how to understand it in the simplest possible fashion. They should give themselves $135 each week for a month on which to live and then they will understand why the employees are asking for more money. It is as simple as that. If honourable members opposite do not understand that they are only trying to draw red herrings across the path. </para>
          <para>The car plan in Australia at the moment is basically the umbrella- the protection and the sort of security- that the Labor Government gave the car industry. There is very little new in what this Government has done over the last two and a half years. The 85 per cent content plan is basically the Labor Government plan which was made when we rejected the Industries Assistance Commission report. In addition, the local industry is provided with 80 per cent of the market. As I have said, the important feature of that argument is that it is a diminishing market. Until such time as the people of Australia are prepared to turn their cars over more quickly, and until such time as the scrappage of new cars in Australia becomes greater, the car industry in Australia will be faced with that problem. </para>
          <para>How do workers in Australia on $135 a week- we are talking about thousands and thousands of workers, not just those in the car industrysit home on the weekend and discuss whether they will buy a new Ford, Holden or Valiant? The real problem that we are faced with here is buyer resistance. It is a new ingredient, a new kerb, a new problem as far as the car industry is concerned. A lot of people who used to buy new cars are now buying second hand vehicles because that is what suits their budget. We cannot maintain the quick turnover of new cars that we have had or expect the same growth rate in the car industry unless the conditions which used to prevail return. </para>
          <para>On the matter of the total amount that is taken home by the workers in these industries, we have a government that is continually going into the national wage case and saying that we cannot afford full wage indexation. That means that over the last two years every wage and salary earner has had a real reduction in his wages. That is reflected in the sort of consumer goods that wage and salary earners can purchase. So of course there will be problems in the car industry. The Leader of the Opposition is entitled to raise these questions. It is, as he says, his responsibility. In relation to the total picture of the car industry, why did Ford just a few weeks ago cancel its plans to build a new $80m plant at Ingleburn? It described Ingleburn as the most suitable area in which to build a car plant in Australia. Why would it cancel its plans to build at Ingleburn? Obviously it is because the Australian auto industry already has over production capacity. </para>
          <para>GMH and Ford are perhaps working at somewhere between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of their capacity. We do not know what Chrysler is working at but we do know that Nissan and Toyota are having difficulty in reaching 85 per cent. All that we are asking for and demanding on this side of the House is that someone who is involved in the industry that is making the decisions be honest with the people involved. That includes us, because we have a responsibility as the Opposition in the national Parliament. I repeat to honourable members who want to know why the plans for Ingleburn were cancelled, it is tied up with the total picture of the car industry. </para>
          <para>There is one other important aspect concerning the employment of people in the car industry. For some time during the late 1950s and 1960s we built up a substantial skill in the car industry in Australia. Many members, not only of the Vehicle Builders Union, the Metal Workers Union and other blue collar unions operating in this field, will be affected. The car industry in Australia was a good outlet for people such as draftsmen and other skilled people involved in the design of motor cars. All of that has come to an end in Australia as the organisations which control the car industry throughout the world are concentrating more and more on world models. People overseas are now being given the opportunity to design the products which Australians will have to purchase and use. Nowadays, when people are laid off in the car industry it is not just the vehicle builder, the bloke working on the assembly line or the fellow doing perhaps the tooling up, but a lot of others including white collar workers also are being laid off. The car industry is undergoing a massive transformation. The statements of the honourable member for Kingston and the honourable member for Sturt, who came in here roaring like lions and told us that the Opposition should not speak about one of the most massive employers in Australia, ought to be rejected out of hand by every thinking parliamentarian. </para>

            <para>-by leave- I wish to provide the House with some information regarding a matter arising from my second reading speech on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1978. I think it is proper that I provide the House with this information. Since the House last met, and as a result of an inquiry that I made of the Australian Taxation Office, my attention has been drawn to the contents of a letter written in September of last year by the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> dealing with matters relating to the retrospectivity of tax legislation. I believe that 1 should draw its contents to the attention of the House by tabling it, as there is a possibility that some people may see its contents as in some fashion qualifying the paragraph on page 5 of my second reading speech. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In tabling the letter, I should make it very clear that I was not aware of it at the time of the preparation and introduction of the legislation. 1 should also make it clear that if I had been aware of it, it would not have altered my decision or the Government&#39;s decision regarding this matter. I take this opportunity to reiterate the terms of the Government&#39;s decision, both in respect of the general provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill and the section of that Bill which has attracted some comment and some controversy in recent weeks, that is, the decision of the Government to apply retrospectively the provisions striking down the so-called Curran schemes from 16 August 1977. </para>
          <para>I believe that this letter was written in the context of the general approach taken by the Government, that is, that it is undesirable to have retrospective legislation. As I have said on a number of occasions, the main basis of the Government&#39;s decision in this area is that having put into balance the two competing principles of non-retrospectivity and the equity of the tax system, the Government has decided that on this occasion the latter of those two principles must be given greater weight. For that reason the Government has firmly decided to proceed with this legislation. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I am compelled to make this statement to the House because of charges laid by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> R. Cavill, Managing Director of SAATAS- South Australian and Territorial Air Services Pty Ltd- and the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peter Morris).</inline> I am making a statement so that the Parliament itself can consider the charges and impose its own judgment on those involved. The charges question the integrity not only of myself as Minister for Transport, but of officers of my Department, of the former Ministers responsible for civil aviation in previous governments, of the Directors of Connair Pty Ltd, of the owners and operators of several charter air services in central Australia, of certain members of the National Party in the Northern Territory and of the Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to say at the start that the charges are totally false and malicious and clearly demonstrably so; and that it is regrettable that the Labor Opposition, through the member for Shortland, has become actively involved in what I will call the Cavill Affair. This matter was first raised on 13 April by the member for Shortland in this House during the debate on the Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill. He made certain charges concerning air service operations in the Northern Territory. He quoted from a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> of SAATAS, not then available in Canberra, which had been given to him prematurely by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline> I have not received nor seen a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill&#39;s</inline> purported Press statement of 1 3 April. I understand however that it is similar to a telex sent to me on 3 1 March. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> repeated his charges on at least two occasions- on <inline font-style="italic">A.M.</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight</inline> on 14 April. The member for Shortland supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> with a statement on 20 April and an interview on <inline font-style="italic">A.M.</inline> on 2 1 April. </para>
          <para>To the best of my belief the charges by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and the member for Shortland are contained in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 13 April, their Press statement of 20 April, interviews with <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight on 14 April, A.M.</inline> of the same date and <inline font-style="italic">A.M.</inline> on 21 April. The major charge is that Connair as the so-called opposition airline to SAATAS has been given unfair Government assistance and I and the National Country Party stand accused of pork barrel politics and discrimination. The charge is quite mischievous and clearly cannot be sustained on the facts. For the information of honourable members I table a report prepared by my Department following the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and the member for Shortland. I draw honourable members&#39; attention to the first part of my Department&#39;s report headed &#39;Types of Service&#39;, which shows the sharp distinction between the two operators. Quite clearly SAATAS is not and has never been an opposition airline to Connair. Connair is the airline providing regular regional scheduled services in the Northern Territory. There are only five airlines of this type in Australia, namely, Ansett Airlines of Australia, Trans-Australia Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd, East-West Airlines Ltd and Connair. SAATAS on the other hand is a charter operator in competition with other charter operators of which there are more than 480 in Australia. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline>has known since at least October 1972 the position of the Commonwealth when the then Minister for Civil Aviation, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> stating: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The position of the Commonwealth in these matters is as follows: </para>
            <para>It has restricted the issue of air service licences in the Territory in an effort to ensure orderly, economic and efficient development of the industry there; </para>
            <para>Your company is one of the favoured few who have been fortunate to gain an operating licence for the Territory; </para>
            <para>In granting this licence to you originally, it was made perfectly clear what the relationship between Connair and the Commonwealth was: </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s contract with Connair is a perfectly normal subsidy contract of a type which has been entered into with subsidised operators for many years; </para>
            <para>This contract enables the Commonwealth to carry out all necessary investigations into the company&#39;s affairs and to control its operations so as to ensure that subsidy costs are kept to a minimum; </para>
            <para>The fundamental role of Connair, and the basis of its original foundation and development, is the provision of regular air services to remote localities in circumstances where uneconomic services are unavoidable; nevertheless, the company should be encouraged to develop other operations likely to reduce its subsidy requirement; </para>
            <para>There is no evidence to suggest that SAATAS, for example, could perform the task allotted to Connair at a significantly different order of cost to the Commonwealth; </para>

          <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Anderson, when DirectorGeneral of Civil Aviation, had written to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> on 14 January 1972, and listed seven benefits his company had accrued as a result of Commonwealth policy or action. That letter states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I find it somewhat puzzling to note your apparent belief that this Department, or the Government, has acted to the disadvantage of SAATAS. Let me recapitulate some of the benefits which have accrued to the company as a result of Commonwealth policy or action: </para>
            <para>SAATAS has been permitted to commence and expand operations in the Northern Territory even though this might have resulted in some increase in the subsidy requirements of Connair; </para>
            <para>In the interests of SAATAS (and other existing operators) additional licences for services in the Northern Territory have been refused or severely restricted; </para>
            <para>The limitations on charter flights over airline routes in the Territory provided under ANR 197 (2) have been administered liberally in the case of SAATAS; </para>
            <para>SAATAS operations to Ayers Rock have been facilitated, and recently, at the request of the company, a higher fare was approved for this route; </para>
            <para>The Department did all it could to promote the commencement of services to and within Indonesia by SAATAS; lt has been insisted that charter services by the subsidised operator, Connair Pty Ltd, which would be competitive with SAATAS services, should bc quoted for at charter rates based on full costs plus profit allowance so that no unfair advantage would be gained by Connair as a result of the Commonwealth subsidy; </para>
            <para>The Department has assisted SAATAS considerably in making available hangar accommodation at Darwin Airport. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That letter puts the matter into the correct perspective. Our policy has never deviated from that described in October 1972. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and his colleagues have always been aware of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s claim that Connair Pty Ltd has been given unfair Government assistance therefore is ludicrous. Clearly, the overall operations of the two companies are not comparable, nor are the services they provide. My Department&#39;s report which I have just tabled sets out the history of the Government&#39;s financial arrangements with Connair. </para>
          <para>The report shows that since its inception in 1939 successive Commonwealth governments have supported, with financial assistance, the operation of the only regular scheduled regional airline for central Australia. Attachment I to the report sets out the payments made to Connair since the new agreement was entered into in 1965. The table shows that subsidy was continued during the three years of the Labor </para>
          <para>Government even though that Government made a decision to phase out the subsidy. </para>
          <para>To suggest that the National Country Party of Australia is in some way responsible for the agreement is ludicrous. In the first place until December 1975 when I became Minister in charge of the Department of Transport, no member of my party had held ministerial responsibility for aviation matters since before the current agreement was negotiated in 1 965. In addition, as my Department&#39;s report demonstrates, all decisions relating to payments of financial assistance to Connair have been made on the basis of decisions by the Government, that is, the Cabinet. No individual Minister has been in a position to act without Cabinet&#39;s direction and approval. </para>
          <para>It should be clearly understood that the basis of the financial assistance to Connair was an agreement negotiated in 1 965 and approved by the then Government. I point out that the 1977 interdepartmental committee referred to in the Department&#39;s report made the following recommendation: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee recommends that the basis of Connair Pty Ltd, be confirmed as that of a regional airline. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The committee further recommended: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the Government does not accept the option of doing nothing for Connair Pty Ltd, and thereby bringing about its immediate demise. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As I have said, Connair is central Australia &#39;s regional airline. It is quite distinct and separate from charter operators such as SAATAS Pty Ltd. The airline was the brainchild of those living at the time in central Australia who saw a need for such a service. Since its inception it has served the people in the Northern Territory and central Australia well. It has been necessary for the Government to provide financial assistance to Connair to ensure that regular air transport services were provided for people requiring them in the remote areas of the region. But as I have said the details of that assistance have always been publicly available and approved by governments, not individual Ministers. </para>
          <para>The second charge is that I, as Minister, have consistently refused <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> the opportunity to meet me. I was curious that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> could take this view. All he had to do was ask. In fact, I held a meeting with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> on 6 October 1 977 and have had regular correspondence with him. In addition my records show <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has not sought a meeting with me since 6 October. All <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has done is to say he is prepared to meet me if I formally call a meeting. On 23 March this year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> sent me a telex saying the directors of SAATAS were considering closing their Australian flying operations the following week, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> did not seek a meeting. What he said was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Directors are prepared to discuss the proposed close down and any other matters if you wish. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On 30 March I sent a telex to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> saying that his company must, of course, make its own commercial decisions but that if he felt a meeting could be of benefit I was happy to meet with him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> sent a reply on 3 1 March 1978 which stated:  1 remain happy to meet with you ... I would however suggest that such a meeting would need to be called by you and a specific agenda be sei by you . . . </para>
          <para class="block">My reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> on 13 April said that because SAATAS was responsible for its own commercial decisions it was not proper for me to call for a meeting or specify the agenda. I then repeated my earlier offer to meet with the company if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> saw advantage in such a meeting. I have not heard since from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline> Clearly I have never refused to meet with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline> What I have done is to refuse to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> to use my ministerial office to assist his commercial activities. </para>
          <para>The third charge is that the Commonwealth in granting air service licences to Chartair and Tillair had acted in a discriminatory manner actionable in the High Court of Australia. The Department&#39;s report sets out the details followed in granting or extending air service licences to Chartair and Tillair late last year. I am not sure what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s own legal advisers are telling him. What I am sure of, however, is that my Department&#39;s actions have been quite correct and in accordance with Government policy and established procedures. On 20 October 1977 I approved the issue or extension of charter licences to Rossair Pty Ltd- trading as Chartair- to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Tilley of Katherine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Ashton of Tennant Creek, the Port Keats Mission in the Northern Territory and the Balgo Hills Mission in Western Australia. The decision to issue the licences was not an arbitrary one. It was made in consultation with the responsible member in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the licences were expressly recommended by interdepartmental committee set up to examine air links in the area currently serviced by Connair. </para>
          <para>Charter operators by their very nature cannot expect to be given a guaranteed monopoly by governments. As 1 have said there are more than 480 operators like SAATAS in Australia. There was, therefore, nothing discriminatory in issuing the charter licences on 20 October 1977. The Department&#39;s report deals at length with the granting of financial assistance to undertake Connair&#39;s mail services out of Alice Springs and new services of a similar type out of Katherine and Tennant Creek. The report speaks for itself and SAATAS was given an equal opportunity with the other operators in the region to bid for two routes. In both instances their bid was higher and, therefore, more expensive for the Government than the successful bidders, Chartair and Tillair. Again the report speaks for itself. In Alice Springs, Chartair indicated it required $20,514 per annum from the Government to undertake the mail service whereas SAATAS said it would require $22,350 per annum. At Katherine Tillair undertook to run the service for a payment of $20,280 whereas SAATAS stated that it would require $26,180. Clearly there was nothing discriminatory in awarding the services to the most economical and, therefore, efficient operators. After all taxpayers funds were involved. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline>appears to be confused about the timing of the approval to the two operators to run these services. The department&#39;s report states the position quite clearly, however. I repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavil&#93;</inline> and his company were provided with an equal opportunity to bid for the services, and the Government&#39;s duty is to do no more than this. The operators&#39; decision to commence the services without waiting for government approval on the levels of subsidy required was theirs to make as charter operators. SAATAS could have done the same. After being given an equal opportunity to bid for mail routes and after being unsuccessful because its bid was too high, SAATAS complained to my Department. It believed the method of seeking offers was unconventional and could give rise to legal challenge. At that time my Department sought legal confirmation that its approach had been correct. Such confirmation was given by the Assistant Crown Solicitor. </para>
          <para>Again I point out that the proposed arrangements were developed by my Department, the Postal Commission and the Department of Finance in consultation. The decisions on maximum levels of financial assistance were recently finalised by the Minister for Finance and me in consultation. There was clearly no discrimination, nor could there have been under the procedures followed in the matter. All procedures followed by the Government, me as Minister, my Department, Australia Post, and the Department of Finance and its Minister have been proper, responsible and totally fair. The Department&#39;s report shows clearly that all the charges by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and the honourable member for Shortland are totally false. There has been no discrimination against SAATAS or any other operator. There has been no pork-barrelling by the National Country Party or any other party. No individual or single company has been given unfair advantage. </para>
          <para>That brings me to the next point. What were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s true intentions and those of the honourable member for Shortland in this matter? An examination of all the relevant papers has led me to only one clear conclusion- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has consistently sought a position of monopoly and unfair advantage over other operators in the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Shortland claims he has evidence proving the charges that he and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> have made. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> says that he has evidence with respect to malpractice by the Government and personally by the Country Party in the Northern Territory. I have already invited the honourable member for Shortland to publish such papers, but to no avail. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> would like to have the honourable member for Shortland table all the correspondence he has had with me and my Department in the last ten years or so, I will accommodate him. I would be surprised, however, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> would want to table his correspondence- correspondence aimed at securing for himself and his company a privileged position in the Northern Territory. As far back as February 1968, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Anderson, and I quote from that letter: </para>
          <quote>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again, on 29 November 1976, the Managing Director of SAATAS wrote to a senior officer of my Department stating: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">

          <para>It is clear from the documents available that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and SAATAS have run a deliberate campaign aimed at causing the demise of Connair and the imposition of SAATAS in its place as the scheduled airline in Central Australia. </para>
          <para>Let me give the House an indication of the lengths to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has gone in his campaign. In December 1 97 1 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill,</inline> on his own initiative, provided the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Anderson with what he described as &#39;an assessment I have made of the financial operations of Connair&#39;. The &#39;assessment&#39; painted a picture of unrelieved gloom and showed Connair in a hopeless financial position. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> dismissed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s assessment&#39; on 14 January 1972 in the following words- &#39;interesting but inaccurate in a number of respects&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I see no particular point in continuing this exercise. If Connair is willing to make public its accounts, estimates such as you have made will be unnecessary. If the company does not wish to take this step, it would be improper for the Department to comment on your efforts, and discussion based on incorrect assumptions would be fruitless. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That attempt to have a Commonwealth department of state provide an opinion of a private company&#39;s operations and financial structure to another company demonstrates a complete lack of business ethics by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline></para>
          <para>A more sinister move occurred on 8 April 1972 when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to the  Chairman  of Connair asking if the company would be prepared to negotiate a sale. To assist SAATAS, Connair made available copies of the loan agreement and subsidy agreement to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline> Then, on 1 1 May 1972, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> sent a document titled Northern Territory Air Services: Proposals for Reconstruction&#39; to a senior officer of the Department of Civil Aviation. The document proposed the formation of a new company to run air services in the Northern Territory with SAATAS holding 5 1 per cent of the shares and the Commonwealth holding 49 per cent. In the document <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> proposed that his company should absorb: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">

          </list>
          <para>Eventually CONNAIR Pty Ltd as it exists now could be liquidated thus avoiding continued tenure of embarrassing accoutrements. </para>
          <para class="block">Because no takeover offer was ever received the Connair board formally rejected SAATAS&#39; takeover suggestion on 20 December 1972. The letter from Connair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> said in part: </para>

This has not eventuated, and we regard the matter as closed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not wish to take up the time of the House in disclosing any further <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s activities in seeking the demise of Connair and its replacement with his own company or with a company or organisation of his own choosing. On the 19 August last year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to me saying that his company:   . . could, with notice of a few days only, provide all those services needed in the Northern Territory, as mentionedmy previous correspondence with your Department- - without subsidy and with efficiency. </para>
          <para>In the light of this claim by SAATAS, the capacity of the company to undertake the services should be examined. Just 9 days before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to me on 19 August the Department of Construction had complained bitterly to SAATAS describing the service the company provided as most unsatisfactory. The Department&#39;s complaints ranged from SAATAS being late for scheduled take off times and the inability of the company to have a light single aircraft on site to the fact they had to pay the hiring cost of a 9-seater aircraft to carry just one person. Unfortunately, the internal operations of SAATAS do nothing for the company&#39;s image. From the brief outline I have given of the actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and his company during recent years and its aviation performance the House will see what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has been up to. It now appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has made some unwise commercial decisions in the past and is trying to blame everyone but himself for those mistakes. I am not sure what the company&#39;s financial position is and what mistakes have been made with its management. On 29 November 1976, however, the Managing Director of SAATAS, in a letter to a senior officer of my Department said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Today our ability to survive is being eroded in two ways. Firstly the Austraiian Government&#39;s cost-cutting program has caused a serious decline in the demand for air charter in the Northern Territory. Secondly, our Indonesian operation has gone sour with our large foreign customers pulling out of the country. No longer can the profits from Indonesia prop up the struggling charter business in the Northern Territory. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As I have said, SAATAS is a charter operator, one of more than 480 in Australia. It is a private operator and, therefore, free to make its own commercial decisions. Its mistakes are of its own making and its future of its own choosing. </para>
          <para>The role of the honourable member for Shortland in this unsavoury matter is curious and sad. On 8 December 1972, six days after the change of government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to the then Director-General of Civil Aviation and said: </para>

          <para class="block">That statement may come as a surprise to the honourable member for Shortland and those of his colleagues who were under the impression <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> was one of theirs.  His  actions clearly show a devious duplicity. In 1972 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> was meeting with the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> to press his case. During 1973 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> was negotiating with the Labor Government, using pressure from the Dunstan Government. In 1975 he was seeking me, in Opposition, to press his case again. </para>
          <para>I am quite sure that my predecessor, the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> could have warned the honourable member for Shortland about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill&#39;s</inline> methods. I am pleased to say he did not get anywhere with the honourable member for Newcastle and I am pleased to be able to show the House he has not got anywhere with me and will not. I regret that the honourable member for Shortland has not shown the perception and understanding of his colleague, the former Minister. The honourable member for Shortland, of course, has not had the sobering experience of ministerial office. Perhaps after his performance in this matter he never will. </para>
          <para>The charges brought by the honourable member for Shortland at the instigation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> were indeed serious. They were given public airing on at least two national media programs. It is never my wish to disclose damaging information or evidence against any member of the public or member of this House. However, if the media are used to bring charges which are totally false and mischievous- charges which if unrebutted are personally damaging to the integrity and character of those they have been brought against- the persons bringing them must be exposed. It is my sincere wish that the honourable member for Shortland has learnt his lesson. It is my sincere wish that on future occasions the honourable member will make sure of his facts before making such outrageous statements and allowing himself to be used by devious operators for commercial reasons.

            <para>-The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> stated that he has not seen the Press statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> of 13 April. The truth is, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> may record this, that I passed him a copy of the Press statement across the table during the debate. I think that the Minister now recalls that. At the time he asked me what it was and he took it away with him. So he did have a copy of the statement at the time it was released. I made some statements in this Parliament on that date relating to the information provided to me, and I will come to that later, but I did not make any charges against anybody. I simply referred to statements and said that if they could be substantiated the situation was serious. Again, I will refer to that later. I released a Press statement on 20 April, and I point out that it was my Press release, not &#39;their&#39; Press release, that is, the Press release of Cavill and Morris, as the Minister said in the statement he has just concluded. Again, that was an inaccuracy. In that statement I said that I believed a senior Cabinet Minister was seeking to cover up the Government&#39;s financial dealings with an airline operator that has close links with the National Country Party. I have no reason to alter that statement in the light of what the Minister has said and what he has tabled in this Parliament. I went on to say: </para>

            <para>The manner in which the Transport Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> has handled the issue of air charter licences in the Northern Territory and the payment of government subsidies to Connair Pty Ltd can only be described as a public scandal.

            <para>I would be extremely surprised at any public statement from the Government on this issue which would provide all of the information that needs to be examined. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that that is the best way to summarise the Minister&#39;s statement. It does provide some of the information but it contains a number of inaccuracies and distortions, and I will come to those a little later. The Opposition welcomes the Minister&#39;s statement relating to the provision of air services in the Northern Territory. The report mentioned by the Minister has only just been made available to me. I have not had a chance to look at it closely but I do have a general understanding of it. Despite the inaccuracies and deficiencies in the Minister&#39;s statement, he has created an opportunity for Parliament to examine more closely the manipulations that have taken place in this area of government responsibility. On a personal basis, I must confess that I am touched, in fact I am flattered, by the Minister&#39;s show of concern for me, but I wish that he could have been more truthful in his remarks. The Minister has previously misled the Parliament and the public on the South Australian and Territorial Air Services Pty Ltd and Connair Pty Ltd subsidy issue, and his statement today further compounds his earlier actions. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the background of the events that have occurred in what I term Australia&#39;s own Nixon affair. Both SAATAS and Connair have operated air services in the Northern Territory for many years. Connair is the holder of a registered public transport licence and has recieved a $9m subsidy from taxpayers&#39; funds over that period. SAATAS has operated as a private enterprise charter operator without subsidy. It has not sought a subsidy, nor is it seeking one. No doubt each has been vigorous in its own area of responsibility and activity within the marketplace. I think it is reasonable to expect that, if private enterprise is to have competition, a competitive keenness would be displayed and there would be some offers to buy and some offers to sell in order to get the major competitor out of the market if possible. In his statement the Minister referred to that being the normal to-ing and fro-ing of the commercial marketplace. SAATAS has claimed for years that it could provide without subsidy similar services to those provided by Connair, and there is the core of the issue. That is the case SAATAS has been putting. It has not received a subsidy and it is not seeking one. It claims that it can provide the services without a subsidy. </para>
          <para>I do not have a brief for Connair nor do I have a brief for SAATAS. The Opposition is concerned about the proper and responsible disbursement of public funds and the proper and responsible administration of government affairs. The issues before the Parliament are why, how and in what manner some $9m of public money has been paid to Connair, and whether the Minister has acted in the discharge of his responsibilities in a proper and responsible way. On the evidence that I have seen, and it is available to the Minister, I say quite firmly that he has not. The close affiliation of the Minister&#39;s party and Connair has already been documented and I will not waste the time of the House by going over that again. From the very beginning the subsidy arrangements have been shrouded in secrecy. I want to refer particularly to a document that was circulated by CAPL, as it was then known, on 9 November 1965 referring to assistance to the company. It states: </para>

No mention was made in this of the Government financial assistance re capital, of f 50,000 to shift to 7-Mile, and f 200,000 to assist completion of re-equipment. This omission was made for very good political reasons, as publicity for this Government action would only result in criticism from some section of the general public, which could be detrimental to us . . . </para>

              <para>-I want firstly to rebut the falsities in the Minister&#39;s statement. I first spoke with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> approximately one and a half hours before I raised this matter in the Parliament on 13 April. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> rang me and read to me the contents of a Press statement he was going to make. He telexed to me a copy of his Press release, which I brought into this House and gave the Minister. I made no charges at that time, and page 1528 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> sets out what I said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. if the claims made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and his airline are substantiated there are serious grounds for the resignation of the Minister or at least the holding of a royal commission of inquiry, which is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has called for. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The only time I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> was the next day when I inspected the correspondence and copies of telexes between himself, his company, the Department and the Minister. I shall refer to those later. The Minister referred on page 2 of his prepared statement to &#39;their&#39; Press statement of 20 April 1978. &#39;Their&#39; Press statement did not exist. I issued a Press statement on 20 April. No joint Press statement was ever made. On pages 7 and 8 of his statement the Minister states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> had not sought a meeting with him since 6 October 1977. The facts are to be found in a telex sent to the Minister and dated 20 October 1977. The first section of the telex reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This telex urgently requests that no further charter licences be issued in the Northern Territory until such time as my company has had the opportunity of presenting an objection to you and of having the merits of that objection considered by you. </para>
            <para>I respectfully point out that we have not had the opportunity of discussing the whole matter of Connair Pty Ltd and the Northern Territory with you and that at our recent meeting in Canberra this opportunity was not made available to us. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The second last paragraph on page 3 of the same telex reads:  . . I request again that before any further alterations to policy be made or before any further licences be issued in the Northern Territory I be given an opportunity of presenting the matter again and discussing the merits with you and the Deputy Prime Minister. </para>
          <para class="block">There is clear evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> having sought an interview. There was no response to that request. At a later stage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> notified the Minister of the situation in the Northern Territory. The Minister has sought to convey the impression that when he received a request for a meeting from SAATAS he agreed to the meeting posthaste. The fact is that the meeting was sought in the telex of 20 October, which I read to the Parliament. No response to that request for a meeting was received. Correspondence was received which went all around the Cape but which did not answer specifically the request for a discussion with the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister. In his speech the Minister referred to being advised on 30 March of the closure of SAATAS. The facts are that the telex was despatched to the Minister on 29 March. It reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I refer to my telex of 23 March 1978. 1 confirm that I have had no reply to that telex. </para>
            <para>The decision to run down SAATAS&#39; Northern Territory operations for the reasons set out in my telexes was taken today and, accordingly, action has been taken. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Once satisfied that SAATAS was out of the arena, once it was confirmed that the company was closing down, the Minister immediately telexed back, but that was five months after he received the request. I suppose that is not too bad by National Country Party standards. He responded in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Refer to your decision conveyed to me by telex today. You must of course make your own commercial decisions on this matter, but if you believe it would be of assistance to you I would be happy to meet with you in Canberra. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So that is the fact of the situation. The Minister ignored for five months the company&#39;s request for a meeting with the principals of the company. Once he received information that the company had closed down in the Northern Territory, he agreed to a meeting. He has since misrepresented that. On page 8 of his statement he refers to his letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> of 13 April. Whilst that letter has been datestamped 13 April by the Department of Transport when it was sent off for his signature, it was received in Adelaide on 26 April- 13 days later. So again the Minister has been a little tardy. On page 10 of his prepared statement, the Minister referred to quotes for services by SAATAS and other airlines. He did not refer in this House on 13 April to quotes and he did not refer to bids. On page 1536 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he referred to tenders. He sought to inform the House that what had happened in the Northern Territory in the provision of these services was that tenders had been called and that SAATAS was an unsuccessful tenderer. The fact is that no tenders were called, but that quotes were invited from the various companies. I shall read the Minister&#39;s own words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I must tell the House that SAATAS was one of a number of tenderers for routes in the Northern Territory. It was beaten by other tenderers who had put in lower tenders for the various routes which became available when Connair Pty Ltd withdrew from agreat number of routes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If the commercial judgment of SAATAS cannot win the route by offering the lowest possible tender, I believe that there is nothing a Minister for Transport in this House can do about it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again he deliberately misrepresented what had occurred. In fact, what took place was that a letter from the Department of Transport, Adelaide, was sent to SAATAS on 26 October in which it was stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If you are interested in operating this service I would be pleased if you could advise: 1. Annual cost for operating a weekly service . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Then are set out the various services. The company responded to that letter. A letter dated 21 December 1977 was received from the Department of Transport, Adelaide, over the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr K.</inline> L. Collett, which was in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Thank you for your letter dated 4 November concerning the operation of regular air services out of Katherine and Alice Springs. </para>
            <para>Your proposal - </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It does not say &#39;tender &#39;- together with those submitted by other operators, were carefully considered with Australia Post but regret to advise your offer was not accepted. </para>
          <para class="block">Nowhere was the tendering process in operation. Then more than a month later, on 23 December, the company learnt that the Minister had not approved any allocation of the services for which quotes had been sought. In that case the company telexed the Minister in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We understand tenders for operations have not been called but some informal method has been adopted of allocating and authorising operators for such routes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The company referred to the letter it had received on 21 November and pointed out that the legal advice available to it- I am not a lawyer; perhaps the Minister is- was that there was ah irregularity in the way that the matter was handled. The company requested that tenders be called so that all interested parties could have the opportunity of tendering on an equal footing and on a proper basis and policy. The Minister confirmed in his reply that tenders had not been called. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>You are correct in your understanding that ministerial approval has not yet been given for these services. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted).</inline> I thank the House. On page 12 of his prepared statement, the Minister accused <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> of having sought a position of monopoly and unfair advantage over other operators in the Northern Territory. The documents show that SAATAS has consistently operated without subsidy and has sought to operate without cost to the taxpayer. On page 19 of his statement, the Minister refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s letter of 4 February 1976. The Minister quotes that letter in his speech. I am rather intrigued by the Minister&#39;s statement, because in it he makes a comment which is really a revelation to the Parliament. For some reason he seems to judge the behaviour of others by his own standards. What he seeks to imply is that if a person is not of the political complexion of the Government the Minister should not have to deal with him. To my mind that confirms that Connair was of the political complexion of the Government and therefore had to be looked after. The Minister is deciding the disbursement of public moneys on the basis of a very strange set of priorities and a very strange set of moral standards. We on this side of the House are concerned for the proper and responsible disbursement of public money. </para>

          <para>Then we have the matter of the retrospective payment of a subsidy to Connair. When this matter was raised in the Parliament he told me by way of answer the dates in April and June 1976 when the subsidy was granted retrospectively and he told me the Cabinet decisions. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records his reply in response to a question on notice: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The statement of the Department&#39;s explanatory notes presented to the Senate Estimates Committee was misleading and any inconvenience is sincerely regretted. </para>

          <para>We are getting too many misleading statements and too many errors for all of them to be the responsibility of the officers of the Department of Transport. Sixteen weeks after the change of Government in 1975 we had a retrospective decision to increase the subsidy. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the Omega affair last November, when the Minister quite brazenly and clearly stated that he had no knowledge of or participation in the purchase of land in his electorate. When examined, the files found that he had his finger in the pie several times. He wanted the local estate agent to have a go. He wanted local property to be looked at. Even now he is still related to the same company in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smart,</inline> of other renown, is involved. As I said earlier, the Minister stated on 13 April that the tender by SAATAS was too high. We have shown that he was incorrect. In this area the word of this senior member of this corrupt conservative Governmentthis Government which said that it would maintain Medibank and there would be jobs for all- means nothing. </para>
          <para>The keynote of the Minister&#39;s administration of transport has been secrecy. I shall come to the interdepartmental committee report very shortly. Let us look at the access by Connair to preferential treatment. On a number of occasions the Parliament has sought to have the IDC report on Northern Territory aerial services tabled in the Parliament. We have received one answer No. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connellan</inline> was able to stand up in Darwin on 3 1 August last year and quote chapter and verse from the IDC report. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connellan,</inline> quoting from the report of the IDC, was able to inform the gathering that the IDC specifically recommended no HS-748s, which this Government is in the process of helping him to purchase. The IDC recommended a reduction in subsidy; the Minister increased the subsidy. The IDC recommended that Connair be left to conduct its own affairs; the Government did not do that. </para>

          <para class="block">There is a relationship between Connair and the Minister. Connair had access to the Minister. It also had access to the IDC. SAATAS was refused an appearance before the IDC. So we go on through this close relationship and alliance between the Minister and members of the National Country Party and the board of Connair. The Minister criticised Cavill for his approach in February 1976 but he did not mention that Connellan had seen him during the previous month. We on this side of the House make no criticism of Connair. It has a business to run and is entitled to put its case to the Minister. I have visited the head office of Connair in Alice Springs. I have met Stephen Marshall and have discussed with him the problems which that airline faces in providing services. What is in question here is the manner in which this Government has carried out its responsibilities. </para>
          <para>I mentioned that the keynote is secrecy. Information available shows clear evidence of a direct, close and personal association between Connair and the Minister and a refusal and rebuttal of approaches made by the competitor airline SAATAS.

Connair has operated in association with the National Country Party Minister for Transport to the tune of $9m over the recent years it has been in operation.

            <para>-I thank the Minister and the House. I was saying that there is evidence of close, direct and personal association between the Minister and the company concerned. The last matter to which I refer is the fact that we have an open-ended subsidy arrangement under the terms of the agreement of 1965 which relates to the provision of a certain dividend target for the company. Looking at the 1976 report we find that out of the moneys on loan to Connair from the public purse $35,000 is on personal advance to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connellan</inline> at call, at a 10.5 per cent interest rate, secured on livestock. It is no wonder that people in competitive organisations such as SAATAS get a bit upset when they find, on looking at the accounts, a public loan from the people to an airline; then from the airline, on a personal basis for personal use, to one of the proprietors. Here again, the indications are that the Government is aware of this. It would be aware from the reports which have come forward. This indicates the Government&#39;s close association with and endorsement of the activities of that airline. We believe that the only way by which we can assess properly what has gone on in the Northern Territory is for the IDC report to be tabled in full and for an inquiry into the administration of the subsidy and into the negotiations with respect to the new service which has been granted in the Northern Territory to be undertaken. </para>

I put it on record that I do not associate him with any devious activity. Doubtless he has properly undertaken those responsibilities of a good member of Parliament in putting forward the claims of SAATAS Pty Ltd. The honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> misrepresented me in a number of ways. I think it would be better if I wrote him a letter.

          <para class="block">As indicated by the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> on 13 April it is proposed to change the pattern of sittings to enable the House to sit from today until Friday of this week and Monday to Thursday of next week. It is proposed that on Thursday, 1 1 May the House will adjourn until Tuesday, 23 May thus reducing the break from two weeks to one week and to sit from Tuesday to Friday of that week and Monday to Friday of the following week, The Leader of the House also indicated that it was proposed to modify the sitting hours. It is proposed that until Friday, 2 June the House meet at 10 a.m. on every sitting Thursday and Friday and on the Wednesday of the second sitting week in each of the two-week sitting periods. Finally, the Leader of the House indicated that it was proposed that on Friday 5 May, Friday 26 May and Friday 2 June the question for the adjournment of the House would be proposed at 5.30 p.m., allowing half an hour for an adjournment debate. The motion I have just moved gives effect to these proposals. It is hoped that by agreeing to the proposals consideration of the business of the House will be concluded by Friday, 2 June. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition indicated earlier that it had no opposition to the re-arrangement of the sittings for May and the first two days of June. However, I take the opportunity to point out that when we previously made arrangements with the Government for a four-day week we ran into considerable difficulties when it was attempted to jam the business of the Government into the final one or two days of those long four-day sittings. In trying to complete this session in the four sitting weeks we have available, the Government ought to be cognisant of the fact that the hours involved are extremely long. Only the honourable members themselves involved in this chamber realise the sorts of pressures that can be brought to bear on each individual who may be here from 9 o&#39;clock in the morning until midnight for four days a week and then return to his electoral office only to come back here on the Sunday night ready to start another four-day week. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In addition to the pressures that will be applied to the individual members, there is also a great desire of this side of the House that some of these very major matters upon which there is a distinct difference of opinion between the Government and the Opposition be given sufficient time for a proper debate. I refer to the major debates on the environmental legislation regarding uranium mining in the Northern Territory in respect of which six Bills will come before the House. Next week taxation Bills will come before the House on which a number of honourable members will want to speak. We will not allow ourselves to be bulldozed into completing legislation in the early hours of the morning, without proper thought, as was attempted by the Government here just three weeks ago. We will continue to fight against the use of the House in the style that was used then by the Government to steamroll legislation or to legislate by exhaustion. We believe that the hours of sitting in the normal parliamentary week are long enough for honourable members to be able to pay due attention to the legislation which comes before them. </para>
          <para>We think that any legislation which comes in after the hours which are prescribed now by the Acting Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> in moving this motion will only reinforce the belief that the Government indeed hopes to be able to slip through legislation without proper scrutiny by the Opposition. We do not agree to the motion reluctantly; we agree to it as a test of how the Parliament can be used in four-day sittings, but we do point out that we retain the right to scrutinise all the legislation in very proper and thorough fashion as has been the practice of the Opposition all this year. We will not allow Parliament to be used to legislate by exhaustion. </para>

            <para>-I would like to make the point to the Acting Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> that at some stage in the not too distant future we should put aside some time for the Parliament or the House of Representatives to debate the matter or to have the  Speaker  convene the Standing Orders Committee for a proper examination of our days and hours of meeting. I think it is ridiculous for us to be starting here at 10 a.m. and going through until 1 1 p.m. Why do we not start at 9 a.m.? If we are going to meet in this pattern, is it worthwhile our giving real consideration to a five-day week and making some arrangements for our wives and families to have more travel to and from Canberra and such Uke? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is a whole series of factors involved which ought to be considered in relation to this matter. I make the point that Ministers &#39; wives are able to travel whenever they feel it necessary. I know that honourable members will say that they have to get back to their electorates and so on but on Friday nights at what time will they get back to their electorates? At what time would they leave on Sundays and so on? If we are to make a fortnight&#39;s foray of some sort into the Parliament we might as well do it properly, make a whole job of it and meet as much as possible during the day time. Perhaps it is better to have committees and other groups meeting in the evenings. A whole series of factors is involved in the way in which this Parliament operates resulting from new subjects coming before it. We have never given the matter proper consideration, nor have we taken enough time for people to be able to predict what we are going to do. The reason why it has not worked in the past when we have changed the times in the way I suggest is that it has always been done with only a few weeks notice. Most honourable members need five or six weeks notice so that they can clear up matters to which they have become committed. I think that the way we are meeting is idiotic. It is designed to make the place uninhabitable and the people bad tempered by the end of the week. To close down at 11 p.m. having started at 9 a.m., as most of us do, is totally nonsensical. It is no way to conduct the business of the Parliament or our own private affairs or anything else. I hope that we will very rapidly get around to considering the business of the House rather than the convenience of Ministers, Cabinets or the off-hand decisions on how to get through certain business in order to get away from the place as rapidly as possible. </para>

            <para>- This program of sitting at the times put forward by the Government is a clear indication of the Government&#39;s incompetence in the manner in which it is trying to run this Parliament. We sat in this chamber for the first month of this year debating the Address-in-Reply when honourable members just stood up and talked and talked a heap of garbage about nothing in particular. That was because the Government was not ready to get on with its legislation. Now legislation is being rushed through this place and the hours of the Parliament are being extended to such a degree that honourable members will be stuck here for five days of the week sitting for lengthy periods. Very few of them will have the opportunity of getting back into their electorates. Maybe it is all right for a Melbourne or Sydney member who can get back to his electorate in a reasonable time, but anyone who lives outside of those two cities will be battling to get back to his electorate by the Saturday morning. Honourable members&#39; constituents are entitled to see their members, to talk to them and to bring them their complaints. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With the way that the Government has this program set up, with the 6 o&#39;clock finish on Friday nights, I think it should at least be reasonable. It should at least have a look at what the Senate has been doing for years. On a Thursday afternoon it has risen at 20 minutes to five so that senators could catch the 5.30 planes home. As far as the 6 o&#39;clock finish on the Friday night is concerned, there will be no more planes for Sydney or Melbourne after 5.30 p.m. I do not think the transport officer can persuade the airlines to hold the flights back to 6.30 or something to that effect. I am putting forward this point of view for the Acting Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> to give some consideration as to whether honourable members should be given the opportunity of getting back to their electorates to do the work that they are required to do. </para>
          <para>Let us face the real facts of life. The real reason why this sitting is being jammed up in this manner is so that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and the other Ministers can hop in their planes and get the hell out of the country. It is a pity they do not get out of it and stay out of it. The country would be run a lot better without Fraser being here as he is at the moment, making a botch of the economy, with the unemployment the way that it is at the present time. </para>

            <para>- in reply- The comments made by the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> and the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> amaze me. I do not know where they have been in recent times. They ought to be aware, as every member of this House is, that the 4-day sitting week has been introduced for a trial period only. Indeed, the 4-day sitting week has been introduced for a trial period to see whether it will assist those honourable members who live in isolated parts of Australia, such as members who have to travel to the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania. No final decision has been taken whether the 4-day sitting week will be retained. Honourable members should know- and had they been attending the House they would know- that this is for a trial period and it has been generally agreed to. I have taken note of the points raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young).</inline> I give him an assurance, as I do the House, that with the cooperation of the Opposition, the Government feels confident that in the program that has been announced this evening there will be adequate time for proper debate on the measures that the Government proposes to bring forward during this sitting. </para>

            <para>-The purpose of the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1978 is to enable the Commonwealth Development Bank to lend to a wider range of businesses than it can at present. Once again, as will happen always, when the Government has a reasonable idea to put to the nation and brings it into this Parliament in the form of legislation, the Opposition will not be opposing it; in fact we will be supporting it. I suppose the consequence of that, as all of us must realise, is that this legislation now will not get much publicity in the community. I wish to say how sorry I am that that is so because I would like many more small businesses to know about it and to be able to take advantage of it. The fact is that the fourth estate, which is very important to us and which disseminates information from this Parliament to the people, likes to report only those areas in which there is violent disagreement. There is no such disagreement on this legislation, I am happy to say. We are, however, moving an amendment at the second reading stage, but it is one of those amendments which put a point of view about the legislation without opposing it, and we certainly will not be voting against the legislation at the third reading stage. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I shall now mention a little more about the legislation. The functions of the Commonwealth Development Bank are set out in section 72 of the Commonwealth Bank Act. This section enables the Bank to provide finance to persons for two purposes. The first purpose is that of primary production. As a practitioner many years ago, before I became a member of this Parliament, I know just how valuable the legislation is to those primary producers who are lucky enough to be able to qualify for a loan. The second purpose of a Commonwealth Development Bank loan is for the establishment or development of industrial and tourist undertakings. The amendment which the Bill seeks to make to section 72 will enable the Bank to provide finance for the establishment or development of all business undertakings by removing the restrictions which confine the Bank to financing only industrial and tourist undertakings. As at present, the Development Bank will continue to be required to give emphasis to the provision of finance for small businesses as opposed to larger businesses. As is currently the case, prospective borrowers will need to establish that the finance sought is not otherwise available. I believe that they will be able to establish that easily in many cases because indeed the traditional trading bank sources are not available to small businesses in the way that we would like, particularly because of the relevant monetary squeeze that is applying in the nation at present in the wake of the Government&#39;s present contractionary monetary and fiscal policies. I want to say more about that later. </para>
          <para>In determining whether finance should be provided, the Development Bank will not necessarily have regard to the value of the relevant security but will have regard primarily to the prospects of the operation being successful. It is pleasing for those of us who believe that the traditional sources in the banking system in this country are too conservative and look too much to security rather than competence and administrative ability that perhaps an additional source of finance will be available not only to the innovators in the community who come to such an enormous extent from small businesses but also to the battlers who can no doubt prove that they are viable and competent and who provide such a splendid service to the Australian community in their particular forms of endeavour. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard),</inline> in his second reading speech, stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To what extent additional funds may be required for the Development Bank&#39;s entry into this wider field of operations cannot be determined at this stage, but the position will be closely watched. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is claimed by the Minister that this widening of the charter of the Development Bank represents a further step in a series of initiatives&#39; which are in response to the Government&#39;s awareness of increasing concern in the business community about the adequacy of funds for small business growth and development. Specifically, the move is said to have been made following consideration of the report of the task force set up to investigate the question of finance for small business. </para>
          <para>I shall make some comments on that part of the Minister&#39;s speech to this House in which he talked about not knowing what additional funds would be required and in which he claimed that the widening of the charter would represent a significant step forward. He cannot have it both ways. If it is to be a significant step forward, a lot more funds are required. This gets to the heart of the Opposition&#39;s amendment which I will move at the end of my speech. We must recognise that the Commonwealth Development Bank is already using in a very worthwhile way all the resources that are available to it. If we are to widen the charter, if we are to make more people eligible to borrow from the Bank and if this is to be a significant move, quite clearly the extent to which this move is successful will be determined by the amount of funds available to the Commonwealth Development Bank. We in the Labor Opposition are extremely worried about that aspect of this measure because of the blinkered economic policies of the Government with an attack-inflation-only mentality which we believe is not sufficient to get this economy moving. Indeed the International Monetary Fund in its latest report and at meetings which have just concluded in Washington is recognising that we need more of a venturesome, expansionary attitude and we need this Government to encourage the Commonwealth Development Bank by making more funds available to it. If it does that, we can welcome this legislation far more wholeheartedly than we can at present. Once again I will return to this matter later. </para>
          <para>Why was the report of the task force on small business finance to which I referred earlier not tabled? What did the task force recommend? Did it propose policies which the Government did not want to adopt? I think that for the sake of good government, more open government and better government for small businesses of this nation, the Liberal-National Country Party Government would have done us all a service if it had tabled the report of the task force upon which it has based this legislation. I believe that probably that task force recommended many other ways for small business- that vital and important sector in this community- to be assisted than the method we have before us. In the interests of good government, in the interests of an easier life for that important sector, I appeal to the Government to make that task force report available. The move that we are debating will not help the vast majority of small businesses since it extends only to the activities of the Development Bank and small businesses in areas other than rural, tourist and industrial activities. Therefore it is likely to give little relief to the problems to which the Government has admitted, namely, the inadequacy of funds flowing from finance organisations for growth and development of small businesses. </para>
          <para>I believe that the report of the task force, the tabling of which I am calling for in the Parliament, would have included other recommendations. They would have helped enormously beyond the extent we are able to help the small business community under the legislation which we are debating tonight and which is related to the Commonwealth Development Bank. As I have said already, the Government gives no undertaking to increase the funds available to the Development Bank so that it can fulfil its wider functions. The only comment is- I repeat what is stated in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech- that &#39;the position will be closely watched&#39;. This is a meaningless comment in a situation in which the Reserve Bank of Australia is required to watch closely all bank operations. The position is being watched already. What we want to hear from the Minister is that, in order to be able to cater for that wider group which now, under this legislation, is able to appeal to the Commonwealth Development Bank for funds, more funds will be available from the Bank and that no more rationing than is taking place now will take place in the future. Without additional funds, it will clearly be impossible for the Development Bank to expand its activities without contracting its lending to the rural, tourist and industrial areas. </para>
          <para>Funds for the Development Bank come mainly from capital subscribed by the Commonwealth Government and also from lending by the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. In a situation of tight monetary policy, it seems unlikely that the Commonwealth Trading or Savings Banks will be allowed to expand substantially their lending to the Development Bank. In the tight budgetary policy which we are hearing about each day and with the deficit soaring to about $6 billion before cuts take place, I am wondering how much will be appropriated from Commonwealth funds in order to assist the Commonwealth Development Bank to meet its wider charter. There are many other methods of bolstering small business finance, some of which have been foreshadowed by the Government. For example, the Government should enable the Development Bank to provide equity finance for small business and it should extend the activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. However, having said that I cite the rumours which have been circulated in the Press and to which credence has been given by word of mouth that the AIDC aspect of helping small business is now being scrapped. Perhaps an honourable member on the Government side who is more privy to the information available in this area will be able either to confirm or deny that the AIDC is not involving itself in this area. </para>

              <para>- Yes, he is a bachelor. I was explaining other ways in which small business with its great need for investment funds might be helped. In addition to the possibility of the AIDC providing help- that possibility now seems to be close- there is the other likelihood of forming joint ventures between State and private sector institutions for the provision of small business finance. I commend that course of action to the Commonwealth Government and the various State governments. Of course, they should make available further funds to bolster the small business sector. I am very glad to be able to say that in my Labor State of South Australia, the Department of Economic Development has a section which is devoted to making funds available to small businesses which need bolstering in this way. I know that in other States there are small business departments or sections of departments which are also devoted to the same purpose. However, the Government has proved to be tardy in introducing further measures along these lines. We live in hope. I am fortunate enough now along with the honourable member for Henty, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Aldred),</inline> to be a member of the Small Business Advisory Council. We are tackling these problems of small business in an apolitical, non-partisan way. I hope that the honourable member will agree with me. It will be for the benefit of our nation if it can be shown that this is so. But on every possible occasion I reserve for myself the right to needle the Government into making more efforts for this important sector, that is the small business sector of our community. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Government seems to have conveniently ignored the fact that the principal cause of &#39;the inadequacy of funds flowing to small business&#39;- I quote again from the Minister&#39;s second reading speech- is the Government&#39;s tight monetary policies. In general small companies tend to be the first hit during periods of monetary restraint. They are denied full access to the range of financial institutions available to larger companies. In addition to that, they are required to pay higher interest rates than are larger companies which have greater security. I must emphasise that point. Multinational companies have their use in our community with the technology that they bring to us. We in the Australian Labor Party believe that it will be in their interests, as well as in the interests of the Australian community generally, if we lay down codes of conduct and limitations within which multinational companies can work. But I raise the subject of multinational companies in the context of their being able to borrow virtually all the money they want, if needs be by a transfer of funds from overseas. They are not constrained in the same way so many smaller companies are constrained. Nor are the larger Australian companies constrained. They do not have the ready sources of finance from overseas- the transfers- that make them less worried by monetary constraints. Multinational companies must go to banking sources for their funds but their bigness means that they have a large clout when it comes to borrowing money <inline font-style="italic">from their</inline> bankers. </para>
          <para>But all of this does not apply to small business. Small business is really worried and really troubled when it comes to the sorts of monetary squeezes that we have had applied to this nation over the last two years of mismanagement. I will sum up the position in this way: In those two years of mismanagement- the period when there should have been economic revival due to our policies- revival has been postponed by Government policy. Lack of working capital and credit restrictions contributed to nearly half the business bankruptcies in 1975-76 according to Professor Meredith in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Current Affairs Bulletin</inline> of April 1977. 1 believe that we have not received the more recent figures in respect of bankruptcies for 1976-77, so we must rely on statistics from that earlier year. </para>
          <para>In summary, while the Opposition is not opposing this Bill, it will move an amendment at the second reading stage, as I have already indicated. We are firmly of the opinion that this proposal, as with many others in the small business area, is largely an exercise in deceptive windowdressing. Although we have witnessed a series of announcements, in contrast to the virtual silence of governments before December 1972, we all have a justification for being critical and cynical about these latest moves. I will repeat that statement using other words: Prior to 1972, Liberal and National Country Party governments did nothing for the small business sector. At least we must be thankful for small mercies. We should build on the efforts made by the Whitlam Government which set up the Small Business Bureau. We acted in this area to assist small business. But at least we have some windowdressing noises these days. This could develop into something worth while. But it has not yet. For the reason set out in the amendment and for the reasons that I have indicated already, we do not know yet what funds will be available. The change indicated in this legislation, with announcements regarding further extensions to the Development Bank- I have mentioned the AIDC but that is now much in doubt- and with the instruction to the Reserve Bank that it is the Government&#39;s policy that adequate finance should be made available to small business all means that there is a little hope of affecting something for other than an inconsequential minority of small businesses. </para>
          <para>I must say that many of the Government&#39;s actions have had the effect, if not always the intention, of tipping the scales even further against small business. That is why we in the Opposition are particularly pleased with any legislation that helps to redress the imbalance. I want to list the sorts of things that have caused small businesses to be worse off than their big business brothers. I refer to such actions as the downgrading of the Small Business Bureau, which was set up by the Whitlam Government and operated in an area that is perhaps one of the most vital for small business- helping small businessmen with their management problems. We must recognise that a lot of these innovative, small entrepreneurial characters who come off the shop floor have not had any experience of administration or of management. They have the ideas and the drive, but they need the training and the education to help them in what is for the most part a strange field, this field of management, of accounting, and the like. They have their own skills in the area in which they have chosen to pursue their small business interests but they do not have other management skills that are necessary. The assistance that the Small Business Bureau can give them in meeting their management needs is most important. That is why I am terribly disappointed at the downgrading of the Bureau as part of the credit squeeze during the time of the Fraser Government. That is only one of the matters that has resulted in an imbalance, and has meant that the Government has hit the small businessman to leg compared with his big brother in the larger business community. </para>
          <para>I refer also to the Trade Practices Act allowing a greater range of anti-competitive practices to go unhindered, to discriminating aspects of the investment allowance, and to the recently announced extensions of export incentives. I believe these have not helped the small businessman to the same extent as his bigger brother. When it comes to export incentives let me put my personal view before the House. I am not suggesting in any way that bigger businesses should be excluded: They are the motor of our economy and certainly they must be helped, but we must give even more help to smaller businesses. What small business needs more than anything else is an expanding economy. What it is getting is a stagnating economy- the result of the false analysis and the false philosophies of the present Government. It is only when we get expansions in the economies of the world- particularly in our own economy, over which we have a control, as has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Witteveen,</inline> the Director-General of the International Monetary Fund, and by other leaders of the world apart from our own Prime Minister- when we get an extension of government spending, particularly in public works and in training and retraining in order to meet the great need that we have for more skilled people, and when we get local employment programs to do something for the half million Australians who are now unemployed that small businesses will really be helped. </para>
          <para>I draw attention to a letter dated 14 March 1978 that was sent to the Prime Minister by somebody from your own State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> I am not sure whether he is from your own electorate. He is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr F.</inline> W. Pilgrim of 38 Dolphin Street, Scarborough, Queensland. A copy of his letter has just been sent to me. As he is a small businessman I quote some of it, because the letter has gone to the Prime Minister and I think it ought to be brought to the attention of the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pilgrim</inline> admits that he is a Liberal.

            <para>-At the outset I must say that on this occasion I welcome the enlightened attitude of the Opposition in supporting this Bill. I hope that that enlightened attitude passes into many other areas. I congratulate the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> on his speech which, in many respects was quite well informed and obviously well researched as to the problems of small business. However, at the beginning I must take issue with one comment he made. Perhaps I take issue with two or three of his comments, but the one I mention in particular is his remark that the Government had overemphasised the importance of combating inflation. It must be understood quite clearly that the high level of inflation we have experienced in recent years, much of which came from certain policies of the previous Government and much of which came from other sources, has been one of the root causes of many of the problems that face small business. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>To attempt to downgrade the importance of reducing inflation is a little unrealistic. However, I would agree with the general assertion of the honourable member for Adelaide that one cannot become carried away with combating inflation as the only objective of economic policy. There are other objectives, but certainly combating inflation cannot be downgraded or underestimated if other problems are to be solved. </para>
          <para>One of the most important features of the Bill is that it shows quite clearly the careful integrated policy that the Government has brought down in respect of small business. All governments from time to time are accused of acting in an ad hoc way when they introduce particular policies, simply reacting to the circumstances of the moment and doing whatever is expedient in the short term. However, over the last couple of years the Government has looked very carefully at the major problem areas confronting small business and has attempted systematically and rationally to overcome those problems. I must give due credit to the previous Labor Government, which was one of the first at the national level, through the National Small Business Bureau and some other initiatives, to take steps to examine the problems. Since then the whole matter has been taken a lot further and has been put on a much more systematic basis. </para>
          <para>Basically we can divide the problems of small business into four major areas. There is the general burden of taxation, the need for management advice, to which the honourable member for Adelaide referred in some detail, the general question of the liaison of small business with government, and finally, the need for adequate finance for small business, which is the area with which we are concerned tonight. This Bill is in fact a response to that need. I will mention briefly what has been done in those other areas to help overcome some of the problems that small business has faced. In the taxation area a number of actions have been taken over the last couple of years. These include the investment allowance, the trading stock valuation adjustment, the increased retention allowance for private companies, tax indexation, the tax cuts that were introduced on 1 February this year, and the recent abolition of estate and gift duty, which is of tremendous benefit to small family businesses and rural enterprises. Those are the sorts of initiatives that have been taken quite systematically to relieve the general level of the taxation burden imposed upon small business. </para>
          <para>In the area of management advice, it has been said quite correctly in this debate that one of the major problems faced by small business is that many small businessmen come from a background where they have been skilled in a particular trade and have no knowledge of or training or experience in management techniques, financial planning, bookkeeping, accounting and so on. It is very important that they be equipped with those skills if they are to overcome the problems they face. To that end, a series of booklets on management techniques has been produced by the Department of Industry and Commerce. Training material and training films have been prepared, and the Commonwealth will also become involved shortly in helping the States to train counsellors and consultants to assist small business. </para>
          <para>In making his comments on this Bill the honourable member for Adelaide referred to the fact that the National Small Business Bureau had been done away with. In fact the National Small Business Bureau has been reintegrated into the Department of Industry and Commerce and there is now the Small Business Branch inside the Department which performs much the same role as the old National Small Business Bureau performed. The reason for taking the Bureau back into the Department was that a lot of the work the Bureau was doing was carefully tied in with the rest of the work of the Department and it was somewhat artificial to have it broken off as a separate entity from the Department of Industry and Commerce. It made good sense to move the Bureau back into the Department, particularly when the States moved into the consultancy area on a large scale and it was no longer necessary for the Commonwealth to be involved in having regional offices to advise small businessmen. </para>
          <para>So far as the third major problem area is concerned, the question of liaison with small business, the Government&#39;s major initiative has been the setting up of the Small Business Advisory Council, of which the honourable member for Adelaide and I are fortunate enough to be members. In that regard, I must commend the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> who has taken personal chairmanship of that Council along with other industry advisory councils, the chairmanship of which is shared between himself and the two other Ministers involved in the industry area, the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife).</inline> Up until the time the present Minister for Industry and Commerce took over the portfolio the industry advisory councils were not chaired by a Minister but by a departmental officer. I think the Minister is to be commended for taking a personal interest in and personal charge of these very important councils, of which the Small Business Advisory Council is one of the most critical. </para>
          <para>The remaining area of small business with which I wish to deal relates to the amendment of the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank, which is proposed in the Bill before the House. The amendment seeks to overcome the problem of the shortage of finance from which small business has suffered. A considerable body of evidence has been put together in recent years to show that small business has major difficulties in obtaining sufficient finance, not only for expansion and development purposes but also for straight-out working capital, and this Bill attempts to overcome that problem. There are many reasons why small business has trouble in obtaining finance. One of the major reasons is that financial institutions tend to look upon small business as being a more risky enterprise than medium to larger businesses, and banks and other financial institutions are more loath to extend credit in one form or another to small business than they are to lend to other forms of enterprise. One of the major reasons why the extension of the Commonwealth Development Bank charter is so necessary is that there is hesitation on the part of financial institutions to lend money to small businesses, sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly. </para>
          <para>One of the other major causes for small business being short of finance is that, because of the tendency of the financial institutions not to extend credit freely, it has to depend very much on other forms of high cost finance such as credit companies and finance companies, often at high rates of interest. In those circumstances, it is often simply not practical for small business to enter into such commitments. As a result of those restrictions, often small business has to fall back on its own internal sources of funds for finance. In recent years, as we well know, inflation has eroded earnings because of increased operating costs, the increased cost of holding stocks and of attempting to finance expansion and development. For all of those reasons it has become much more difficult for small business to finance its own development from its own internal revenue sources. Certainly initiatives such as the increased retention allowances under Division 7 of the taxation provisions go a long way towards resolving those problems, but they are still not resolved completely. Small business is still left with the fundamental problem that it does not have sufficient capital in its own internal resources to provide sufficient money for development, and that is one of the reasons why this Bill has been introduced. </para>
          <para>Small business today employs something of the order of two million people, with a further three million family dependants and so on who rely on the operations of small business. In fact we are talking about a total of five million people out of a population of 14 million who are either directly or indirectly dependent upon the activities of small business. In that light this Bill takes on a more critical importance and significance. Almost 40 per cent of the work force and a very large proportion of the population are dependent on what happens to small business. The Bill is aimed at extending the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank so that it can lend freely to all forms of business undertakings, particularly small businesses. To date the Commonwealth Development Bank has been restricted mainly to lending to the industrial, tourism and rural sectors, and in those areas it has established an excellent reputation. That is one reason why the Government can with great confidence give to the Commonwealth Development Bank this extended and further role in loaning money to all forms of enterprises. </para>
          <para>The other great advantage in extending the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank to assist small business lies in the fact that it is one of the few bodies throughout the country which in fact has an extensive network of branches and agencies which are accessible and available to small business. There are few other bodies, particularly government bodies, which are in that fortunate position. That is another reason why this Bill represents a particularly valuable step in extending the source of finance available to small business. </para>
          <para>I again commend the Opposition for supporting the Bill. I think it is a very important Bill. As the honourable member for Adelaide said, it is perhaps unfortunate in some ways that there is not some sort of disagreement in relation to the Bill, because had there been a major disagreement on the Bill it might have received more publicity. Let us hope that as time goes by, through the normal channels of information provided by the Government, small businessmen will become aware that this extra source of finance is now available. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>-The debate on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill is, and I have no doubt will be, fairly non-controversial, because it is the attitude of the Opposition that the Government should be supported, aided and abetted to every possible extent in overcoming the malaise in business and the great difficulties that are being so widely experienced throughout Australia. I do not have great anticipation of significant results ensuing from this legislation, but hope springs eternal in the human breast. We have heard so much of Government promises in the past and we have seen so little manifestation of them. Of course, in recent times we have had the advice of the international monetary and trade organisations which have been looking at Australia and commenting on us. I refer to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund in particular. I suppose this legislation could be put up as response to the International Monetary Fund&#39;s recommendation of last weekend, which was to the effect that the developing countries should be taking some significant steps to stimulate the economy. So far we have heard nothing else in the way of a response to that call for activity. The recommendation applies to Australia as much as it applies to any other country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have an appalling rate of unemployment in Australia which obviously affects the small business people as much as it affects the big business people. Who will go into business unless at the end of the line there is in evidence a buoyant consumer. Of course, while we have such an outstanding rate of unemployment that confidence and buoyancy will not be in evidence. That is also the case while we have the startling job vacancy figures that were released just a short time ago. There are 20,000 job vacancies in Australia and about 600,000 people available to fill them. One cannot help but feel that the small business entrepreneur not only will lack confidence but also will find that confidence will be denied him by those who have to support him. lt is as plain as a pikestaff that they have not been supported sufficiently by the traditional lending institutions. No doubt that is one of the reasons why this legislation has been introduced. There is a vacuum to fill. </para>
          <para>The old ebb and flow of the market place apparently is not working out too well because the Government does not have a fundamental enthusiasm about the Commonwealth Development Bank playing a bigger part than it has to. The Government has a tendency to minimise the role of the public authorities in this country. If there is some kind of profitability in giving a hand to a small businessman or a big businessman, the Government would see that role being carried out normally by the private sector. It does not want the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Commonwealth Development Bank or anything else of a public character getting into the act any more than they have to. It sees these instrumentalities as being ones of last resort- something to call on when the other authorities are not terribly responsive. Of course, the plight of the small businessman, the entrepreneurial person who initiates the small business, is more serious today than it has been for a long time, as I will point out in a moment. </para>
          <para>I know that great play has been made of the Government&#39;s intentions in relation to this matter. It was the present  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> who said in November 1975: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The tragic destruction of small business must end. We are determined that the progressive collapse of the nation&#39;s small businesses will be arrested. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was part of the ploy of that  Deputy  Prime Minister- he was not then the  Deputy  Prime Minister, of course; the Labor Government was in office- to win the support of the bedraggled small business people and especially the farmers whom the National Country Party traditionally let down, despite all the things that its members say about them. That comment was made in November 1975. The chickens have not yet come home to roost. The Government has not arrested this great problem in the small business area. So, this evening the Parliament has before it the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill, and only time will tell the extent to which the Bill represents pie in the sky. I see it as another little stanza, another bit of mouth to mouth resuscitation, just something to keep small businesses going, to keep the pot boiling, as it were, just to keep the propaganda going out, just to keep the carrot in front of the donkey a bit, if honourable members like. But when we come to measure the results of this legislation in three years&#39; time or five years&#39; time, if the present Government is still in office, I confidently predict that a great deal will be found wanting. </para>
          <para>Let me deal with the purpose of the Bill. Primarily its purpose is to remove the present restrictions on the lending activities of the Commonwealth Development Bank to enable it to lend to all kinds of businesses. We know that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> indicated in his second reading speech that businesses have to be viable. I suppose that is fair enough where a public instrumentality is involved. As I indicated, we wonder about the extent to which this legislation represents a gesture to the small business people and whether it will really be successful in resurrecting their enterprises. The main provisions of the Bill, of course, are in respect of section 72 which is to be found in Part VIII of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. The Bill amends section 72 to enable the Bank to provide finance for the establishment or development of all types of business undertakings, particularly small business undertakings, which are described in sub-clause (3) (a) of the Bill and also to provide advice and assistance to the full range of business undertakings that will be eligible to borrow from it. That is covered in sub-clause (3) (b) of the Bill. </para>
          <para>I think honourable members will recall that in 1974 the Labor Government, under the Commonwealth Banks Act 1974, extended the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank to allow the Bank to provide finance for tourist development projects, especially smaller projects in selected areas. I am surprised that in the context of the second reading debate the Parliament and the people have not had the benefit of advice as to the stewardship of this Government in giving effect to that Act. We hear a lot of conjecture and contention to the effect that the tourist industry should be encouraged in Australia. We made it possible in 1974 for the Commonwealth Development Bank to do something about the tourist industry. I suggest that, although that objective is very much in keeping with the amending legislation which is before the House at the moment, there has been a lack of enthusiasm in relation to the amendments with which we are dealing now and that there is not much to show in terms of results from assistance given to the tourist industry. </para>
          <para>A subsequent speaker in the debate can pick me up if I am wrong in making this statement: It would have been appropriate for the Treasurer to have said in his second reading speech: &#39;In 1974 our predecessors extended the powers of the Commonwealth Development Bank in respect of an industry which is often languishing and we want to exhibit our enthusiasm by giving effect to that&#39;. Not one solitary word has been said about that matter. Why is that so? There is not much to show in the report of the Development Bank because not much has been included there. I have that report before me at present. </para>
          <para>This Bill widens the lending activities of the Bank further by allowing it to go outside the rural, industrial and tourist sectors into new sectors, such as wholesaling, retailing, professional services, entertainment and the service industries generally. There is a great smorgasbord. There will not be much of an excuse when the Government comes to the reckoning table, say, on the eve of the next Federal election. I think that this will be a very good issue to resurrect at that time. </para>
          <para>The Bank will provide finance only if it is not otherwise available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. It will supplement and not compete with other banks or sources of finance. The Treasurer said in his second reading speech:   . . prospective borrowers need to establish, to the satisfaction of the Bank, that the finance sought is not otherwise available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. </para>
          <para class="block">One wonders why we have a public bank so hobbled; when no one else wants the business the Commonwealth Development Bank can take it up. The Bank must satisfy itself that the business will be viable. This Government has never thought of putting the Commonwealth Development Bank into a virile competitive situation with the other banks. It is only when nobody else wants the business that the Development Bank will be able to offer its services, but then only to a limited extent. </para>
          <para>Before I lose sight of the objectives of the Bill, I point out that included in the other measures announced in October 1977 was the intention that the Development Bank be enabled to provide equity finance to small business. I have noticed- I do not think any honourable member will deny what I am saying- that this Bill does not implement that decision in any way. Possibly that matter is still under examination by the Government. Hopefully the matters concerning the prospects of assistance by the Australian Industry Development Corporation might also be the subject of a governmental announcement on some future occasion. </para>
          <para>Underlying this whole matter is the question of funds, because the sources of finance for the Development Bank in the past have been the capital market, the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the Commonwealth Government. The Treasurer stated in his second reading speech that the extent of additional funds required for the wider operations of the Bank is not yet known. None have been provided at this stage. Quoting the Treasurer&#39;s exact words, he stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To what extent additional funds may be required for the Development Bank&#39;s entry into this wider field of operations cannot be determined at this stage, but the position will be closely watched. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker,</inline>the Labor Government did move on this matter. In May 1974 we established the National Small Business Bureau. Regrettably there has been this process of devolution, that is, of undoing what the Labor Government did. This Government wants to find its own way, but is has not really identified its own way. As long as it tips overboard the enactments of the Labor Government it seems to regard that as progress. </para>
          <para>This Government downgraded the National Small Business Bureau and made it the Finance and Small Business Branch of the Tertiary Industry Division of the Treasury. It is poked away in an obscure back cupboard or pigeonhole in a ministry which has virtually lost its significance to the small business people of this country. All this represents a very unhappy situation. As I look back I know that these are the facts of life: In the financial year 1976-77, according to the Australian Statistician, there were 1,270 business bankruptcies and 926 non-business bankruptcies, representing a total of 2,196 bankruptcies, which is near the record level. We are told that the current rate is that in the vicinity of 230 small businesses are failing each week. </para>
          <para>As I read through the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Robert</inline> Cotton, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, which I have quoted tonight, I can see the buck passing that he has engaged in in turning over to the States so many of the Commonwealth Government&#39;s obligations. In terms of the new federalism policy the Government has not given the States sufficient funds to enable them to make a significant contribution to the alleviation of problems in the small business area. As I look at these problems- there is no time to go through them- I realise that the Government has little more than some intentions. Whether they are good intentions only the passing of time will prove. Judging by the record of this Government, which already has had several years to give expression to those objectives so enthusiastically espoused on the hustings in 1975, 1 would say that, given time, it will prove to be a disaster. </para>

Here was a man who they thought would control them. He had no idea of what they did and no idea of how to control them.

              <para>- Silent Sam they call him. He has just crept into the House and is talking about the banking system. It is a shame that as a small businessman himself he has not been here for the whole debate. Let us recall what the Government has done. Reference has been made already to the fact that in October last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Robert</inline> Cotton- I do not think he was knighted then; he was certainly the Minister for Industry and Commerce- presaged this legislation in the Senate in a substantial statement dealing with small business finance. I recommend that statement to all honourable members on both sides of this House. It was equally heartening to those on this side of the House to hear the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, state again in his policy speech last year the need for some action and of his intention to move in this matter. I congratulate the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> for bringing this legislation before the House so soon after the recent election. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>My friend the honourable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Aldred)</inline> has described in a most excellent manner the positive achievements of the Fraser Government since last December. I have no need to repeat his sentiments. I am very happy to endorse them. What he described and what the House and the country must take note of is the fact that our whole approach to the problem of small business has been systematic and planned. Of course there can be no doubting that this is a most unfortunate section of the community. It is a section of the community that everybody has overlooked, except, if I may say so, the socialists of this country. One of the easiest ways for socialists to nationalise a country is to see that small businessmen of all categories are put out of business, receive no encouragement and are taken over and controlled by large businesses which the socialists then proceed to nationalise one by one. If we do not really understand this situation let us look at some of the countries where the so-called social democrats have taken over. This has been their exact method of operation and, with due respect, it was the exact method of operation of the Whitlam Government. Any government which could introduce a 25 per cent tariff cut across the board could have had no concern for the small businesses that were thrown out of business almost immediately. Let the small businesses of Australia remember that Act which was introduced by the people who today maintain that they and they alone have an interest and a concern for small businessmen. They talk with forked tongue. </para>
          <para>Getting back to the legislation and resisting the temptation to talk about the Opposition, I point out it is vital that we protect and encourage those small businesses currently in difficulty. As my friend from Henty asked earlier: &#39;Who got them into that difficulty&#39;? It is worth remembering that it was not the present Government. We must also consciously encourage the establishment of new, vigorous, virile small businesses throughout Australia. They are the very lifeblood of the Australia we want to see coming about. I hope that the Treasurer, on assuming the new role of becoming more involved than previously with the Commonwealth Development Bank&#39;s borrowing program, will instruct that Bank that it must remain aware of the need for and of new small business enterprises when determining its new style lending policy, as required by this legislation. It should not merely provide developmental finance for established small businesses only. This new lending policy must be applied to new entrepreneurs who have been restricted from getting under way because of a lack of developmental finance. The honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Robert</inline> Cotton&#39;s remarks in the Senate last October. Let me quote from that speech. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Robert</inline> Cotton went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Reserve Bank has been advised that it is the Government&#39;s policy that adequate finance should be made available to small business and that no arbitrary limits should be placed on such finance. It has been asked to inform the major groups of financial institutions that lending criteria should be reviewed in the light of the Government&#39;s policy and to approach finance industry groups with a view to achieving better communications within their respective areas, aimed at improving the finance facilities available to small businesses. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">All honourable members on both sides of the House have had constituents come to them and say that they have been informed by their local bank manager that the reason they have not been given a loan is because Reserve Bank restrictions have forced bank managers to reject a particular overdraft application. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> you and I have taken this matter up with the present Treasurer and previous Treasurers on each occasion we have had this matter before us. On each occasion we have had a firm and reliable assurance from these men that no credit restrictions were in force, most certainly not with regard to small business. Perhaps there have been instances of bank managers making these excuses as an easy way out when in fact the application for credit has been refused either because of the inability of the business involved to meet the requirements of trading banks, which are not in a position to provide developmental finance, or because of the incapacity of the business man or woman to show proof of an ability to service a larger debt in the necessarily short term nature of trading bank overdrafts. We heard the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> talk about the Commonwealth Development Bank as if it were just another trading bank competing with the trading banks around the town. Obviously the Opposition does not have a clue in creation as to what on earth a Commonwealth Development Bank is meant to be. It is meant to provide funds that are not available anywhere else in our banking system. We heard the sarcasm of the honourable member for Hughes about the statement that &#39;prospective borrowers will need to establish&#39;- I quote from the Minister&#39;s speech, as did he- &#39;to the satisfaction of the bank, that the finance sought is not otherwise available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions&#39;. That shows that honourable members opposite do not have even the first clue about what development finance is all about. It is like their hide, luxuriating in this ignorance, to move an amendment to this legislation. </para>
          <para>It is significant that the Commonwealth Development Bank can now make the longer term loan that development finance involves. It is very significant- and I hope all speakers on the other side are aware of it- that the Commonwealth Development Bank will also provide assistance and advice for the full range of business undertakings that will now benefit under this newly expanded area of the Commonwealth Development Bank. The honourable member for Hughes also mentioned as a fact that this side of the </para>
          <para class="block">House had no interest in the Commonwealth Development Bank. My God, it was this Government that brought the Commonwealth Development Bank into existence. It was my party which saw the real need for a development bank. It saw the need for that development bank to be under the auspices of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. I think that even though it had difficulties in the beginning in determining what its role was it has provided a useful service to business people in Australia. Anyone who is at all concerned about small business should be delighted that we brought this legislation forward. I am pleased to see the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> in the chamber. I repeat that he is to be congratulated on bringing in this legislation so quickly after the recent election. </para>
          <para>I refer to one point about the Commonwealth Development Bank that may not win me many friends. I hope that the Commonwealth Development Bank will not be using this new area of lending responsibility as a means of encouraging small businesses to take all their banking business to the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. I know that it has always been within the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank not to require any organisation seeking developmental finance from it to bring all its banking business to the Commonwealth Trading Bank or Commonwealth Savings Bank. Honourable members will realise that the three banks are the constituent members of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> from my own experience 1 have never been convinced that in fact this is not the case. I hope that the passing of this legislation will give the Treasurer a fresh opportunity of reminding the Executive of the Commonwealth Development Bank that it is there to service the customers of all the trading banks and that no pressure should be brought to bear on clients of the trading banks to see that their accounts are transferred to other members of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. That is a fact that I have lived with for a long time as a former banker. </para>
          <para>I do not suggest that the officers of the Commonwealth Development Bank are in any way acting with malice or mischief. I believe that these things may have come about through an over-abundance of enthusiasm on the part of the officers. I accept that this professional enthusiasm on their pan has caused them to encourage accounts to be transferred to the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and its other member banks, namely, the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I beg the Treasurer to take up this matter and to see that this policy is very firmly brought in again. I do not wish to be contentious on this Bill. I feel that it is beyond that. I know of the deep concern of the following  speaker,  the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen),</inline> for finance for small businesses, of his personal experience in small business and successful experience in several small businesses. I hope that that will allow him to look beyond the philosophy of his own party and to accept from his personal experience that this Government has had a real interest in seeing that small businesses are kept operating. </para>
          <para>I know it must have come as an agony to the next  speaker  to hear the honourable member for Hughes mention that half-way during the Whitlam Ministry his party changed the Commonwealth Development Bank. The question was thrown at us of what we had done to encourage the Commonwealth Bank to get into tourism and the other areas that it extended into back in May 1974. It is a simple question. What on earth did the Whitlam Government do for the second half of its time in this place on the treasury bench in this regard or in any other regard? I put it to the House that the difference between the Opposition and the Government is quite fundamental. As one goes around the traps the sort of comment one hears is: &#39;The present Government may not have done all we wanted it to do but at least we know it is helping. With that previous lot&#39;- I quote my constituents, not myself- &#39;we were convinced that they were out to destroy us\ That is the basic difference in our philosophies. </para>
          <para>We may not be succeeding in certain areas, we may not have achieved the things that we desire to achieve- and as a member from this side of the House of the Small Business Advisory Council I can say that there are many areas in which I would like to see further things done- but with this legislation before the House, and I hear that apart from this incredible amendment the Opposition is going to support it, it is time for the House to sit back and say: &#39;Thank goodness the Government has acted in this area. Thank goodness it has expanded its operations and is encouraging the Commonwealth Development Bank to operate.&#39; </para>

            <para>- It is a rare and privileged occasion when the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie)</inline> stands up to make his annual speech. Talk about Silent Sam. I had forgotten what his voice sounded like. He ought to speak more often; he has quite a resonant voice. But I could not let some of his absurd remarks pass. I was not proposing to speak in this debate but he started to give us some of the Liberal rhetoric about free enterprise and equated- I emphasise this- a socialist government to a government which automatically cut tariffs and therefore ruined businesses. That is a fascinating exercise. I would have thought that any government that was an anti-tariff government and believed in free trade was essentially a free enterprise government. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> is smiling, It was the height of absurdity for the honourable member for Cook to make that claim. Whether one is in favour of free trade or protection is a separate question. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I could not allow the honourable member for Cook to get away with that piece of absolute nonsense. He said: &#39;I want total free enterprise. All I want is government subsidies, tax concessions, long-term low-interest loans, tariffs and quotas, but I am a free enterpriser&#39;. That is the sort of rubbish that we hear from some honourable members. If they would only be consistent and genuinely profess to be free enterprisers I could understand it. The honourable member for Cook and the honourable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Aldred)</inline> are all of a sudden spokesmen for the small business community. I do not know how much experience they have had. I understand that the honourable member for Henty is a defrocked public servant and the honourable member for Cook is a former bank manager. In my book no bank manager is a member of the small business community- ask anyone who is involved in small business. The honourable member claimed that there had been a massive resurgence of confidence in business. I can assure him that I, as a small businessman, and a successful one, and one of the few in this House who knows what genuine small business is all about, am aware that what he says is not correct. I am not talking about someone who has inherited a business but someone who started one. </para>

              <para>- Members on this side of the House believe in a mixed economy. If the honourable member would read the Labor Party&#39;s platform and stop talking the sort of nonsense that he does, he would understand what this is all about. How many members in this House are genuine small businessmen who have had to start with nothing and work from the bottom up? I am one who did and I made a success of it. There are quite a few on this side of the House, for instance, the honourable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John Brown).</inline> If one is good at business, generally speaking, one does not need government handouts. I do not need help from any government. Undoubtedly, sometimes there are occasions when government help is needed but generally speaking a genuine free enterprise businessman should not ask for help. That is the whole essence of it: One does struggle and fight and make one&#39;s own way. </para>

          <para>If the Government creates too many precedents like this one, everybody will expect help. That is in fact what has happened. That is what worries me about this series of legislative changes. The expectations of small businessmen are raised. The moment this new legislation comes in and development loans and such like are offered every small businessman suddenly believes he is eligible for that funding and that he has a genuine case. I am concerned that, once this happens, a lot of businessmen will be disappointed. When they learn that they are not included on the list they will go to see their bank manager and their federal member and anyone else whom they think might help. When the former Treasurer introduced legislation similar to this measure, I made a speech in which I said a lot of people would be disappointed. I have been answering some of the comments made by the honourable member for Cook who said how wonderfully business confidence had returned. </para>

I can assure him that retail business is in a terrible state. Sections of it are very bad and depressed. As for the motor car industry, one need only look at the figures to see how bad it is. The building industry is in a similar situation. One could go on and on and on. </para>

              <para>-We have waited for nearly 2te years but still there are no signs. Recovery is a long time coming. The Government knows that there are all sorts of problems that it is not facing up to. We are in for a fairly long period of stagnation. Whether they are all the fault of the Government, just as they were not all the fault of the former Labor Government, one does not know. There are problems with international economy. The Treasurer knows that; indeed, everyone knows it. I think Bob Hawke put it nicely when he said: &#39;It is about time you came clean with the Australian community and perhaps then you will get some co-operation&#39;. The Minister keeps telling the people that a boom is just around the corner, as the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie)</inline> also implied, and then wondering why, if things are so good and business is picking up and confidence is returning, people are asking why the hell they are supposed to take wage cuts? I shall not proceed further. I merely wanted to answer some of the comments made by the honourable member for Cook. </para>

            <para>-I am pleased that this legislation has been brought before the House. It was mooted in October last. It was promised during the election campaign. It is good to see that promise come to fruition. It will be of great benefit to the community. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Commonwealth Banks Act to enable the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia to lend to all kinds of businesses. The present restrictions which confine lending to rural, tourism and industrial sectors will be removed. The amendments will enable the Commonwealth Development Bank to extend its lending to the establishment and development of undertakings in business sectors such as retail, wholesale, professional services, entertainment and service industries generally, something that previously has been sadly lacking. As at present, the Bank will continue to be required to give emphasis to providing finance for all small business undertakings. </para>

          <para>I should like to make it clear that the Government attaches considerable importance to the small business sector in Australia, exemplifying as it does the essence of the free enterprise system. The Government recognises that small businesses are a vital source of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, thereby giving vigour and drive to the private sector of the economy. Small businesses are usually defined as those which are wholly owned and operated by individuals or persons in partnership or by a proprietor company within the meaning of a companies Act, and more often than not they are managed personally by the owners. Frequently they are defined as businesses with fewer than 100 employees in manufacturing and fewer than 20 employees in the retail, wholesale and other tertiary activities. </para>
          <para>According to recent statistics the small business sector encompasses about 200,000 enterprises in manufacturing industry, wholesale and retail trade, with a further 150,000 enterprises in the building, transport and other tertiary areas. Overall, excluding primary production, the small business sector comprises some 350,000 enterprises- over 90 per cent of all businesses- and employs nearly 40 per cent of the labour force, involving about 2 million people, as previous speakers have indicated. The importance of small business to the economic and social fabric of Australian life is greater than that indicated by the statistics. The small business sector provides a productive outlet for the energies of that large group of enterprising people who wish to be independent of large organisations in building their financial future. </para>
          <para class="block">Small businesses add considerably to the variety of products and services offered to the consumer because they can nourish in a limited or specialised market which would not be worthwhile or economic for a large firm to enter. </para>
          <para>In an industry where the optimum size of the production unit on the sales outlet is small, the most efficient form of business organisation is often a small firm. In an economy in which larger multi-product companies are common small businesses provide competition, both actual and potential, and facilitate the proper working of the price mechanism in the market place. In this way they contribute to the efficient working of the economic system as a whole. Many small firms act as specialist suppliers of parts, subassemblies or components produced at a lower cost than could be achieved by the large companies which purchase them. Small businesses are an important source of innovation in products, techniques and services and as such challenge and stimulate the more established leaders of industry. </para>
          <para>The spirit of independence and initiative fostered by small business is an essential element of our democratic society. Small businesses and individual enterprises contribute significantly to the national wealth and in so doing create opportunities for employment and assist in developing the nation&#39;s living standard. Governments of most industrialised and developing countries, including this Government, recognise the importance of small business in their economic structure and to varying degrees have developed programs to assist them. The United States of America has a declared national policy that free competition which is basic to economic well being cannot be realised unless small business is encouraged and developed. In the United States small business receives special taxation and financial assistance, loan and equity finance, management assistance and assistance with government procurement. Japan, for instance, has a small business policy similar to that of the USA and has developed a variety of programs along similar lines. The same applies to small firms in Canada. The Canadian Government provides equity and loan financing through the Federal Business Development Bank and is involved in providing venture capital. The Federal Business Development Bank is also responsible for the operation of a small business consulting service and sponsors a large number of management training courses specially designed for small business. </para>
          <para>In Australia we are developing policies aimed at overcoming some of the inherent disadvantages facing small business using self-help principles but avoiding an extension of direct government involvement in private enterprise. In particular, this means removing unintended and undesirable effects of legislation or procedures on small business. The Government recognises that it needs to give small business the opportunity to compete and grow in a business climate of increasing confidence and prosperity. Small businesses are very diverse, operating in all sectors of the economy. Their problems are not homogeneous, and they have been affected in different ways by adverse economic conditions. In these circumstances the Government is convinced that as economic recovery proceeds, the vitality of the private sector generally and of small business in particular will be enhanced. During the time of office of the Whitlam Government real wages outstripped productivity, and the profitability of business enterprises was squeezed. Government spending grew rapidly, and large public sector deficits led to excessive monetary expansion. Inflation, loss of confidence among consumers and businesses alike and unemployment were the results. </para>
          <para>Inflation threatens the very survival of many small businesses. Directly or indirectly, its effects are felt through lack of orders, higher interest rates and a worsening financial position, all of which contribute to a loss of confidence. In the context of recent economic conditions claims have been made that the trade credit position of many small firms has deteriorated sharply. This suggests that in some respects small businesses may have suffered more in recent years than larger companies. Small firms suffer because they are squeezed by larger suppliers and are unable to press for prompt payment by their customers. During difficult periods large enterprises may be able to absorb in various ways increased costs and falling sales. The smaller business often does not have this capacity. For example, small business generally has fewer sources of funds on which to rely for financing its activities. Unlike public companies, private companies are prohibited from soliciting equity and debenture funds from the public. In addition few institutional sources provide risk capital to assist in financing growth and development. </para>
          <para>The success of the economic strategy that has been pursued for the past 2% years has done much to improve the situation of the small business sector. However, against the background of particular problems facing small business, I now want to mention some of the steps that this Government has taken to assist small business. In the taxation field we have introduced a number of measures to help restore small business to economic health. In 1976 we introduced an investment allowance which applies at a rate of 40 per cent until the end of this financial year. The allowance will apply at a rate of 20 per cent from then until 30 June 1985. This incentive applies to individual items costing $500 or more and includes owner-used plant and equipment as well as that leased and acquired under hire purchase arrangements. The allowance is available to all businesses, including small businesses, although I am mindful of representations from small firms that have sought a reduction in the level of the monetary limit to which I have just referred. </para>
          <para>The trading stock valuation adjustment introduced in 1976 has contributed to improved cash flows. Other taxation measures which have been of benefit to small businesses include the indexation of personal income tax and the adjustments of personal income tax scales introduced in the last Budget that have been in effect since the beginning of February this year. Given that 75 per cent of all small businesses are unincorporated, a large number of them will benefit from these taxation measures. The Government has recently made further moves to lighten the tax burden. We all know that these scales were introduced and are operative in this financial year. We promised in the recent election campaign to phase out estate and gift duty. This commitment will be given effect in legislation to be enacted during the current session of Parliament. Family businesses, many of which in the past have had their very existence threatened by the untimely death of one or more of their principals, will appreciate the significance of this initiative. </para>
          <para>As mentioned previously, the Government is very conscious of the role played by small businesses in providing competition in the market place. It is essential that small businesses are encouraged to grow. This acts as a dynamic influence in the national economy as well as providing a stimulus by way of innovating a new product development. Small businesses have a great problem in accumulating capital. The cash that they accumulate is used up in paying provisional tax. This measure to give small businesses an added opportunity of gaining finance from the Commonwealth Development Bank will be of great benefit to them. Of course they will need to have exhausted every other avenue of obtaining finance, but if they are viable these funds will be made available through the Development Bank. I have very much pleasure indeed in supporting the Bill. I am pleased to note that the Opposition is substantially supporting it. It has moved an amendment to the Bill. But I think that honourable members opposite know in their hearts that this Bill is good for the Australian economy and that it is good for small business. Honourable members on this side of the House give it their full support. </para>

            <para>-I did not really expect to speak in the debate on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill. There was an arrangement that only two speakers from each side of the House would speak in the debate. But as the opportunity to speak has arisen, I will say a few words on the Bill. As the night is wearing on and as there are other Bills to be debated, I will not spend too much of the time of the House on it. The Opposition is supporting the Bill, lt has moved an amendment which basically encourages the Government to make more money available to small businesses. But what worries me is that in this situation honourable members opposite- the disciples and the supporters of small business people in Australia- rise in the House and mouth all the erroneous platitudes that small business people do not want to hear. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>First of all, we have heard honourable members opposite advance the argument constantly that the problems of small businesses today were promoted by the Labor Government. This is arrant nonsense. The figures indicate quite clearly that in Australia between 1969 and 1 972 the number of small businesses that went to the wall for any number of reasons was much greater than the number of small businesses which failed under the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975. So let us put that nonsense to bed once and for ever. The Australian Labor Party, in office, was the Party that provided some sort of vehicle or some sort of machinery for small business to have support. The small business support scheme was started by the Whitlam Government. It is very unfortunate that the present Government has seen fit to sink the scheme away in a cupboard in the back of a department. The honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> mentioned that he was a small businessman who started from nothing. So did I. We do not find it altogether exceptional that the honourable members on this side of the House have managed to succeed in their own business. We believe in a mixed economy. But we believe also that honourable members opposite should look at the real problems that are facing small business. They are not necessarily the problems which honourable members opposite have put forward. </para>
          <para>The reason that small business is having great difficulty in Australia is that you have succeeded in giving us a non-expansive economy. The Government has allowed the economy to sink or to contract to such an extent that all the confidence of the spending public has disappeared. The reason that small business is finding it difficult to make a profit and to exist can be found in the letter that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pilgrim</inline> has written to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> Surely this was not a case of <inline font-style="italic">Pilgrim&#39;s Progress.</inline> This was Pilgrim&#39;s retraction. He gave all the reasons why his business was failing. Out of a staff of 22 people, he has had to retrench seven. He has written about a lack of contracts, a lack of profit and a lack of support from his bank. The stagnation of the economy is the big problem that he is facing. It is when the economy is booming, when people are prepared to spend and when they have some confidence in the country&#39;s future that small business can see some future and can make some profit. While ever you people opposite do the things that you are doing, while ever you have this paranoia about the deficit and while ever you have this paranoia about reducing all the advantages that small business people want to see in the economy, then small businesses will fail. </para>

              <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> The unemployment rate that Australia suffered under a Labor Government was largely in Une with the rate of unemployment in all the developed countries of the world. This was also the case with the inflation rate. The difference since the change of government is that the rest of the world has been able to correct these ills while Australia has not been able to do so. Australia never will correct these ills while we have successive governments of its colour and while we have successive Treasurers who preach the sorts of policies they preach. The Government has a paranoia with the deficit and with inflation. It has a lack of regard for the fact that unemployment is the large problem in Australia. Every person who becomes unemployed becomes a non-consumer. For every non-consumer, there are three or four people who are terrified at the prospect of losing their jobs. Because they are terrified about losing their jobs, they do not spend. They do not buy a new motor car and they do not buy new conveniences for their houses. They do not want to build a house. All they want to do is to put money into the savings banks or into building societies and leave it there for the rainy day that they know is around the corner. That is the basic problem facing small business. The quicker the Government can see that this is the problem, the quicker the Government can see that the Australian people want to have some confidence in the economy which will lead them to spend, then the quicker that small business will get back on its feet. </para>

          <para>I am speaking from hard experience. I have battled in the small business area for 25 years, I must say with a great deal of success. I am the sort of person, like the honourable member for Robertson, who is not looking for handouts. The people that honourable members opposite talk about, particularly the people that members of the National Country Party support, are the people who decry us as socialists. But they are the best practising socialists in Australia. They want support at the production end and they want support at the marketing end. They want all the benefits that they can get. A very good example of this came before the House last week in the form of a Bill which the Australian Labor Party supported. I refer to the Bill to support the Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd in Melbourne. The support we gave to that Bill demonstrates the attitude that we take to small business. We do not want to put down small business. We do not want to see it disadvantaged to the advantage of the multinational companies and the great corporate bodies. We want to see the small Australian person, who works for himself and who provides employment, prosper. That is the reason we are supporting this Bill. But I take issue with the people opposite who have been speaking arrant nonsense in respect of small businesses. The Whitlam Labor Government did all it could to bolster small business. Since returning to Government all you people have done is what you did between 1969 and 1972. You have put the little people out of work. Do not rise in this House and hypocritically say that you support the little people. You support the multinational corporations - </para>

            <para>-The Bill now before the House bears some relevance to the subject of the previous debate because this, too, has important implications for small business, albeit in a restricted area of the Australian Capital Territory- nominally also in respect of the Northern Territory, but in fact for the Australian Capital Territory only. What the Bill seeks to do is to amend the Pay-Roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act in several respects, the most important of which is to raise the general level of exemption from payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory for an annual payroll of $48,000 as currently provided to an annual payroll of $60,000. That exemption will then be reduced by $2 for each additional $3 of payroll, so that for a payroll above $150,000 the full payroll is subject to the 5 per cent tax. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The matter of payroll tax has become of considerable importance in Australia during this decade. In 1971 the Federal Government decided to hand this tax over to the States to collect to satisfy their demands for a growth tax and increased autonomy, with the result that its incidence was quickly increased and payroll tax became the single most important revenue source for the States. Meanwhile the Australian Government continued to levy the tax in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and has, in general, applied rates identical to those being charged by the States. The uniform rate now is 5 per cent but with some small variations as to the levels of exemption. All States except Queensland now have a basic exemption of $60,000, although there are some differences in the extent to which that exemption is tapered off. Tasmania and New South Wales write the exemption off at the rate of $2 for each additional $3 of payroll over $60,000, as is proposed in this Bill, so that all exemption ceases at $150,000. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia use the same rate of tapering of the exemption, except that tapering ceases at payrolls of $109,500 and all payrolls at that level and above enjoy a basic exemption of $27,000. In Queensland the current basic exemption level is $100,000, with the exemption being tapered off at the rate of $5 for each additional $2 of annual payroll, but with all payrolls of $127,200 and above being exempt from tax on the first $27,000. As from 1 July this year the basic exemption in Queensland will increase again to $125,000, tapering off to $164,200, at which level of payroll and above tax will be payable on a payroll in excess of $27,000. Thus it can be seen that the present provisions applying in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are by far the least generous. </para>
          <para>What this Bill proposes is to raise the exemptions in the Territories to the lowest level applied by the States. It is therefore in no sense a trendsetting piece of legislation. It is rather a catch-up piece of legislation which provides for small businesses in the Territories the rninimum conditions applying to small businesses in the States. One sympathises with the States in respect to the situation that they now find themselves in with regard to payroll tax. Although they welcomed the Federal Government&#39;s decision to hand collection of the tax over to them, the States find that it has since become a very unpopular tax and that they themselves are under continuous pressure to reduce its incidence. However, because it is such an important piece of revenue for the States they are unable to give way to such pressures to too great a degree. </para>
          <para>The reasons for the increased unpopularity of the tax are twofold. The rapid increase in the rate of the tax to 5 per cent by September 1974 guaranteed a sharp reaction from businessmen, and, of course, the onset of economic recession in 1974 and its increased severity since have increased complaints about the tax. The business sector complains that the tax is levied without regard to capacity to pay. It is indeed true that it is payable whether a company makes a loss or a profit and, where it makes a profit, without regard to the level of profitability. Thus, some companies have a greater liability for payroll tax than they have for company tax. </para>
          <para>In the last two or three years there has also been increasing concern about the employment effects of this tax. A tax on employment, which is what this tax is, clearly is not calculated to assist employment prospects. Indeed, it is likely to lead to fewer people being employed than would otherwise be the case. The employer organisations in this country have complained about the phantom twenty-first employee: That is, for every 20 persons they employ they must pay for another through the incidence of payroll tax. This means that labour intensive industries are much more severely affected than capitalintensive industries, and since it is our labourintensive industries that are most under challenge from imports from low income countries to our north, the payroll tax is for them a heavy burden indeed. </para>
          <para>The Victorian Employers Federation calculated last year that if payroll tax were to be abolished altogether, another 100,000 persons would be employed in Australia. Even if one is skeptical of that figure, it is difficult to deny that the operation of payroll tax in this country is a major stumbling block in the path to the return to full employment. Indeed, the Australian tax system is doubly biased against employment in that not only do we have a high tax on labour but also we have through the investment allowance a large tax concession applying to additional investment which, insofar as it is labour-saving investment, represents a tax incentive to replace men with machines. The reality, as the Government has admitted in the most recent national wage case, is that most of the investment taking place at present is labour-saving investment, which is what one would expect when demand is slack and attractive tax concessions for investment, which are of limited duration, are made available at the same time. Naturally, in these circumstances there is a powerful incentive for employers to take advantage of the investment allowance and to invest in machines which enable them to maintain their present output at lower cost, rather than to increase capacity to produce more by investing in machinery to enable them to produce more with the current methods of production. Thus, the operation of the tax on labour through the payroll tax and a tax concession on labour-saving capital through the investment allowance mean that the tax system is massively biased in this country against the employment of people. </para>
          <para>In this respect I think it is most important for the House to take note of something to which I have referred previously. I do not think the Government has taken any notice of it, so I refer to it once again. This is a most important statement made in Paris by the Secretary of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development at a meeting of experts on structural determinants of employment and unemployment. In making the opening speech at that meeting in March of last year the Secretary of the OECD said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Of the various structural explanations of unemployment, a theme that has been getting increased attention by policy makers in some of our member countries, and one which I am glad to see has received prominent attention in the papers prepared for this conference, deals with the possibility of overly capital intensive production methods in the private sector at the expense of employment. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He went on to mention ways in which this happens and the incentives for it. They include payroll taxes, which increase the cost of labour, depreciation allowances, artificially low interest rates and so on. He then stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>What we may perhaps agree is that where governments wish to encourage private investment to sustain economic growth, it is important that the incentives chosen should support a wholesome balance between capital-deepening and capital-widening (i.e., between labour saving and job creation) and that the tax system should avoid any bias against the use of labour. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I draw attention particularly to the last statement:   . . the tax system should avoid any bias against the use  of labour </para>
          <para class="block">Quite clearly, the problem being drawn to the attention of the experts in Paris in 1977 by the Secretary of the OECD is a problem that has extreme relevance in this country. As I have already shown, we have a tax system that is massively biased against the use of labour; on the one hand there is a tax on labour and on the other hand there is an incentive for investment to be labour saving rather than job creating. Even if one takes account of the fact that an increasing array of subsidies is available for employment through the Special Youth Employment Training Program and the National Employment and Training Scheme, one can still say that, taken overall, the tax system in this country is massively biased against the use of labour Clearly, if governments are at all concerned about unemployment, and there is not much evidence to show that this Government is so concerned, something should be done, and quickly, to remove or at least substantially to reduce this tax bias against labour. </para>
          <para>The removal of the investment allowance is one means of reducing the tax bias, but it is also clear that as much as possible should be done to reduce the incidence of payroll tax. In this connection, I draw the attention of the House to the recent decision of the Swedish Government to reduce payroll tax from four per cent to two per cent and to abolish it altogether as from July this year. The fact that Sweden, with an unemployment level less than half of ours, is abolishing its payroll tax shows just how much more concern there is by its government, which is a conservative government, to reduce employment than there is by the Australian Government. If anything substantial is to be done about payroll tax in this country, it is up to the Federal Government to take the initiative. The States are so dependent now on payroll tax that it is quite unrealistic to expect them to do anything other than make adjustments to the exemption level in an attempt to relieve the burden on small business, which is basically labour intensive. </para>
          <para>The Bill now before us shows just how disinclined this Government is to take any such action. In a simple matter of raising exemption levels for payroll taxes in the Territories it is prepared to go only to the lowest State level. In our opinion it should be prepared to raise the exemption level at least to the highest level set by any State, which is that applying in Queensland. The complete exemption applying in that State from the middle of this year will be at a level more than double that which this Bill will implement in the Australian Capital Territory. I ask the House to consider the difference. A payroll of $60,000 will not quite cover a business with a staff of seven, taking the median rate of earnings of $ 170 a week </para>
          <para>The Queensland exemption, however, will completely cover a business with a staff of 14 employees being paid at the median level of earnings. That is a very substantial difference, and clearly exemptions at that level would greatly enhance the prospect of small businesses being able to employ an additional person. According to calculations made by a Liberal member of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, the widening of the exemption from its present level to the Queensland level would exempt some 1,600 Australian Capital Territory employers from liability for payroll tax and undoubtedly would give a fillip to employment in Canberra. It would also encourage the other States to do their best to raise their exemptions to the Australian Capital Territory level and thus free many thousands of small businesses from the tax. </para>
          <para>A further reason for giving serious consideration to this proposal is that the Legislative Assembly in Canberra has resolved to support raising the exemption to the Queensland level. Since the Assembly can be taken as speaking more directly than any other body for the people of Canberra, it is clear that this is what the people of Canberra want. As the Australian Capital Territory moves towards selfgovernment, the wishes of its people in respect of financial matters should receive increased attention and consideration from the Government, but little attention has been paid to their wishes in this matter. Of course, costs art involved in increasing the exemptions, but from the point of view of the Federal Government there are offsets that do not apply to the States. Immediately payroll tax exemptions are increased in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, if that has the effect of increasing employment, unemployment benefit payments are reduced and people who are at work pay more in the way of income tax. If a company simply keeps the tax in its profits, something one would try to reduce to a minimum, it will at least pay more company tax. So there are substantial immediate offsets to the Federal Government if it increases the level of exemption applying to payroll tax in the Territories. </para>
          <para>We on this side of the House regard the eradication of the appallingly high level of unemployment now prevailing in this country as the prime task of the Government at this time. We do not consider the attainment of such an objective to be at all easy but we do assert that many policy measures could be undertaken which would assist in the attainment of that objective. One such measure would be to reduce substantially and if possible eradicate the tax bias against the use of labour. This Bill shows, however, that the Government, which preaches long and loud about the evil effects of current wage levels, is prepared to take only the minimum possible steps to reduce the tax bias against employment. In so doing it proves once again that it is not really very concerned about unemployment, or at least that that concern runs secondary to various other objectives it is more anxious to pursue. I therefore move: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That all words after &#39;That&#39; be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: the House is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for levels of exemption from pay-roll tax no less than those that will apply in the State of Queensland from 1 July 1978.&#39; </para>

              <para>- As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro points out, it would assist the general area by encouraging the employment of more people in Canberra and more money would be spent in Queanbeyan. However, I would be reluctant to support it because it would bring into question the whole thrust of the Government&#39;s economic policy, which is to reduce inflation and therefore to create additional employment. The Bill seeks to bring payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory into line with that in New South Wales, particularly in regard to the areas surrounding the Territory, where our employers and businessmen compete. In his second reading speech the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> stated that it is the desire of the Government to secure consistency between the exemption entitlements of employers in the Australian Capital Territory and employers in New South </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Wales. He went on to say that he was sure that the operators of small businesses in the Australian Capital Territory will welcome the change. They certainly do welcome the change and are very pleased that twice in the last few months the Government has seen fit to increase the exemption for payroll tax. But they see the Treasurer&#39;s statement that the Australian Capital Territory is being brought into line with New South Wales as rather cynical and hollow. In New South Wales the Government gives very real incentives to industries located outside the major metropolitan areas. Part of that incentive is administered through payroll tax rebates. I believe that employers in Queanbeyan and in the surrounding areas of Canberra can get those rebates. </para>
          <para>So I call upon the Treasurer, if he is sincere in the statement he makes in his second reading speech, to consider in his deliberations on the Budget for this year bringing the Australian Capital Territory completely into line with New South Wales, which he claims is the desire of the Government. If we are to improve employment prospects in the Capital Territory we have to do so by widening the employment base. There is no doubt at all that that is done by State governments in the rural areas by means of incentives designed to encourage industry to establish and/or to relocate within the State- in other words, outside the major areas of population. Victoria uses amongst its armoury of incentives a rebate in payroll tax. New South Wales does likewise. I believe that other States have payroll tax concessions. </para>
          <para>Other activities are promoted by the State governments throughout Australia in establishing industry and employment opportunities in non-urban or non-manufacturing areas. Canberra is certainly a non-manufacturing area. The Department of the Capital Territory has embarked on some programs designed to assist industry in coming to Canberra, but I am afraid that so far these efforts have predominantly appeared to most business people already operating in the Territory to be tokenistic. There is a scheme operating under which a lease of land in the Capital Territory is made by direct ministerial grant on favourable conditions. But that is being done at a time when anybody in the Capital Territory can pick up industrial land for next to nothing, because nobody really wants it anyhow. A cheap land policy is not nearly good enough. There is a need for cheap loans, loan guarantees, freight incentives and, as I have already mentioned, payroll tax rebates, and, more importantly, a method which is used in many other States, namely, giving preference to decentralised industry in government purchasing. At this time, new industries coming into the Canberra region are attracted predominantly to the Queanbeyan area where the New South Wales Government offers much better incentives than does the Federal Government. </para>
          <para>The other point about decentralisation and offering incentives is that it is more often than not the case that natural economic advantage and the energies of the local promotion attract industry. I think the Government has to spend more time in examining those particular aspects of industrial development in the Capital Territory. The Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> has gone on record on a number of occasions as saying that tourism is the great strength of the Capital Territory and that it will be the great growth industry. There is absolutely no doubt at all about that. Many projects which the Government has under review at the moment will enhance Canberra&#39;s tourist potential. I mention, for example, the new archives building, the new national museum, the Australian Defence Force Academy, or Casey University as it is now known, and also we hope in the future there will be other national buildings such as a national convention and meeting centre which will be used by people from all over Australia. But we have to do more than just talk about these matters. We have to get off our proverbial backside and we have to promote Canberra as the area which is truly the city of Australia. We have to ensure that the 2.S million tourists who come to the capital city each year stay an extra day or two, because for every day they stay, they spend $20 or $30 which goes into the local economy. That money is spent in the local shops and in the local tourist industry. That, of course, creates employment opportunities outside government. </para>
          <para>We as a government are quite certain that the economic policies that we are promoting and pursuing will increase employment opportunities across Australia. There has been a lot of criticism in Canberra of the Government&#39;s economic policies. People in the Capital Territory seem to feel that we have been singled out for special attention. I am pleased to say that that is just not the case. During the six years from August 1 97 1 to August 1977, government employment across the whole of Australia has increased by 3.33 per cent. It is interesting to note that, although the Government has been professing the need to cut back on government employment through the imposition of staff ceilings and the like, government employment in Australia and in the Capital </para>
          <para class="block">Territory is still growing while private employment is falling. Private sector employment has declined not just in the last three years but during the last six years. So those people in Canberra who are claiming that the fall off in employment in the private sector is a Canberra phenomenon should look a little further in making their analysis. </para>
          <para>If we in the Capital Territory are faced with an employment situation which is Australia wide, how are we to deal with it? How are we to bolster our private sector? It seems that in spite of all the efforts of the previous Administration in its last few months in office and the efforts of this Administration during the last two and a half years, we cannot quite quell the growth of the bureaucracy- the growing monster, if I can put it that way- and the growth of the complexity of society which calls for more intervention. Of course, society is demanding that the Government does more for it all the time. What do we have to look at in the Capital Territory? What do we in Canberra have to look at in terms of the Capital Territory as we approach the time when the Budget will be presented? What do our Ministers and our senior Cabinet advisers need to look at carefully to ensure that the young people of Canberra, the capital of Australia, have opportunities to get jobs and to enter the workforce? We have Government as an employer, and Government employment is growing, in spite of staff ceilings. Job opportunities are being created by wastage, by people leaving the service, and by growth in some areas. </para>
          <para>The construction and building industry in Canberra has suffered badly because of the quite necessary drop in the growth rate of the capital city from a level approaching 10 per cent to 2.5 per cent or 3 per cent. That drop appears to be stabilising. There is evidence to suggest that the sale of houses in Canberra has picked up again and that the pipeline of unsold nouses is emptying at a satisfactory rate. There are signs also that job opportunities are being created in the retail and service industries. Several large new shopping centres have opened, both in my electorate of Canberra and in the electorate of Fraser. That activity has created a lot of jobs during the last few months. But we know that in the longer term real job opportunities in Canberra in the private sector have to be created in the entertainment and tourism areas. I look forward very much to the presentation of the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism which is inquiring into methods by which to promote the Australian tourist industry. In various areas of Australia the tourist industry will be the great employer of our young people and of members of our ethnic groups who are coming to this country albeit in diminishing numbers. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt at all that the Government&#39;s economic policies will create further employment. There is also no doubt at all that the option of increasing government expenditure- the easy way out; the way which was tried in 1974- is not going to be the way to solve the longer term problems of Australia. The mere stabilisation of inflation to within the range of 6 per cent is not going to be enough by itself. It will not guarantee the regeneration of the economy of Canberra or of Australia which is required. There is a need for a gently selective stimulus to growth both in the Capital Territory and in Australia. </para>
          <para>I agree with the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> that the removal as far as possible of payroll tax could be such a gentle stimulation. It certainly would be a major stimulation if the increase could be made at the lower end. Small business looks very carefully at employing extra people because predominantly the dollar comes out of the boss&#39;s pocket. As we know, large businesses in Australia are monolithic, oligopolistic and monopolistic in many respects and simply pass on their costs to the consumer. So it is very important that in the forthcoming Budget considerations the Treasurer and his advisers do not just take the easy way out and say: &#39;We do not want to be pacesetters for the rest of Australia&#39;, but that they look carefully at the possibilities of innovative programs in the payroll tax area. </para>

            <para>- I support the amendment moved by the Opposition to the motion for the second reading of the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Amendment Bill 1978. Although the Bill is quite commendable in handing out something to business people who are in a very bad position in Canberra, these people would be much better off if the Government were to support our amendment. I sympathise with the honourable member for Canberra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Haslem).</inline> Naturally, he would have sympathy for our amendment, but he is not able to support it. However, I could not quite accept his argument that the Bill is in keeping with the Government&#39;s economic policy and our amendment is not. I can say only that the Government&#39;s economic policy must be on a very fragile base if it is dependent upon the difference between the revenue which would be received through the enactment of the Government&#39;s Bill and the revenue which would be received as a result of our amendment to that Bill. That difference in revenue would be very minute in terms of the Government&#39;s Budget. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I accept that the honourable member for Canberra is very anxious to promote the city of Canberra. Naturally he is, and so am I. Unfortunately he supports a government whose leader is committed to demoting Canberra and not promoting it. That has been the story ever since this Government was elected. There has been tremendous discrimination against Canberra, particularly against business, through the general cutting back in government expenditure, the way it reflects on turnover in the city, on the building trade and on employment opportunities generally. This legislation represents just one very small plus against a very large list of minuses which this Government has against it in relation to its consideration of the people of Canberra, particularly the small business people. </para>
          <para>In moving our amendment we are suggesting that the Australian Capital Territory payroll tax provision should be in Une with the Queensland payroll tax provision, with an exemption of $125,000 payroll per annum. All States have different exemption provisions. I draw attention to the fact that many of the growth centres in New South Wales have special exemptions for payroll tax. As Canberra was the original growth centre, it should be treated in the same way. Instead of being pacesetters in terms of payroll tax we have been lagging behind the field and we have been placed at a grave disadvantage. Every time we amend the payroll exemption for the Australian Capital Territory and bring it into line with somewhere else we find that the exemption in that place has moved on again, and we always lag behind. If we accepted the Opposition&#39;s amendment the Australian Capital Territory would move into the more progressive brackets of payroll exemption. When we think about it, the 5 per cent tax in effect means paying for one extra employee for every 20 employees, which is a very big burden on business in the present trading conditions. In actual money terms I think that Canberra pays somewhere around $ 1 5m per annum in payroll tax. It should be pointed out that by increasing the exemption the Federal Government would not in fact lose very much at all. It would be a temporary loss because the Government would receive an immediate rebate in the form of increased profits or increased employment in the community. I think our unemployment bill in Canberra is something like $19m. If we can create jobs we will save there as well as add to revenue from indirect taxes which emanate from improved business trading in Canberra. </para>
          <para>As I said, we have lagged behind the States. Small business in Canberra has been placed at a tremendous disadvantage. As the honourable member for Canberra said, the big businesses are able to look after themselves, but many small businesses were lured into Canberra with the prospect of a steady rate of growth. That just has not happened. Recently I was visited by a number of business people from our new industrial centre of Mitchell. They paid pretty big prices by way of annual rentals for leases. They are paying pretty high rates- something like $2,000 a year. Some of them borrowed money at very high rates of interest- 16 per cent and 17 per cent- to build their structures in which to conduct their businesses. Nothing happened. These people are out there like shags on rocks. No other business has developed, there is no street lighting and no public transport. They are sitting there with this tremendous debt around their necks and no growth at all, which is not what they anticipated when they made their investment. I am making representations to the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> now. I hope he will give them some sympathy because some concessions should be made to them. If we do not help them they will go into liquidation. Instead of the Department of the Capital Territory getting a lower rent it will get no rent at all. Some adjustment should be made to those rents in the light of present day trading conditions. The situation at Mitchell is typical of the way that business is struggling in Canberra. We are oversupplied with retail business premises because of this drastic slowdown in growth. It is having devastating effects on many small businesses indeed. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately, we have had no relief from previous Budgets. We seem to have had Ministers who have had no real sympathy for the Australian Capital Territory and who have not been able to influence the Cabinet to take some of the pressure off business and unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory. I am looking forward to the new Minister being more effective in that regard. I hope he has a bit more influence and a bit more pull in the Cabinet than former Ministers have had in getting some relief for the people of Canberra. I live in great hopes. I am confident that he will be more successful and that he will give us some relief because our businesses cannot go on under the present situation. If there is no relief we will have a great list of liquidations in Canberra. We have had a lot in the past 12 months. They will escalate. We will have many more in the next few months if we do not get some relief. I commend the amendment to the House as a means of providing to some small extent relief for the business people of Canberra and for the unemployment situation and of giving some small benefit to offset the many disadvantages that the business people have suffered under this Government. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr FitzPATRICK</inline>(Riverina) ( 10.30)- I rise tonight to discuss a report entitled &#39;$l.5m Black Home Project Riddle&#39; by Robin Bromby which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of Saturday, 29 April. </para>
        <para>It states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A million and a half dollars of Federal Government money has been spent on an Aboriginal housing project at Wilcannia without one house being finished. </para>
          <para>Mystery surrounds the spending of the money but it is clear that some of it has been misused. </para>
          <para>The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has admitted that all is not well with the project. </para>
          <para>The money was allocated to make a start on providing 30 houses for the Aboriginal people of Wilcannia on the Darling River in central New South Wales. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Of course, that is a part of my electorate. The report goes on to say that following articles in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> dealing with the Aborigines&#39; plight, improvement was decided upon by the Federal Government. It stated that eight houses have been erected, which would give the impression that each house cost something like $186,000. This is the second time that I have raised in this House the matter of the Bakandji housing project, as the scheme is called. On15 February 1977 I referred to a visit of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> to Wilcannia for the very purpose of opening the first house referred to in this article. On that occasion there were television cameras and all the publicity that could go with a great group of pressmen. I was very sore because I was not invited to the party. It was in my electorate and I did not know that it was taking place. </para>
        <para>I wish to point out that the purpose of my raising the matter is not to be critical of the Prime Minister but more to ask him not to forsake the project because of this bad publicity. On reading the full article it does appear that something has gone wrong out there, that an admission has been made by the Aboriginal committee that there is something drastically wrong in the amount of money that has been spent and the progress that has been made. The report further states that Aborigines in Wilcannia were living in mud on the river bank. When Gordon Bryant was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I went to Wilcannia and took some pictures of the state of the Aborigines there. They were provided with tents in which to live until something more substantial could be supplied to them. The outcome was that they started the Bakandji building society. It not only built houses; it also had a big joinery works and a brick plant. </para>
        <para>The standard of the housing was vastly improved on what we saw some time previously of Aboriginal houses which they had built themselves. This project was a form of training for the Aborigines. I would not try to justify their spending of this amount of money if the report is correct but I do hope that the Minister and the Prime Minister do not lose their interest in the Aborigines in the area. Although I was somewhat shut out of the affairs of Wilcannia it seems to me that it was harder for me to find out what was going on further along the river at Menindee. I have been invited there several times. I have had numerous discussions with the Aboriginal groups there and we have ironed out several matters. When I originally spoke on this matter my point was that the Minister should take a little more notice and involve the representative of the area in the matters concerning his area and see that he is better informed. I believe that not only the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Prime Minister but also the local member should share responsibility. The local member should answer statements like this and should be involved in and have some knowledge of these matters. He should be provided with information about what is going on. I must admit that since I raised this matter several members of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs have visited my office and have kept me a little better informed. </para>

            <para>-The Australian Government believes firmly in the policy of federalism. We believe that the daily lives of 14 million Australians should not be directed by one vast bureaucratic centralised body in Canberra. There are three levels of government in Australia- federal, State and local- and each has a role to play. Obviously there are many areas, such as the economy and social services, which need administration at federal level. However, local government is the most appropriate level for many other needs. In order that these needs may be fulfilled the Fraser Government has legislated to provide local government with a guaranteed percentage of personal income tax. This share will be increased from 1.52 per cent to 2 per cent during the life of this Parliament. In 1976-77 local government&#39;s share was $ 140m, a 75 per cent increase on the $79.9m provided by the Whitlam Labor Government for the year 1975-76. I commend the increase in the local government share of personal income tax to 2 per cent during the life of this Parliament but urge the Government to introduce this reform as soon as possible. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In other areas positive steps have been taken towards full implementation of the federalism policy. Local government grants commissions have been set up in all States. There is local government representation on the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations. Federalism is based on the idea that consultation and co-operation will overcome many of the problems which confront all levels of government. Tonight I urge the Government to take a further step towards enabling local government to play a more active role in the management of this country. Local government is that branch of government which is closest to the needs and aspirations of the majority of Australians. It will be able to satisfy these needs and aspirations only if its representatives come from a wide crosssection of the community. Under section 74 of the Income Tax Assessment Act candidates for State and Federal elections can claim election campaign expenses as allowable deductions for income tax purposes. I believe that the Government should amend this section of the Act to extend this deduction to candidates for local government. </para>

              <para>- Such a concession would be a further step towards fulfilling the Government&#39;s federalism policy. I am glad to hear the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier)</inline> agreeing with me. All individuals who have a contribution to make must be free to participate fully in government and the forms of government must be decentralised to permit maximum response and involvement. Government must be brought as close as possible to the people. It is not sufficient to provide an increase in funds; we must also increase the status of local government. In my State of Victoria at present hardworking councillors are not even recompensed for out of pocket expenses, such as the cost of running their cars or the cost of telephone calls made because of council business. The cost of running a campaign must also deter many people, who would otherwise be able to make a positive contribution to local government, from standing for election. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I am not saying that those in local government at present are not doing a good job. Financially unrewarding though it may be, it is undoubtedly rewarding in work satisfaction. However, there are many people who, if given the opportunity, have experience which would benefit their communities and the country at large but who cannot afford the out-of-pocket expenses and the cost of running an election campaign. We must all continue to re-evaluate our ideas and to ensure that governments at every level are aware of the needs and views of Australians and that the community has the best possible representatives. It is only if all people have an equal opportunity to take part in government at whatever level they choose that we will be putting into practice the full ideals of federalism. I urge the Government as part of the next Budget, if not sooner, to legislate to make tax deductible campaign expenses incurred by candidates for local government, just as they are for candidates who stand for election to federal and State parliaments. To say the least, this would be only fair and just. </para>

            <para>- I express my concern that, in the recent industrial dispute over the export of live sheep and goats to the Middle East, the issue of the humane treatment of animals was so completely ignored. Our national preoccupation with narrow economic interests, cash in hand, is illustrated very clearly by our lack of interest in the cruelty implicit in the live animal export trade. I draw attention to a letter which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 18 April. I identify myself with it completely. It reads: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>It&#39;s time we questioned the morality of the export of live sheep ( and goats) to the Middle East </para>
            <para>Farmers and unionists are understandably silent on one of the reasons why so many millions of live animals are exported. Any trade worth $300 million could overcome refrigeration and transportation problems. </para>
            <para>Australians either don&#39;t know, or choose to ignore, the fact that Moslem rituals specify that animals should be fully conscious at the time of slaughter. </para>
            <para>Your editorial <inline font-style="italic">(&#39;The Age&#39;,</inline> 12/4) gives us a clue to the farmers&#39; demands for unrestricted trade. These sheep &#39;are mostly cast-offs from the wool clip worth only a few dollars and sometimes not worth sending to slaughter. But the Middle East is paying $ 1 5 to $30 per head, &#39; </para>
            <para>Farmers know the substantial economic losses caused by the stress of transportation especially over long distances. Injuries, deaths and shrinkage are inevitable. No farmer would choose to export prime-quality lamb or mutton in this way. Obviously it is a very lucrative method of disposing of animals which can no longer be exploited. </para>
            <para>In January 1 977, the ABC <inline font-style="italic">Country Hour</inline> reported that private veterinary surgeons had perfected a conveyor-belt, oneminute spaying operation for aged merino ewes which would then be exported live. No need to worry about bans on the export of these sheep once they have been spayed. </para>
            <para>In the late 1 9th and early 20th centuries, English livestock owners shipped their worn-out and aged horses to Belgium for slaughter. This trade was justified then by the same arguments which Australian farmers are using in 1978. </para>
            <para>It is the duty of the Federal Government, the livestock producers and the trade union movement to stop this deplorable trade. Australia&#39;s long-term economic advantage lies in developing carcase export. Our moral advantage lies in realising that increasing contempt for lower forms of life may be leading us, especially in an agnostic age, to a contempt for man himself. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that the treatment of animals may well be the most accurate single indicator of our national capacity for compassion. The vast public indifference to the sufferings of animals in the live export trade to the Middle East suggests that we would deserve to rank very low on a compassion index. </para>

            <para>-There are standards of behaviour to be maintained in this House and, indeed, in all parliaments. It therefore comes as a disappointment to me that a new member of this House with extensive experience in the Victorian Parliament should abuse these standards. It is apparent that the business of the Opposition is at present tightly orchestrated under the new Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden).</inline> The Leader and also the majority of his colleagues stand condemned in that they agreed to include in the Opposition&#39;s program General Business motion No. 10 which was moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding)</inline> on 11 April 1978. During the course of that debate, it was stated that parliamentary privilege does not carry with it a licence to slander. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports denegrated himself and attempted to influence similarly this House with his ill-argued censure motion. One could make the uncharitable observation that his actions run parallel with those of the honourable member for Caulfield in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. </para>

The honourable member for McMillan should know the Standing Orders of this House. As I said, I rose to my feet in an attempt to bring him to order on that point. It is not within the compass of the Standing Orders of this chamber for any honourable member to make an attack on any other member of this chamber unless it be in the form of a debate on a substantive motion. The honourable member did not do that. In fact at this hour of the night he cannot do it unless he can suspend Standing Orders, because the Standing Orders do not enable him to move a substantive motion at this time of the night. At any other time of the day, with the concurrence of the Acting Leader of the House, he could well have done that but in his true cowardly fashion he waited until this hour of the evening. </para>

The report makes broad observations and recommendations and suggests further lines of inquiry but does not make detailed or specific recommendations.

              <para>Trade recognition criteria in the metal and electrical trades for Britain and a number of European countries were established in 1 969 following the visit to Europe by an Australian Tripartite Mission comprising Government, employer and union members to study the training of skilled workers in the metal and electrical trades.

This has resulted in some slowing down of the processes, but steps are being taken to reduce delays caused by this factor to a minimum. The adaptation of computer type-setting, which was designed primarily for producing the daily Hansard, to the more precise lay-out of legislation has necessarily caused some problems at the technical end. However, the computer type-setting process results in an extremely valuable by-product in that the text of the Acts will be available in machine-readable form for the legal information retrieval system which my Department is developing and which will be of benefit to the Parliament, the Government and the community generally when fully developed.

              <para>to (6) Under the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1977, the Tertiary Education Commission has the statutory responsibility for approving advanced education courses for funding purposes. Towards the end of last year the Commission considered several courses in nurse education which had been proposed for approval for funding purposes, including post-basic degree courses in nursing at the Western Australian Institute of Technology, and in nursing education and nursing administration at the Lincoln Institute. The Commission decided not to approve these courses for funding purposes in 1 978 as it considered that approval of these proposals would pre-empt the deliberations of the Committee on Nurse Education and Training, which the Government has established to provide objective advice on the whole range of questions relating to the education and training of nurses at both the basic and post-basic level. In particular, the Commission was aware that the proposed course at the Western Australian Institute of Technology, which the Advanced Education Council had recommended for approval prior to the establishment of the Committee on Nurse Education and Training, would be the first degree course in nursing to be introduced at a tertiary institution in Australia and the Commission was concerned at the possible implications of such a move when the whole question of nurse education was under review. </para>

            <para>Following a decision taken at the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in London last year, a Special Consultative Meeting met in Canberra from 27 February- 16 March to elaborate a draft definitive regime for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. This meeting will continue this task in Buenos Aires in July. We expect a decisive meeting to establish the regime will be held later this year. This meeting will involve the Consultative Parties in major decisions on the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Yes. The principal reasons for this approach are: </para>
            <para>Animals from different regions of the world constitute different animal disease risks. Mixing of animal consignments from these different regions would result in exposure of some animals to diseases which do not exist in their country of origin. All animals in such a mixed group would have to be subjected to the conditions laid down for the originating country of greatest risk. Should any animal fail a disease test, it might be necessary, depending on the nature of the disease involved, to destroy all animals at the station or return them to their countries of origin. </para>
            <para>For the most part, it is intended that the station will operate on the &#39;all in all out&#39; quarantine principle. On the other hand, mixed consignments of animals from different regions of the world would be required to undergo different periods of quarantine at the station. </para>
            <para>The logistics and cost of &#39;on-farm&#39; testing and preexport quarantine make such an approach most secure and practical. </para>
            <para>Notwithstanding this general approach, there may be circumstances involving various species from various regions for which joint quarantine may be possible. </para>

            <para>In no way. The major advances in artificial insemination since 1 973 have been in semen freezing techniques applied to species other than cattle, while the major advances in ova transplants have related to non-surgical methods of transplanting and of storage. None of this work has facilitated disease detection, recognition or control, nor has it increased the very limited range of countries from which semen and ova can be safely imported into Australia. The developments referred to have not reduced the need for the station. </para>

              <para>None. The determination of the status of State of Chief Industrial Importance in the ILO context is governed by the application of a weighted formula by which, on a ten-point scale, national income rates six points, assessed contributions to the ILO budget rate three points and the size of the economically active population rates one point. Whether or not Australia should be included among the ten states of chief industrial importance will be determined at the next General Review of this category of states or when the governing body decides to fill the seat left vacant by the United States. The outcome will depend upon Australia &#39;s relative ranking as determined by the application of the foregoing formula on the basis of the then current economic statistics but present indications suggest that Australia would not be included. </para>

        <para>As the above estimates were based on levels of consumption as reported by respondents in the survey and certain groups of people were excluded from the survey, these consumption levels are lower than would be expected from other sources of information i.e. statistics of production, exports and imports. Included in the groups of people excluded from the survey are members of the permanent armed services, certain diplomatic personnel and certain institutionalised personnel. This understatement, however, is consistent with results of overseas studies and previous smaller scale surveys in Australia. </para>

          <para>Some health insurance organisations do in fact offer supplementary benefits for hearing aids. However, persons may be precluded from receiving such benefits, because of a preexisting ailment rule.

            <para>The Committee of Inquiry under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Scott into Government Procurement Policy, to which the honourable gentleman referred, recommended the setting up of a Purchasing Commission. As he will be aware, such a Commission has not been established. It follows that recommendations of the Committee relating to suggested roles for the Purchasing Commission have lapsed. This includes Recommendation 24 in which the Committee proposed that the Commission be directed to make an investigation into acceptance by government officers of employment with firms which have contractual relations with the Government. </para>

        <para>The excess of domestic spending by Government over receipts (the Budget domestic deficit) represents a direct increase in the volume of money; only sales of government securities to the domestic non-bank sector, among the various financing transactions, provide a direct reduction in the volume of money. Thus, for a given Budget deficit, official overseas loan raisings do not have, in themselves, any impact on the volume of money. The proceeds of such loans form part of Australia&#39;s official reserves of foreign exchange which are held in the form of assets denominated in foreign currencies. </para>
        <para>Overseas borrowings by the Government can have indirect consequences for the volume of money in the domestic economy in so far as, through their effects on attitudes and expectations concerning the external account, they can influence private sector foreign exchange transactions, which are an element of monetary formation. There are of course many other factors that affect private sector foreign exchange transactions, but it may be noted that, accompanying the progressive implementation of the Government&#39;s 1977-78 overseas borrowing program, there has been the emergence of a stronger trend in such transactions. </para>

            <para>While the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN) being conducted under the auspices of the GATT have accelerated in recent months and major participants are seeking to have many of the major issues substantially resolved by mid 1 978, no specific date has been set for the conclusion of the MTN which could even extend into 1979. </para>
            <para>Within the MTN, wheat, beef and dairy products are being dealt with by specific negotiating sub-groups of the Agriculture Group. The meat and dairy sub-groups are now in almost continuous session examining the scope for new international arrangements which would improve trading conditions for these commodities. In the case of grains however, the main discussions and negotiations have been within the International Wheat Council in London and more recently of the UN Wheat Conference in Geneva. At an appropriate time discussions in the MTN Grains sub-group will complement and parallel these. </para>
            <para>In addition, there has also been established within the MTN an item by item, bilateral request and offer procedure for the negotiation of trade concessions on agricultural products. All the principal trading countries have made and received requests and initial responses have been exchanged. </para>
            <para class="block">The next phase which is about to commence shortly, will involve bilateral consultations. </para>
            <para>Australia is taking an active part in discussions in the three negotiating sub-groups on grains, meat and dairy products, and has also made wide ranging requests for concessions in agricultural trade under the bilateral request and offer procedure. </para>
            <para>Confidentiality is of course an essential aspect of the negotiating process, and premature disclosure of the detail of discussions could inhibit progress. I wish to assure the honourable member, however, that at the earliest appropriate time I shall provide full details of the progress made and results flowing from the MTN. </para>
