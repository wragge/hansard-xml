          <para>That the House notes the death, on 29 September 197S, of His Holiness Pope John Paul, and expresses its profound regret at his passing. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It was with deep shock that we heard 1 1 days ago of the death of Pope John Paul. Elected to the papacy on 26 August, his reign was tragically brief. No pontiff in modern times had so short a tenure. In that lies a very human tragedy- that of a man chosen for his church&#39;s highest office but who almost in the same hour was taken from it. Yet even in such a short time Pope John Paul had been able to make a strong impression, winning widespread affection with his simple, selfeffacing style. </para>
        <para>Pope John Paul was ordained in 1935 and thereafter rose to bishop, archbishop, cardinal and finally Pope. During this period he displayed a capacity for reasonableness and moderation. He also eschewed ostentation and much of the pomp and ceremony of ecclesiastical office. On being elected Pope he chose to have a simple ceremony for his installation in St Peter&#39;s Square. Pope John Paul&#39;s entire ecclesiastical life was spent in northern Italy but his was no narrow experience. As Archbishop of Venice his diocese included not only this historic and beautiful city but also the highly industrialised area of Mestre. </para>
        <para>One of his strengths which was undoubtedly a factor in his being chosen to succeed Pope Paul VI was his involvement in pastoral work, including the daily round of visits to the sick, to schools, factories and seminaries. Another factor may have been his outgoing warm-heartedness. Pope John Paul combined an unassuming manner with infectious good humour. Although Pope John Paul had displayed an attachment to orthodoxy, he was prepared to travel down the road of reform opened by the Second Vatican Council. He showed deep concern for the poor and the underprivileged. He saw the need for social change and symbolised this by his own personal actions. </para>
        <para>He was a man of decision tempered by goodhumoured tolerance, a man of austerity but with considerable personal charm, a literate man but one able to communicate simply and directly to all peoples. His untimely death will be a loss both to his church and to mankind. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Opposition, I support the condolences that have been expressed by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on behalf of the Government. The reign of Pope John Paul was sadly short. He was a pastoral pope who brought a spark of joy and happiness to a world which in many respects is unsure and gloomy. He was a man from a poor background, elevated by dint of hard work and intellectual ability; but he remained a man of humility, simplicity and friendliness. He clearly demonstrated an understanding and responsiveness to those throughout the world who suffered hardships. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is impossible to gauge with any sense of reliability what the late Pope John Paul&#39;s contribution would have been, but certainly, on his record, he would have been a moderate reformer, a progressive, and the world, and especially his Church, would have been better for his term of service as Pope if it had been, happily, a longer one. His elevation was a welcome one. His presence in office was encouraged by the goodwill of people from all walks of life and from all religions throughout the world. His passing is a tragedy for the world as much as it is a tragedy for his Church. I join with the Prime Minister in conveying the condolences of the Opposition on such an unhappy occasion. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I have a recollection of a statement made in 1972 by the Minister to whom the honourable member referred. I think that the honourable gentleman could be persuaded to acknowledge the fact that I was a private member of Parliament in those days and not a ministerial colleague of the Minister. I cannot answer definitively the argument that the honourable gentleman presses upon me as to the apparent disparity in the half fife time cycle of plutonium which I understand to be of the order of 24,000 years. I will look at what my honourable friend said on that occasion. I am inclined to the view, if I may presume to express one to the honourable gentleman, that my honourable colleague in 1972 may have been referring to material other than plutonium. But I will make inquiries promptly and promptly inform the honourable gentleman of the results of those inquiries. </para>

            <para>- I welcome the question concerning the application of the export market development grants scheme to the tourist industry. This will be a major breakthrough for the tourist industry in Australia. The Government is hopeful that legislation relating to the scheme will be introduced during the current sittings of the Parliament. I am confident that the incentive will encourage the travel and tourist industry to increase its promotional efforts overseas, thereby significantly increasing the number of overseas visitors to Australia. Under the new legislation, the claimants will be able to receive grants of up to $100,000 per year, based on a grant rate of 70 per cent of eligible expenditure. The ceiling will be raised by an additional $25,000 for expenditure in connection with Commonwealth Government sponsored promotions. The types of expenditure which will be covered under the program include overseas market research, advertising and promotion literature, consultants&#39; fees, the cost of participating in overseas trade fairs, overseas representation - </para>

              <para>- It would not be slow enough for the honourable member to understand. Also included are fares involved in overseas travel and the cost of bringing agents or buyers to Australia. The extension of the scheme will operate from 1 July this year, with the first payments being made in 1979-80. 1 recall that the cost to revenue will be of the order of $3.25m during the first year of the operation of the scheme. As I said earlier, it is a major breakthrough for the industry. It will provide the industry with very real encouragement and I believe will lead to a greater number of overseas visitors coming to Australia. </para>

            <para>-In directing my question to the Minister for Defence I refer to his public statement last Thursday about a discrete mass of plutonium buried at Maralinga. Did the Minister present to Cabinet recently a submission warning of the threat posed by the possible theft by terrorists of this discrete mass of plutonium? Does the Minister accept this advice from his Department? If so, how does he explain today&#39;s statement by the British High Commission that the so-called discrete mass of plutonium is buried in six separate steel containers in a concrete lined pit covered with steel plate under hundreds of tons of soil? </para>

            <para>- I have taken extensive steps to communicate to industry the Budget allocation of $24m in this financial year for improved industrial research and development grants. In fact, I have sent out over 2,000 letters to companies which have previously received grants, I have made a number of Press releases in trade journals, and I am conducting at present seminars in all the capital cities, the first having been yesterday in Sydney, aimed at acquainting industry at first hand with the grants. We are effectively doubling the project grants and the commencement grants which help small businesses in particular to get new technology. We are introducing a new streamlined system that overcomes the problems which industry has complained of in the past. In addition, we are introducing new public interest grants to assist new industries to be created. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is our concern that the debate on technology has looked at the more negative effects of technology on employment when there are many positive impacts, not only by way of making our existing industries more competitive with imports and more able to find and compete in export markets, but also by way of creating new industries. The InterScan example, of which the House is aware, is only one of those industries. We are concentrating very much on the creation of new industries by new technology as well as on the creation of new employment opportunities by developing more export-oriented industries. I believe that most of the concern is about the rate of change, and as a government we are doing all we can to assist Australian industry to be more competitive through improved innovation; not by slavishly adopting other people&#39;s technology but by designing its own technology for its own requirements. </para>

            <para>-The last part of the question hardly deserves an answer. Quite clearly the Minister has exhibited very great control over his Department. That does not really need stating. I was advised that there could be a problem in relation to a substance buried at Maralinga, I think in 1977, and the matter has been under examination since then. There have been communications also with the British Government in relation to it. The matter has come under Government discussion within the last few days, as I think is quite obvious to the whole House. </para>

            <para>- In the Saskatchewan province of Canada an inquiry was recently set up under Justice Bayda to look into the prospects of developing what was known as the Cluff Lake deposit of uranium. This inquiry had terms of reference similar to those of the Fox inquiry in Australia. It was similar also to two other inquiries held in Britain which resulted in the Parker and Flowers reports. All of these inquiries which were conducted by judges found that the development of uranium ought to take place on a controlled basis and that the terms under which that development should take place should be much the same as the terms and conditions that were recommended by the Fox report. I think it is of interest to note that a number of major discoveries have been made in Saskatchewan, Canada. There is the Midwest Lake deposit, the size of which is about the same as that of the Ranger deposit. The inquiry which I mentioned will now enable the development of that deposit to go ahead. Key Lake deposit is another very substantial deposit. In addition, about 100 exploration companies are now operating in Saskatchewan in the search for uranium and many prospects are showing up. I think the significance of all of this is that the rest of the world is moving ahead fairly rapidly in developing uranium. I refer, of course, to those countries which have signs of its existence. Those people in Australia who say that we should not be developing uranium should get out of their Rip van Winkle state of mind and realise that we are living in a nuclear age, that any country which has uranium is developing it and that those countries which are looking for alternative sources of energy will have to rely heavily on nuclear power. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does the fact that overseas borrowings, both received and announced, have amounted to more than $ 1,000m so far this financial year mean that total overseas borrowings will exceed last year&#39;s total of about $ 1,800m? Further, will the debt servicing cost of Australia&#39;s overseas borrowings for the last financial year alone average about $350m a year for the first half of the 1980s and will this double with this year&#39;s borrowings? If so, are the Government&#39;s overseas borrowings merely transferring the debt servicing problems created by the private capital inflow of the 1960s and . early 1970s from the present to the 1980s? </para>

            <para>- I cannot confirm or deny some of the per capita calculations that the honourable member for Reid has made. I will do that and see whether there is anything useful that should be conveyed to him.  His  question gives me the opportunity of saying quite directly and quite simply that a substantial overseas borrowing program has been part of this Government&#39;s external policies for some time. My colleague, the present Minister for Finance, announced a substantial borrowing program last year. The desirability and appropriateness of such a program was reaffirmed earlier this year in a statement that I made. It was reaffirmed in the Budget. It is entirely appropriate that a country such as Australia should on official account borrow substantial sums from overseas conformably with the type of economic strategy that we are pursuing at the present time. </para>

            <para>- The matters referred to by the honourable member for Henty result from decisions taken by the  Chairman  of the Industries Assistance Commission. In taking those decisions he is acting under the powers he has as permanent head to make the best use of the resources available to him. I understand that the basis of the decision is that the IAC will be able to make better use of the manpower resources and that this will result in increased efficiency. I am also advised that the decisions taken by the  Chairman  of the IAC do not relate directly to the staff ceilings; it is more a matter of making the best use of the manpower resources. I would be concerned if, as the honourable member suggests, industry were not adequately served by the IAC and there were added costs and inconvenience to industry generally. I would hope that the increased efficiency as a result of the redeployment of manpower within the IAC would offset any inconvenience that would be caused by way of additional travel to Canberra. In the light of the question raised by the honourable member and the matters that he included in his question, I shall take the matter up with the  Chairman  of the IAC and seek an assurance that industry will be adequately served and not seriously inconvenienced and put to additional cost as a result of these movements. </para>

            <para>- Yes. The Government, through the Commonwealth Employment Service, has worked closely with the Channel 9 network on the development of what is now called <inline font-style="italic">The Job Show</inline> which started in Melbourne and Sydney yesterday morning. Initial reports are that the show will achieve what it is setting out to do; that is to enable people in the work force who are looking for jobs to find the jobs most suited to them, and to bring those employers in the work force who have vacancies registered into contact with the people most suited to fill them. More importantly than that, by this new and imaginative program the services provided by the Commonwealth Employment Service are being brought to people in their own homes, to both employers and those seeking work, and I believe a greater understanding will emerge of the services provided by the CES in this way. Certainly the initial response after the first show was extremely encouraging. The show will run initially for six weeks. During and at the end of that time the Government will make an evaluation of its success and the results it has achieved. I hope that if that evaluation shows that it is successful, it might be possible to extend it to other capital cities. I shall certainly keep the honourable member and, indeed, all honourable members informed of the progress made in this new and imaginative project. </para>

            <para>-I refer the Prime Minister to the debate on the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill on 3 May this year when the Opposition urged the establishment of a Nuclear Safeguards, Safety and Security Commission to set standards for aspects of safeguards, to make rules for physical security, to set physical safety standards, to issue and withdraw licences for construction and to carry out investigations and inquiries. In the light of recent events and the evident failure of Ministers, departments and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to establish and present the truth in respect of nuclear activities, I ask the Prime Minister whether he now acknowledges the urgent necessity for an independent authority to regulate nuclear activities. If so, what action does he propose? </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman would know that as a result of the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry the Government has instituted a number of measures to make sure not only that we contribute as fully as we can to international safety through nuclear safeguards but also that we fulfil to the utmost obligations within Australia. We are also, of course, having discussions with the States in relation to nuclear codes for industry to make sure that nuclear-related <inline font-style="italic">activities</inline> are undertaken in an absolutely safe manner. </para>

          <para>I think that in part the assumptions underlying the question are not accurate. It is my advice that basically whatever information may be available to this Government in relation to matters at Maralinga was available also to the previous Labor Government. Therefore, the question is: What did the Labor Government think of these matters when they were in its area of concern? I am not aware that it took any action in relation to these matters. If there is now a matter that needs some action it is because of the vigilance of this Government and of the Minister for Defence, a vigilance that apparently was not shown under the previous Administration. </para>

            <para>- I am aware that legislation was introduced into the United Kingdom Parliament to protect children from indecent photography and from the publication of photography of this description. I am also aware of the fact that a Bill of a similar description was introduced into the United States Congress, and I am not sure whether that has yet been passed. I can assure the honourable member that I shall investigate his suggestion. The honourable member will recall that last year when I was Attorney-General the question arose of child pornography in this country and that I met with the Ministers from around Australia for the purpose of preventing pornography of this description from being distributed. So far as I am aware, at a Federal level efforts have been made to prevent this sort of pornography from being imported into the country. As I indicated, I think on the occasion of that meeting, it is not possible, because it is impracticable, to prevent literature or photographs of this description from coming through the mail and then being used as the basis of publications in this country. But I can assure the honourable member that the matter will be given careful attention. </para>

          <para>I remind honourable members also that next year is the International Year of the Child and that the Government has taken a number of initiatives in relation to that.

If we are able to produce legislation along these lines, I hope that it will be introduced into this Parliament and that it will have the support of both sides of the House. </para>

              <para>- I regard the election victory of the Labor Party in New South Wales as a remarkable personal victory for the Premier, Neville Wran. I think it is remarkable in a number of respects. It is remarkable because in most of the advertising material the name Labor&#39; did not appear. It said: &#39;Return the Wran Government&#39;. It did not say: &#39;Return the Labor Government&#39;. I think that honourable gentlemen opposite know quite well that the New South Wales Premier distanced himself to a very considerable extent from Australian Labor Party policies during the course of that election. </para>

          <para>I think it is worth noting that, because of the policies of this Government and because the tax reimbursement grants to the States have increased so much, not only the New South Wales Government but also other State governments have been able, over a period of two to three years, to reduce taxation and, at the same time, to make sure that they restrained expenditure and did not increase their charges to any great extent. Indeed, it is pleasing to see the New South Wales Premier following other policies of this Government, such as the abolition of death duties. That is something to which I understand the New South Wales Premier is now firmly committed. </para>
          <para>There were a number of remarkable things about this election, apart from the Premier&#39;s own performance, in that in a number of important respects he sought to embrace the policies of the Federal Government and to support those policies. In pre-prepared telecasts, the New South Wales Premier was able to say that he was at one with the Federal Government in its fight against inflation, whereas on other occasions he had said that it was a massive effort requiring hard decisions - </para>

              <para>-On the other occasions the New South Wales Premier had pointed to the fact that for us to achieve the reduction in inflation that we achieved has resulted from a massive effort requiring a number of hard and difficult decisions. Indeed, I think the Premier of New South Wales has only had praise for the Commonwealth Government in that regard. One would expect the Federal Labor Party to try to take some pleasure from this election, but when it analyses the circumstances of the election I fear that time will prove that it can take very little pleasure from it. The particular circumstances, I repeat, are a remarkable personal achievement for Neville Wran and I do not believe that anyone should try to take that away from him. </para>

            <para>-I share the honourable gentleman&#39;s concern that the Primary Industry Bank has not yet started to function, although, of course, its offices have been opened, its staff has been appointed and its directorate has met. Over the course of time there has been considerable communication between the directorate of PIBA and the Government. There are now no matters outstanding. I believe from a report that I read over the weekend that there will be announcements this week about the terms of lending of the Primary Industry Bank of Australia and I expect that applications will be received for advances from that institution within the next couple of weeks. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I regret very much that it has taken so long but 1 think that primary producers need to realise that in PIBA there is a facility which is quite different from anything that has been provided previously. It does provide for longer term money than is available from any current lending institution. It provides a facility which is designed to try to cover something of the generation gap difficulty that exists in the rural sector. The generation gap there is that each primary producer going on to the land is required, within the term of his lifetime, to find finance to fund a fairly significant investment. Given inflation, the product of inflated land values and the extent of capitalisation in agriculture, this investment is one which most family farmers find more and more difficult to encompass under normal lending circumstances. </para>
          <para>Additionally, over the last 10 years there has been an enormous increase in the funding, directly by the Commonwealth, of the primary producers&#39; debt. As of the moment something like 27 per cent of rural indebtedness is covered by funds directly advanced from the Commonwealth. This compares with something less than 2 per cent back in 1970. Of course, much of this is through rural reconstruction assistance but nonetheless it reflects the fact that a number of institutions, such as the pastoral houses, the insurance companies and the trustee houses, have withdrawn significant funds from the rural sector. This Government believes strongly in having . funding opportunities for Australia&#39;s farmers to enable them to operate normally in the community. We believe that through the facility that will now be available in the Primary Industry </para>
          <para class="block">Bank, the family farmer will be able to look to the future with considerably more confidence than would otherwise have been possible. </para>

During your visit to Israel, did you have the opportunity to see the facilities available for the operation of this type of committee in the Israeli Parliament?

            <para>-I have had reports of the success of the Legislation Committees. I do know, because I arranged this before I left, where they met- that is, in committee rooms 1 and 2. 1 have always welcomed Legislation Committees but I have been very well aware of the totally inadequate facilities that we have in committee rooms 1 and 2. However, they are the only ones that we have that could be used. As this is a provisional parliament house there is very little I can do. I think that there will be a need for substantial changes before we can adequately house Legislation Committees. I think that the whole of the House would welcome Legislation Committees and seek to see their expansion and extension as a service to the Parliament. I did see in Israel the provisions made for similar sorts of committees, although the system there is different from ours. There the standing committees that examine legislation have committee rooms that are assigned permanently to them and to the staff of the committees, and they are quite adequate for the purpose. Westminster too, of course, has very much greater facilities. I will examine what can be done to improve the facilities in the committee rooms and I will report to the House. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable member were concerned about unemployment, he might have some concern about penalty rates. The present system of penalty rates is crazy. I share, as I am sure the Government shares, the concern which the honourable gentleman has mentioned because the present system of penalty rates contributes very significantly indeed to higher costs in the industry, loss of investment and an overall reduction in the number of job opportunities. However, I must say that there is a limit to what this Government can do. The honourable gentleman would be aware of the negotiations that are taking place within the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission between the union involved and the employers and that those negotiations concern a consent determination. The union in question is the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia. </para>

          <para>Although that matter is more properly within the jurisdiction of my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, as I understand it, what is taking place is a renegotiation of the award. According to my information, the employers have not seen fit to reopen the question of penalty rates. I think that that causes, not only within the industry but elsewhere in Australia, a great sense of concern that the employers are not prepared to stand up, not simply for their own interest but rather in terms of investment in the industry. At the same time that action which comes as a consequence of an arrangement in the consent award determination between employers and employees is adding very significantly to the burden of the loss of job opportunities in Australia. </para>

              <para>- If I may say to my honourable friend, I would indeed do that but it would not meet the convenience of the House. When this country acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the first requirement which was cast upon the country was to enter into an agreement regarding safeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency. That was in 1974. There were two requirements concerning safeguards pursuant to Part II of the IAEA agreement. The first requirement was that if any particular fissionable material was available, it had to be declared- I think that &#39;declarable&#39; was the term used. Secondly, it had to be appropriately safeguarded &#39;safeguardable&#39; was the term used. Following accession to the non-proliferation treaty and the IAEA safeguards agreement- I say this without any partisan feeling- the scientists working for the Government which was administering them, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member, did not initially address themselves to the Maralinga area. That is the first observation I made in my statement. They did not do so for the good and simple reason that they took the view that there was nothing declarable at Maralinga pursuant to the IAEA safeguards agreement. They took the view also that there was nothing recoverable. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>If the honourable gentleman looks at the language I have used in my public statement he will find the term &#39;potentially recoverable&#39;. I say to the honourable gentleman that there is a very respectable body of opinion that it is not potentially recoverable, ergo not declarable and not safeguardable. This is a matter for scientific inquiry. </para>
          <para>The Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council, which is administered by my friend and colleague the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, reported on the need for scientific inquiry in 1976. The conclusion in its report was that a further inquiry should be made. That matter comes under the jurisdiction of my honourable friend, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. </para>
          <para>My responsibility in this matter, quite apart from sharing the corporate Government responsibility in the issue, is a ministerial responsibility with respect to the records concerning the Maralinga test of the 1 950s. </para>
          <para>Having said that, I apologise to the honourable gentleman and to the House for having been so long. May I now answer the specific questions put to me. Early in 1977 I was informed of the existence of plutonium in a discrete form. Discrete form is not simply, as some have suggested, like the form of a golf ball or a half pound of butter. &#39;Discrete&#39; means that the half kilogram that is there is individually and distinctly identifiable from the <inline font-style="italic">l9Vi</inline> kilograms which is spread throughout some 834 tonnes of rubble. As to the second specific question the honourable gentleman asked me, if the material is potentially recoverable- large as the odds may be- it may be possible at some distant time in the future for it to be recovered illegally. That was precisely my concern on this question. I wanted the reconnaissance of the Maralinga burial pits to be completed before any indication was given to the rest of the world and to some malevolent minds that exist in the world that that material was there. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Because the High Court of Australia made a decision in favour of the Australian Wheat Board within weeks of the commencement of the 1978 harvest, can the Minister inform the House whether the Wheat Board intends applying the new powers given to it by the decision in an inflexible manner or whether there is any indication that the Board will adopt a softer line during the current harvest for people who have made firm commitments under the old arrangements? </para>

            <para>-It is true that as a result of the High Court decision the stabilisation arrangements introduced long since by this Parliament have been held to be constitutionally valid. In that they are supplemented by complementary legislation of each of the States they are not capable of being avoided by the application of section 92 of the Constitution. In response to that decision, numbers of wheat growers have suggested that perhaps there might be reason to change the legislation presently and apply the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission on wheat stabilisation. Let me assure wheat growers everywhere that it is complementary legislation of the Commonwealth and the States, not peculiarly that of this place, and that there is certainly no physical opportunity for any change to that legislation before the coming wheat selling season. If in the event of discussions apropos the IAC report it should be accepted that the report should be implemented in whole or in part, that will be a matter for further discussion and, of course, subsequent government decision and legislation, which will probably be introduced into this place early in 1979. The Wheat Board, therefore, has the responsibility of determining the basis upon which domestic wheat marketing will take place with respect to the 1978-79 season. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Board, in my view, is correctly concerned with equity among growers. Those who have been trading privately across the border generally have avoided costs of about $16 per tonne. These costs relate to storage charges, the wheat research levy and the administration charges of the Board. At the same time there are a number of problems in respect of ensuring that those who trade across the border have a reasonable opportunity to deliver their products in an equitable way. It is necessary, for example, that the restrictive hours used by some of the grain elevator boards be looked at because at the moment private traders receive grain 24 hours a day. I hope that the Wheat Board might find some facility whereby the grain elevator boards will be able to receive grains over a wider period of time than has been possible in the past. </para>
          <para>It is also true that off-grade wheats have created some problems. I think some facility needs to be established in this respect. The Wheat Board is looking at these and other issues. I understand it has still to determine finally its policy with respect to trading within Australia, but I have little doubt that the product of the High Court decision is that wheat growers throughout Australia will receive significantly more for wheat traded domestically than has been the case in the last few years, and this is something that I think every wheat grower generally would welcome. </para>

            <para>-On 27 September last the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> referred to the question of fire protection measures in Parliament House and asked what action, if any, had been taken on a report that had been submitted on this matter. Following a request from the Joint House Department for a survey to be made of the fire risk in Parliament House, a number of inspections of the building were made by the Fire Commissioner and other officers of the Canberra Fire Brigade. The Fire Commissioner then submitted a comprehensive report on fire protection and safety measures in Parliament House. The honourable member for Corio referred to a comment in the report which indicated that this building could be brought to a satisfactory level of fire protection only by razing it to the ground and rebuilding it. For the information of all honourable members, I quote the relevant section of the report. It states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Before proceeding further it should be mentioned that to implement adjustments within this complex, necessary for the building to comply rigidly with the requirements of to-day, would be tantamount to demolition and reconstruction. Consequently when submitting recommendations relative to the upgrading of buildings some latitude has to be extended. Before any concession is permitted however, the situation is closely evaluated to determine the possible effect with regard to the safety of occupants and overall fire safety within the building. </para>

          <para class="block">Recognising that a new and permanent Parliament House cannot be built overnight and further recognising that while it is being built fire protection is essential against the considerable risk of loss of life, the report recommends that the following immediate action be taken as an essential minimum program: </para>

          <para>-At the outset of these proceedings I express on behalf of the Opposition our great concern at the way in which this debate has been brought on. There Has been no discussion with the Opposition about not going ahead with the matter of public importance and also, the way in which these Bills have been brought on today without giving the Opposition time to put them before a party meeting, breaches the normal understandings of the way in which Bills will be handled before this House. There has been no explanation of why this is being done. Is it because the Government is so embarrassed about its own legislation that it does not want to have it debated or to have it on the Notice Paper any longer than is absolutely necessary? This would seem to be the case. To say the least it is utterly discourteous of the Government to give us no reason whatever for proceeding in this fashion. The Bills which have been brought before the House in this way give effect to the Government&#39;s income tax amendments announced in the Budget and therefore one can understand why the Government is so anxious to get them through the House and out of the way. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>They are not exactly the highpoint of the Government&#39;s political standing in this country at the present time. The effect of these Bills is to increase considerably the income tax burden on Australian taxpayers, particularly upon those who are least able to bear that burden. The Opposition approaches these Bills with absolute opposition to many of the proposals contained therein. In our view they amount to a cynical repudiation of past promises to the Australian people. In their overall effect they are economically damaging and will further intensify the recession. They are also quite inequitable in that their major impact is on low and middle income earners. The principal feature of these Bills is the imposition of an income tax surcharge for this financial year in that there is to be an increase in the rate of tax applying to income taxpayers in this country of21/2 per cent from 1 November to give effect to a 11/2 per cent increase for the whole financial year. This measure will raise some $562m in this financial year and is therefore an important measure. </para>
        <para>Consideration of this surcharge reveals three major characteristics of this Government: Firstly, its utter dishonesty and untrustworthiness; secondly, the absurdity of its economic policy; and thirdly, its absolute determination to redistribute income on a more inequitable basis. In regard to the dishonesty aspect, this Government has emphasised over the last year- certainly in the Budget of 1977 and in the period thereafter, right up until the elections- that the people of Australia could look forward to very substantial tax cuts. In the Budget last year the then Treasurer proclaimed the new tax arrangements as &#39;the most revolutionary change yet made to Australia&#39;s system of income tax &#39;. He also claimed that &#39; the new system goes a long way to restoring the monetary incentive for individuals to work and work harder, to take on added responsibility, to work overtime&#39; and so on. In the end result, this great new system, this revolutionary change, the greatest revolution in the tax system since Federation, lasted only half a year. The tax cuts came in in February of this year and in August of this year the Government announced their total abolition for many taxpayers and a very substantial reduction for the rest. </para>
        <para>However, it was not only a matter of what was said at the Budget last year. If there is one pan of the election last year which would stick in the mind of each person in this country it would be that the Government parties went to the polls in 1977 saying to the Australian people: &#39;If you elect us you will get substantial tax cuts&#39;. The Government went out of its way to embed that in the mind of each voter in this country. No Government spokesman spoke without mentioning that in the course of the election campaign. It was the focal point for its advertising campaign. I am sure everyone recalls the enormous advertisements that the Government parties had in the newspapers with hands showing fistfuls of money, fourteen $5 I think were counted, and the caption that this represented the Government&#39;s tax cuts. These are the kinds of things that were done at that time. It was embedded in the mind of the electorate that a return of this Government meant substantial tax cuts. These were grossly exaggerated but the eventful impact was probably to make sure people understood that point. </para>
        <para>To make sure the electorate understood what it meant for it the Government parties established a &#39;dial a tax cut&#39; system in every capital city. You could ring a number and find out what your tax cuts were going to be. Many people did that. I understand some quarter of a million people rang those numbers to find out what their tax cuts were going to be. This was a very important issue in the last election. Now what has happened? This Government has decided totally to repudiate its promise to the Australian people, a promise which was the key point in its election policy last year, by imposing an income tax surcharge which will totally wipe out the tax cuts for the majority of taxpayers, particularly those taxpayers who are lower middle income earners, and substantially reduce the tax cuts for the rest. To demonstrate this point, I wish to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> two tables relating to the 1 February tax savings to the tax increases which will come as a result of the imposition of this tax surcharge. </para>

            <para>-These tables show for taxpayers without dependants and for taxpayers with a dependent spouse the result of the imposition of the income tax surcharge and compare that with the saving to taxpayers at various income levels as a result of the tax cuts introduced in February. They show that taxpayers in the range of $1 14 a week to $238 a week- some 55 per cent of all taxpayers- will totally lose their tax cuts which were brought in in February this year in that the increases in their taxes from 1 November will be more than what they had their tax reduced by in February of this year. It is a tremendously important step that this Government is taking, a step which not only repudiates its number one election promise but also represents, in respect of many taxpayers, a substantial impost on their tax liability. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>That is not the end of the story because when the tax cuts were announced we were told that there was going to be only half tax indexation; as the Government was being so generous in giving these tax cuts it could not afford to go ahead with full tax indexation, there would only be half tax indexation. The tables do not take account of the fact that there is only half tax indexation introduced nor of the fact that half of this tax indexation- so called- really only becomes onethird tax indexation because in the price index used by the Government for tax indexation purposes there were taken out a number of price increases due to devaluation and indirect tax increases before the Government halved that to get the tax indexation factor. It finished up being one-third tax indexation. These tables do not even take account of that. When we take account of the fact that the tax indexation factor was much less than full indexation, the tax payers generally are even worse off than is shown in these tables. This represents a massive fraud on the Australian electorate. It is an utter repudiation of promises made in the last Budget and, most particularly, at the last election. It emphasises the total untrustworthiness of this Government. One just cannot believe anything it says. We have seen example after example of broken promises from this Government following the elections of 1975 and 1977, but the surcharge is the most blatant and most cynical of all those broken promises. It is simply no defence to claim that the surcharge is only temporary and that it is just something which is to apply for a few months only. How do we know whether that is true? </para>

            <para>- Sure, it is in the legislation, but the Government can easily introduce new legislation; that is nothing. We have only the word of the Government for it, and the Government&#39;s word is worth nothing because we cannot trust anything it says. If the Government says to us that this is only a temporary surcharge, on its past record the most likely assumption we can make is that in fact it is going to be a permanent feature, because every time it says that something is so we find out that it is quite the opposite. Let us look at the promise to support wage indexation, the promise to retain Medibank and the myriad other promises which have been discarded by this Government. We just cannot take the word of this Government on anything and, as I say, this surcharge is the most blatant example of the cynicism of this Government. In being so cynical it is demeaning not only itself- goodness knows that it is doing that- but also the parliamentary institution and the parliamentary process. </para>

        <para>As I mentioned, another aspect of this income tax surcharge which reveals the Government&#39;s characteristics is the absurdity of its economic policies. The tax surcharge will further depress demand. Anyone can understand that if we take $560m off the Australian people they are going to have that much less money to spend and, therefore, there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> going to be less consumer demand. The savings ratio is about IS per cent. Therefore, 85 per cent of that $560m would have been spent if the Government had not taken it off the people and would have had the effect on the economy of increasing economic activity and at least doing something to arrest the growth of unemployment. </para>

            <para>- I will be coming to the deficit. The Government&#39;s policy is clearly depressing demand; that is obvious. Professor Neville at the University of New South Wales, who is one of our foremost fiscal analysts, has assessed that this income tax surcharge and the associated tax measures contained in these Bills will depress gross non-farm product by 0.6 per cent, which is a substantial amount given that the Government is hoping- I emphasise the word &#39;hoping&#39; as distinct from the word &#39;estimating&#39;- for a growth of something like 4 per cent. The loss of 0.6 per cent is an important loss and is something which this Government seems not to have taken into account. It is tremendously important that we get an increase in consumer demand if we are to have economic recovery. Consumer demand represents about 60 per cent of total demand in the country. With the government sector being reduced in real terms- that is an important area of demand but there is no growth there- with investment in the private dwelling sector of demand being at an abysmally low level and with exports being low, where are we to get economic growth if it does not come from the consumer sector? Perhaps it may come from investment in fixed capital equipment, but that is only one sector of demand. We must have growth in consumer demand if we are doing all these other things. But this tax surcharge and the associated tax measures make that much less likely to happen. Therefore, this is an enormous contradiction in this Government&#39;s economic policies. The Government&#39;s arguments to the contrary are quite pathetic. It is claimed in Statement No. 2 of the Budget Papers that this tax surcharge will have only a marginal effect on consumption, but there is no substantiation of that; it is a mere assertion. In talking to the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures two days after he brought down his Budget the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> said: </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>I would like to emphasise my belief that industry should not fear its effects upon consumer demand. Firstly, it is temporary, and the necessary legislation will bring it to an end on 30 June next; there is no reason, therefore, why it should have an ongoing effect on consumer confidence or expectations. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The reality is that consumer confidence and expectations have been crashing all through this calendar year. Since the beginning of this year the indexes of consumer sentiment published by the Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic Research have been showing a continual decline. The growth in retail sales has been minimal, so there has been no sign of consumer confidence. In fact quite the contrary is the case. Since the Treasurer brought down his Budget we have seen a further decline in consumer confidence to the lowest point in ages. I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of about a week ago headed &#39;Consumer confidence down sharply in August &#39;. It reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Consumer confidence, which has been on a downturn since January, suffered a further sharp drop in August, according to the latest survey by the University of Melbourne &#39;s Institute of Applied Economic Research. The August drop was the sharpest ever recorded since the institute first began its survey in early 1973 . . . The institute&#39;s index of consumer sentiment dropped a substantial 12.2 points between the July and August surveys to its present level of 9 1 .2. This is the second lowest reading recorded by the Institute . . . The survey shows a major downturn in consumer confidence in Australia in 1978 . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">So we can see from this that it is absurd to suggest that the Budget and the income tax surcharge would not damage consumer confidence. They have had a disastrous effect on it and, therefore, on consumer demand and on the prospects of economic recovery in this country. This is a tremendously serious matter which we have under discussion. This Government, I think, has failed abysmally to understand the effects of its economic policies. It seems surely most unlikely that consumers will spend strongly when real disposable income is being reduced by the tax surcharge and their confidence has been shattered. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s reason for proposing the income tax surcharge is that it says it has to get the deficit down, but this Government has a deficit phobia. Of course, deficits are not unimportant if they spiral out of control. That has important implications for monetary policy, but it does not automatically follow that an increase in the deficit necessarily means an increase in inflation. Indeed, last year we saw the deficit increase by $600m, but there was a very substantial decline in inflation. Inflation fell from 13.3 per cent in 1976-77 to 7.9 per cent in 1977-78, and that was with an increase in the deficit of $600m. So it is absurd to argue, as the Government does, that there is some sort of black box relationship between the deficit and inflation and that if the deficit goes up a few hundred million it will mean an automatic increase in inflation. It just does not work like that. The simplistic notion that the Government has is just utterly without foundation. The reason that last year&#39;s deficit blew out from $2.2 billion, for which the Government budgeted, to $3.3 billion was that the economy was more recessed than the Government expected and, therefore, there was a great shortfall in revenue. That is why we have such a big increase in the deficit. </para>
        <para>What the Government is doing now with this income tax surcharge and other measures is squeezing the economy further, trying to raise revenue to reduce the size of the deficit, but it is making it more likely that the deficit will blow out again because revenue will fall short through lack of economic growth. Therefore, next year there will again be a blown out deficit, lower levels of economic activity and more pressure to increase taxes to try to get the deficit down. We are in an absurd situation. It is a vicious cycle of deflation which will ruin this country if the Government does not mend its ways in the near future. </para>
        <para>Another aspect of this Government&#39;s characteristics which has been revealed by the income tax surcharge is its determination to redistribute income more inequitably. The February tax cuts, as I have already mentioned, were highly inequitable. The tables which I have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> show that taxpayers on average weekly earnings of around $200 saved only $3.07 a week as a result of the tax cuts in February of this year, compared with tax savings for people on $2,000 a week of $1 12 a week. Just think of that for a moment. In February of this year the Government gave a person on $2,000 a week a tax saving of $ 112 a week, but a person on $200 a week- round about average weekly earningswas given a tax saving of a whole $3 a week. So, quite clearly, the Government was biased very much towards the high income groups. This is shown up by the fact that 40 per cent of the total benefit of the tax cuts went to the top 10 per cent of income earners. In fact, 15 per cent of the benefit went to the top 1.4 per cent of taxpayersthose earning $30,000 a year and over, or at least those declaring to the Commissioner of Taxation that they were earning that much. So we can see that these tax cuts have been highly inequitable in that they have given a vast amount in tax savings to the people on the higher income levels and miserable amounts to the people on the lower income levels. That is the effect of the February tax cuts. Now that this tax surcharge is being introduced we find that it has its major impact on the people on lower incomes and its least impact on the people on higher incomes. So the higher income earners have saved again. Everything this Government does is tinged by this process of redistributing income from the low and middle income earners to the high income earners. It is not just so with taxes: It applies in a whole range of areas. But it is particularly noticeable with taxes. </para>
        <para>As I have mentioned, the tax surcharge is highly inequitable. The table that I mentioned shows that all taxpayers earning between $114 and $238 a week lose all their 1 February tax cuts, whereas a person on $2,000 a week, with a tax saving of $ 1 12 a week after the February tax cuts, will still gain $62 a week after the tax surcharge has been imposed. So he is much better off than a person on a lower income level. The combined effect of the tax cuts and the tax surcharge is to leave him in a much improved position compared with his position before the tax cuts. But for the ordinary wage and salary earners in this country, this is not the case: They are worse off than before. A massive redistribution is involved in these tax cuts and the tax surcharge. This is extremely revealing of the Fraser Government&#39;s characteristics and it shows why people are turning away from the Government in droves. </para>
        <para>There are a number of other measures in this legislation to which I will quickly refer. The taxation of annual leave and long service leave on a new basis is a very important measure, and one which is strongly opposed by the Opposition. What is proposed by this legislation is that all annual leave payments on termination of employment after 15 August will be taxed at the rate of 33Vi per cent and all long service leave that accrues after 1 5 August will be taxed at the rate of 3 3 <inline font-style="italic">&#165;i</inline> per cent when paid on termination of employment. The present position is that such payments are only taxable to the extent of 5 per cent of them being included in assessable income for tax purposes. The result of changing the legislation in this way is to gain a lot of revenue for the Government. The annual leave change will raise $70m in revenue this financial year. The long service leave measure will raise only some $6m because this measure is being phased in. </para>
        <para class="block">For the individuals involved, the impact is very important. I take as an example the worker on $200 a week who has his employment terminated and who leaves with four weeks annual leave being paid to him.  His  four weeks annual leave entitles him to payment of the sum of $800. Previously that was taxable at the rate of 5 per cent and he would have paid $13 in tax on that sum. Now he will have to pay $267 in tax on that amount. That is a very dramatic change and one which will greatly disadvantage many workers who commonly leave their jobs and go to new jobs. I instance in particular workers in the building and construction industry. The reason given for the change is that the Government sees the current tax law as encouraging the non-taking of leave during a person&#39;s working life. Many workers do not take their leave when it falls due- there is certainly some truth in that- but if the Government is really concerned about the health of workers and wants to make sure that they take their leave when it is due so that they do not overwork themselves and so on, why does it not go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or the other industrial tribunals and seek amendments to the awards to ensure that the workers take their leave within a certain time? Why mess around with the taxation system to try to induce people to do so? It is simply not going to get to the heart of the matter anyway. The Government is only taxing leave which is taken on the termination of employment. If one stays with the one employer all one&#39;s life and accumulates vast amounts of leave, there will not be any tax levied on that leave until one&#39;s retirement. What this tax does, of course, is tax heavily those who commonly swap from job to job. As I mentioned previously, this is particularly true in the building and construction industries. Building and construction workers often go into an unemployment situation, particularly in present circumstances and in going into an unemployment situation previously they had at least their pro rata leave entitlement to take with them. Now, of course, they will be taking with them leave that is payable at the same rate of tax as would be payable if they were at work. There have been a number of examples of that but I do not have the time to go into them. </para>
        <para>Another important point is the lack of superannuation for wage earners. This kind of approach has its major impact on blue collar workers. These are the people who have little superannuation provision. Mostly superannuation applies to people who are white collar workers. What workers of this kind take out when they leave their jobs and retire is their accumulated leave. This Government is now saying to them: &#39;Sorry, but that accumulated leave which you were going to take into your retirement and on which you previously paid little tax is now going to be really solidly taxed&#39;. The tax rate will increase twenty-fold. That is what is being done. Therefore it is having a major effect on blue collar workers. </para>
        <para>I shall quickly mention some other matters. One is the abolition of home loan interest as a tax deduction. Absolutely no reason has been given for doing so. Its major impact is on low income earners. The tax deduction is phased out by the time an income reaches $14,000 a year, but it is not to be replaced by anything. The home savings grants are being postponed. They are getting harder to obtain. The effect on the home buyer, particularly a low income earner who wishes to buy a modest home- it would have to be modest if he is buying a house on an income of something like $120 a week- is substantial. Assuming that a low income earner were paying something like 13 per cent of his income on a home loan and that 90 per cent of that was for interest, he would be losing some $3 a week as a result of this tax measure. That is an important tax impost on a worker at that level of income and it makes it infinitely more difficult for workers at lower income levels to obtain a house. </para>
        <para>Similarly, the removal of the tax exemption from the Commonwealth post-graduate awards is something which this Government has rushed into without proper consideration. Such awards are currently at a subsistence level. They have fallen far behind the rate of inflation. If they had been adjusted for inflation since 1970 they would be more than $1,000 higher than they are at present. But this Government intends to tax them just the same. This means that a research worker with a post-graduate award will be paying something like $70 a year in tax which he would not have paid previously. Such people also will be adversely affected by the health insurance measures. Previously, they never paid the health insurance levy because they paid no tax but they had a 75 per cent cover under the health insurance scheme. Now they still will not be paying any levy but they will have a cover of only 40 per cent. So on that side of things they have been badly affected as well. </para>
        <para>If there is to be taxation of post-graduate grants- one could see some argument for it if the grants were large enough- the amount of the grant should be increased. There is no means test on these grants. Therefore if we are to tax these grants- I can see some argument for it- we should do so only if there is a substantial increase in the amount of the grant to make it a living wage. But we should not be taxing on a level of real grant which has fallen way behind the rate of inflation. </para>
        <para>The averaging of income for primary producers is one aspect of this Budget which we support. What is involved is simply the restriction of the amount of non-farm income which primary producers can include for averaging purposes. The Opposition supports the &#39;measures that are being taken in this regard. It clearly is cutting down on a form of tax avoidance by preventing Pitt Street and Collins Street farmers from utilising their farming activities to gain a substantial tax benefit in respect of their non-farm income. We support that measure. One could argue perhaps that the $5,000 level for non-farm income is a little too high, but in general we regard this as a worthwhile proposal. The Opposition strongly opposes the abolition of the rebate for a dependant residing overseas. The Government is proposing to say to migrants in this country that the tax concession which they received previously in respect of funds sent overseas to look after their dependants in their country of origin is now to be removed. This proposal will increase tax revenue by about $20m a year. It means that the migrants of this country will be paying to the Government in 1978-79 $20m which they did not have to pay in 1977-78. I understand that this has caused considerable concern in the migrant community in this country. </para>
        <para>Finally, may I quickly mention the proposal to extend the gift provisions of the tax law to the World Wildlife Fund of Australia. Why is this being done in respect of that particular charity? We have no strong objections to it but no reason has been given. This Government just governs as though it does not give a damn about the people of Australia, It does not say why it is doing things and in this respect it nominates one charity out of the blue. Is this because a particular person got to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> or perhaps to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)?</inline> We do not know. We have not been told. What is wrong with all the other worthwhile charities? Why is this particular one mentioned? </para>
        <para>These Bills demonstrate, as no other Bills have done, that this is a government lacking enormously in principle and it is a government which is basically dishonest and untrustworthy. They demonstrate the paucity of its economic policies and they demonstrate its utter lack of concern to bring about a more equitable society in this country. </para>

          <para>- It is well known that it is many times easier to criticise than it is to be constructive. The honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> spent 30 minutes criticising this legislation. He did not offer any concrete suggestions as to what the Labor Party would do. I want to be constructive but firstly, since the honourable member for Gellibrand spoke about the &#39;nasty&#39; things that this Government has been doing- obviously he has had a &#39;great&#39; lesson in economics since he has been a member of the Opposition because he appears to have learned little- I would like briefly to mention some of the things that the Whitlam Labor Government did during its term in office. Firstly, receipts from personal income tax were raised by an unprecedented 89 per cent during the first two years that Labor was in office. That is not a bad sort of a record for a party whose spokesman on economic matters claims in this place that we are over-taxing the people, that we are thrusting great burdens on them. Indirect taxes were increased in each of the three Labor Budgets. A massive increase of $602m in indirect taxes and levies, excluding the coal export levy, was imposed by a Labor Government. Last but not least- it is very important to remind the people of Australia of this- the Labor Government specifically refused to introduce tax indexation for individuals or for companies. That is very important. The tax indexation legislation is the most important piece of tax legislation introduced by this Government in the <inline font-style="italic">2lA</inline> years it has been in office. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Indexation, which would have returned tax to all the people of Australia, was refused by that Labor Government. Yet the honourable member for Gellibrand had the hide and the audacity to stand up in this place and say that this Government is over-taxing the Australian people. </para>
        <para>As the honourable member for Gellibrand broadened the debate into the general economic area, I would like to make a few points. I am at a loss to understand the conflict that has developed in the Opposition&#39;s economic policies. One of the Opposition&#39;s spokesmen on economic matters stands up in this place and says that the Government should spend more money and not worry about a deficit, yet today another member of the Opposition sought to introduce as a matter of public importance a discussion on concern about the Government&#39;s overseas borrowings. I do not know how a Labor government could blow out a deficit and at the same time not borrow more money overseas. Obviously a Labor government would return to the printing of money. </para>
        <para>We are debating five Bills and they are all machinery Bills. They have been spoken about in August in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> but nevertheless some of them are of extreme significance and importance. I would like to deal with those last; I would first like to mention three of the Bills briefly. One of the Bills before the House is a Bill to rectify a particular aspect of tax indexation which disadvantaged a small group of people. It rectifies the position for a small group of people whom the honourable member for Gellibrand claimed were disadvantaged as a result of tax indexation. It is true that when the Government brought down the 50 per cent tax indexation in conjunction with the threetier revised scale introduced in February, a small number of people would have had to pay marginally more tax. At that time the Government promised that no person would be disadvantaged. One of the five Bills we are debating today removes that disadvantage. Provision is made in one of these Bills so that a small number of people who were marginally disadvantaged will not have to pay more tax than other people. </para>
        <para>The Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill is a machinery Bill to increase company tax by lh per cent in line with the 1% per cent temporary surcharge that unfortunately has been imposed on people who operate under the pay-as-you-earn tax system. The third Bill I want to mention is the Health Insurance Levy Amendment Bill which provides for the levy to cease from 1 November. I am very pleased to see the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> sitting at the table. The Australian people are now starting to understand this proposal. They are now starting to realise that the abolition of the health insurance levy, which, of course, will return <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent tax to many people, in conjunction with the new system that has been instituted, is of great benefit and is a great step forward by this Government for the Austraiian people. </para>

            <para>- As the Minister for Health says, it puts money back into the pockets of the Australian people. I am pleased to say that despite all the confusion over the last month or so the Austraiian people are now realising the advantages of this new system. It is appropriate that in one of the Sydney newspapers today, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> the headline on the front page reads &#39;Fund&#39;s new medical table halves old rates&#39;. In other words, a particular fund has been able to halve the old rate that was offered to its members. The article reads: </para>

        <para class="block">I am pleased to see that people are starting to understand the new scheme. I am pleased also to support the legislation which as from 1 November no longer makes it necessary for people to pay a 2te per cent levy in addition to their tax. </para>
        <para>One of the remaining two Bills was dealt with at length by the honourable member for Gellibrand, as one would expect him to do. He was really able to get stuck into this one. He said that this Government is removing the 5 per cent tax on lump sum payments for annual leave and superannuation. Of course, he can jump on the bandwagon and make that statement. This Bill will return $60m a year to the Government but I think it needs a little bit of explanation. Many people came to my office complaining about this legislation but obviously they did not understand it. Their expectations of what this legislation is going to do did not turn out to be so bad after all when it was explained to them. First of all let me state this. It was never intended that people should accumulate annual leave. People were to take leave annually and have a rest from their normal employment. I think that is the purpose of annual leave. I am surprised to hear a Labor Party supporter speaking against this legislation because I know that firmly embodied in Labor&#39;s policy is the principle that people should take their annual leave. In fact this legislation stops annual leave from being converted to a lump sum payment on retirement. I feel sorry for those people who have been caught up under this legislation but annual leave was meant to have been taken and they should have taken it. The news about long service leave, superannuation and other lump sum payments that are made on retirement is not so bad at all. Only 5 per cent of long service leave that accumulated up to 15 August is to be included in a person&#39;s taxable income. Only that long service leave which accumulates after 15 August is to be taxable at the rate of 3314c in the dollar, which is the base rate of the new scale. </para>
        <para>Superannuation is not mentioned in this Bill because no alteration has been made to it, but it forms part of lump sum payments on retirement. Another section of this Bill deals with other payments. I mention this because I have certainly had deputations, particularly from people who are employed in the Local Government Association where it is normal for a gratuity of one week&#39;s payment for every year of service to be paid on retirement. I am pleased to see that this legislation ensures that that is treated not as normal annual holiday pay which is fully taxed but as another form of accumulated long service leave. The effect of this Bill on that payment is certainly not nearly as severe as those people had originally thought. </para>
        <para>The fifth Bill which is embodied in this legislation deals with the 1V4 per cent surcharge and in particular is related to pay-as-you-earn tax. It is clearly embodied in the legislation that that surcharge expires on 30 June 1979. It is to be applied for only 12 months. The honourable member for Gellibrand asked: &#39;How honest is the Government&#39;. I think that this Government is very honest. I am proud to be part of it. I would not be part of a government that was not honest. The time for the application of this surcharge is embodied in the legislation. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Treasurer have made statements about it. What more can we do to convince people that it is necessary to apply this <inline font-style="italic">\Vi</inline> per cent surcharge for only 12 months? I do not think there is any doubt about the situation. </para>
        <para>The Bill to which I am now referring, the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill 1978, that legalises this surcharge also alters two other tax rates. For instance, where a person&#39;s income exceeds $16,608 the legislation alters the tax scale to 47.5 per cent, and where a person&#39;s income exceeds $33,216 the legislation alters the tax scale to 61.5 per cent. I think that people on high incomes such as those should have to pay a high rate of tax. I do not think, as the Opposition spokesman suggested, that this Government is disadvantaging people on low incomes. </para>
        <para>In the final part of my address I come back to the generosity that has been extended through the indexation that has been introduced by this Government; indexation that, over the last three years, has returned to the Austraiian people approximately $ 1,000m for each year, that is, a total of $3,000m. Only at the weekend I took out and studied some figures on income tax collections which went back to the years when the Labor Government was in office. I worked out the increase in total tax collections over the previous years, adjusted for movements in the consumer price index. In 1973-74 when the total tax collections were almost $ 11,000m, the total increase in tax collections over the previous year was 28.6 per cent, and 13.9 per cent after adjusting it for movements in the CPI. Yet in the last three years, after adjusting for movements in the CPI, the increases in taxation collected over the previous years were a plus of 5.8 per cent for 1975-76, a plus of 2.5 per cent for 1976-77 and a minus of one per cent for 1977-78. 1 seek your indulgence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> to have this rates scale incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>- Very well. This scale shows clearly that in 1973-74 the increased tax collection over 1972-73, after the adjustment for the movement in the CPI, was 13.9 per cent. That was when the Labor Government was in office. In 1974-75, once again under the Labor Government, the increase in tax collections over the previous year, after adjusting for movements in the CPI, was 1 1 per cent. As I have said, in 1975- 76 the increase was plus 5.8 per cent, in 1976- 77 it was plus 2.5 per cent and in 1977-78 it was minus one per cent. Now I come to the estimate of tax collections for 1978-79, which is of course contained in the Budget which was presented to the House only in August. Even after the surcharge is applied, the estimated increase in tax collections for this coming year over the previous year is a low 5 per cent. This shows the Government&#39;s success in tax indexation; it has been able to achieve these figures. </para>

        <para>I will mention also the three-tiered tax scale system which was introduced in February this year. As opposed to the multi-tiered tax scale that we had previously, it is a much simpler system and one that many people can easily follow and understand. At the time when the threetiered tax scale system was introduced the Opposition made great play of the fact that we had abandoned tax indexation because we had brought in only a 50 per cent tax indexation. The Government has made it clear that it intends to continue with tax indexation in future years and that the people will benefit from it. I have the utmost confidence in the future of Australia. I have the utmost confidence in the legislation that is before the House at the moment. I know that no one likes to pay tax; none of us like to do that; but tax is a necessity if we are to provide services for the people of Australia who are in need. Taxation is like a great big funnel: Money from taxation is taken in one end from the people who can afford to pay taxes and is filtered out the other end for community services such as education and health. </para>
        <para>Yet the Opposition says that we should not do this and we should not do that. It criticises this tax legislation almost as if it believes that no increases in tax are necessary. I deplore that action. Taxes are necessary. The increases that have been brought about by this legislation are sensible, particularly in light of the Budget deficit. I have no hesitation in suggesting that such legislation will be advantageous to Australia in reducing the deficit. As soon as the Australian economy has picked up, as it is now picking up, we will be able to do away with the 1? per cent surcharge, as the legislation states, and once again Austalia will continue on its way towards solid economic growth, as it is doing at the moment. </para>

          <para>-The honourable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bradfield)</inline> obviously still believes in fairy tales. He still believes that this surcharge will be applied for only one year. We have seen what has happened to surcharges in the past. He seems also not to recognise that he is part of a government which is dishonest, dishonourable and disreputable. It is led by a dishonest and devious Prime Minister - </para>

            <para>- I withdraw the direct reference in this instance but it does not affect the reputation of this Government as stated by myself. Why is it a dishonourable and disreputable Government? The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> went to the people last December and promised them tax cuts to operate from February of this year. It was on that basis that the Government was elected. Then, as soon as the election was over, the tax cuts were reimposed on the people in this Budget. In other words, the tax cuts have been wiped out completely for those in the lower and lower-middle income groups but not for those in the higher income groups. The Prime Minister made sure he protected his own. I intend to refer to a few examples of this but before I do so I will mention some of the other promises made by the Prime Minister during the last election and the election prior to it which have been broken, as instanced by this legislation. I refer to the home loan interest deductibility scheme. In the election campaign of 1 975 the Prime Minister gave a firm promise and undertaking that it would not be affected; that under no circumstances would it be touched. After the election the first thing he did was to emasculate it and to make it available only to those who were buying their first home. Then he went one step further. In this Budget and in the legislation we are discussing today it has been completely wiped out. Once again a promise has been utterly and irrevocably broken. Dishonesty! Then, of course, we have the question of long service leave and holiday pay which was dealt with by the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis).</inline> For a long while rumours have been going around that action would be taken in regard to long service leave and holiday pay. Honourable members may remember that reports appeared in the Press. </para>

            <para>- That has been recommended to the Government by the Treasury. The Government decided to go for only two of them in this instance, that is, long service leave and holiday pay. Instead of only 5 per cent of lump sum payments for unused long service leave and holiday pay being taxed, these amounts will be taxed now at the rate of 33.5c in the dollar. We are at the half way house at the moment. Because of the public outcry that occurred when news about the taxing of lump sum payments at the standard rate was leaked to the Press, the Government has introduced it in respect of only long service leave and holiday pay and left the taxing arrangement for superannuation benefits unchanged. But, of course, we will see superannuation benefits subject to normal taxation in the future. It too will be taxed at the rate of 33.5 per cent in accordance with the leaks which appeared in the Press prior to the introduction of the Budget. </para>

        <para>I return now to the income tax surcharge. As a result of this surcharge a taxpayer without dependants earning $200 a week, which is pretty well the average, will pay an increase of 8.03 per cent. For a person earning $2,000 a week the increase is only 4.75 per cent. For a person on $200 a week the difference between the 1 November tax increase and the 1 February tax reduction will be a reduction of 15c in take home pay whereas a person on $2,000 a week will be $62.32 better off. That is an extraordinary difference. For a taxpayer with dependent spouse and earning $1 14 a week the percentage increase in taxation is 98. 1 per cent. For a person on $200 a week it is 1 1.3 per cent and for a person on $2,000 a week it is only 4.8 per cent. Is it any wonder that we say that this is a government for the big man, that this is a government which is setting out deliberately to assist the people in the high income bracket? Why is the Government raising this levy? It says that it is raising it because it needs the revenue. Why does it need the revenue? One of the major reasons is that it will not close off one of the most important means of tax evasion in this country, that is, family trusts. In an editorial entitled &#39;A matter of trusts&#39; the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 29 September states. </para>

        <para class="block">I will quote those statistics. In 1973-74 payasyouearn taxpayers paid $4,238m whilst nonPAYE taxpayers paid $ 1,252m. In 1975-76 PAYE taxpayers paid $6,07 lm and non-PAYE taxpayers paid $l,643m. In 1976-77 PAYE contributors paid $8,529m and non-PAYE contributors paid $2,525m. In 1977-78 PAYE contributors paid $9, 639m and non-PAYE contributors paid $2, 490m. The estimate for 1978-79 for PAYE contributors is $ 10,341m and for non-PAYE contributors $2,599m. Between 1973-74 and 1978-79 PAYE contributions have increased 2? times whilst non-PAYE contributions have only doubled. The article continues: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There is no suggestion that professionals and other selfemployed have suffered such a massive revenue loss as to justify the recent decline in tax receipts from non-PAYE contributors. </para>
          <para>As a proportion, tax receipts from non-PAYE people have slipped from a proportion of one in three of PAYE contributions to one in four. </para>

It is very obvious that the family trust mechanism is being used as a means of avoiding taxation and that this is costing this country many hundreds of millions if not thousands of millions of dollars in revenue. </para>
        <para>I am not going to deal today with the tax avoidance schemes of the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> or the  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal Party. I am dealing with this matter so far as it affects revenue and the reason why the Government has imposed this taxation surcharge. It has done so because it is losing such massive amounts in revenue from the use of the family trust mechanism as a means of avoiding taxation. The Government has refused to close it up because to do so would hurt too many of its own people, including its own members from the very top right down through the reaches. Is it any wonder that I have said that it is a dishonest, dishonourable Government- a devious Government. Of course, I will not repeat what I said about the Prime Minister. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I did not say anything wrong. I said that I would now like to deal with the question of lump sum retirement payments for long service leave and holiday pay. I would like to give one example of how this procedure is to operate. I though that the honourable member for Gellibrand explained the situation very clearly and constructively when he cited the case of the building and construction worker who goes from job to job and then eventually becomes unemployed. In the past a building and construction worker who became unemployed could utilise accumulated pro rata long service leave to tide him over during his period of unemployment. Now, of course, that person will have to pay taxation at the rate of 33.Sc in the dollar on that accumulated pro rata long service leave. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Let me give another example. I refer to the average person who receives a wage of $200 a week and who is entitled to four weeks holiday a year. If that person chooses to save up his holiday pay he will be able to accumulate leave to the value of $800 a year. If he does it for five years he will accumulate leave to the value of $4,000. In the past he was taxed on only five per cent of that $4,000. In other words, he was taxed on only $200 and he would have paid in the vicinity of $66 in tax. However, he will now have to pay tax at the rate of 33.Sc in the dollar on the whole $4,000. Therefore he will pay tax of $1,340 out of the $4,000. That is how the legislation will hit the ordinary person. That is how it will hit the average individual who is earning $200 a week. Is it any wonder that the Opposition opposes this proposal to increase the taxation payable on long service leave and holiday pay. Instead of five per cent of the amount accrued being subject to tax the Government now proposes to tax the lot of it at the rate of 33.5c in the dollar. </para>
        <para>Next on the list is superannuation itself. Claims to this effect were leaked before the Budget was presented. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> made denials. He led everyone up the garden path. But he did not mention long service leave and holiday pay. We should watch what will happen next year in respect of superannuation. The Opposition opposes very strongly the imposition of such a measure. The Opposition opposes strongly the proposal to impose a tax surcharge. It believes that such a proposal is inequitable. It is one that can assist only those people in the high income brackets and it is to the detriment of those in the lower and middle income brackets. Added to that, the proposal is dishonest because the Government gave a firm undertaking at the last election that it would reduce taxation in accordance with the 1 February tax cuts. Now, as soon as the election is over, a surcharge has been introduced and taxes have risen. </para>
        <para>As I said at the beginning of my speech, the honourable member for Barton is living an Alice in Wonderland existence if he believes for one minute that the Government will impose this surcharge for only one year. It is here to stay. The Government has put forward this measure in this way so as to ensure that it hits the middle and lower income groups and not the big men. For this reason the Opposition opposes these propositions. </para>

          <para>-I rise to support the Bills which we are now discussing and which are in fact budgetary measures. Before I deal with this legislation and look a little more closely at some of the avoidance measures which it proposes to close, I would like to refer to some of the points made by previous speakers. I agree with the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis),</inline> who is the Opposition&#39;s spokesman on this matter, that what we should be looking for more than anything else in our taxation laws is equity. If we are looking for equity I believe that we will have to start to rewrite the whole income tax legislation. I agree with him in that respect. However, perhaps his philosophy as to how to get equity is different from mine. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I would like to make a few points in respect of what was said by the honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage).</inline> The honourable member spoke about trusts. I believe that his comments in this respect were based more on rumour and innuendo than on facts. I also believe that speeches of the kind made by the honourable member only created fears and uncertainties as far as the population is concerned. The honourable member talked in terms of the benefits available to some classes of the community as opposed to others. If we look very closely at the changes in the taxation laws over the last decade we will see that considerable benefits have been provided to the lower income earners. For instance, in 1972 the ceiling for tax exemption was $1,040. Yet in the space of six years the ceiling for exemption has more than trebled to the present rate of $3,893. An individual can now earn $75 per week tax free. The spouse can earn as much again, which means that a combined income of $150 per week tax free can flow into a household. </para>
        <para>Having given those concessions to the lower income earners, when one comes to look at the taxation laws with a veiw to giving the benefit of further taxation decreases obviously those people in the lower income bracket will not be advantaged as much as the people in the higher income brackets. The philosophy of taxation is based on how much incentive a person has to earn income in order to produce the revenue that government- the Labor Government particularly, and this Government proceeds to follow suit- needs to pay for fairly lavish welfare and social programs. In fact, I think it was probably a mistake to delete from the title of the Income Tax Assessment Act the fact that it was also a social contribution Act. I believe that we have to weld together the social aspects of our revenue spending and try to provide some basic comparison in respect of the manner in which we raise that revenue from the other sector of the community. We have to relate the amount of money that is spent on people in the community who are disadvantaged and in need to the amount of income that is collected through taxation. </para>
        <para>The honourable member for Chifley quoted from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times.</inline> He placed a great deal of emphasis on the pay-as-you-earn taxation system. I believe that if the honourable member looked at the figures closely he would find that revenue from the pay-as-you-earn taxation system increased&#39; proportionately more during Labor&#39;s term of office than it did in latter years. Of course, this can be attributed to many things. The wage explosion during those years must have increased the collections made under the pay-as-you-earn taxation system. There was no tax indexation to offset the effect of inflation. Worse still, many people in the community during those years sought the security of a salaried job in preference to the uncertainty of private enterprise or businesses that were going bankrupt in great numbers. Probably it would be factual to accept the figures cited by the honourable member. However, we should look at the figures more constructively and place the blame where it should be placed. </para>
        <para>The fact that we are gathering more taxation under the pay-as-you-earn system now is a result of the higher salaries being paid at the cost of less profit in the private enterprise system. Also, without a doubt, this is due to the fact that more employees are earning rather substantial salaries. Therefore, there has been a boost to those payasyouearn taxation collections in that time at the expense, I would suggest, of those people who pay taxation on an annual basis. This can be attributed to the uncertainty of the economic position during the period of the Labor Government. When we are looking at the payasyouearn taxation system, we should never forget that tax paid on the high salaries earned by parliamentarians is collected under the system. Nobody would suggest that the comparison that was drawn by the honourable member for </para>
        <para class="block">Chifley was devoted only to people in receipt of lower incomes. Taxation paid on a tremendous number of higher incomes is being collected through this system. It is possibly a safer system. It is more certain for the Government. It can collect the tax on a weekly basis rather than on an annual basis. They are some of the factors that I thought I would mention. Members of Parliament are not the only people in the community in receipt of high salaries. Many people receive incomes in the vicinity of $300 to $500 a week. We certainly would not call such people poor by any stretch of the imagination. </para>
        <para>I thought that the temptation to mention trusts would have been too great for the honourable member for Chifley to pass up in this debate. Let us be frank about the position: Members of the Opposition have trusts and members of the Government have trusts. They use them for various purposes. But let us look at when the proliferation of the use of trusts and family trusts occurred. It occurred in the years of soaring taxation which was not subject to indexation when the Australian Labor Party was in power. As a practicing accountant at that time, I can certify that these family trusts found their basic origin and their growth in the years when the ordinary individual was being overtaxed. Greater amounts of taxation were being taken from people during those years. In other words, these people thought that they would like to be in partnership with somebody they knew in preference to a partnership with the then Commonwealth Government and paying out a greater share of their profits than should have been the case. The device was initiated then. It was within the power of the then Labor Government to correct any anomalies that it thought were evident at that time. It had plenty of opportunities to do so. But what did honourable members opposite do? They have done nothing except carp and criticise since they have come back here as members of the Opposition. For that reason, they will probably stay members of the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- Yes, they did not build up enough trust in their own Government. That is where they went wrong. The family trust or the trust structure is no different from a private company or a public company structure in which the income is spread over a greater area. I believe that the fact that we have not recognised certain alterations which should be made in the companies structure has led to family trusts being created so that these tax concessions can be gained in practically the same way they are gained in companies. I am not saying that there are not abuses under the system; but if we are to look at just one area without looking at the total effect or the theory of taxation we will not get anywhere. We will have a hop-scotch situation. The trust system is possibly one of the older legal devices that have been adopted under common law. As I said, trusts are no different from a private or public company. The Labor Government had an opportunity to do something about trusts when it was in government and it failed to do so. If we are to look at trusts, let us look at the whole of the Income Tax Assessment Act to make sure that the equity we seek and should have is firmly implanted in the theory of trusts and taxation law. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The legislation we are debating today is designed to close some of the tax avoidance loopholes. Honourable members who have spoken in the debate have mentioned some of these loopholes. I wish to make some remarks in respect of annual pay and long service leave. I hesitate to say that the previous  speaker  in the debate, the honourable member for Chifley, referred to these matters in the same vein that I will. It is a fact that in some commercial transactions, salaries were taken in the form of retirement salaries instead of as immediate income. This is still being done. Instead of taking normal retirement leave or annual leave as the person concerned should have done at the time of earning that leave, this leave was deferred each year, put into the form of retirement pay and then taxed at the rate of 5 per cent. But let us never forget that people who take annual leave, people who take their long service leave in the normal course of employment without terminating employment, have always been taxed on the amount of money they receive. We are dealing with a rather confined area in which certain abuse was occurring. I believe that the Government has recognised that people should not suffer in respect of long service leave provisions by deciding that the rate of tax to be paid on the lump sum shall be only 5 per cent of the sum accrued up to 15 August 1978. Perhaps we could have adopted the same philosophy in respect of annual leave. Lump sum payments for accured annual leave for the 12 months prior to 15 August 1978 could have been assessed in full but leave accrued before 15 August 1977 might have been subjected to the same provisions that apply in respect of long service leave. That is only a suggestion that I make, and possibily too late at that. This was one narrow area of tax avoidance which will be closed. </para>
        <para>I believe that the withdrawal of rebates in respect of overseas dependants occurred because this is another concession area where abuse has occurred. The Government strives to collect taxation under an Act but it may grant an exemption or a concession. Those exemptions or concessions can be subject to abuse. Obviously, this is one area of abuse that has been indicated to the Taxation Office. The narrowing of the provisional tax adjustment from 20 per cent to 10 per cent represents no great penalty. We must realise that it affects only those people whose provisional tax is self-assessed and who have taken advantage of a situation to deliberately underestimate their provisional tax by the 20 per cent margin knowing that they have no fear of retaliation from the Taxation Office. This provision will apply only in the self-assessment provisional tax area. Discretion is still vested with the Commissioner of Taxation for the penalty not to be imposed if he feels there are obvious circumstances that led to miscalculation of the figure submitted initially. Of course, this can happen. </para>
        <para>Some fears and concerns have been expressed in respect of the averaging provisions for primary producers by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council. I think that the Council should receive fairly direct answers from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> when he is replying in the debate on this Bill just to alleviate the fears that have been expressed. Adjustments were made to the tax averaging provisions in 1977. The tax averaging system now is the best it has ever been. It provides all the benefits that are due to primary producers who must contend with seasonal fluctuations and other difficulties. I see the tax averaging provision at this stage as fully covering the difficulties of the primary producer. The amendments now being made to the legislation will prevent the abuses by people who are not primary producers but who would want to enjoy the benefits of these provisions at the risk of damaging the tax base of every other taxpayer in Australia. </para>
        <para>The Treasurer has placed before honourable members a list of 10 or more areas of abuse that have been closed in the last 12 months. This makes me realise that, with the Income Tax Assessment Act in its present form, I can only describe the actions of Australians and the Australian nation in respect of tax as very sick. People who are not prepared to carry their proper burden of taxation or their proper share of the liability devise these avoidance schemes. Possibly the most blatant to come before the notice of the Parliament this year was the sales  tax avoidance scheme. A method of options permitted the taxpayer to avoid his share of liability in respect of the sales tax paid on new motor vehicles. I believe that our society in this regard is rather sick. I do not believe that people should be permitted to deliberately get out of their obvious responsibility and liability as set by the law. They should not be allowed to indulge in these methods of avoiding tax. In this regard, I must say something about a profession that has developed in the last few years. I refer to the tax avoidance industry. I can only class it as a parasite on our society. It should not be part of our society. The sooner we get rid of this industry the better. It is one thing to close down the schemes as they come to our attention, but I believe that it would be far better to ask people in private enterprisepeople in private and public practice in the legal and accounting fraternities- to meet with the Treasurer or the Government on a consultative basis not only to make sure that the professional ethics enunciated by their societies and institutes are adhered to but also so that those people can have an input into government to assist in closing the loopholes. They might be able to make some very good suggestions as to how a better equity between taxpayers could be achieved. Whilst I decry the people who involve themselves in tax avoidance programs, the people I detest are those in the tax avoidance industry, and the sooner we do away with them the better. It is my suggestion that we consult with private enterprise to try to form a consultative panel to deal with the problem. </para>
        <para>Much comment has been made about the <inline font-style="italic">\Vi</inline> per cent increase in tax rates from 32 per cent to 33V4 per cent, but nothing has been said by the Opposition and little has been said by the Press of Australia by the offsetting influence of the cancellation of the Medibank charge as from 1 November, which on my calculation will amount to about $325 a year. I think it is unfair and deliberately misleading for the Opposition to feature the <inline font-style="italic">\Vi</inline> per cent increase without taking into account the offsetting effect of the Medibank levy. In that regard, I believe that the Government has taken a step in the right direction. I say with a certain amount of pride in my own State that we now have a Medibank system which is almost parallel to the one that has been in existence in Queensland for quite a few decades. </para>

            <para>- They might copy us in many other directions too. That aspect has not been brought out in this debate and I doubt whether any Opposition speakers will bring it out. I wish to dwell for a moment on the averaging provisions. A letter has been circulated by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, and I ask the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> or the Minister who replies to this debate to clarify certain aspects of the proposed changes in the averaging provisions. First of all, I ask him to enunciate what farm income is and what nonfarm income is and what guidelines will be set. For instance, there is some concern about the salary paid to a working partner in a primary production partnership. Is that salary, which is paid out of the profits of the firm, classed as farm income or non-farm income? I know that in the past a precedent has been set in relation to the salary paid by a company, which must be regarded as non-farm income, as is the dividend, but I think that partnerships will want to know whether the salary of a working partner is to be regarded as farm or non-farm income. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There is also some concern about the  redemnon  of income equalisation deposits, although I believe that as these income equalisation deposits are redeemed they will come back in the form of farm income, even though the interest will not. That is another area that needs some clarification. Another aspect that needs to be clarified relates to farmers who hire or lend out their farm equipment under a contracting arrangement to assist a neighbour. Will that be regarded as farm or non-farm income? If the plant is hired to any other outsiders in any circumstances, how will that income be regarded by the Taxation Office? I believe that the amount of $5,000 which has been set will allow an individual farmer sufficient scope to cover seasonal fluctuations by making investments from time to time. On today&#39;s rates, an income of $5,000 would represent an investment of about $50,000. Bearing in mind the aspects of income equalisation deposits, this must be a more attractive proposition for people in the rural industry. In fact, it is a very good alternative which a farmer or grazier could use in relation to averaging or income equalisation deposits. I have no hesitation in saying that an income of $5,000 from outside the basic structure of the farm is a fair one and I believe it has been adopted rightly by the Government in order to stop the abuse relating to the Pitt Street and Collins Street farmers. </para>
        <para>In regard to the taxation legislation, the Government has closed some of the loopholes and will be alert in relation to other loopholes. However, in that regard I want to make one final point about the income tax legislation. It is now almost impossible to interpret the legislation. High Court cases in great numbers are required  to interpret it, and I refer particularly to the Curran scheme, where I believe the interpretation was probably not even a legal one; certainly it was not an accounting interpretation. I believe that it is time the Government got down to producing legislation that is as easily read as our Constitution, which has stood the test of time for over 77 years. We should have legislation which provides for one basic tax rate on income, whether on the basis of capital gains or otherwise, with a ceiling to ensure that a family or an individual is allowed to earn a certain income free of tax. Above all, let us reduce the exemptions and rebates that presently apply because every time the Government creates an exemption or rebate it ensures that a comparable abuse will follow. I suggest to the Government that this type of taxation reform is long overdue. I have much pleasure in supporting the budgetary measures introduced by this legislation. </para>

          <para>- There are five income tax Bills before the House. Four of them concern personal income tax and the fifth relates to the health insurance levy. That last Bill proposes the abolition of the health insurance levy from a date to be declared and the Opposition does not oppose it. It is in relation to the other four Bills that we are concerned. We regard them as unfair and unjust in their imposition and accordingly as unacceptable. More than that, they represent a downright dishonest enterprise in the way in which the Government has sought to destroy promises firmly given to the public and accepted in good faith by the public. We intend to oppose those Bills as a demonstration of good faith. We do this in the knowledge that there is justifiable public outrage at the way in which the Government has destroyed those firm undertakings to the community. There can be no quibbling about the opposition of the Australian public to the injustice and the dishonesty of the present Government. That was amply demonstrated a fortnight ago in the Werriwa by-election, which was fought totally on federal issues. It was quite clear that essentially the Australian community, as represented by the people of Werriwa, was repudiating the dishonesty and the injustice which are rampant in the way in which the Government administers the affairs of this country and, more essentially, in the way in which it applies economic policy. That rejection, that repudiation of the measure of government administration was confirmed only this weekend. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have said some very strong things about these Bills- that they are unfair and unjust, that they represent collectively a downright dishonest enterprise- and I want to justify those assertions. Dealing firstly with the unfairness of the proposals, they penalise wage and salary earners, and in a severe way in many cases, but they allow privileged opportunities like capital gains, excess profits generated by mineral development companies in this country, windfall gains as additions to the profits of oil companies derived because of arrangements instituted by this Government, and family trusts to go scot free. The vast mass of people in this community- the wage and salary earners- is expected to bear a burden of additional cost to support the Government. However, those areas of privilege I enumerated go scot free. Again, the Bills favour high income earners at the expense of middle and modest income earners, and there can be no better illustration of that than the way in which the burden of sacrifice is distributed. For instance, if we take the situation of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> we find that he, a man on $ 1 ,500 a week, will have a 5 per cent increase in the tax he has to pay. But a person on up to average weekly earnings- that is up to about $250 a week- will have an 8 per cent increase in the tax he has to pay in future. That is inequitable, it is unjust, it is unacceptable. Again the Bills will disadvantage every second taxpayer. Fifty-five per cent of taxpayers will be worse off as a result of these changes. The simple fact is that we have in Australia today a government of unfair principles and a government of injustice. It is a government of unfair principles and of injustice, regardless of whether it is fixing electoral redistributions, arranging as to who is to take the blame for fixing redistributions, when the fixing goes wrong or allocating the burden of increased income taxation. </para>
        <para>These proposals continue the injustice which was enshrined in the tax changes introduced in February this year. In those changes 43 per cent of the benefit went to the top 10 per cent of income earners. When we look at the way in which this burden of changed tax arrangements is distributed, we discover that very largely it is again the people in the middle and modest income earning areas who will proportionately bear the greatest burden of sacrifice. That is not only unfair and unjust but also the product of blatant dishonesty. The Government did not campaign eight months ago on the promise of tax increases, both direct and indirect. The Government did not give any indication that it was intending to disadvantage most of all those in the middle and modest income areas. The Prime Minister in his policy speech of last year said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Government has brought in the largest and fairest reforms ever made to Australia &#39;s tax system. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Eight months later he sets about dismantling what he describes- I do not describe them in these terms- as the largest and fairest reforms ever made to Australia&#39;s tax system. He would have known full well at the time he made that statement, at the time he drafted these arrangements which were introduced in February and which now have been repudiated that it would have been impossible, given the state of the economy, the direction in which the economy was moving, the liabilities the Government had, for the Government to sustain that undertaking. It reminds me of a saying that I have heard from time to time, namely, that a diplomat is a man who is sent abroad to lie for the good of his country. It is quite apparent on the record of the Prime Minister that he seeks to achieve the same sort of benefit for his party by the same means by staying at home. </para>
        <para>Another disturbing aspect of these proposals and other proposals which will be discussed in the course of debate during the Budget session relates to the unfairness of tax sourcing. Under the present Government the tendency is to move proportionately away from direct personal taxation and increasingly towards indirect taxation. Last year personal tax represented 56. 8 per cent of total revenue. This year it is down to 54.8 per cent. The Government no doubt would suggest that this represents an easing of the tax burden for income earners in the community. That is nonsense. It is more than nonsense; it is dishonest to suggest such a thing. The total revenue burden imposed by the Government has to be borne by the whole community and, in the final analysis, income earners as consumers have to meet the cost of it. Accordingly, the extent to which the Government shuffles about the distribution of the burden between direct and indirect taxes makes no difference to the simple fact that the same people finally will be paying for that burden. </para>
        <para>What is important is the way in which that burden will be distributed and the capacity of people to pay for it, according to the different ways in which the burden is distributed. The more the Government resorts to indirect tax measures, the greater becomes the inequity of the total revenue raising system. The bigger the disadvantage for people on modest and low incomes, the greater the difficulties for those unfortunate people who are described as living in relative poverty in the community. The Prime Minister suggests that the great virtue of indirect taxes is that they allow choice; people can choose whether or not they purchase the goods on which the indirect taxes are imposed. Presumably the choice for the poor is one of starving or living, of eating bread and butter or of denying themselves these staple foods. This is an argument of selfishness and it completely ignores the inequity of these sorts of proposals, the inequity of the direction in which the Government is moving in relation to the distribution of its tax burden. </para>
        <para>The more it is able to move in the direction of indirect taxes, the more it is able comparatively to ease the total burden of taxation on high income earners, such as people like the Prime Minister or the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume),</inline> the former representative of Patrick Partners. At least he was successful there in putting together prospectuses, if not in being able to produce the goods to support the description in the prospectuses. As I was saying, it eases the burden for people of their ilk but increases it for people on modest and low incomes. </para>
        <para>As well as that, people who have never paid tax before will be required to pay tax to the extent to which the Government introduces, as it is generally believed, a broadly based system of indirect taxes, whether in the form of final retail sales tax or in the form of value added tax. I refer to low income earners such as pensioners, Aboriginals or even children; such are the lengths to which the Government is prepared to go to redistribute the burden away from those more able to bear it towards those least able to bear it. </para>
        <para>So the sum result of this sort of situation and of the strategy that the Government is seeking to establish in the distribution of the revenue burden in the community is that the losers will be losing twice. As I have pointed out, we have already seen how the moderate and the middle income earners will be disadvantaged largely because of the imposition of the so called temporary tax surcharge. But because of the extent to which the Government also resorts, as it has resorted in this Budget, to indirect taxes, these people are doubly disadvantaged because proportionately the burden of indirect taxes on essential commodities, such as food, clothing and transport which is necessary for employment, for those people will represent a greater proportion of their income than is the case for high income earners. Moreover, unlike many high income earners working in professions or in business, the middle and modest income earners will not be able to evade these liabilities, such as many of the charges related to motor vehicles and the use of motor vehicles, by claiming them as business expenses and passing them on to the general public. </para>
        <para>Let me illustrate how people are being disadvantaged as a result of the imposition of indirect taxes. This is germane to these Bills. The tendency is for the Government to move away from direct taxes, personal taxes, individual taxes, to indirect taxes. Last year taxes such as customs, excise duty and sales tax represented 26.8 per cent of total revenue. This year they represent 30.5 per cent of total revenue. Let us see how these taxes fall among the various income groups in the community. In illustrating this point, I seek leave to the have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table which has been prepared by D. J. Collins and delivered in an address to the New South Wales Branch of the Australian and New Zealand Economics Society in August 1978. </para>

            <para>- I do not intend to detail all the items listed in that table. What it shows is that for income earners receiving approximately $7,000 a year or less- the sort of modest and lowincome earners about whom I have been speaking- the imposition of increased excise tax, duty on tobacco, spirits and crude oil and the adjustment in sales tax on motor vehicles, represents 1.5 per cent of household income as a measurement of the additional costs that these people have to bear, but that for people on $18,000 a year and above, the imposition is only one per cent or less of household income. The higher one goes in the income scale the less is the burden that has to be borne. That is the sort of inequity about which I have been talking. Those are the sorts of redistributional effects which the Government is seeking to bring about in this community. They are crude, they are unjust and they are unacceptable to any fair minded person. We in the Opposition oppose them. We will continue to oppose them and will take every reasonable measure that we can properly take to urge the community to vent its outrage at such an injustice being imposed on it. Let us look at the nonsense that the Prime Minister goes on with when he seeks to justify this sort of injustice. He is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 10 July 1978 as saying this: </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>If income tax is too high, government takes that off and you &#39;ve got no choice about it. </para>
          <para>If indirect tax is higher, and in Australia it&#39;s worth noting that indirect tax is very low by world standards, then it&#39;s up to the discretion of the taxpayers whether they consume more of a certain thing, and therefore pay more tax. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I go back to the point I mentioned earlier. There is not a lot of choice available for people on modest and low incomes. Even people on middle incomes find some difficulties in these areas. There are certain basic outlays they must make, especially if they have a family, for bread, butter, milk, eggs and flour, the staple essentials necessary to keep any family going. To the extent that the Government moves towards a broadly based sales tax- as it clearly indicated it will- then these people are going to be more disadvantaged than people on higher incomes. That is clear from the details in the tables I have had incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eric</inline> Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association has estimated that the introduction of a value added tax or broadly based retail sales tax will increase the cost of living for a pensioner by $150 a year in terms of higher prices. That is the sort of injustice that concerns the Opposition. But not even the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> is prepared to go all of the way with the deception that the Prime Minister is seeking to introduce into the community in discussion on that matter by suggesting that it is just a simple matter of choice. </para>
        <para>The Treasurer is on record as saying that the most obvious argument in favour of broadly based indirect retail tax is that it would allow you to reduce personal tax and give people a choice. That is true in theory, anyway, but in practice it is not so true, if you have it broad based and you catch food and clothing. He goes on to say that one of the obvious disadvantages of it is that it can fall more severely on low income earners, certainly in the areas where the effective choice is in theory only. Of course it is in theory only and it is a mean cruelty for the Prime Minister or for anyone else on the Government side to suggest that people can exercise choice in these circumstances. Accordingly, that is the whole tactic behind the thrust of Government fiscal thinking at present, a shift of the burden of fiscal responsibility away from the wealthy, away from the high income earners like the Prime Minister who in any case pays very little tax because of the tax avoidance devices he has been able to establish like his family trust- and on to the shoulders of the middle and modest income earners and especially on to the low income earners in the community. </para>
        <para>I referred to the quality of dishonesty which is rampant through just about every undertaking of this Government and especially of this Government&#39;s Prime Minister. This is particularly true of tax indexation. All of the community would remember the firm promises of the Government in 1975 to introduce full tax indexation. In 1976 we had 93 per cent tax indexation. In 1977 we had 80 per cent tax indexation. In 1978 we had 35 per cent tax indexation, and what are we going to have next year? The simple fact is that you cannot trust the word of the Prime Minister. It is a serious state of affairs for any country to be in when the people of the nation cannot ignore the simple fact that they cannot trust the word of the No. 1 public figure in the country. </para>
        <para>I mentioned a few minutes ago that the increase- the tax surcharge as it is called- is supposed to be a temporary surcharge. What we would like to have is some firm undertaking that this is going to be a temporary increase, that it will be eliminated at the end of this fiscal year and more especially we would like to have some outline of what is going to replace it. Any thinking person who has merely a basic understanding of how this economy is performing and where it is going would recognise that there is no room available for the Government to eliminate that so-called temporary tax surcharge, given the thrust of its general economic approach- one that we disagree with- and not replace it with some other sort of imposition. Accordingly that is where my concern stems from about the increasing tendency of the Government to wish to move towards indirect taxes. </para>
        <para>There are a few other matters I wish to raise in the limited time available which are highly germane. This is a high tax government, contrary to what the Prime Minister has said. Budget receipts as a proportion of gross domestic product on average for the three Labor Budgets were 24.8 per cent and for the three coalition Budgets 26. 1 per cent; that is, the community is paying 1.3 per cent of GDP more in various forms of taxes both direct and indirect as a result of the consciously imposed measures of this Government. That is not the result of policies honestly applied, given the firm undertakings of the </para>
        <para class="block">Government that it would reduce the total burden of revenue raisings imposed on the community. What does that mean in monetary terms? It means that the community is paying $ 1,300m more in revenue on average this year than was the case on average for the three years of the Labor Government. It means that on average taxpayers in this country are paying more than $200 each as a result of the high taxation policies of this Government, or something like $4 a week. </para>
        <para>What I would like to see the Government moving towards is a resource tax raising $ 150m; to eliminate the crude oil levy windfall gain to the oil development companies of $340m; to impose a capital gains tax on gains in excess of $200,000, raising $300m; to adjust the highest levels of personal income tax to raise $200m; to abolish the investment allowance, $400m; to abolish tax avoidance through family trusts, $100m-$l,490,000 as against the imposition of the direct increases in personal tax and denying pensioners and employment beneficiaries and other social welfare beneficiaries of benefits amounting to about $l,140m. There would still be $350m available for the Government and it could keep its conscience intact in that it had been fair and just in the policies it had introduced. </para>

He is endeavouring to maintain his rage too. I am just looking at the style of the Opposition in dealing with what is a very serious item of tax legislation. I am interested to hear the continuing harping on individual words, personal words relating to members on this side of the House. I wonder whether this is seen as a method by the Opposition of furthering its position, of increasing the public awareness of tax matters, or whether it is part of some unfortunate new style of politics. I am afraid that the harping on individual words and on indvidual members of Parliament by honourable members opposite does seem to suggest that issues are no longer the matter of substance that they wish to discuss in this House but that the personal impugning of members is their style. It seems to me to be an unfortunate style. I noticed, for example, that when I interjected quite properly, I would submit, on the Leader of the Opposition, when he was talking arrant nonsense about how indirect taxes would prevent people eating bread and jam- when I interjected that there are no indirect taxes on food-his only response was personal insult of me. I do not mind, they have been insulting me for years. </para>

I was glad to note that towards the end of the speech by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> he started to introduce a few &#39;facts &#39;. I regret, of course, that in other areas in the text of his speech he preferred to accuse the Government, for example, of fixing electoral redistributions. He knows that that is certainly untrue. He knows that any suggestion that the Queensland redistribution was affected in any way by Government influence was totally rejected by the McGregor inquiry. Its findings related entirely to naming an electorate and not to fixing any electoral redistribution. It was improper and disgraceful for the Leader of the Opposition to interpose that kind of nonsense in what is a serious debate on taxation. </para>

        <para>Let us examine the key issues. Let us examine to what extent it is reasonable for the Leader of the Opposition to allege that this Government&#39;s determined policy, which he says is away from personal income tax to indirect tax, is an attack on the worker. I was interested to look at his statistics because the facts as shown in the Budget seem to suggest a totally different picture from that which he presented. For example, in the latest Budget excise duty and sales tax, which are indirect taxes which affect the working man and all consumers, have increased by 26 per cent. Is it not curious that in the 1975 Budget, which was brought in by the man who is now Leader of the Opposition, excise duty and sales tax taken together increased by 35 per cent? Here is a man who introduced a Budget to increase these indirect taxes by 35 per cent complaining about a government which has increased them by 26 per cent. What extraordinary hypocrisy from the Leader of the Opposition. Is it not fascinating that in the 1974-75 Labor Government Budget, for example, the combination of indirect and direct taxes rose by 32 per cent in one year? The Labor Party did not appear <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> object. The Labor Party supported that Budget. How curious it is then that there is violent opposition from those opposite and that there is &#39;repeated use of the words &#39;outrage&#39;, &#39;injustice&#39; and &#39;dishonesty&#39; when this Government introduces a set of tax measures which increases the combination of direct and indirect taxes by only 12 per cent, which is so much- in fact almost one-third- less than the amount by which the Labor Party raised them in one year. How extraordinary it is then that this kind of nonsense is coming from opposite. </para>
        <para>It strikes me that the important point that we should be discussing here today is the best way of resolving problems which are faced by a government in the present budgetary situation. How do we make certain that the burden of the attack against inflation is carried fairly throughout the community? I draw honourable members&#39; attention to these specific Bills because, despite what the Opposition has been doing, we are here supposed to be discussing some specific Bills., For example, I refer to the change to the long service leave situation contained in this legislation. In the past people who took long service leave paid tax as if they were still at work. No one in this House or outside it has ever objected to that proposition. However, if they failed to take that long service leave- for which I believe the trade union movement fought well and hard because it was held that people deserved that benefit- and thereby apparently demonstrated that they did not need it, they could avoid normal taxation on it. </para>
        <para>It is not a question, as the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> suggested, of a benefit suddenly being taken away unfairly. The fact is that by failing to tax people when they took long service leave as a lump sum payment at the same rate at which they would be taxed if they had taken it normally, governments in the past have been providing these people with an unfair advantage over the rest of their fellow workers. Anyone must recognise the truth of this proposition. Those who take long service leave have always been taxed. Magically, those who do not take it but take a lump sum payment, have been taxed on only 5 per cent of what they have received. That is unfair to the bulk of workers and in fact provides an unreasonable incentive for people not to take the leave to which they are entitled, which they should take and which it has been held is in their interests to take for health and other purposes. </para>
        <para>It seems to me that the Labor Party&#39;s opposition to this measure is in fact the normal sort of fictional opposition which, because of the structure of this House and this style of parliament, an Opposition is required to present. It seems to me unfortunate in many instances that Oppositions feel under a total obligation to oppose everything whether or not it is fair or right. Certainly the volume of opposition from honourable members opposite to this matter seems to me to relate largely to a formal requirement to be seen to be doing something in opposing rather than to applying their intellect to the problem in hand. The same principle, of course, applies to annual leave as well as to long service leave. I think that I should stress here that there has been a great deal of misunderstanding about the long service leave situation. The facts are, of course, that anyone who has earned entitlements to long service leave in the period up to the presentation of the Budget in August will be taxed only at the old rate on those entitlements, that is, at 5 per cent. There is a widespread view in the community, which has no doubt been fostered by the sort of hysterical nonsense being spoken opposite, that people&#39;s back entitlements are suddenly to be unfairly and unreasonably taxed at a new rate. That is totally untrue. The facts are that it is clearly stated in the Budget Speech that people who have earned entitlements in the past will be entitled to take those entitlements at the old tax arrangement, which applies to only 5 per cent of lump sum payments. That is clearly spelt out in the Budget Speech. There is no scope for misinterpretation, even by people opposite with malicious intent. </para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his timely interjection. In the matter of annual leave there is a very serious question of principle. In many areas of employment, particularly in the public sector, people lose their entitlements to annual leave if they do not take them. In fact there is a requirement in many areas of this nation to take annual leave because it has been earned for a specific purpose. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>This is because as a result of strenuous endeavour, for which I commend it, the trade union movement has earned entitlements to leave for its members. This leave is paid for and should be taken. It is extraordinary for anyone to deny that under the old system a person who failed to take leave- which in many areas as a general principle is taken away if an employee does not take it- got away with a very low tax rate. In other words, those who took the leave paid normal tax, but those who did not take the leave, and retired with it accumulated ended up getting away with a very low tax rate, once again to the disadvantage of their fellow workers who had paid tax at the standard rate. One of the things that so many people do not seem to recognise is that if someone avoids paying tax someone else has to pay it. The workers of this nation have in fact been picking up the bill for those people who have been able to avoid paying tax in this area as in many other areas. </para>
        <para>I am opposed to the use of systems by which people can avoid paying tax. I suggest that this system of being able to accrue one &#39;s annual leave and then pay only a nominal tax on it when one leaves is a disgraceful provision. I am very glad to see it being changed because it can be used not only by workers on modest incomes where the impact on tax collections is not serious at all but also by people on very high incomes, by people who are self-employed and by people whose revenue impact on the Government would be very serious indeed. I suggest that improvements like this in the tax legislation to make it fair to all concerned are of vital consequence. I must say that I welcome the introduction of measures of this nature as I welcome the introduction of measures aimed at stopping tax avoidance of an improper nature which is, in effect, evasion by people using tax devices of a kind that this Government has worked so hard to oppose. </para>
        <para>I agree with some members of the Opposition- it is a pity that some members of the Opposition do not adopt an equally conciliatory tone- that there were some features of the tax measures introduced in the present Budget which could be improved upon and which have been improved upon. For example, as regards the annual leave situation, the original intention in the Budget Speech was to tax that annual leave at whatever the rate that would apply to the lump sum payment. In other words, if a person had quite a few weeks of leave left over and he left his place of employment, his total income would be added up and, of course, a pretty high marginal rate of tax would apply to the last little bits of revenue, such as annual leave, added to the lump sum. The fact is that as a result of substantial pressure from individual back benchers and from the Government members taxation sub-committee, this rate was limited to 3316 per cent. So in effect no penal rate is applicable. </para>
        <para>I want to stress to this House that this Government is not inflexible when clear anomalies are pointed out to it by, for example, its own back bench and effective committees like the taxation sub-committee, of which I must say I am very glad to be the Secretary. We have presented to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> clear indications of methods by which the Budget objectives can be better met by some modest changes in the tax situation. In fact they have been introduced. I commend the Treasurer for recognising the merits of the points that we raised. I commend him also for the changes he introduced relating to page 22 of the Budget Speech by which, as a result of strong submissions from the Government back bench and others, the tax imposed on various benefit payments has been withdrawn. The suggestion that tax should be imposed on them was recognised by the Treasurer and by the Government to impose an unfair burden on particular people. These benefits were, of course, the rehabilitation training allowance, the rehabilitation living-away-from-home allowance, the incentive allowance for rehabilitation, the invalid pension for persons under age pension age, the sheltered employment allowance, the repatriation service pension on account of unemployability or pulmonary tuberculosis for persons under age pension age, the tuberculosis allowance for persons under age pension age and the tuberculosis housekeeper allowance. There had been suggestions that these benefits would be taxed. They will now not be taxed and I commend the Government for recognising the merit in the case against taxing those measures. </para>
        <para>The other point that concerns me is the suggestion that somehow this Government has done something terrible about tax. Honourable members will notice that there was no mention by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech about the enormous increases, not just in money terms but in real terms- that is, after accounting for inflation- in the level of tax that was collected by his Government as against that collected by this Government. I presume that everyone is rather bored with hearing members of the </para>
        <para>Government say &#39;Ah, yes, but you were worse than us&#39;, whenever the Government is attacked for doing something. The whole issue in making these distinctions is to dramatise the fact that any Government that raises taxes is going to be unpopular because people do not like paying tax. Yet we see here that personal income tax collections, as I pointed out to the House last week, will in fact fall in real terms this year after accounting for inflation, despite the imposition of the 1 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent surcharge. This is for one very simple reason and that is that the enormous tax reforms we have introduced will have a full year effect this year, despite the <inline font-style="italic">\Vi</inline> per cent tax levy. This should be compared with the 20. 1 per cent rise in tax collections in one year under a Labor Government followed by another year of a 1 9.9 per cent rise. This year we are to have a 0.3 per cent reduction. There will be a fall in real terms in personal income tax paid this year. Yet we hear all this phony nonsense about a disgraceful bike in tax. It is not happening. </para>
        <para>I commend the Government for introducing these Bills, which improve the taxation situation and which make it fairer, and I look forward to seeing further legislation which will be aimed at voiding these devices and schemes which have enabled many businessmen to avoid paying tax that should have been paid. </para>

          <para>- I join in the concern that has been expressed about the fact that these five important tax Bills have been introduced at such short notice, thereby denying Government committees and Opposition committees an opportunity to examine properly the import of the legislation. It is plain as a pikestaff that this Government is on the run. What the guillotining of this legislation really means is that the Government is planning to get out of Canberra just as quickly as possible. It has seen the writing on the wall from the New South Wales elections and the Werriwa by-election. It knows that the people are gravely concerned about the tax measures and that these attitudes of the public at large were expressed in the New South Wales elections last Saturday. From the Government&#39;s point of view, the sooner it wraps up this whole controversy about taxation and gets away from Canberra, the better it will be. That is certainly the way the Government sees the situation and that is why we are debating this legislation today. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Why have these five Bills been introduced at all? It is simply because of the Government&#39;s difficulty following the Budget deficit of over $3,000m last year-more than $ 1,000m greater than was estimated in last year&#39;s Budget. It is just amazing how things which are supposed to be pernicious can suddenly be designated as respectable by this Government. The Labor Government was accused of being ineffective and infamous, for that matter, because of the deficit which it incurred, but that deficit just pales into insignificance compared with the deficits that have occurred since this Government took office. </para>
        <para>Of course, this year, as I have said, we are to have another large deficit. Last year the deficit got to $3,300m. The Government has to replenish its coffers. So the tax measures before the House aim to satisfy the Government&#39;s requirements for money. This will be done, firstly, by increasing the tax burden on a large number of Australians and, secondly, by removing some of the more blatant tax avoidance schemes which have sprung up over the years. Of course, we support the removal of the latter. The Government should be condemned for increasing the tax burden. The measures introduced further burden those members of the community least able to pay and least organised to resist the further reduction in their standard of living. </para>
        <para>There are six significant issues involved in these tax impositions. I just want to spend a short time saying a few words about each of them. First of all, the tax surcharge of 1 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent is to apply only for this year. This raises the standard rate of personal income tax from 32 per cent to 33Vi per cent, with corresponding increases to 47&#189; per cent and 61&#38; per cent at higher income levels. The effect of the surcharge is to wipe out any so-called tax cuts offered by the Government- promised by the Governmentand introduced in February of this year and which were bought by the electorate at the cost of losing many Government-funded support schemes which constitute the social wage of workers and are so important in raising the standard of living of Australians. The tax cuts were a trade-off for cutbacks in programs such as the health scheme, Medibank matters, housing and the environment. These tax cuts, which were the subject of the trade-off, have now been removed. The pay-as-you-earn collections are estimated to rise by 7.1 percent. </para>
        <para>The injustice that is involved with these alterations to the tax laws is causing very great concern throughout the Australian community. A family receiving $175 a week will pay 7.3 per cent more tax while a family receiving $300 a week will pay only 5.6 per cent more tax. A family receiving a salary of $1,000 a week will pay only 3.2 per cent more tax. There are not many people in that latter category. They are the very prosperous people. Parliamentarians are advantaged by this. Foremost among them, of course, is the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I do not know his salary offhand but I suppose it is in the vicinity of $ 1 ,000 a week. </para>

            <para>-I cannot do that quick calculation. The point I am making is that if the Prime Minister gets $1,000 a week he will pay only 3.2 per cent more tax but the poor old battler on $175 a week has to pay 7.3 per cent more tax. That seems to me to be a very unfortunate situation. I cannot understand how this can be condoned by honourable members opposite. It is unfortunate that their State colleagues in New South Wales had to bear the burden but I think that people&#39;s memories are enduring enough to take a toll of the guilty men when the people go to the polls on some subsequent occasion. I know that the Government thinks these things will be forgotten about in two years time, that people have short memories, but I doubt it. I have never seen such indignation at the polling booths as I saw last Saturday. On many occasions I asked people why they were turning to the Labor Party in such large numbers. Most of us here know the pattern of many voters at local polling booths. I said to many people: &#39;I understand that you regard Neville Wran as being a great Premier&#39;. They did not deny that, but many of them said: &#39;The real reason for me changing my voting pattern is because of the injustice done; firstly, in respect of the breaking of the promise concerning taxation and, secondly, by putting the burden on to the lower income people &#39;. </para>

        <para class="block">Sitting suspended from S.S9 to 8 p.m. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr LES</inline>JOHNSON Before the suspension of the sitting I was discussing the income tax surcharge and the fact that there is a higher percentage tax surcharge on lower incomes than on higher incomes. I want to refer to the additional tax on lump sum retirement payments for unused leave. Unused annual leave payments are to be taxed at a rate of 33.5 per cent. Previously only 5 per cent of such income was taxed as assessable income. The fact is, of course, that the Government has backed off from taxing unused leave payments at 47.5 per cent and 61.5 per cent in the case of higher incomes. This is very disappointing for many people who were planning to use the payment for unused leave as a nest egg for retirement. I suppose all honourable members know of such cases and it is a very distressing situation which the taxpayer tends to regard as a breach of contract. After all, he has entered into an arrangement over a long period in anticipation of some date ahead, the date of retirement. When we consider that a person can have an amount of, say, $3,000 accruing to him and that $ 1 ,000 of it will be swept away in tax, or that a person is entitled to $9,000 in lieu of unused leave and that $3,000 of it will suddenly be grabbed by the Fraser Government, we can understand why people are reacting so bitterly. </para>
        <para>The third matter concerns the proposal to abolish tax deductions for housing loan interest payments. This also is a very serious blow to many people and indeed to the depressed housing industry. There are working class, average income people in my electorate who are desperately trying to finance homes 20 miles from the centre of Sydney. They are paying $20,000 for a block of land and are trying to enter into an arrangement with a building society. The tax deductibility of their mortgage interest payments was actually taken into account by the lenders in determining whether they had the capacity to repay these loans. We know that $3m in revenue will be saved in the remainder of this financial year and that $31m will be taken away from these home owners and from the building industry in the next year. That seems to me to be running in the face of all the things that ought to be done by the Government. As any of the building organisations will state, the building industry is facing a crisis. The Master Builders Association is incessantly contending that a critical situation prevails. The housing industry association and architects have made similar submissions. Yet we find this Government putting a deterrent into home building and, worst of all, committing this breach of faith with the home building industry and the young people in this community who have been finding it so difficult in these days of rapid inflation to enter into an arrangement to purchase a home. </para>
        <para>I think that I should make some reference to the proposal to tax the incomes of holders of Commonwealth post graduate awards. This scheme was introduced some 19 years ago in 1959, and now for the first time the income received by holders of Commonwealth post graduate awards is to be subjected to taxation. The Government will take from the holders of these Commonwealth awards $600,000 in the remainder of this financial year and $lm in a full year. It does not seem to be a lot of money. To a government it is certainly not a lot of money, but it is a lot of money to these people. All honourable members have received submissions from student organisations. I have in front of me now a submission from the Research Students Association of the Australian National University, which states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The aim of the scheme is to encourage able students to pursue studies normally leading to the degree of Master or Ph.D. in an Australian University. The scheme encourages post graduate work and research in Australia . . . There are now 2,050 award holders and the allowance has risen to $4,200 with some additional allowances for thesis typing, dependants, travel, et cetera. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The submission continues: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In 1976 64 per cent of post graduate scholars were married ... 40 per cent of scholars are supporting a family while undertaking post graduate studies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The submission goes on to point out that a single scholar receives a scholarship allowance of $4,200. The level at which the income is to be taxed is $3,893. The taxable income will be $307, and at a tax rate of 33.5 per cent the amount of tax payable will be $103. This seems to me to be nitpicking. The Government has closed off so many other options for deriving income tax in terms of resource taxes and matters of that kind- taking additional taxes from industry which, in some instances, is fleecing the Australian community unreasonably. The submission states that the summary of the overall effect on the real value of awards is that the combined effect of the Budget proposals on taxation and changes in Medibank, together with the lack of indexation of awards, is a sharp decline in the real value of the scholarship. The effect with respect to the basic stipend for a single scholar, taking into account the absolute reduction in income due to taxation amounting to $103, the estimate of $50 for medical expenses and the loss due to inflation amounting to $1,236, is a total loss in real terms of $1,389, or 33 per cent. I ask the Government- maybe it is too late- to reconsider this matter. </para>
        <para>Another matter concerns tax rebates for dependants residing overseas. These provisions are also being withdrawn in this tax legislation. The cost to the Australian taxpayers and citizens of supporting aged parents and other dependants living overseas is estimated by the Government to be $8m for this year and $20 for a full year. This concerns the taxpayer&#39;s spouse, parents, parents-in-law and invalid relatives. The Government seeks to justify this action with a one line sentence in the Budget Speech, which states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In many cases the dependant in question may have never been to nor have any intention of coming to Australia. In other cases the provision has led to flagrant abuse. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is on that criterion that the Government is changing this tax arrangement and withdrawing this benefit. I believe that the provision is aimed essentially at migrant communities throughout Australia. All of the recipients of this tax deduction have been declared guilty without a trial but how many of them are guilty? No evidence of abuse has been put to the Parliament. Even if the abuse exists it does not justify removing the deduction. It is up to the government of the day to tighten up the scheme to prevent abuse, not to abolish the scheme because of the abuse which is occurring possibly on the part of a minority of people. In taking the course of action which is proposed in the legislation before the House the Government is culpable of punishing innocent people. There is also no equity in discriminating among Australian taxpayers solely on the basis that their dependent parents or children are not living in Australia. </para>
        <para>The other matter I mention is health insurance. As we know, Medibank Standard is to be abolished and the cost to revenue in a full year will be $30Sm in extra outlays plus $3 16m in reduced receipts. But, of course, this does not mean that the average Australian necessarily will be paying less in the long run because to achieve a greater cover than the 40 per cent offered by the Government Australians will have to insure with a private fund and the cost of this cover is likely to rise as more and more healthy Australians opt not to obtain additional insurance. The worst part of this concept is that the extra amount that has to be paid for through the private insurance funds is applied on a most inequitable basis. That is to say, regardless of the income of the person concerned, everyone who wants more insurance has to pay the same. That is the great difference between the Government&#39;s new proposals and the proposals which operated under the Labor Government&#39;s original Medibank scheme. Under that scheme people payed according to their capacity to pay. </para>
        <para>The reason for the Government&#39;s decision to abolish Medibank Standard is not related to the wish to provide a better health care system. It is prompted by an ideological commitment to certain groups of doctors and to put the burden of health care on private health insurance funds and the desire to fortify the Government&#39;s attack on real wages by artificially reducing the consumer price index. I do not think it will be very long before the chickens come home to roost and we see the CPI down as a result of artificial manipulating through this health scheme arrangement. We will then see a reduction in the support that the Government gives to the national health scheme. </para>
        <para>I have referred to six very serious situations which represent a deterioration in the taxation arrangements that have operated in this country. I can understand the Government seeking to close off this debate as quickly as it can. These tax arrangements represent a serious breach of faith with the Australian people. The Government&#39;s actions have rankled the Australian constituency. I believe that at the first opportunity the Australian people will show their indignation against the decisions of this Government. </para>

          <para>- I have never failed to be surprised at the audacity of the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> The honourable member is one of the few remaining members of an administration which during a period of two financial years increased the income tax burden on the people of Australia by some 40 per cent- a 20. 1 per cent increase in one financial year and a 19.9 per cent increase in the following financial year. Yet the honourable member for Hughes parades himself in this Parliament tonight and speaks to the people of Australia as one in support of lower income taxation when he was a member of a government which increased taxation more savagely than any government in the history of this country since Federation. The honourable member for Hughes stands condemned as a member of a government which took the stockwhip to the income earners of Australia and said in essence: &#39;The harder you work the harder we will tax you&#39;. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> when Treasurer in the final year of the Whitlam Government, achieved for himself the unequalled reputation of being a latter day St Paul before his conversion because if ever a person taxed the people of Australia it was the honourable member for Oxley, who is now the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have some interest in taxation because I have campaigned consistently for lower taxation during my time in the Tasmanian State Parliament and in this Parliament. I am very proud to stand in this Parliament as one who has urged a reduction in income tax because I believe that through lower taxes and through lower interest rates this country will get back on its feet. I believe that this Government, even though it comes under criticism from some honourable members opposite, including my friend the honourable member for Hughes, has something to be proud of because it has in fact reduced taxation every year since the 1975 election. If honourable members opposite do not believe me they will find in previous Budget Speeches that the income tax burden in Australia was reduced in three consecutive Budgets in the 1976, 1977 and 1978. I think that three years of reduced income taxation is something of which any government could be proud. </para>
        <para>My only disappointment is that in this financial year, because of economic circumstances of which all honourable members would be aware, the amount of reduction in income taxation has not been as substantial as one perhaps otherwise would have hoped. This year, despite the fact that a temporary surcharge of <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent has had to be imposed, Australians will be paying less income tax in 1978 than they paid in 1977. Therefore the record of the Government is somewhat credible. We have been able to reduce the tax burden on the people of Australia. The influence of inflation being taken into account, the fact of the matter is that the tax burden of this country is lower than the tax burden was in the previous financial year. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Prospect says it is not true. I say with the greatest of respect for him that, inflation being taken into account, the tax burden this financial year is lower than it was last financial year. That is a record which in my opinion stands far more open to scrutiny and far more open to public comment than the record of his Government, which increased income tax in this country by 40 per cent in two years. The people of Australia who complain about this Government and this Budget ought to remember that it was under the Whitlam regime, in particular and under the regime of the present Leader of the Opposition as Treasurer, that income tax was increased by 40 per cent.

        <para>Rather than be distracted by the beguiling arguments of my friend the honourable member for Hughes I turn to this cognate debate, which involves consideration of no fewer than five separate income tax Bills and something like 15 individual reforms. The honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> spoke in this debate and I did listen to what he had to say. I listened also to what was said by the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume),</inline> lt has been said- and I believe this to be a truism- that there is nothing certain in life apart from death and taxes. We do not like either of them, and rightly so. The Government has been forced by the economic position to restrict the tax reform which was commenced last year. The Government has had to impose a temporary surcharge. Certain other reforms which we would have liked to push have not been feasible in all the circumstances. </para>
        <para>Last year a group of Government back benchers formed themselves into a loosely knit but nevertheless, I would believe, a somewhat effective politically cohesive force. We called ourselves the Fifty Cent League. We had two objectives. One was to bring about a reduction in the maximum marginal tax rate in Australia from 65c in the dollar, which it then was, to 50c in the dollar. The other objective was to bring in standard rate taxation. I pay tribute to the former Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> because it is now history that in the 1977 Budget we introduced standard rate taxation and we reduced the maximum marginal tax rate from 65c in the dollar to 60c in the dollar. No doubt, the intention was that in the next financial year the taxation rate would be reduced from 60c in the dollar to 55c in the dollar and in the third financial year it would move from 55c in the dollar to 50c in the dollar- hence the name of the group of the 50c league. Therefore, it was as much a disappointment to our group as, indeed, it was to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> when he made the comment that it was a matter of personal regret to him that a temporary surcharge of 1 &#39;/i per cent was to be imposed for the financial year 1978-79. </para>
        <para>One of the Bills with which we are dealing tonight- the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill 1978- provides in clause 10 for the implementation of the proposal, as a temporary measure for 1978-79 only, that the standard rate of income tax applicable to the taxable income of individuals that exceeds $3,893 is to be increased from 32 per cent or 32c in the dollar to 33.5 per cent or 33.5c in the dollar. Surcharges of 14 per cent and 28 per cent applying from taxable income levels of $16,608 and $33,216 respectively will bring the effective marginal tax rates above those levels to 47.5 per cent and 61.5 per cent. The Treasurer said that this was to be a temporary measure. I can assure all those listening to this debate that it is the wish of the Government and certainly the wish of the back bench members of the Government that it be a temporary measure and that the surcharge which has been imposed for this financial year will expire on 30 June next year and will not be continued. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Chifley can yaffle and waffle as much as he likes, but the fact of the matter is that the Government has made a commitment, and I believe that commitment will not be broken, that this is a temporary surcharge against the general thrust of the tax reductions that we have implemented since our election to government in 1975. It is a temporary aberration which hopefully will expire and which I believe will expire on 30 June next. </para>

        <para>I wish to direct my attention now to another matter. Perhaps on this occasion the honourable member for Chifley will not be as critical of my remarks. I refer to the question of the taxation changes with respect to those who are in receipt of Commonwealth postgraduate awards. It is always a difficult line to draw on a Budget matter as to how much one presses an objection to a particular item or matter of concern. The situation with respect to clauses 3 and 14 of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 &#91;No. 2&#93; is that, with effect from 1 November 1978, exemption from tax of benefits paid under the Commonwealth post-graduate award scheme is to be removed. In this debate I wish to make a plea for the consideration of those who have already commenced their post-graduate courses. Some of them are married; others are living together and may well have commitments with respect to children. Others again have entered into a post-graduate course on the basis of what at that time appeared to them to be a reasonably forseeable financial situation. </para>
        <para>I do not know whether it is asking too much to make the request that the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation ought to be invested with a special discretion in this situation. There are young people attending universities in Australia today under post-graduate awards who may very well have to reconsider their entire future as a result of the potential effect of this amendment. My belief is that it was not the intention of the Government to change the situation, as it were with respect to students who are midway through their courses. I believe that there is an arguable case in respect of persons who are half-way through their post-graduate award courses and who have commenced them on a certain taxation basis for the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to have at least a discretion to alleviate hardship in respect of the cases which will apply as at 1 November. I know that the Government is looking at that matter. I hope it is one which will be pursued. It is my view that when people have commenced post-graduate courses on one basis, it would not be the wish of the Government that they should suffer hardship because of a complete changeabout with respect to the taxation system. </para>
        <para>The next matter to which I wish to refer is the question of annual leave. I listened with very great care to the most thoughtful and, if I might say so, persuasive speech of the honourable member for Macarthur. In his position as secretary of the taxation sub-committee section of the Treasury committee which operates under the Government&#39;s back bench committee system, he has devoted a great deal of time and consideration to what has been a very involved and complicated matter. My concern again is with respect to those who through no fault of their own have been prevented from taking annual leave. One can cite without very much difficulty cases in which employees either were asked specifically not to take annual leave or, as is the case in certain State Government departments in Tasmania of which I am aware, where the man concerned was not permitted to take his annual leave. </para>

            <para>- My colleague the honourable member for Diamond Valley reminds me of the matter raised by a colleague from Victoria, the honourable member for Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jarman),</inline> involving an employee of the Victorian Government Railways Department. I think that he accrued something like four years or five years of annual leave which he was not able to take. I am aware of one case concerning an employee of the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania in which the amount involved is $8,000. The employee has not taken annual leave now for a period which exceeds six or seven years. It makes an enormous difference to that man as he approaches retirement whether he is to be taxed on that lump sum payment at the rate of 5 per cent or as if it were normal income. I would not disagree basically with what the honourable member for Macarthur and some honourable members opposite have said. If superannuation payments and long service leave payments were to be taxed as if they were income, which is not the proposal in the Budget, I would not be arguing about the question of annual leave. But I am concerned about the position because it seems to me on the face of it to involve two very important principles. The first one- I compliment the Treasurer because he has not diputed this fact- is that the legislation is to all intents and purposes retrospective&#39;. Whether one takes a legal view or a practical view, whether one talks about rights which have been accrued or about reasonable expectations, the fact of the matter is that I believe the legislation involves the application of retrospectivity and to that extent I find it offensive. </para>

        <para>I hope that it is not too late to give to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation a discretion in the case of persons who have not been able to take their annual leave or in the case of persons whose service with the employer is terminated before they can take their annual leave, otherwise I believe that considerable hardship will be caused to a considerable number of innocent people in this country. The amount involved is estimated to be of the order of $70m. It is not an insubstantial amount. But I do not believe that the Parliament should blithely amend or change a situation and deprive people of the rights which they believed they had accrued. I find myself on a point of conscience in virtually an impossible position with respect to supporting this proposed amendment. </para>
        <para>I want to draw attention to three remaining points in the time available to me. I will be brief because my colleague the honourable member for Diamond Valley, who has been particularly concerned with the incidence of income tax, wishes to make some remarks on the legislation before the House. I applaud the Government&#39;s decision to make donations to the World Wildlife Fund Australia tax deductible. It is a fund which I believe deserves support and one which I urge should be supported. Perhaps some honourable members will say: &#39;What does it really matter?&#39; The fact of the matter is that World Wildlife Fund Australia, by virtue of clause 6 of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill, is to be acknowledged as a fund to which gifts will be tax deductible. I hope that those who are genuinely concerned about the preservation of the environment and world wildlife generally will be prepared to support the Fund. </para>
        <para>I wish to comment also upon the termination of the housing loan interest deduction. Accepting the wisdom of the Government&#39;s decision, I hope nevertheless that in the period from now until the end of the current financial year- that is, to 30 June 1979- we will look at the effect of this amendment. Lastly, could I make one brief comment in relation to the rather wild statements made by the honourable member for Hughes with respect to dependants residing overseas. I do not believe that it is fair to accuse the Government of the sorts of things of which the honourable member for Hughes accused it. My own view is that we have demonstrated ourselves to be a Government concerned with the rights of the individual, and with the right of the individual to have executive and administrative decisions reviewed. The fact that we have set up the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and are progressing with freedom of information legislation demonstrates such a commitment. </para>
        <para>My situation in relation to the question of unused annual leave is that as a matter of conscience, I would find it impossible to support that provision. Nevertheless, I congratulate the Government on dropping everything contained on page 22 of the Budget Speech, which dealt with the proposed taxation of social welfare payments. I would like the opportunity to meet face to face the gentleman who came up with the bright idea of taxing people in sheltered workshops, the genius who came up with the idea of taxing non-blind paraplegics. I would really like to meet him. </para>

            <para>-The honourable member used to work there and I am not blaming him. I just made the point that there are some people with very interesting ideas on what is and what is not social justice in this country. It has never been my understanding that it was the idea of our party that we would tax newsboys, blind or non-blind paraplegics, and people in sheltered workshops. I am delighted that the proposals on page 22 of the Budget Speech have disappeared from the scene. With those remarks, and with the reservation I have expressed about the question of the retrospective implications in relation to unused annual leave, I support the legislation, but I must in conscience indicate my incapacity to support that particular provision. </para>

          <para>-The five Bills before the House are the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978, the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill 1 978, the Income Tax (Individuals) Bill 1978, the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill 1978 and the Health Insurance Levy Bill 1978. 1 am afraid that the only Bill in that bevy of five which the Opposition can wholeheartedly support is the Health Insurance Levy Bill, which in fact abolishes the levy previously imposed for health insurance. At the outset may I join with the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis),</inline> who led for the Opposition, in decrying the attitude of the Government. It introduced these Bills into the Parliament on 28 September, which was the Thursday before the House rose, and on the first day on which the House resumes it has brought them on for debate. That does not provide an opportunity for either the Government party meeting or the Opposition party meeting to discuss in depth the Bills now before the Parliament, and I think it is to be decried that the Government is adopting such an attitude. The honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> spoke with tongue in cheek or with a forked tongue, if I can call it that, when he said that he was opposing certain aspects of these Bills. When we come to a vote I will be most interested to see whether the honourable member either abstains from voting or crosses the floor. It is all right for an honourable member in this Parliament to oppose Bills, but the only real test of a person&#39;s sincerity is when he puts his vote where his mouth is. If the honourable member for Denison chooses not to vote against his own Government on these issues then I think he has been speaking with his tongue in his cheek or with a forked tongue, as I said before. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The main Bill with which the Opposition takes very great issue is the Bill altering the tax rates for the coming year. At the time of the last election I well remember the attitude of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> He had been foisted into that job. At that stage he was not the Prime Minister of choice. He was Prime Minister not by choice of the electorate but by choice of the then Governor-General. As members of this Parliament and the Australian populace will remember, the democratically elected government was tossed out on 11 November 1975 by the choice of the then Governor-General. The then appointed Prime Minister of Australia, as he was prior to the December 1975 election, and my memory is very clear on this, indicated that at no stage would there be an increase in the income tax rate then applying in Australia. I have no real criticism of the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> because I think he has done an exceptionally good job in many areas, particularly in the area of tax avoidance. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer has implemented a lot of the policies which I think would have been recommended to him by the Commissioner of Taxation, and I think it is to his credit that he has done so. It is not often that I speak kindly of a Treasurer of the opposite party, but in all conscience I must give credit where credit is due, and I give him credit to that extent. At least he has taken positive steps to try to prevent some of the tax avoidance schemes which have been rampant in this country for many long years. There is only one scheme about which I wish the Treasurer would do something, and I refer to the matter of family trusts. The honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> has been most outspoken about the lack of action by the Government in respect of family trusts, particularly as they relate to some members of this Parliament. When the matter was raised during Question Time in the House not so very long ago the Prime Minister sought to condone the actions he had taken. </para>

            <para>- I am addressing them to those Bills to the extent that I am drawing attention to the fact that the Treasurer pointed out in his second reading speech that legislation had been brought down covering certain tax avoidance schemes, and he itemised them. I am pointing out that so far legislation has not been brought down on one particular tax avoidance scheme. However, I will not push that to any great degree because I know it is a rather touchy subject. I ask the Treasurer to give consideration at an early date to doing something about the family trust legislation. I could understand why taxpayers sought to prevent their estates from being cut to pieces when there was such a thing as probate legislation, when there were such things as estate duty and gift duty, but the stage has been reached when estate duty and gift duty are certainly on the way out so far as the Federal Parliament is concerned even if they are not on the way out in all the States. The need does not exist at the present time for the setting up of family trusts if the reason given for doing so is that a taxpayer wants to make sure that his estate is not dissipated. When a situation exists where there is no estate duty, then there is not the necessity for family trusts to be incorporated. I suggest that the Treasurer might give consideration to the introduction of legislation to prevent the racket, and it is a racket, of family trusts being instituted. </para>
          </talk.start>

        <para>As I mentioned earlier, the Prime Minister promised, in fact pledged, that his Government would not increase income tax. In citing the actual figures I refer the House to the Budget Papers which show the estimates of receipts and expenditure. I refer in particular to the figures in respect of pay-as-you-earn taxation, that is, income tax which is collected from salary and wage earners. The collections from that source during the year 1976-77 amounted to $8,528.9m. The collections from that source during 1977-78- this was in the regime of the present Government- amounted to $9,638.8m. That represented an increase of $1,1 10m. The Budget Papers presented to the Parliament on 1 5 August show that the collections from salary and wage earners in respect of PA YE tax for the year commencing on 1 July 1978 and ending on 30 June 1979 are estimated to be $10,341m, which represents an increase of $702m over the receipts from that source for the previous year, 1977-78. So it is the intention of the Government to increase its income tax collections from ordinary salary and wage earners by $1,8 12m between 1976 and 1979. That is not an inconsiderable sum. </para>
        <para>I have some quarrel with the honourable member for Denison who suggested that a discretion should be given to the Commissioner of Taxation in regard to the change in the legislation with respect to the taxation of long service leave and/or holiday leave, if that is what we like to call it. In the Public Service it is called recreation leave. I do not know why in the Public Service it is specifically called recreation leave. In private enterprise, in the cold outside world, it is called holidays. There must be some difference in terminology because in the Public Service one goes on recreation leave and in private enterprise in the outside world one goes on holidays. There must be a difference between holidays and recreation. I have never yet found that difference myself. To me any holiday is recreation and any recreation is a holiday. </para>
        <para>I say again that this Government has hoodwinked the Australian public by promising to reduce taxation. In its very first Budget after being re-elected it has increased personal income tax by a minimum of 1.5 percent. The Government has acted dishonestly. I do not say that any individual person has acted dishonestly but I say that the Government has acted dishonestly in promising to reduce income tax when in fact it has not done so. The figures which I cited earlier in my speech show that the Government acted dishonestly by promising to reduce income tax when the figures show that in fact there has been not a reduction but a very marked increase. I say also- I say this quite advisedly- that the Australian voting public are very perceptive people. There was a time when sons and daughters would vote as Mum and Dad voted, when wives voted as their husbands did. That day has gone. The present Australian voting public is very discerning. They have shown that in two ways in very recent times. They showed it, first of all, in the Werriwa by-election when there was a marked swing against the Government. Swings are against governments and not necessarily for oppositions. There was a very marked swing in the Werriwa by-election which resulted in the entry into this Parliament of an extremely good man who was previously a member of this Parliament. I refer to the present member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kerin).</inline> I am most pleased to see him back in the chamber. He is a person who will add a great deal to the discussions which take place in this Parliament. The people of the Werriwa electorate showed that they are not prepared to put up with the dishonesty of any government. There was at least a 10 per cent swing against the Government in the Werriwa by-election. </para>
        <para>I do not need to go back further than last Saturday to make my second point. Even though Wran was the man in New South Wales, I feel that the result of the New South Wales State election was a demonstration by the people of New South Wales that they were dissatisfied with the performance of this Government, in particular with the Budget it brought down and more particularly with the matters which we are discussing at the present time. There is no more sensitive nerve in a person&#39;s body than the hip pocket nerve. Possibly the greatest Prime Minister Australia has ever had, Ben Chifley, said that what brought him undone was his attack on the hip pocket nerve. That is what will bring this Government undone if it keeps attacking the hip pocket nerve. I hope it comes undone, even though I do not want to see the hip pocket nerve of the average Australian being attacked to an excessive degree. </para>
        <para>I think an examination of the figures will reveal that even though the subject of the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill which is before the House is the 1 .5 per cent across-the-board tax increase, the amount of increase for the average and middle income group works out at much higher than that 1.5 per cent. I have seen figures which show that the 1.5 per cent increase in tax results in an average income earner receiving $10,000 a year paying an extra $200 a year in tax. In actual fact that works out to be an increase of 8.5 per cent in tax. It is blatant dishonesty on the part of the Government, in seeking to establish a 1.5 per cent increase in tax, in actual fact to increase it by 8.5 per cent. </para>
        <para>At this stage I wish to say something in regard to tax avoidance schemes because it is a subject mentioned by the Treasurer in his second reading speech on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 &#91;No. 2&#93;. He in fact claims credit- I think rightly so- for the foreshadowing of legislation which deals with many of the tax avoidance practices. In his second reading speech he lists the various schemes in relation to which he has either foreshadowed legislation or has brought down legislation for the purpose of stopping these illegal tax avoidance practices. I suggest to the Treasurer that he also give serious consideration to altering section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. If my memory serves me correctly, that section has been in that Act since before 1936. It should be remembered that income tax was introduced in 1918 only as a temporary measure. It has been with us from 1918 to 1978, a period of some 60 years, but it was introduced only as a temporary measure in 1918 to finance the First World War. I think we have to live with that because I do not see the day ever corning when income tax will cease to exist. </para>
        <para>In drawing attention to these tax avoidance schemes which are very rampant in the community at the present time, I think it would be true to say that there is something radically wrong with a society which seeks to avoid by any means within its power its taxation liability. I think that leads to another question which we can ask ourselves: Is the society in which we live really sick? Is it a sick society? I am inclined to the view that it is a sick society. I say that having in mind that a certain section of the community is seeking, by fair means or foul, to pass its taxation responsibilities on to another section of the community which is in a worse position to bear those responsibilities. </para>
        <para>The taxpayers concerned are not the only ones at fault. There is also something wrong with the profession. I can recall another honourable member today drawing attention to the matter. He was a practitioner in the accounting profession. I was on the other side of the fence before I came into this House in that I worked in the Taxation Office. I believe that there is something wrong with the taxation profession when it holds seminars and when it seeks to induce people to try to escape from their taxation liability. But is there something wrong with the ethics of the people concerned with taxation, whether they be in the accounting profession or whether they be in the legal profession? I think there has been a severe decline in the ethics of such people. The methods employed by the practitioners- I call them that for want of a better name- are certainly parasitical. They are encouraging parasites in the community. On occasions I have called them bludgers but I think &#39;parasites&#39; is a much nicer word. At least a parasite is an insect. I do not know what a bludger is. It has some connotation but I am not certain what it is. I call them parasites because an insect is an insect and the legal practitioners and practitioners in the accounting profession are encouraging these parasites- that is what they are- to enforce and to transfer their just liability onto other people who are in a less fortunate position to bear that responsibility. </para>
        <para>I think it is axiomatic that in any government there is a certain amount of revenue which has to be collected and it has to be collected proportionately over the section of population which can afford to pay that proportion of taxation. If somebody else has to bear that unfair proportion it means that the person who is forcing that other person to do it is a parasite. I think that the Act is in very great need of redrafting. I think that has come out of all the legislation that has been before this House. The Income Tax Assessment Act was simplified in 1936, is now four times as big, and it has been simplified ever since. I think what is needed is a real look at the Income Tax Assessment Act; it needs to be redrafted. I well remember the words of Chief Justice Dixon many years ago in a High Court case when he was asked to define income. He said: &#39;If I was asked to define income I would say income is what comes in&#39;. I think if that was a definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act we would not have any of the problems we have today. </para>

          <para>- I would be very happy to enter into a wide-ranging debate on taxation and taxation reform. If it were not for the fact that I want to raise one specific matter, I would do so. However, at this stage I will content myself by associating myself completely with those parts of the remarks made by the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> when he paid credit to the Government for the continuous series of tax reforms which it has introduced since it came to government. This has been, and remains, a government of tax reform. It is a government of tax reform because tax reform and the lessening of the incidence of taxation is consistent with the Government&#39;s philosophy. There is one part of the remarks of the honourable member for Denison with which I would not agree and that is when he advocated that additional discretion should be given to the Taxation Commissioner. I would have thought by and large that there are probably enough discretions given to the Taxation Commissioner as it is at the moment and, particularly in view of the fact that most of the taxation legislation now passed is incomprehensible, it seems to me highly undesirable to give him any more discretion than he already has although undoubtedly he exercises the discretion he has with good faith and good intentions, for which I give him credit. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I turn to the single specific matter concerning this legislation to which I want to draw attention. It is by way of drawing attention to an anomalyperhaps an intentional, anomaly, I do not know- in clause 22 of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978, and to suggest that it does not meet the Government&#39;s intention to reflect the temporary increase of 1.5 per cent in the standard rate of tax. I should make one point perfectly clear at the outset. When we talk about provisional taxpayers we are not necessarily talking about high income earners. A person may be subject to the payment of provisional tax and yet be a very low income earner. What has happened in this case is that unfortunately- I use that word advisedly- it appears that the provisions of clause 22 of this Bill reflect an increase of11/2 per cent over the composite rate for the year1977-78 proposed in the Fifth Schedule to the Income Tax (Rates) Act and not a 11/2 per cent increase over the rates imposed for the year 1978-79 in the Ninth Schedule of that amended Income Tax (Rates) Act. </para>
        <para>The Government is fully entitled to alter the rate of tax for the current financial year and to raise provisional tax in accordance with the rates as amended, but what clause 22 appears to be trying to do is to to levy provisional tax on the basis of a tax rate which has never been in operation and which never will be in operation. Let me explain what that means. Clause 22 requires two components to be added together. The first is the amount of last year&#39;s income tax paid by the provisional taxpayers. The second is1 .5 per cent of last year&#39;s taxable income. That is what the provisional taxpayer will be obliged to pay this year subject to other qualifications in the section. The point is that that is not an increase of11/2 per cent in tax nor does it reflect in the case of provisional taxpayers the temporary increase of 11/2 per cent in the standard rate of tax. It is an obligation to pay again the sum of last year&#39;s tax and, in addition,11/2 per cent of last year&#39;s income. </para>
        <para>It does not reflect- this was said to be the intention but it is not the intention- an increase of 11/2 per cent in the standard rate of tax because last year&#39;s income tax was not a payment at the standard rate of tax on income but an assessment of provisional tax. So the Bill takes from the provisional taxpayer this year the whole of last year&#39;s tax and11/2 per cent of last year&#39;s income. The increased payment is an increase on a rate of tax which never was a rate of tax, properly so called, and which never will be. Therefore, provisional taxpayers will have to pay much more than an increase of11/2 per cent, to put it in simple terms. Some rough calculations have been made to make this clearer and the calculations are as to the differences between the provisional tax rate proposed under clause 22 and the actual rate of tax for1978-79 which is proposed by the new Ninth Schedule pursuant to the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill 1978. These are increases or decreases as compared with the actual rates. I have already obtained the consent of the Opposition and I ask for leave to incorporate in </para>

            <para>- When you come to look at this list in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> you will find that the increase in the case of the provisional taxpayer earning between $3,750 and $3,893 is not 1.5 per cent at all, nor is it 5 per cent nor10 per cent but an increase of over 30 per cent, and so it goes on. For instance, we find there is an increase of over 8 per cent for taxpayers earning between roughly $25,000 and $31,000. Any reflection of an increase of 11/2 per cent is rather difficult to see. It must have been an oversight to have permitted such differentials between the provisional rates of tax and the true rates of tax for the years 1978-79. A letter has been sent to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> from a distinguished Melbourne Queen&#39;s Counsel setting out this and some related matters. I am sure that the Treasurer will have regard to the matters contained in that letter and to the matters that I have put forward in the course of these brief remarks tonight. I hope that when the legislation is before the Senate some opportunity will be taken to rectify this anomaly. None of that can depart in any way at all from the recognition that should be given to this Government as being a government of tax reform. </para>

        <para>In the course of a number of measures the Government has lessened the incidence of the tax burden on all citizens. As I have said previously, this is consistent with the Government&#39;s philosophy because since it came to government it has sought to leave with the taxpayer as much of his own resources as possible so that he can exercise his own decision and judgment as to the way in which he wishes to spend that money. Of course, in his remarks the honourable member for Denison drew attention to the <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent surcharge which will be imposed in this year. One can understand the reasons that led to the imposition of that surcharge. One can also understand the concern of the Government that it was necessary to introduce that surcharge. However, let us remind ourselves that it is a temporary surcharge and not a permanent exaction from the taxpayers of Australia. We should remind ourselves of that not just because of the amount of money involved which will have to be paid by individuals but also because it is part of the overall taxation situation. This Government, State governments and governments of comparable countries cannot continue with this continuous exaction from the efforts and the incentive of the citizens who produce the real wealth in the community. With an increase in taxation we find an increasing dependence by people on governments for what governments do in return for the taxes they levy. I draw attention to these matters very briefly because I have no doubt whatsoever that the Government is committed to taxation reform, that it has demonstrated that and that it will continue to demonstrate it. </para>

            <para>- We may have been able to manage it in that time. Unfortunately the honourable member did not have to try. This legislation contains some very curious and innocuous provisions, but it does not contain the provisions which we would have expected it to contain. Honourable members opposite keep talking about the levy on income tax, which is expected to raise some $600m in this year, as being a temporary provision. Income tax was introduced in Britain during the Napoleonic Wars as a temporary provision and I would suggest to the Treasurer, unless he has some hidden treasure which he has not yet disclosed, that this will be just as temporary a measure. There are a number of one-off provisions in the Budget and in the Treasurer&#39;s accounting which will not be available for his accounting next year and which will have to be replaced by other forms of revenue, if the Government&#39;s undertaking is to be met. The income tax surcharge is one of those provisions. If the Budget figures are correct, since the Budget was introduced changes have eroded nearly $200m off the Government&#39;s income or have added that amount of money to the expenditure provisions. For instance, it has already been announced that the estimates for unemployment benefits are $ 100m under the presently projected figure. </para>

        <para>The Government made a lot of noise and Government members continually make a lot of noise about their support for home ownership in Australia. This is an act of faith with people speaking on behalf of the Government parties which is reflected neither in this legislation nor in actual events in this Parliament. One of these pieces of legislation takes away from first home purchasers on combined incomes below $14,000 the tax deductibility of all or a portion of their interest payments on mortgages and thus adds to the cost of buying a home. To obtain total deductions one has to be on an income of less than $160 a week, which would almost render one ineligible for a loan without the assistance of this provision. The Government is wiping out the provision in one fell swoop. It says that it is justified in doing so because the measure is designed purely to raise revenue, but by doing so it will add something like $30m to the costs of purchasing homes for many thousands of Australians. Many people entered into mortgages on the basis of this tax concession being available and with confidence that the Government would meet the commitment which was given to young home owners, many of whom are partly through the first 10-year period of the repayment of their mortgages. Other people who would have been planning to purchase a home are in not dissimilar circumstances. They have to borrow another $2,000 because the Treasurer cannot meet the obligation which was given in the 1975 election campaign with regard to homes savings grants, which are not contained in this legislation but in respect of which the Government&#39;s actions are comparable in taking away the home interest deductibility scheme. In both instances the person most in need and in difficulties and with the least borrowing powers will be the person who suffers most. Such people have to borrow an additional $2,000 which the Goverment promised them as an election promise and made a lot of fuss about. To have to borrow that additional money is a repudiation of the worst type. Despite the bits of papers being sent out by the Minister responsible, which are fraudulent documents because they have neither the financial backing of the Government nor guarantees from this Parliament that that money will be available, there is no undertaking that the Treasurer next year is going to increase the expenditure for homes savings grants from $20m to something like $ 1 60m which will be the amount needed to meet the commitments for this year in addition to the total commitments which will fall due next year. This legislation also has a very serious provision for retrospectivity in respect of accumulated annual leave which is something the Government has said in the past that it does not agree with. </para>

            <para>-The Government has indicated that amounts received in lieu of accrued annual leave will not be taxed at the ordinary rate, and the only concession of which I am aware is that it will be set aside from the normal annual income of the person concerned and taxed as a separate item. That means an increase of about 25 per cent in the rate of tax in that area. </para>

        <para>Because the Treasurer is apparently not aware of the real circumstances of many people, I would point out to him that persons are not always able to take their annual leave when it is due because of circumstances in their employment. Governments are the worst offenders in this regard because they will not always release employees for the full period of accrued annual leave which is available to them. In such cases an accrument of available annual leave takes place every year. A number of persons who were approaching retirement age would have decided that it was not unreasonable not to take their accrued annual leave in the last year or the last couple of years of their service. Now they will pay a penalty of 25 per cent not because they have deliberately not taken their annual leave but in many cases because they have not been able to take such leave. I would point out that during the period that I was an employee of the Victorian Railways there were many employees who had accrued annual leave of up to one year because they were not allowed to take the full amount of leave owing to them each year and in some instances they were not granted their leave at all. </para>
        <para>For the Treasurer&#39;s benefit I would point out that in recent years there have been employees in this Parliament who, because of the sittings of the Parliament and because they were required to be present in the Parliament during that period, were not able to take the leave which had accrued, some of it as a result of a leave credit as opposed to payments of overtime which were not allowed within Public Service awards under which they worked. Those people who could not take their leave because of circumstances beyond their control will now have an increase of 25 per cent retrospectively placed on those accruals. If the Government wishes to change the form of taxation then existing accruals should not be counted. The Government has exempted them in the case of long service leave. I think the Treasurer ought to take into consideration quite seriously the fact that in many instances annual leave is in much the same circumstance. A person taking a long period of accrued annual leave, expecially at a late period of his employment, could seriously disrupt the organisation for which he works. The organisation might not have been prepared or might not have been able to grant annual leave during an earlier period when it fell due. </para>
        <para>I raise one other matter in this legislation. Among the various changes in taxation there is an announcement that donations to the World Wildlife Fund Australia will be tax deductible in future. I do not dispute that measure at all. I do think though that it is most likely the Fund would have been much happier if the amount spent on feting the  president  of the Fund and his wife when they were in Australia recently had been donated to it. I am sure it would have been more appreciated by everyone concerned. What I ask the Treasurer is: Why one particular organisation? Who does Community Aid Abroad have to bring to Australia in order to get its extremely valued work outside Australia accepted as tax deductible. Why are organisations such as the Freedom From Hunger Campaign and others which are doing very significant work and contributing greatly to Australia &#39;s reputation abroad left out? </para>

            <para>-With this legislation the Government is showing very clearly where it stands on the question of income tax. The concessions which are being taken away are those which will disadvantage most of those on the lowest income. I wonder what the Treasurer has done about the book that is advertised every week on the back of the <inline font-style="italic">National Times?</inline> The advertisement says that for $10 a person can buy a book which will tell him how to avoid paying all income tax. Rydge&#39;s Journal publish the book so the Treasurer will know where to find his tax avoidance schemes. Rydge&#39;s guarantee that if a person follows the advice given in that book he will not have to pay any tax at all. He will not even have to go into the sorts of schemes which some people enter into for tax avoidance purposes. I would have thought that the publication of that sort of information would have been illegal under the various income tax Acts, but apparently it is not. If it is possible, as claimed in this advertisement by what is supposedly a reputable journal, to purchase a tax scheme for $10 that will enable one to avoid all forms of income tax, then I suggest that someone else has to pay, and the person who has to pay is, of course, the wage and salary earner who is on - </para>

        <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the States Grants (Roads) Act 1977 by providing an additional $33m in Commonwealth Grants to the States for roadworks in both 1978-79 and 1979-80. The Bill also provides for an increase in quotas for State road expenditure from their own resources. Honourable members will be aware that the States Grants (Roads) Act 1977 currently provides for grants totalling $475m to be made available to the States in each of the three years 1977-78 to 1979-80. In introducing the legislation in September last year, I announced that it was the Government&#39;s intention to adjust the grants for 1978-79 and 1979-80 so that they would be maintained at a level equivalent in real terms to the 1977-78 amount. The Bill now before the House will give effect to this undertaking by providing for the level of the grants for 1978-79 and 1979-80 to be increased to $508m. This is an increase of almost 7 per cent over the amount provided in 1977-78 and is based on a forecast rate of price movements in 1978-79. The Government considers that the increased level of funds for roads for which this Bill provides represents a very substantial commitment, having regard to the continuing policy of restraint in public expenditures that it has had to adopt. The increase will be applied equally to all States. </para>
        <para>Honourable members will be aware that, in allocating its grants for 1977-78, the Government made it clear that its priorities were to ensure that the road needs of local authorities were adequately covered and that emphasis was maintained on the funding of the national road network and rural arterial roads. The additional moneys which this Bill provides have in general been allocated among road categories pro rata to the existing allocations. This will effectively ensure that the priorities inherent in these allocations are maintained. There has been a slight departure from the pro rata approach in the case of South Australia. The indexation adjustment that would normally have been added to the National Commerce Roads category has instead been applied to the National Highways Construction category. This has been done to assist the State in meeting the Commonwealth&#39;s request that work to the value of Sim be undertaken on the Stuart Highway during 1 978-79. In line with the Government&#39;s view that road funding is a responsibility of all three levels of government, each State will be required to fund an increased quota of road expenditure from its own resources in order to qualify for Commonwealth assistance. The Government has decided that State expenditure quotas for 1978-79 should be increased by the same percentage as the Commonwealth grants. I should emphasise that the quotas represent minimum expenditure requirements which the States are free to exceed according to the priority which they attach to their road programs. </para>
        <para>It is pleasing to note that in recent years a number of States have exceeded their quotas by a significant amount. It is fair to say, however, that having regard to the increases in Commonwealth general revenue assistance that have been made available in recent years, the States have been well placed to substantially increase their own road funding efforts. The details of the legislation are quite straight-forward. The Bill provides for the repeal of the Schedules to the States Grants (Roads) Act 1977 and for their replacement with new Schedules setting out the increased Commonwealth grants by road categories and the increased State quotas. The Bill also provides for a further minor amendment to update the reference in the principal Act to the Commonwealth transport planning and research legislation. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">On Thursday 28 September 1978 I introduced the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 and the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978, the provisions of which give effect to the Government&#39;s health insurance arrangements to operate from 1 November 1978. The Bill before the House amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and establishes the role of the Health Insurance Commission in these new arrangements. In framing the revised charter of the Commission, it is the clear intention of the Government that Medibank Private will operate in a competitive position with other health insurance organisations and should be in as flexible a position as possible, having in mind that there is a statutory relationship with the Commonwealth as a Commonwealth authority. </para>
          <para>Before commenting on the specific matters covered by the Bill, I would like to inform honourable members that the principles embodied in the legislation relating to the employment of the staff by the Commission have been discussed with representatives of relevant staff associations whose members are affected by the Government&#39;s proposals. I wish to express my appreciation of the considerations and views put forward by the staff association representatives. The Government has taken into account the views of the staff associations in the framing of this legislation. </para>
          <para>The Bill may be divided into four principal parts: </para>
          <para>Firstly, the reconstitution of the Health Insurance Commission; Secondly, the removal of the Medibank Standard functions and the continued operation of Medibank Private; Thirdly, provisions relating to the engagement of staff by the Commission after 1 November 1978 and the terms and conditions applying to the staff; and Fourthly, the transitional provisions necessary to effect the changeover to the new functions of the reconstituted Commission. </para>
          <para class="block">Whilst the Bill does not, in any way, affect the corporate identity of the existing Health Insurance Commission, it does, by the amendments contained in clause 11, provide for the Commission to be reconstituted. Before outlining the constitution of the new Commission, I would like to record the Government&#39;s appreciation of the work of the retiring commissioners. There have been substantial changes to the health insurance arrangements during their period of office. It is an indication of their administration that Medibank has continued to operate efficiently and effectively. On behalf of the Government, I would also like to express my appreciation to the General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ray</inline> Williams, and all his staff for the excellent and dedicated work they have done since Medibank &#39;s inception. I wish the General Manager and the organisation success in the future operation of Medibank Private. The new Commission is to be constituted by up to seven Commissioners, including a  Chairman  and the General Manager of Medibank. All Commissioners, with the exception of the General Manager, will be appointed by the Governor-General on a part-time basis, for a period, not exceeding five years, specified in the instrument of appointment. </para>
          <para>The abolition of Medibank Standard and the transfer to the Department of Health of the administration of various Commonwealth benefits and payments now made by the Commission, means the principal functions of the new Commission will be the management of Medibank Private and payment of the new Commonwealth medical benefit on the same basis as other registered health insurance organisations. The performance of these functions is reflected in the amendments made in clauses 7 and 8 of the </para>
          <para>Bill. Clause 10 of the Bill provides for the Commission to perform such other functions in relation to health insurance as the Minister directs. This provision enables the Commission to pursue government policy objectives in health insurance where so directed. Initially, the only additional function to Medibank Private and the payment of the Commonwealth medical benefit will be the payment of medical benefits under the winding-down of the Medibank Standard functions of the Commission. The Bill provides for any direction of the Minister, relating to additional functions to be performed by the Commission, to be included in the annual report of the Commission. Further, provision is also made for the Minister for Health and the Commission to enter into an agreement for the payment to the Commission of administrative expenses arising out of the performance of functions which are the subject of a direction by the Minister for Health. </para>
          <para>In order that the Commission can compete with the private health funds on an equal footing, the Bill provides that the Commission will no longer be required to seek Public Service Board approval of its terms and conditions of employment and will be subject to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Clauses 32 and 33 of the Bill contain transitional provisions to protect the terms and conditions of existing staff of the Commission. Any changes to the terms and conditions of existing staff will, of course, be discussed by the Commission with relevant staff associations. I should also mention that the Commission management has already agreed with the staff associations that the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act and the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act should continue to apply to all staff of the Commission and the Bill has been drafted to take account of this. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides that the Commission may establish and conduct its own superannuation scheme. However, the intention is that staff who are contributors to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme at the time of the introduction of the Commission&#39;s superannuation scheme, or who join the Commission thereafter and are already contributors to Commonwealth superannuation scheme, will retain such membership. Persons who join the Commission staff after the introduction of its scheme, and who are not already contributors to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, will be able to elect to join the Commission&#39;s superannuation scheme or request to be treated under the Superannuation Act 1976. The Bill, in clauses 16,17,19 and Part III gives effect to the above proposals. </para>
          <para>Part IV of the Bill contains transitional provisions. It is accepted that, with the abolition of the Medibank Standard functions of the Commission, there is likely to be a significant number of surplus staff. Discussions have already been held between the relevant staff organisations, my Department, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, the Commission and the Public Service Board about this situation. In the first instance they have concentrated on the transfer of staff associated with bulk billing functions to my Department. At this stage I am unable to give any accurate indication of the number of staff who may ultimately be surplus to the requirements of the Commission as this will be dependent on the market share obtained by the Commission. However, the Bill in clause 31 recognises the need for action to be taken and provides for the Public Service Board to be involved in the redeployment of surplus staff. There will be continuing discussions with the staff associations on this aspect as the situation develops. </para>
          <para>The remaining provision of the Bill to which I would specifically draw the attention of honourable members is clause 34. This provision enables a reconciliation to be effected of the assets andliabilities of the Commission as at 31 October 1978. The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to pay to the Commission an amount which represents the liabilities of the Commission, both current and contingent, which are attributable to the Medibank Standard functions of the Commission. Similarly, provision is included for the Commission to pay to the Commonwealth an amount that represents the value of the assets of the Commission acquired by the Commission in carrying out its Medibank Standard functions. The purpose of this transitional provision is to provide for a distribution of assets and liabilities which properly relates to each of the Medibank Standard and Medibank Private functions as at 31 October 1978. The remaining provisions in the Bill are consequential amendments relating to the reconstitution of the Commission; the abolition of the Commission&#39;s Medibank Standard functions; and the inclusion in the Act of more relevant provisions, applying generally to statutory corporations, concerning borrowing and investments by the new Commission and the entering into of contracts by the Commission. I commend this Bill to the House. </para>

          <para>-This morning the Australian Broadcasting Commission news reported a most unfortunate incident at Goulburn Island in the Northern Territory. The  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Galarrwuy</inline> Yunupingu, arrived at the Island to a very hostile reception from a large portion of the Island&#39;s population. After about10 minutes on the Island, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yunupingu</inline> was told by the community to get back into his aircraft and leave. I believe it is a very disturbing situation that an Aboriginal community should hold so much hostility and ill feeling towards a  chairman  of the land council which is supposed to represent its interests and carry out its wishes. This lack of confidence in the Northern Land Council is not restricted to Goulburn Island. The last few weeks have seen expressions of dissatisfaction from Milingimbi, Croker Island, Elcho Island, Borroloola and other communities. The divisions and bitterness which today surround the Northern Land Council have only one single cause: It is the attempts of the Fraser Government to manipulate and intimidate the Northern Land Council and the Aboriginal communities which it represents into accepting uranium mining on Aboriginal land. The blame for the unfortunate events at Goulburn Island lies fairly and squarely in the lap of this Government. </para>

            <para>- The blame for these unfortunate events at Goulburn Island lies fairly and squarely in the lap of this Government. The Government&#39;s overriding concern is to get the Ranger agreement signed as soon as possible. It does not care what happens to the Northern Land Council in the process. It does not care if its tactics turn black people against each other, as was the case at Goulburn Island yesterday. It has ignored the well-informed warnings of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Coombs</inline> that hostility and possible violence will result if the traditional Aboriginal processes of decision making are not gone through before any agreement is signed. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Government&#39;s tactics have been to undermine the ability of the Northern Land Council to fight for Aboriginal interests. It has used threats to convince the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council that the Council&#39;s position is not secure unless the agreement is signed soon. It has used the white manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alex</inline> Bishaw, a public servant from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, to manipulate at every stage of the Council&#39;s consideration of the Ranger agreement. He has used all the old bureaucratic tricks of restricting the flow of information and issuing 1 1th hour notices for meetings in order to keep Aboriginal communities in the dark. We have only to look at the remarks of one of the two Aboriginals who took the court action three weeks ago. When asked if he had seen the draft Ranger agreement, he said that he did not know he was allowed to see it. He said that he thought it was the Government &#39;s business. This indicates the success of the bureaucratic intimidation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishaw.</inline> It is about time that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> who is sitting at the table, took some action in respect of this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishaw</inline> and had an inquiry made into his activities. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishaw</inline>&#39;s intimidatory remarks made to the Northern Land Council meeting which considered the draft Ranger agreement are on the record. He is also on the record in the NorthernTerritory <inline font-style="italic">News</inline> of 28 September admitting that he lied to the Northern Land Council regarding a statement by the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke, in order to convince the Council that it would not get trade union support. It was only a little over two weeks ago that the Government &#39;s efforts to rush a start to uranium mining foundered because of the courageous action of several Aboriginal communities whose members resisted the Government&#39;s bullying and demanded an opportunity to examine and discuss the Ranger agreement in their own language. But the Government has not let up. It is still trying to get the agreement signed without full consultation according to section 23(3) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. </para>
        <para>The tactics of the Government now are to exclude all communities except Oenpelli from the consultation program. Its hope is that it can snow what is a particularly frightened and repressed community. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishaw</inline> has tried to divide communities by telling the Oenpelli people that the people of Goulburn and Croker Islands, who have led the fight for more time to examine the draft agreement, just want to take away royalties from Oenpelli. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishaw</inline> has already completely pre-empted any consideration by the people of Oenpelli by announcing last Tuesday that the agreement would not now be signed within a month. He said this before the task of translating the agreement into the Oenpelli language, itself a lengthy process, had even begun. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s role in this matter became even clearer when Liberal <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neville</inline> Bonner turned up at the Northern Land Council meeting on Monday. No whites were allowed at that meeting but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> was allowed to attend. He made the Goverment &#39;s position clear when he said after the meeting that &#39;the Oenpelli people fully realise that uranium mining will eventually take place&#39;. That is an intimidatory statement in itself. The Government&#39;s shabby performance has been ably assisted by many sections of the media which continually misrepresent the Aboriginal position as being a concern only for what they can get from mining royalties. I am reminded by a shoddy piece of journalism entitled &#39;The Uranium Debate: A Shift from Morals to Dollars &#39; by Peter Bowers in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 1 May this year. Nowhere have I seen an honest effort by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bowers</inline> or any other members of the Press gallery who have made these allegations of misrepresentation to clarify the situation. None of them has clearly spelt out the Aboriginal evidence presented in the Fox report. I stress to those honourable members who are too lazy to understand the position that they should read page 9 of the second Fox report. The report clearly sets out that those people of the Northern Land Council and at </para>
        <para class="block">Oenpelli are opposed to the mining of uranium on their land. </para>
        <para>Nowhere in the Press have I seen reports or analyses of the unprecedented mobilisation of Aboriginal communities in Arnhem Land over recent weeks. A rally of over 800 people was held on Elcho Island on 21 September to oppose uranium mining. This was a truly historic event for Northern Territory Aborigines. But there was barely a murmur from the national Press about it. Instead we had the false reporting that the Labor member for Arnhem Land, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Collins, had initiated the court action which prevented the signing of the Ranger agreement. The Press in general did not correct that mistake. There was no substantial effort to report the facts. This action has been taken by representatives of two communities and is supported by many others. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter from an Aboriginal community representative which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline> on 2 October. </para>

          <para>-I think that we are all a little tired of the total obsession of the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren).</inline><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> In the 1978-79 Budget a total of $120m has been allocated for Aboriginal affairs, and it is worth noting that this represents a 9. 1 per cent increase over last financial year in total expenditure on Aboriginal affairs. I think we all ought to compliment the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> for being able to achieve that result in what were undoubtedly very tight Budget discussions in Cabinet. It is pleasing to see that the Government has given this high degree of priority to Aboriginal affairs. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I want to comment on just a few items in that total expenditure to indicate how they support some of the developments in government policy with respect to Aboriginal affairs. For example, there is one rather small but significant item in terms of its meaning for policy under the heading of &#39;Training&#39;. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> A total of $2.5m has been earmarked for specific training programs, and of that amount $800,000 has been allocated to new projects. This year these training items have been isolated from general functional areas such as health, education and employment. This has been done so that the separate allocation can be identified and shown to be the commencement of a special effort in this area to equip Aborigines with the management and other skills necessary to underwrite the Government&#39;s policy of self-management. Indeed, support for that policy of selfmanagement with adequate training opportunities is most important. There is a need in many Aboriginal communities to re-establish confidence and self-respect in relation to their own identity and their own ability to make decisions and to occupy an equal place and take an equal part in the Australian community. </para>
        <para>I want to mention specifically the expenditure that will be allocated for employment activities. Almost $7m will be provided for the employment of Aborigines, particularly those in remote areas. One can refer specifically to the Community Development Employment Scheme, which last year began as a pilot project and which this year will be continued and expanded to include a new project at Papunya. This will bring to 776 the total number of Aborigines employed under the scheme. In addition, nearly half of the total allocation for employment activities will provide additional employment opportunities for 650 Aborigines through special work projects in all States. I want to comment on some of the problems that will face the Government in the future in respect of the provision of employment opportunities for Aborigines. It is a long term problem because in many of the more isolated rural areas where Aborigines traditionally live there has been a decline in recent years in traditional forms of employment. In particular I refer to the situation with respect to employment on pastoral properties, a standard form of employment for Aborigines in years gone by. With a series of rural recessions, with the advent of greater mechanisation in farm work and pastoral activities, and also having regard to increases in award wage rates, many of the pastoral managers in these areas find it impossible to continue to employ any labour at all, and in particular Aboriginal labour. This has some social effects as well as economic effects. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> One cannot but notice that even after the ringing of the bells for the quorum there are only three Opposition members sitting in the chamber. On the other hand, the Government benches are packed with members who are taking a great interest in this debate. </para>
        <para>Before I was rudely interrupted I was making the point that the decline in employment in pastoral industries for Aboriginal people has had both economic and social effects. There has been the economic effect of their being denied wages. There has been the social effect that accompanied the increase in unemployment amongst Aboriginal communities. One has to look at the nature of a number of Aboriginal communities in outback areas and wonder about their long term economic viability. In this respect, therefore, a number of Aboriginal communities are looking forward to the commencement of mining activities as a way of providing the revenue by which they can remain economically viable. </para>

          <para>-I take the opportunity during the discussion of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to raise the question of land rights in Western Australia. We have in Western Australia the possibility of there developing a Queenslandtype situation in relation to the legitimate claims of the Aboriginal people for land rights. We must ensure above all else that the Aboriginal people of Western Australia and Aboriginal people everywhere are not ensnared by this Government in a battleground of legal complexity and political rivalries. The Aboriginal people throughout Australia have made perfectly clear their demand for land rights. That is their first demand. That is the demand which they give the highest priority. Whilst I suspect that there is a possibility of the development in Western Australia of the sort of brawl that has developed in Queensland, I suspect also that even though the Premier of Western Australia shares the ideological absurdities of the Premier of Queensland he probably has slightly more political finesse. Whilst he will probably end up achieving exactly the same result as has been achieved in Queensland, he will probably ensure at the same time that the publicity and the open political conflict do not develop in Western Australia. This is particularly perplexing for us and something that we have to scrutinise all the more diligently, because we know at least that the Premier of Queensland is opposed- he is prepared to take his opposition to extraordinary extremes- to the granting of any sort of real, permanent land rights to the Aborigines of that State. We know also that the Premier of Western Australia is of a like mind. </para>

            <para>-I think the people who have been most noisy in these circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> are those who were pretending to have a particular interest in this subject matter. What we must be. particularly aware of is that there is not some sort of shoddy deal perpetrated in Western Australia under which the legitimate claims and the rights of the Aboriginal people of Western Australia are simply shoved under the carpet as a result of some collaboration between the Federal and State governments. I think that the Premier of Western Australia would prefer to do it that way. We must ensure that the Federal Government is not inveigled into that situation. The Premier of Western Australia will always say that a system of land rights does exist in Western Australia but, of course, that is only a subterfuge for the real thing. There is in Western Australia an Aboriginal Lands Trust which theoretically at least has some control over the management of Aboriginal land, but that Lands Trust has only a very tenuous involvement indeed. There is absolutely no security of tenure in terms of the land which is under the control of the Aboriginal Lands Trust. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The members of the Aboriginal Lands Trust are appointed by the Government. They are not elected by the Aboriginal people and the land over which they have control is controlled substantially by the State Government. Whilst the Premier will say that the Lands Trust has greater tenure over the land than does a private citizen over freehold land, inasmuch as before the Government can alter the boundaries of any Aboriginal reserves it has to refer the matter to Parliament, that is a disguise for the real situation. In fact, all the State Government has to do if it wants to abolish a reserve or if it wants to change substantially the boundaries of reserves is to inform the Parliament. There is no requirement for legislation to be passed through the State Parliament. All that has to happen is that the State Parliament has to be informed of the intention of the Government or the Executive Council so to change the boundaries of those reserves. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Swan would have absolutely no idea of this subject In fact, he would have even less idea of this subject than he had of a debate which occurred in this chamber not long ago. When the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> was raising the very serious question of bauxite mining on the Darling Range the honourable member for Swan replied that bauxite mining on the Darling Range posed absolutely no threat to Perth&#39;s water supply and posed no threat to the future of the jarrah forests of Western Australia. If that is the extent of the knowledge of the honourable member for Swan, then it would be far better if he kept quiet rather than made absolutely absurd and inane interjections. That seems to be the level of his contribution in this place. </para>

            <para>- We are a wake-up to you too, my friend. I am unlikely to be able to share your company after the next election. The point is that in Western Australia there is under the control of the Aboriginal Lands Trust some 20 million hectares of land which constitutes more than 7 per cent of the total land area in Western Australia. That seems to be a substantial amount of land when one bears in mind that the Aboriginal population of Western Australia as a whole is approximately 2 per cent of the population of Western Australia. But one has to bear in mind that until recently there has been absolutely no competition from anyone else for that land, and then the interest has been only selective. Only when it is discovered that some value is attaching to that land does anyone else in the community have designs on it. That land has been set aside for Aboriginal purposes and it is my contention that that land ought to be permanently reserved for Aboriginal people and ought to be under the permanent control of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. It is not good enough for the State Government with, I suspect, the collaboration of the Federal Government, to say that there is an Aboriginal Lands Trust which has some limited power in relation to the management of that land. It is not good enough for the State Government to say that that constitutes land rights. It does not constitute land rights. It never has and it never will. It is open to the responsible Minister in any Western Australian government simply to abolish any reserve which happens to get in the way of any mining interests in that State. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>We know also that it has been the intention of the State Government to vary the way in which people get access to Aboriginal reserves. We already know that it is the intention of the State Government to remove absolutely any involvement of the Aboriginal people in determining who is allowed to go onto their land- land on which they are living. I know that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> has expressed some concern about this matter. I even know that he has written letters to the State Government expressing his disapproval of the intentions of the State Government in relation to this matter. But I am yet to see any positive action which will result in the State Government&#39;s abandoning that particular course of action. It has even been suggested to me that the new mining Bill which has recently been introduced into the Western Australian Parliament will in fact abolish the necessity for the State Government to proceed in the way in which it intended to proceed under the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act. </para>

          <para>- What is wrong with it- to acquaint the honourable member for Swan with the facts- is that it may be possible under the new provisions of the Mining Act for people who have permission under that Act to explore or actually to mine land, to do so even on Aboriginal reserves without reference to the Aboriginal people themselves, without reference to the Lands Trust, without reference even to the Government itself. What I want to ensure is that the Minister in this place makes investigations into the consequences and the provisions of the new mining legislation to ensure that this is not a back door method of achieving the goal which the State Government publicly announced some time ago of removing the possibility of any Aboriginal people getting in the way of the interests of mining companies and the like. It is not enough for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to go to the Central Reserve in Australia and express theoretical support for the people in their land claims. It is about time he turned that theoretical support into some practical support of the legitimate claims of the Aboriginal people of the Central Reserve. </para>

          <para>- In entering the debate on the estimates of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, I first express surprise and disappointment at the honourable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham)</inline> who opened the debate for the Opposition. He said that it is time this Government and, in particular, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, recognised the importance of ownership of land for the Aboriginal people and did something positive about promoting Aboriginal acquisition of that land. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> It is only a few weeks ago that in a well publicised trip the Minister toured the Northern Territory and gave the actual titles of thousands of square kilometres of land to the tribal Aborigines who had successfully claimed that it had been their traditional tribal land. Having travelled with the honourable member to many Aboriginal communities in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland, I find it hard to understand that he had no better knowledge and appreciation of the situation. This is especially true when he talks of paying unemployment benefits to Aborigines, or &#39;sit down money &#39; as they call it. If there were ever a more terrible legacy of the Whitlam Government I do not know of it. We can and will overcome the economic chaos into which that Government pulled us, but the legacy of the policy of &#39;something for nothing and of letting the Government look after us instead of helping ourselves&#39;, is the most terrifying result of all of its tragic period in office. Unfortunately, while the Labor Party was in power it fostered this feeling among Aborigines and we can see its terrible effects, if only in the alcohol problem and in their health. The present Government&#39;s programs are designed to encourage work rather than the receiving of social service payments. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Another subject brought out by the honourable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham)</inline> was housing and architects. Having travelled through many Aboriginal communities, he must surely realise that we cannot put tribal Aborigines straight into white man&#39;s houses. We went together to the Wiluna settlement where the Aboriginals just want more tents. At another centre they are building one-roomed houses, as they want them. Then we went on to Cundeelee where they do not want to move out of their leantos. We saw the outstations at Yirrkala which they recently built themselves, after moving from white man&#39;s houses. Then at Brewarrina we saw the $45,000 houses, of 8 squares, which had been architect-designed, I was disappointed at the emphasis the honourable member placed on the use of architects in this context, as against getting on with the job and having the people help themselves as much as possible. </para>
        <para>Later the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> entered the debate. Again, one must be disappointed to find the Opposition using the Aborigines as pawns in its misguided and unsuccessful anti-uranium campaign. The speech of the honourable member consisted mainly of quotations from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Zorn,</inline> who had advanced nothing new- nothing which any ordinary, well-paid Australian lawyer could not have brought forward. However, I was glad to hear the honourable member admit that it was the Labor Party that was involved in bringing pressures to bear on the Northern Land Council. </para>

For some reason he thinks that Government members stand in some sort of inviolable position. I draw the attention of the honourable member for Bendigo and of other honourable members on that side of the House to the fact that the matter I raise tonight should be of some concern to all Government members. In his electorate in the State of Victoria the honourable member for Bendigo has a very large number of railway workers. If the man has any political sense at all, he will listen to what I have to say. Because there has been a Liberal Government in Victoria since 1955 railway workers in that State are being done in the eye, to use a colloquialism, by this Government&#39;s legislation to tax their accrued long service leave. </para>

I do not know for how long the Chair is going to tolerate that sort of interference in an honourable member&#39;s speech. The matter I am raising tonight is obviously jocular to members of the Government but it is of great importance to every railway worker in Australia. Because railways throughout Australia traditionally have not been great profit making institutions a direction has been given by every State, including the State of Victoria with its Liberal Government since 1955, to employees of the State railways not to take their long service leave and their annual leave when it becomes due. In the interests of the State and of the service in which they are engaged these people have not taken their long service leave. They believed they were doing the right thing. They are now being attacked by this Government which cannot be trusted by anybody in Australia. It is now going to tax those people not at five per cent - </para>

          <para>- I rise tonight to bring to the attention of this House an industrial dispute which is disrupting the Australian Capital Territory schools system. Today the Australian Capital Territory Teachers Federation commenced a campaign of rolling strikes designed to put pressure on the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> to increase the number of teachers to be made available to the Australia Capital Territory government schools system. This tactic has been backed by an extensive and expensive media advertising campaign using Press, radio and television - </para>

            <para>- Pre-prepared motions were passed at all these meetings, and I compliment those responsible for arranging the compaign on its professional delivery. It had all the trappings of a campaign organised by trained political activists and I am sure that it will serve as valuable experience for a similar campaign which, I understand, is to be run just before the Federal election to be held in 1980 but with a different purpose in view. </para>

        <para>Having said that, I must ask whether the whole exercise has been honest in its thrust or necessary, in the light of the dislocation of schools, children, teachers and parents it has caused. The major thrust of the campaign has been dishonest, so dishonest that if any teacher of consumer protection at a school saw such a campaign using such material mounted by a private firm or business house he would be outraged and undoubtedly would use it as a good example to his students of the excesses of the capitalist system. An advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> today stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We are not prepared to accept the decision of the Minister for Education to enfore staff cuts . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It also stated:  . . threatens the future education of every child attending a Government School. </para>
        <para class="block">If these claims could be substantiated, I certainly would join the teachers myself. However, they are such overstatements of* the facts that they cannot be described as anything but dishonest. They are so dishonest that I must question the suitability of the people who are drafting the advertisements to teach our students. How can anyone claim that there have been cuts in staffing of our schools when, demonstrably, 40 extra teachers are being provided next year? We have 2,732 teachers this year and will be getting up to 2,772 teachers next year. How can it be claimed that that situation will &#39;threaten the future education of every child attending a government school &#39; when on the figures accepted by the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority there are only 13 fewer teachers than it wanted, in a system employing 2,772 teachers? </para>
        <para>Other savings result from the fact that many new teachers asked for are simply not required. No starting teachers will be appointed in 1979. In addition, six teachers from a new high school, which informed educational opinion states is not viable, will be saved. Two positions have been saved within the schools office itself. The fact that these positions are not required will make no difference at all to face-to-face teaching in the schools. The whole issue boils down to an argument about 13 extra teachers in a system which provides for 2,772 teachers. How myopic can people be? How alarming it is to see this attitude in those charged with the responsibility of teaching our children and instilling in them the characteristics of truthfulness, objectivity and clear thinking. </para>
        <para>I would like to point out to honourable members that the Schools Commission report of 1978 states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Commission believes that in the interests of maintaining proper balance in resource allocation there should be no increase in real per student expenditures on secondary education in the Australian Capital Territory in the immediate future. This is particularly true while resources levels in the Territory are so clearly superior to other States . . . </para>

          <para>-On 28 September last I asked the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> a question without notice regarding 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T herbicides and a report to the Victorian Parliament criticising the lack of a research facility for examining such substances in Victoria. The Minister, in his answer, virtually replied that it was a State responsibility, and he washed his hands of it. In any case, he replied that the National Health and Medical Research Council had examined the matter on several occasions and had found no proof of a relationship with congenital abnormalities. He did say in his reply that this was a matter that must be left to research scientists, both in this country and overseas. But he failed to indicate what Government action was being taken to encourage any Australian research facility to look into this matter. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In yesterday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> a member of one of the Minister&#39;s own Federal committees made a statement on this matter. I speak of Professor Geoffrey Bentley, who is a member of the Federal Congenital Abnormalities Committee and he, in referring to those herbicides, said that his Committee had requested a full inquiry into the matter, through their parent committee, the Drug Evaluation Committee. He pointed out that 2,4,5-T in particular when burnt produced dioxin, a substance known to cause congenital abnormalities. He suggested that people in country areas should be particularly interested because the spray could drift onto house roofs where, through sunshine, et cetera, it could be subjected to heat and could be washed into the tank water that was used by those people. It was evident from the concern expressed in various quarters that there was a possibility that congenital abnormalities were occurring. I was shocked to read at the end of that report in the Press the following: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A spokesman for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> said yesterday there were no plans for a new inquiry into 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">So much for the Minister&#39;s reliance on his own Federal committees. Even if he does not take the attitude that the Opposition takes to these substances and the possibility of their causing congenital abnormalities with consequent human suffering, I would have thought that this Government which talks so much about cost containment would have had some responsibility on the national scale if it were to look at the problems that arise, the cost of the health services, the cost of the prostheses that have to be provided to the people involved, and the cost of their rehabilitation and so on. </para>
        <para>This matter is associated with another matter I wish to raise, and that is the question of the storage of toxic waste. I raised the matter following an American report. Following my mention of it I found a number of university people were in an embarrassing situation because of the problem they had with organic solvent wastes- toxic substances- whereby they had nowhere to dispose of these toxic wastes. They believed industry was very much in the same position. At the moment the Victorian Government is setting up a site in the Darghile Forest near Heathcote and there is the possibility that Bendigo &#39;s water supply might be contaminated by it. I would have thought that the Government Whip would have been interested in that aspect. This Federal </para>

          <para>- I wish to speak for a few moments about a person who was not a leader of a nation, not a spiritual leader, but an entertainer extraordinaire. I refer to a person who was buried today in Sydney. I do not intend indulging in a form of words which refers to a personal association with this person whom I was privileged to know. But those who watch the news or who will read tonight&#39;s or tomorrow&#39;s newspapers will learn that the Catholic Church at Waverley was packed out and hundreds of mourners spilled into the street during the funeral service for the late John Michael O &#39;Keefe. During the panegyric a Christian Brother who taught John O &#39;Keefe at school and who became his lifelong friend asked those assembled to ponder upon &#39;just what did he do for you?&#39; The Christian Brother was referring to the man&#39;s generosity to his fellow man. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He was not by any stretch a wealthy man but he willingly gave to those in need even if such giving added a burden to his own shoulders. Besides supporting charities and the poor he gave himself to the cause of promoting his belief that when it came to entertainment we Australians can provide it without relying on importations or without total reliance on aping. There are honourable members on both sides of this chamber who have been Ministers with a portfolio associated with the media who can testify to the fact that at some stage they were visited by this entertainer who was attempting to promote the availability of our own material and to ensure that Australians were given a fair chance to receive the exposure which is necessary to build up acclaim and support. Undoubtedly he will be remembered by different people for different things. But without doubt he dedicated his life to the promotion of the Australian product. </para>
        <para>I make the concluding observation that the number of Australians who have been saddened by his death and the number of Australians who turned out for his funeral in Sydney today indicate that an Australian has the capacity in any field to make a hit within his own country. The people who have dipped their lids to this man show that he made the grade and proved that that in which he believed was truly possible. We all have something to contribute to this world. We all contribute in a different way. Some of us are noticed more than others. Some of us have a more lasting impact. </para>

            <para>-Well, it is in the same area. The votes for Pittwater have not been all counted yet, so there may be a Labor member in that seat too. This was a fascinating election because never before in the history of Australian politics has any political party been annihilated the way that the Liberal Party was annihilated in New South Wales. Never in history. Sixty per cent of the vote was obtained by one political party. Such a feat has never been recorded before in Australia&#39;s history. </para>

            <para>- Askin never got anything remotely like 63 per cent. If the honourable member can produce an election result which shows that Askin got 63 per cent I will dance naked through Parliament House. If the results in New South Wales on Saturday were recorded in a Federal election there would have been an annihilation on the other side of the House. The seat of Mackellar would have fallen. There is no question about that. The seats of Lowe, Phillip, St George, Barton, Cook, Macarthur and Macquarie would have fallen, and even the honourable member for Dundas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ruddock)</inline> would have been hanging on by his proverbial fingernails. The most incredible thing is to look at where Labor&#39;s victories were. Labor now holds five seats on the north side of the harbourthe seats of Manly, Wakehurst, Willoughby, Fuller and Yaralla. Who would have believed it? Only with a Liberal Opposition going so bad and getting so much help from its friends here in Canberra could such a result have been achieved. </para>

It was a magnificent performance. But, my word, we can thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> for his help. The same thing that happened in the Werriwa by-election has happened in the New South Wales elections. The people are fed up to the back teeth with the Liberals and if they continue to believe the nonsense that the Prime Minister put over this morning they will be riding for a very big fall. The same thing will happen again in a couple of weeks in Ballarat and it will keep on happening until the Liberals wake up to themselves. They know it as well as we on this side do. The result in New South Wales was not just a vote for Neville Wran, although that was a major factor. Look at the result of the elections. Who would have thought that the seat of Vaucluse would have been in doubt? The result has not yet been decided. It will be decided on preferences. Who would have thought that in New South Wales the Liberal Party would hold two seats on the south side of the harbour? It has won only a handful of seats. About only five seats in Sydney now could be called safe Liberal seats. Even seats like Eastwood and Northcott, which are in the heart of Tory land, have been retained for the Liberals by only 3,000 or 4,000 votes. Labor used to struggle to find a candidate to stand for these seats. </para>

        <para>I want to pay my tribute to Neville Wran. It was a magnificent victory, but he of course was one of the first to acknowledge that he was helped by the Prime Minister and by the LiberalCountry Party Government and its policies. Of course the results in New South Wales are only a follow-on from what happened in the Werriwa by-election,, following which the brilliant young member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kerin,</inline> was returned to this House, although representing a different electorate from that which he had previously represented. I conclude by saying that the election result is a warning to this Government to shape up. If it does not it will be shipped out. Unless it starts to solve the problems of&#34; unemployment and looks at the problems of small business and stagnation in this country it will go the same way as the State Liberal Party went on Saturday. </para>

          <para>-Until the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> spoke I had no idea that he had made such a substantial contribution to the recent New South Wales election. It has been said that there is nothing quite like the voice of experience. I simply make the point that the honourable member for Robertson has a short memory. When he talks about the greatest annihilation of any political party in Australian history, he seems to forget December 1975 and seems to forget what happened in Queensland in 1974. At that election a political party was actually struggling to field a cricket team. Whatever he might say, the Liberal Party and the Country Party in New South Wales have enough members for at least two cricket teams. </para>

            <para>- Indeed, as my honourable colleague reminds me, it is more like three. Let me say as one who campaigned in one seat which I believe we have held- I refer to the seat of Bligh- that this is the second New South Wales election that I can bring to mind that has been won on false pretences. The election in 1976 was won on the false pretence that, if the Liberal </para>

        <para>What did we have this time? We did not have any Party standing for election; we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> and his Government. One could not find the word &#39;Labor&#39; on any advertisement, on any bill poster or in any television or radio commercial. Labor was in New South Wales, as it is throughout the rest of Australia at present, a dirty word. Neville Wran must take the prize for winning an election. In fact I think he will go down in history as the only Labor leader who won an election by pretending to be a Liberal. </para>
        <para>The people of New South Wales- I have no right to say this but I will- are in for a very big shock. I wonder what will happen when the redistribution comes along next year. It may well be that the people unwittingly have been conned by this smooth, suave-talking armchair socialist, this man who puts himself forward as one of them when in fact not only is he not one of them but also is, as my colleague the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil)</inline> has said repeatedly, a prisoner of the Left. He has been reelected as Premier. How will the people feel when Frank Walker steps from the side and takes over? That will happen. How will they feel when the boundaries are redrawn so that Labor stays in power through the greatest gerrymander that this country has seen. </para>
        <para>I say to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> as you are from Queensland, that I get sick and tired of people grizzling to me about the alleged gerrymander there. Do you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that for the Liberals in South Australia to gain government- for the anti-socialists to win- they have to get 54.5 per cent of the vote. I make the prediction that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> and his colleagues, the people who run the Party from inside, the left wingers whom my colleagues the honourable member for St George, the honourable member for Dundas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ruddock)</inline> and the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Carlton)</inline> repeatedly are pointing out to the people of Australia, pass their gerrymander 60 per cent of the vote will be needed to get Wran out of office.

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The facilities described in this answer are those which, whether or not precisely required by the language of the question, are considered to be properly included having regard to their direct relationship with Australian Defence concerns and with foreign involvement at one dme or another in the period covered by the question. </para>
            <para>For the sake of completeness I record that a receiving station operated at Norfolk Island from January 1969 to April 1970. This station was established under an Exchange of Notes between the Australian and United States Governments dated 13 January 1969, and the agreement, which remained in force for six months, was extended on 10 July 1969 for a further six months. The purpose of the station was study of ionospheric propagation in relation to long range radio paths, and the US Air Force was the designated US cooperating agency for the duration of the project with the Australian Department of Supply. </para>
            <para>For the same reason I record as well that for many years Australia has participated with the US and UK in the operation of a number of portable geodetic satellite observation posts. The posts have generally each operated for a period of a few months up to two years. Agencies involved include the British and US Armies, US Coast and Geodetic Survey, and US Defence Mapping Agency. Activities jointly undertaken with the US are covered by the Memorandum of Mapping, Charting and Geodesy Arrangements of 29 August 1973 which designates the United States Department of Defence and the Australian Depanment of Defence as respective cooperating agencies. This memorandum, which remains in operation until one year after either of the co-operating agencies shall have notified the other of its intention to terminate the arrangements, replaced separate individual service arrangements of May /October 1960, March 1963 and </para>
            <para>CO- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">May 1965. Co-operation with the UK did not take place under a specific exchange. </para>
          <para>The function of these posts has been geodesy and mapping. They have been located, at different times, at Cocos Island, Perth, Culgoora (NSW), Thursday Island, Manus Island (when under Australian sovereignty), Darwin, Carnarvon, Townsville, and Caversham (WA). They are presently operating at Perth and Townsville. </para>
          <para>The numbers of personnel involved in these posts have been small- usually of die order of one or two Australians and two to six US or UK personnel. The US personnel concerned would be covered by the Status of Forces Agreement. Total operating cost of the facilities to Australia since 1966 is approximately $52,000. </para>
          <para>Having mentioned the foregoing in order to ensure that nothing which might be seen to fall within the ambit of the honourable member&#39;s question has been omitted, I turn to those things which more clearly fall under the heading of facility&#39;. </para>
          <para>Where in this answer information is not readily available this is indicated by the designation &#39;NRA&#39;. Where data are classified no answer is given. </para>
          <para>Cost data sought in question 10 are provided, where available, in current dollars. Annual operating costs for the facilities are not recorded in constant dollar terms. No answers have been provided to question 10 (b) because the annual operating costs to foreign governments of the facilities with which they are involved in Australia are not provided to the Australian Government. </para>

            <para>Joint Project, Woomera- The Joint UK/Australia Long Range Weapons Project (the Joint Project) was established in 1947 under the terms of a Memorandum of Arrangements (MOA) between the two Governments. Under the MOA, a redundant munitions factory at Salisbury (SA) was utilised as headquarters and laboratory support facilities of the Long Range Weapons Establishment. A testing range was established at what is now known as Woomera with launching, tracking and support facilities, airfields and a village. The Australian Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence (Procurement Executive) are the designated co-operating agencies. Several changes in designation of the UK cooperating agency over the last thirty years have been occasioned by organisational restructuring in the UK. (In this way, for example, UK co-operating agency responsibility passed on 1 May1971 from the Ministry of Aviation Supply to the Ministry of Defence (Procurement Executive).) </para>

          <para>Local call access in metropolitan areas (or any other area ) is determined by the principle that local calls are available between exchanges in the same or adjoining telephone zones. Consequently, the local call area for subscribers served by exchanges in, say, the Sydney metropolitan area covers exchanges in the metropolitan zone and those in all zones within the outer metropolitan area, each of which adjoins the metropolitan zone. </para>

              <para>The grouping of exchanges into zones and districts broadly follows the National Switching Plan which in turn has been based on an analysis of traffic flows between exchanges which indicated the direction of the main community of interest. In determining local call areas each centre is considered individually in relation to others in the area. The direction and extent of community of interest between centres is taken into account but other factors, including the geography of an area, population density and distribution and availability of reasonable community services within the existing local call area are important considerations. </para>

              <para>As it is not possible to convert all exchanges immediately priorities for conversion are based on a number of factors which include the number of subscribers involved, the service they are receiving, the capital required for conversion, the condition of external plant and exchange equipment in the area, and the need for extension of the exchange equipment. </para>

        <para>Information concerning official holdings of other foreign currencies, or of sterling since July 1976, has not been published. Australia&#39;s practice in this regard is in line with that followed by major overseas countries which confine publication to holdings of the one or two currencies in which the bulk of foreign exchange reserves is held and which are used for intervention purposes. Until the late 1960&#39;s sterling carried this function for Australia; it has since been fulfilled by the US dollar. </para>

            <para>The Commissioner has many discretions under the income tax law and it is not practicable to set out all the criteria he uses to exercise them. He is, however, constrained to exercise his discretionary powers reasonably and in accordance with law. Opinions formed by the Commissioner in exercising discretionary powers can be reviewed by Taxation Boards of Review and, in some circumstances, by the Courts. </para>

            <para>The Commissioner of Taxation has a statutory obligation to furnish annually to the Treasurer, for presentation to Parliament, a report on the working of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The form of the report including the taxation statistics supplement fully complies with that obligation. While the contents of this comprehensive report are largely for the Commissioner to determine, one of the important matters he must keep in mind is the requirement of the law not to disclose details of any individual taxpayer&#39;s affairs, except in a case involving a breach or evasion of the Act. </para>
            <para>Section1 36 of the Income Tax Assessment Act permits the Commissioner to assess tax on a taxable income greater than that returned by a taxpayer within a designated class if, in his opinion, this course should be taken. If the Commissioner takes that course his action does not carry with it the implication that the return lodged breached the income tax law in any way. Taxpayers within the designated class are legally obliged only to disclose the taxable income actually produced. It is on the basis of that, in conjunction with other information available to him from the taxpayer or other sources, that the Commissioner forms an opinion under section 136. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Relatively few assessments are raised each year pursuant to section 136. In the Commissioner&#39;s view, publication of separate details of those cases in his Report could lead to identification of the taxpayers concerned and thus breach the secrecy provisions of the income tax law. The cases are therefore included with the appropriate industry groupings in the statistical information relating to companies generally. </para>

            <para>The decision to discontinue particular collections took into account the nature of those collections: it was necessary to choose self-contained projects so that their termination would not have major repercussions on any related projects and therefore on users, and it was also necessary for the chosen projects to be small to medium in size so that it was possible not to concentrate the whole of the impact on one sector. After consideration of Ministerial views on alternative ways of curtailing the proposed statistical program, the Statistician decided that studies relating to foreign ownership and control of Australian industry and the job vacancies collection should be terminated. </para>

            <para>I would point out that the vegetable oils covered by this survey had been prepared and packaged before the National Health and Medical Research Council limits had been set. </para>
            <para>The question of vinyl chloride monomer levels in plastics for food contact applications was fully discussed with industry. Co-operation was excellent both from manufacturers and the Plastics Institute of Australia. Immediate steps were taken to survey the situation and to reduce levels of vinyl chloride monomer in polyvinyl chloride containers. </para>
            <para>A further survey of vinyl chloride monomer levels in vegetable oils packaged in PVC containers was carried out in 1977-78 by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. This survey involved the analysis of 330 samples of all available brands selected from retail food outlets throughout Australia. </para>
            <para>Only two of these 330 samples contained vinyl chloride monomer levels in excess of the N.H. and M.R.C. recommended maximum level of 0.05mg/kg. </para>
            <para>The date coding on one of these two samples showed that it was packaged in September 1975, that is before the N.H. and M.R.C. limits were recommended. </para>
            <para>The bottle which contained the other defective sample bore no date coding. </para>

              <para>1) A private survey of a limited nature was conducted by J. H. Martin of the Cancer Institute, Melbourne in 1955. The Australian Radiation Laboratory has been involved since the mid-50 &#39;s in measuring and assessing radiation doses received by patients undergoing specific x-ray examinations, but not at a level suitable for national survey purposes. Apan from the current national survey which is being conducted for the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &#38; MRC) and which is now nearing completion, the laboratory has made national assessments of population dose resulting from occupational exposure in 1961, 1966-67 and 1971. The latter two were reported to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects&#39; Of Atomic Radiation. These gave genetically significant doses closely comparable with results obtained in other countries. Since 1956 the Australian Radiation Laboratory has been responsible for monitoring radioactive fallout throughout Australia arising from atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. The assessment of exposure to the population shows doses resulting from fallout are very small compared with natural background. </para>

              <para>The management of low level radio-active waste arising from the mining and milling of radio-active ores is analogous to normal waste management in the mining industry at large. In the States the regulation of mining practice is a matter for the State Governments concerned. In the Northern Territory, matters concerning uranium and related issues were specifically excluded from the grant of executive authority to Territory Ministers under the Northern Territory (Self Government) Act, which came into effect on 1 July 1978. In order to ensure that there will be co-operative development of uniform nuclear codes of practice to cover such matters as the management of waste from the mining and milling of uranium ores throughout Australia, the Commonwealth passed the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act in May 1978. </para>

              <para>Existing legislation provides for a complex set of arrangements relating to crop insurance and disaster protection for farmers. These arrangements include the provision of extended loan programs for farmers, emergency compensation payments for crops affected by natural hazards or where plantings are prevented or yields reduced as a result of hazards, and the provision of crop insurance through the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. The arrangements have commonly been criticised for their inequalities which result in some farmers, depending on their location and the crops grown, qualifying for assistance while others are considered ineligible. It is anticipated that these inequalities will be eliminated with the introduction of the new program. </para>

              <para>Research in Australia is being conducted into the insect vectors of Australian Encephalitis, into animal and bird reservoirs of the disease, the causative virus and other closely related viruses, and into the possible effect of weather patterns on the incidence of the disease. </para>

          <para>Treatment procedures rely in the main on skilled nursing and facilities ibr intensive care, there being no specific antibiotic effective against the virus concerned. </para>
          <para>Since the ecosystem(s) involved differ from those existing in countries such as Japan where vaccines are used, effective application of a vaccine in this country is doubtful. There is no defined animal reservoir which might be vaccinated as is done elsewhere, and this whole matter is still under active consideration by the Expert Working Group on Australian Encephalitis of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Naturally a close watch is kept on research into vaccines being undertaken overseas. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General whether depositions relating to a conspiracy case in the Special Federal Court in Sydney late last year involving a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Patricia</inline> Moylan were removed from that Court without the knowledge or approval of the presiding magistrate? Who took this action and did it occur the day after the same depositions were unsuccessfully sought by counsel representing a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Christopher Lawrence in similar proceedings in another court? Further, were both cases related to the importation of cannabis into Australia? </para>

          <para>The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am informed that the events referred to by the honourable member were as follows- </para>
            <para>On 19 October 1977, the transcript of committal proceedings in progress against <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs P.</inline> M. Moylan was re- - moved from the Office of the  Clerk  of Petty Sessions, Phillip Street, Sydney, on a written direction from the Under-Secretary of Justice of New South Wales, who is the superior officer of the  Clerk.  That direction ordered the  Clerk  to make the transcript available to a member of the staff of the New South Wales Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking and the  Clerk  duly acted in accordance with that direction. </para>
            <para>The direction to the  Clerk  to make the transcript available was brought to the notice of the Magistrate presiding over the committal proceedings as soon as possible on 19 October 1977. The Magistrate adjourned the court to make enquiries. </para>
            <para>On 20 October 1977 the Magistrate, on resumption of the proceedings, informed the court that he had been told by the Department of Justice that the transcript would be returned that same morning, together with all copies. The Magistrate also said that he had been given an undertaking that no other copies had been made, that no notes had been taken as to the identity of witnesses or the value of evidence given, and that no further attempts would be made to obtain the transcript without the consent of the Commonwealth authorities. He also stated that he had been assured that the transcript had been sought only for use of the New South Wales Royal Commission. </para>
            <para>The removal of the transcript did occur on the day after Counsel appearing for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr F.</inline> C. Lawrence in a bail application before other sittings of the court sought access to the transcript of the proceedings against <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Moylan.</inline> That request was refused. </para>
            <para>The proceedings against <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Moylan</inline> and against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lawrence</inline> both related to charges of conspiracy concerning the importation of cannabis into Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Moylan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lawrence</inline> were convicted on those charges. </para>
