          <para>That the House notes the death on 6 August 1978 of His Holiness Pope Paul VI, and expresses its profound regret at his passing. </para>
        </motion>
        <para class="block">With the death of Pope Paul- the spiritual leader of the world's 700 million Roman Catholics for the last 15 years- the world lost a great religious leader and a messenger of peace. In many ways his papacy came in an unique age. It coincided with an upsurge of the ecumenical movement and far-reaching and fundamental changes in society throughout the world. It was an age, too, of challenge to the traditional spiritual authority of the Church. </para>
        <para>Pope Paul sought to maintain the essential body of doctrine of his Church, and to uphold its institutional character. He saw his duty as being to steer a middle course within the Church, between those elements calling for change and those who defended continuity. Pope Paul handled these challenges calmly and wisely, with moderation, tenacity and courage. </para>
        <para>Pope Paul made strenuous efforts to encourage the ecumenical movement for Christian unity. He actively encouraged contact and fraternity within Christianity and between the major world religions. He sponsored ecumenical meetings for Christian unity, held numerous meetings with leaders of other churches, and looked forward to the eventual resolution of disunity. </para>
        <para>Pope Paul also will be remembered for his important reforms to the organisation and structure of the Church. The implementation of the Vatican Council's decision to allow celebration of the mass in the vernacular was an historic event of his reign. There were important changes initiated by Pope Paul in the field of international affairs. He strove tirelessly for world peace and for higher ideals in the conduct of world affairs. </para>
        <para>Under him, the Vatican enhanced its already high stature in international diplomacy. It became a notable contributor to conferences such as those on world food problems, population, humanitarian law in armed conflict, and security and co-operation in Europe. Foreign policy concerns of the Holy See under Pope Paul included: Disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons; improvement of social welfare; assisting the development of the poorer countries; evolution of relations with Marxist regimes; and a desire to expand official communications with the communist, Islamic and Asian world to ensure maintenance of freedom of Christian observance. He emphasised peace as the most essential need of our time, and this was reflected in his innovation of the observance of 1 January as the world day of peace. </para>
        <para>I recall with warmth and appreciation my private audience with Pope Paul only last year, during which he gave expression to his concern for and promotion of peace amongst all the world 's citizens, and expressed at the same time a special concern for underprivileged developing nations. Pope Paul travelled widely, disregarding risks to his person, and became the first reigning Pontiff to visit all continents. We remember the affection generated by his visit to Australia in 1970. It was during his reign that Australia opened diplomatic relations with the Holy See. These have proved of great value in the conduct of Australia's foreign affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> Pope Paul was a man whose great strengths and personality became clearer the longer he remained Pope.  His  death saddened this country. It is a supreme loss for his Church and a real loss for all mankind. I commend the motion to the House. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition joins with the Government in its expression of condolence at the death of His Holiness, Pope Paul VI. Pope Paul VI began his reign in the shadow of his predecessor. Pope John was not an easy man to follow in office. As well, Pope Paul reigned at a time of change both within and outside the Church. His efforts to protect the Church from the radical changes occurring outside while at the same time in a sense allowing for those changes, earned him the respect of the world. Pope Paul, in fact had become known for his compassion towards all men long before he became head of the Roman Catholic Church. His relentless efforts during World War II to aid displaced persons and political prisoners, and the impartiality with which he dealt with diplomatic representatives of all nations, won him much admiration. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the critical days at the end of the War he served as the liaison between the Holy See and the Americans sent to Italy to establish the Catholic relief services. After the War he continued in his efforts to relieve the suffering of the homeless. Pope Paul never lost sight of the role of his Church in the international sphere. He reigned with great dignity during a period of considerable turbulence and change in international affairs. Not without sympathy I noted the problems he had to resolve in Vatican Council arising from differences between the progresives and the conservatives, or, as popular idiom might have it, between the left and right wings of the Council. </para>
        <para>Among the more notable achievements during his regin was the celebration of mass by Roman Catholics in their own language, replacing the traditional all-Latin mass. Pope Paul was a healing Pope. The rift between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church- the Great Schism of 1054- was healed. The Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches came closer together. As spiritual leader for 15 years of 600 million people, his influence in the cause of peace and wise counsel helped shape the events of our time. He will be remembered too for his heartfelt appeal to the United Nations- 'No more war; never again war'. The sense of loss in the Catholic Church caused by the death of this compassionate and gentle man will be shared by all Australians. </para>

          <para>- I would like to associate the members of the National Country Party with the expressions of regret made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> on the Death of Pope Paul VI. Pope Paul died in the 1 5th year of his pontificate. In those 15 years, he experience developments and changes which no Pope before him had seen. Pope Paul's reign saw not only great changes in his own Church but in the views and standards relating to many facets of life. He had to face up to many difficult and controversial issues and he did so with courage and resolution. He fought for the improvement of social welfare and development. He travelled widely to promote peace and goodwill. He visited not only christian countries but also opened up communication between the Vatican and communist countries. Pope Paul travelled to many countries throughout the world, and in Australia in 1970 he was greeted warmly by people of all faiths.  His  Australian visit was the first ever undertaken by a Pope. It contributed to bringing closer together Australian Christians and church leaders- an objective Pope Paul pursued throughout his time in office. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>During Pope Paul's 1 5-year reign, there were challenges by many Roman Catholics throughout the world to some of the centuries-old principles embodied in the activities and dogma of the Church.  His  determinaton to face these challenges firmly and without equivocation won him great respect, if not always agreement. One of the principal achievements of Pope Paul was to arrange the Second Vatican Council. Pope Paul worked tirelessly to re-unite the whole Christian Church. He will be remembered for important changes within the Church, for his untiring efforts and contributions to peace and for his humanitarian understanding of world problems and conflicts. Prior to his death, he asked that no monument should be erected to him, but Pope Paul established his own monument in the 15 years of his office. The world is saddened by his death. </para>

          <para>- On my own behalf and as a member of the Catholic community in this country I want to join with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> in expressing my deepest regret at the death of  His  Holiness Pope Paul VI. Pope Paul VI will long be remembered for what he did as head of the Catholic Church over a period of some 15 years and for what he sought to do in so many different areas during the whole of that period. In a world of massive change,  His  Holiness sought to place continuing emphasis upon the need for morality. He was an outstanding churchman, a great spiritual leader and a man of peace. I take this opportunity to join with the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister in expressing my sympathy. </para>

            <para>- I welcome the honourable gentleman's question because I feel it is high time that attention was focused on the facts of the dispute rather than on the apparently clouded public relations exercise in which the union has been engaging in the last couple of days. I say that because I am not surprised that the union would try to obscure the real issues involved. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In answering the honourable gentleman's question it is necessary to go back over some recent history. On 30 June the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association imposed work bans in three States in an attempt to press its claims for promotion of some of its members without the qualifications necessary for them to gain that promotion through the normal internal structures of the Australian Telecommunications Commission. For the Commission to have agreed to those demands would have meant abandoning the necessary qualifications standard. The dispute was the subject of proceedings before Commissioner Clarkson on a number of occasions before it was adjourned indefinitely, and it needs to be understood why it was adjourned indefinitely. The reason was the refusal of the union leaders to accept a working document prepared by all parties to the dispute as a basis for examining the classification structure of the Telecom Australia staff. On the recommendation of the federal executive of the union, the work bans and industrial disruption were then widened. At the time of the union 's action Commissioner Clarkson said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It seems to me that if you - </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is the union- persist with the action which your members are now engaged in that you are inviting a confrontation . . . While you  have got the bans on you are dosing the doors; nobody else is; and the simplest and most effective way of getting this dispute fixed is to lift those bans. </para>
          <para class="block">Those were the words of Commissioner Clarkson a couple of weeks ago. He concluded: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>All in all, the situation is a mess, the quickest and easiest way of cleaning up the mess is to lift the bans. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Last Friday Commissioner Clarkson again sought to convene discussions. He proposed, inter alia, a 2 1-day cooling-off period. That evening Telecom communicated to the union its general acceptance of this proposition. The next day the Federal Executive of the union decided to reject the Clarkson proposals in the full knowledge of the Telecom general acceptance of them. That was made public before Commissioner Clarkson yesterday. </para>
          <para>I would like to emphasise that Telecom has acted responsibly at all times and has sought to have this dispute settled through the proper processes available to it. On the other hand, the union has rejected any attempt to negotiate and has chosen to revert to strike and ban action designed to impair the effectiveness of the nation's telecommunications network. I would like to say that the Government supports Telecom in the action it has taken, following the normal negotiating procedures. It has taken all reasonable steps to resolve this dispute. </para>

              <para>- Finally, Telecom has assured the ATEA that it would facilitate the training of its members to reach the new standards which would enable them to get the higher classification that they have been claiming. So the inconvenience caused by this dispute rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Federal Executive of the ATEA, as indeed Commissioner Clarkson has pointed out. It is high time the union stopped clouding the issue and sat down to negotiate a settlement of the dispute in the proper area- and that is the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>

We have a firm commitment to see that these communities can become self-managing communities under the local government legislation. Over recent weeks I have maintained continuous contact with my counterpart in this regard, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hinze,</inline> the Minister for Local Government, to iron out difficulties that had arisen and to see that the legislation has an opportunity to work. </para>

            <para>- There has been very great concern about the lowering of the world price of sugar, particularly since we negotiated an International Sugar Agreement last year with the hope of improving the price. The main reason that the price has not responded has been the delay in the United States ratifying the International Sugar Agreement and the European Economic Community not becoming associated with that Agreement and restraining its exports to the world market. This year the EEC has given approval for 2.9 million tonnes of sugar to be exported with an export subsidy in excess of $700m. This, of course, is having a very disruptive effect on the world price and the operations of the International Sugar Agreement. </para>

          <para>While in Geneva I had discussions with senior officials, both of the United States Government and the EEC, and asked that they take appropriate action. I also spoke to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to obtain the support of the developing countries, which are greatly concerned, so that they may use their influence and pressure. I also called a meeting of the International Sugar Council executive so that it might confirm its desire that America and the EEC take action. I believe that all of these steps are leading to a situation where the American Congress will ratify the Agreement. This probably will not take place until next month. If it does not ratify it, I believe that will have very serious consequences for the International Sugar Agreement, for </para>
          <para class="block">UNCTAD, for the integrated commodity program and for the Common Fund. So it is very important that the United States ratifies it and that the EEC becomes a member. </para>

            <para>-From the honourable member's question it appears that some of his constituents are visiting Lebanon. If he will give me the specific information about those constituents and their relatives to which he has referred, naturally I will have inquiries made. I recall discussing with officers of my Department last month the desirability of warning Australians about travelling in Lebanon. This tragedy has been recurring for some time now. The ceasefire that came into effect on approximately 10 August appears at present to be holding, but the reality is that it is one of a series of ceasefires that have collapsed since the outbreak of major fighting in February. The latest accord may have a better chance of success since it reportedly contains provisions aimed at a disengagement of forces within the city of Beirut. The Australian Embassy, which is in West Beirut, has been keeping the Department fully informed of developments on a day to day basis. Naturally the Government welcomes the ceasefire and hopes that in the interests of the inhabitants of Beirut law and order can be restored and a peaceful political settlement arrived at as soon as possible. </para>

          <para>I ask the honourable member to give me details of the matter he has raised specifically and I shall have investigations made to ascertain what we can do.  His  concern for his constituents is a by-word amongst Government members, and I reiterate that we share the concern for not only his constituents but also people in the wider community who have suffered grievously and tragically in Lebanon. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that any issue affects the profitability of the Australian meat industry more than the question of access to the United States market. Hence the reported statement by  President  Carter at Columbus, Missouri, yesterday and its implications for future levels of Australian beef imports in to the United States is of profound concern to Australian producers and certainly to the Australian Government. Indeed, since the so-called Bentsen counter-cyclical proposals passed the United States Senate and were referred to the House Ways and Means Committee the Government has been particularly concerned to ensure that there is understanding by the average consumer in the United States of the level of imports into that country. In fact it represents only about 7 per cent of the domestic consumption. Yet to a country such as Australia such imports are quite critical in being able to maintain overall national and international economic programs. In the multilateral trade negotiations, at which Australia has been led by the  Deputy  Prime Minister and supported by the Minister for Special Trade Representations, Australia and the United States have generally taken a line stressing the necessity to include agricultural products with industrial products in any conclusions reached with respect to a lessening of trade barriers. Therefore it seems paradoxical that within the United States itself people should be making statements which suggest the need for further restrictive legislation, particularly pertaining to agricultural products. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As far as the level of United States imports is concerned, it is true that recently there has been an increase of 200 million lb in the restraint levels for this year. That will increase the actual quotas to the highest point ever. But against that it needs to be said that in 1972 and 1973, when no quotas were applied, the level of Australian beef exports to the United States was even higher. So the prevailing level of beef imports, although somewhat better than the position in preceding years, is certainly not as satisfactory as it was in 1972 and 1973. Of course this has a very marked effect on the prices paid by American consumers and, in an election year in that country, one would hope that members of the Congress would be concerned to listen not only to the American cattlemen but also to the American consumers. I understand that there has been some reduction in the prices paid on the average for beef consumed in United States households since the relaxation of imports but it is still true that price levels there are significantly higher than they are anywhere else in the world. </para>
          <para>From the Australian producers' point of view, the Australian Government is pursuing every possible course to ensure that no further restrictive legislation is imposed by the United States Congress and, certainly, that before any such legislation is passed the American Administration realises the implications for its own country, for the negotiations that the United States is pursuing in the MTN and for countries such as Australia which are so heavily dependent upon continued access to the United States market. I believe that the American Administration generally is conscious of many of these forces. Through visits to the United States by individual Ministers and approaches by representatives of the Australian Government, we are trying to ensure that there is recognition not only by the American Administration but also by members of the Congress and the Senate of the implications of any new moves to restrain beef imports to their country. </para>

            <para>- Officers of my Department automatically swing into operation as soon as incidents, such as those mentioned by the honourable member, occur. The Air Safety Investigation Branch began an immediate investigation and it will eventually report to me on each of those incidents. Insofar as the general question of air safety is concerned, I am able to tell the House that in terms of statistics- mark you, statistics are never satisfactory to those people who are involved in incidents of this nature- the fact is that there has been a declining trend over the last 10 years in incidents of this nature. In terms of manpower of the Department and funds made available for expenditure in areas which fall within my responsibility, each year I have made sure that, despite budgeting difficulties with which the Government might be faced, appropriate funds are found for the continuance of a program of maintenance of air safety. In fact, I have said on occasion after occasion that I am not prepared to prejudice air safety because of budgeting difficulties. If the honourable member waits until tonight's Budget he will see that an appropriate amount of money has been made available for air safety and for the maintenance of air facilities. Incidents of this nature are a very vexed problem. When the reports on these incidents come to hand I will, of course, table them in the Parliament. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Can the Minister confirm reports that agreement has been reached between Australia and Great Britain on the level of a discounted air fare, possibly $570? If so, when will that fare be officially announced? Will the fare be restricted to travel on Qantas Airways Ltd and British Airways only? Because of some confusion in the travel industry when will the full report of the International Civil Aviation Review be available to the Parliament? </para>

            <para>- The negotiations with the British Government in respect of cheaper air fares in and out of this country have been proceeding very satisfactorily. The British team returned to the United Kingdom about a week ago to report to the Government there. The next step is for me to arrange for negotiations to be undertaken with other countries of Europe, Asia and America that have airlines coming in and out of Australia. A team will be leaving for America towards the end of this month. There have been a number of reports stating that for some reason the Australian Government has got the axe into KLM, JAT, Lufthansa, UTA and, I suppose, Alitalia. A great number of representations have been made to me, particularly about KLM. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I have said, the facts are that we will be sending a team to negotiate with the Dutch Government and other governments of Europe within the next couple of weeks. Those governments can make their own judgments about the proposals that we have. I point out to the House that on a previous occasion when there was an opportunity for KLM to pick up a cheaper air fare which British Airways and Qantas had negotiated and agreed to, KLM showed no interest in that particular air fare. Therefore, I am unable to make a judgment as to whether KLM will be interested in the sorts of proposals that we have before us. A great variety of figures has been chosen by media writers and others speculating about the air fares. I can confirm for the honourable member that the figure chosen will be of great interest to the members of the Australian travelling public. It is certainly much cheaper than any fare available today. However, I am not able to disclose the actual figure because it is part of the negotiations and it would be improper for me to confirm a figure that as yet has not been conveyed to other governments. I know that the honourable member will understand my sensitivity on that point. I hope to be in a position to table at an early date the report of the International Civil Aviation Review. </para>

            <para>-During the course of the Vietnam war the United States of America built up a major sea and air base at Cam Ranh Bay which was one of the major naval installations, certainly in the Pacific theatre, and I believe that it is a major naval installation by any standards in the world. Concern has been expressed from time to time since the end of the Vietnam conflict that Russia might gain access to Cam Ranh Bay as a major addition to its own shore based facilities, thus enormously increasing the Soviet Union's strategic reach into the Pacific and linking up the Soviet facilities at Vladivostok and in the Indian Ocean. Of course, we know that the Soviet Union has a great capacity to maintain ships at sea for long periods and can reach into any part of the world from its present facilities. But another major land based facility at Cam Ranh Bay would enormously increase the Soviet Union's capacity to reach out with great strength. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Government has been concerned for the maintenance of balance in the Indian Ocean. We have been concerned for the maintenance of balance, albeit at the lowest possible level. But activities of recent times by the Soviet Union have not given us great cause to be confident that the Soviet Union shares that particular objective. In addition, the countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations have policies designed to make sure that the military activities of the major powers do not impact on the region. We have always supported the ASEAN nations very strongly in that objective. I am quite certain that the ASEAN countries would not want to see additional incursions of any kind that would upset the present situation. A major development at Cam Ranh Bay by the Soviet Union would be such a development. </para>
          <para>In addition to that unsettling factor, we have the fact that the move would inevitably tend to push Vietnam towards closer and closer links with the Soviet union in contradistinction with its relations with China. That would impose additional stresses and strains on the region which it could well do without. All in all, in terms of stability and strategic balance, there is nothing whatever to commend such a movement of Russians into Cam Ranh Bay. It would upset the balance of the region, it would unsettle the politics of the region, and it is a move that would need to be condemned. I think it is symptomatic, knowing these concerns and knowing very much that they are shared by the ASEAN countries, that they have a concern about the future directions of the policies of some countries, even though in recent times there have been encouraging moves and encouraging developments which I think ought to be applauded. They are concerned about events such as those to which the honourable gentleman drew attention that could lead to instability. </para>
          <para>I think it is worth noting that the Leader of the Opposition indicated during one of his recent excursions overseas that in his view such a move would not involve any instability whatsoever. I can only say that that is typical of the view that has been taken by the Leader of the Opposition and by his predecessors over a great many years- that an extension of power and influence by the Soviet Union does not create instability. I wonder how many countries in Africa or how many observers of Africa one could ask that question of and get the same kind of answer. That kind of attitude in relation to the extension of the Soviet Union's influence needs to stand in stark contrast with the Opposition 's general criticism of the efforts of the United States whenever that country undertakes initiatives designed to maintain balance. We know quite well the arguments about North- West Cape which have been going on for a long period- arguments that have been revived in the last couple of years. We know quite well its opposition to the development of facilities at Diego Garcia. I think it is just as well that not only this House but also the people of Australia should be reminded from time to time of the natural inclinations which are carried through from past Leaders of the Opposition to this particular Leader of the Opposition. If this Government has to make a choice, in blunt and plain terms, between naval facilities under the control of the United States and those under the control of the Soviet Union, I guarantee that we would prefer those facilities under the control of the United States. We do not wish to see an extension of major facilities under the control of the Soviet Union that would upset the strategic balance and which would, at the same time, be viewed with great disfavour by ASEAN countries and which would lead to the possibility of political instability of a very serious kind. </para>

          <motion>
            <para>That the House take note of the papers. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">It may be helpful to honourable members if I briefly set out the key events leading up to the setting up of this royal commission. Allegations were made by the present honourable member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> on 21 December 1977 that one of his parliamentary colleagues had had an undue influence on the redistribution in that State. It soon became apparent that the person to whom the honourable member was referring was the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Robinson).</inline></para>
          <para>I discussed this matter on 1 7 January with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Administrative Services and it was decided that a meeting should be held in my office on the following day attended by me, those two Ministers, and the honourable members for Fadden, Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull).</inline> As a result of the meeting on 1 8 January, and with the agreement of the Minister for Administrative Services and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> I requested the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General to examine the complaints which had been put forward. The honourable member for Fadden had a lengthy document, which he showed me briefly, about his allegations. He did not leave a copy with me but agreed to discuss it with the Solicitor-General. </para>
          <para>I rang <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> to tell him what happened at the meeting, and at my request <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> as the responsible Minister, reported further to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> on the matter. The law officers' advices of 9 February and 15 February were referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in the Senate on 28 February. In summary, that advice was that the matters complained of neither required nor warranted Government action. </para>
          <para>The issue was raised again on 7 April. On that day the law officers' advice was tabled after the honourable member for Fadden had again adverted to his allegations. The honourable member for Fadden referred to some statutory declarations which were additional to the material the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General had previously considered. </para>
          <para>There were several discussions between Ministers on 10 April at which both Senators Withers and Durack were present, to decide what action should be taken and it was again decided that this additional material should be submitted to the law officers for further advice. On the same day, the original memoranda of advice of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General were incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
          <para>On or about 11 April the Chief Electoral Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> read the memoranda for the first time in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> After discussing the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> he spoke to the Solicitor-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> informed the Solicitor-General that in mid-September <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had discussed with him the naming of the electorate of the Minister for Finance and that at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> suggestion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> had spoken to the  chairman  of the Queensland distribution commissioners, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman,</inline> on this matter. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General was informed of this orally by the Solicitor-General on 14 April. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> approached <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> who confirmed what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> had said. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> then told me on 16 April of the telephone conversations between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> and between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman.</inline></para>
          <para>Now let me make one point quite clear. This was the first occasion on which I became aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> intervention. While not reflecting in the slightest on the evidence of the Minister for Finance, I have absolutely no recollection of the matter being raised in any previous discussions. It is also fair to say that in his evidence to the royal commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has no clear recollection of raising the matter with me on 17 January, nor has there been any suggestion that the matter was raised in the lengthy discussions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and I had with the honourable member for Fadden. If I had had any relevant information relating to the inquiries of the law officers, eitheron 1 8 January or 10 April, I would have referred it to them. I state that categorically and absolutely. </para>
          <para>Both the Attorney-General and I were concerned that this information, which was clearly relevant to the allegations against the Minister for Finance, was not made available to the law officers in January and as a result their original advice was deficient. There were further discussions between Ministers on 17 April. On the following day I left for Japan. From there I requested that a report of the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General be ready for discussion upon my return. </para>
          <para>On 2 1 April, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> confirming details of the telephone conversations and his reason for making them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> also wrote to the Attorney-General supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> letter. Both these letters have been tabled. On 23 April, a meeting was held at the Lodge of a number of Ministers to consider the report from the law officers which I had sought to expedite while in Japan. This report resulted from the Government's reference to the law officers of additional material on 10 April. The report was incorporated in the letter dated 23 April which I have tabled and advised that further investigation was required and that a judicial inquiry would be preferable. The Ministers agreed that a royal commission should be appointed forthwith, so that the allegations could be examined fully and publicly. </para>
          <para>The Ministers discussed proposed terms of reference and the precise form was settled the following day and is set out in the letters patent of 24 April. The letters patent referred specifically to the change of name of the electorate and were quite wide enough to allow all the relevant evidence to be heard, and I emphasise that point as one of substance. It was not unnatural that as the only allegations which had been made concerned the Minister for Finance and the Queensland distribution commissioners, then, as to the commission's findings, the terms of reference referred to those persons for these were the matters in Ministers' minds. These were the matters subject to examination. The telephone conversations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> were raised at the meeting. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General's advice on 23 April was that in his view these telephone conversations were not contrary to the Electoral Act, a view subsequently confirmed by the royal commission, but constituted evidence relevant to the charges against the Minister for Finance and should come forward at the hearings of the royal commission. Ministers agreed with this advice. As soon as the royal commission had been appointed, the Attorney-General arranged for papers to be made available to counsel assisting the royal commission including details of the telephone conversations between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> and between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and the  chairman  of the distribution commissioners. In this way, the Attorney-General made absolutely sure that the details of the telephone conversations would be disclosed in public evidence before the commission. </para>
          <para>All the Government's actions, it can be seen, were prompted by a desire to have all the facts brought out at the royal commission. Allegations were then made, supported by statutory declarations, relating to alleged statements by the Minister for Finance on the Government's decision on uranium mining. The Government decided that the terms of reference should be widened to cover the uranium allegations and revised terms of reference were drafted by the law officers. New letters patent incorporating the revised terms of reference were issued on 10 May. </para>
          <para>The following day and before any evidence was heard by the commission, the Attorney-General wrote to the royal commissioner indicating that the Government was willing to extend his terms of reference further if any matters came to his notice indicating that in the course of the redistribution any person had acted improperly or in breach of a Commonwealth law. On the same day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> wrote to the honourable member for Fadden urging him to place before the counsel assisting the royal commissioner any further material he had which supported his allegations. I have tabled these two letters from the Attorney-General, together with  His  Honour's reply on 12 May. </para>
          <para>On 15 May, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> and on 22 May, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> gave evidence before the royal commission about the telephone conversations.

On 28 May, a meeting of a group of Ministers and officials from my Department and the Attorney-General's Department met to consider the situation. </para>
          <para>In accordance with the Government's policy throughout this matter, as reflected in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> 's letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> McGregor of 11 May, to have all allegations of illegality or impropriety in the course of the McPherson redistribution fully heard and determined, Cabinet decided on 30 May to have the terms of reference widened again so that the royal commission could make a finding on whether any breach of the law of the Commonwealth or any impropriety had occurred on the part of any person in the course of the McPherson redistribution. </para>

            <para>On 26 July 1 977 at Beaudesert in the State of Queensland, the Honourable Eric Robinson made a statement concerning the likely decisions of the Commonwealth Government in relation to the mining or uranium in Australia to the following effect- </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This was a statement to which no exception can be taken. Accordingly, I wrote last week to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson</inline> asking him to resume his portfolio as Minister for Finance. The Royal Commission similarly exonerated completely the Chief Electoral Officer and the three Queensland Distribution Commissioners.

            <para>The action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Right Honourable R. G. Withers constitutes impropriety within the meaning of the Letters Patent dated 30 May 1978. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> used his position to further a political purpose by an approach (not open to members of the public) to the Distribution Commissioners. That purpose was not made known to them, and it was foreign to the matters which were proper for their consideration. Had the Commissioners been made aware of what was behind the approach, they would not have entertained it. </para>
            <para>However, believing they were being invited merely to correct an error on their part, they went along with the suggestion which was put to them. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> did not seek to influence, or influence, the Commissioners in any way about how they should perform their duties of distribution of the Electoral Divisions in Queensland, he did seek to influence them, and he did in fact influence them, through an intermediary, as to something which they proposed to say in their Report, that is to say, the names which they tentatively attached to two Electoral Divisions. What he did, having regard to the purpose with which he did it, in myjudgment constitutes impropriety. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>McGregor thus found that an impropriety had been committed not because of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> act of communicating with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> about the name of the electorate but because of 'the purpose with which he did it'. The Commissioner exonerated the Chief Electoral Officer who was a party to the same act but who did not have, in the judgment of the Commissioner, and was not aware of in the view of the Commissioner, the motive which the Commissioner found to be the real reason for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> telephone calls. </para>
          <para>Senior Ministers considered carefully what should be done in the light of this finding and of the judge's definitions of impropriety. We had no doubt that our first and foremost responsibility was the maintenance of the high standards of propriety set and maintained by this Government. We were of the view that we had no option but to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> McGregor's report and accepting it had inevitable consequences in respect of the finding of impropriety. In coming to decisions on these particular matters, it was necessary to have in mind the answers given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in the Senate on 4 November and 26 May in the light of the evidence which emerged at the Royal Commission and the findings of the Commission. As I said in my statement when the report was released on 8 August: </para>

            <para>If these high standards were not upheld, the people's confidence in Government- a confidence which is fundamental to Australian democracy- would be undermined. </para>
            <para>The Government has an obligation to uphold them even though the cost can be and is in this instance, a high one. </para>

          <para class="block">Thus on 7 August I recommended to  His Excellency  the Governor-General that he should determine <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> appointment as Minister for Administrative Services. </para>
          <para>Throughout this whole matter, the Government has consistently acted to have the allegations examined by the law officers, and then, in their recommendations, by the Royal Commission. Twice, when new allegations and issues were raised, the Royal Commission's terms of reference were widened. The totality of the Government's actions was designed to elicit all the facts on the allegations which had been made. I remind the House that the terms of reference were sufficiently wide to encompass findings in respect of any other Minister, public servant or person. The decisions we made were difficult and not without pain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has a fine <inline font-style="italic">record</inline> as a Minister and as Leader of the Government in the Senate.

            <para>- If the impropriety committed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> is so serious that he should be peremptorily dismissed from ministerial office by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> then the Prime Minister too should stand down. The Prime Minister is as deeply implicated in this matter as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> The events associated with this affair cannot be dismissed in the way the Prime Minister has suggested today. The Royal Commission report deals with only one narrow aspect which, despite its importance, is one of the lesser concerns of this Parliament. The central issue for this Parliament and for the community at large is the conduct of the Prime Minister, not of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> The evidence given before the Royal Commission, not just its report, raises many serious questions which must be answered before the Parliament can discuss the matter in a meaningful way. The Prime Minister obviously is seeking to avoid these questions and to avoid meaningful debate. He is hoping that he can bury the issues beneath the weight of publicity for the Budget. He is terrified of the mounting tensions within the Government parties. He is terrified of the challenge to his own position. </para>

              <para>- Whistling in the dark to prove you are brave will not reassure anyone. In the tactics he is attempting today the Prime Minister is demonstrating his contempt for this Parliament in the same way that he demonstrated it over this affair throughout the first half of this year. Let me state now that we are not prepared to let the matter rest at this point. We intend to raise it tomorrow, the day after and next week, and after that again if it is appropriate. This matter is going to continue to haunt the Prime Minister, and properly so. We are being asked today to whitewash a conspiracy. We will have no part of that proposition; nor, we believe, will the Australian people. Events and facts already on the public record challenge the basic credibility of the Prime Minister and his Government. They challenge the fitness of the Prime Minister and his Government to hold office. It is absurd to suggest that they can be brushed aside with a statement that ignores the fundamental issues and attempts to paint a tainted government as the virtuous defender of probity in public life. I repeat: We do not intend today to explore fully all of the matters that concern us on this issue. I reaffirm that we will be raising this matter tomorrow, and the Prime Minister can prepare himself for that, the day after that and next week too. It is our belief that the Prime Minister has established by his conduct in this matter that his behaviour is not the behaviour of an honest man. He ought to resign. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let us look at some of the matters we will be exploring in the course of the next few days. How can the Prime Minister ignore the statement of the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> in this Parliament on 3 November last year? Whatever differences the Opposition may have with the honourable member for Lilley, it concedes his integrity and his determination to serve a principle. He is not a double dealer; he is not a dissembling representative in this Parliament. He is also not given to exaggeration in an effort to make a case, least of all a case that is damaging to his own team. On 3 November 1 977, the honourable member for Lilley said:   . . I am of a mind that the redistribution in Queensland was a dishonest redistribution. I am certainly of a mind that section 21 of the Act was not adhered to in that redistribution. To put it bluntly, I believe that some cheating went on. </para>
          <para>He continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>They- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, the distribution commissioners-  got a message from on high, perhaps by way of a telephone call. </para>
          <para class="block">That is prescient in the light of what has transpired. There was no guesswork there. But back benchers already knew the felony that was afoot on the part of the top people in government. The honourable member for Lilley continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But they made a significant change in names such as has not occurred before in redistributions . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It was improper conduct; corrupt conduct. The former Minister for Administrative Services was party principal to it and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Big</inline> was the Prime Minister who knew all along of the implication of the Minister for Administrative Services. Now no one is going to suggest seriously to me that any comment from a senior member of the Government, with the standing and respect that the honourable member for Lilley enjoys bipartisanly in this House would be ignored and that the Prime Minister would fail to make some sort of inquiry when such a serious and damaging allegation was made against the Government of which the honourable member for Lilley, who was previously a Minister in a conservative government, is part. </para>
          <para>There are the statements of the Minister for Finance- sworn testimony before the Royal Commission- that on 17 January, 23 April and some time in between, with other Ministers present, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> on three occasions told the Prime Minister of his implication in this matter. The Prime Minister is seeking in the House today to tough it out. No one believes him when he says that he took no notice of the allegations of the honourable member for Lilley and no one will believe him when he suggests that he cannot recall at all the serious statement of the Minister for Finance. It is a case of convenient amnesia. He seeks a tabula rasa of the guilty man wanting to make a fresh start, but he has gone too far. We cannot let this matter rest here. I ought to mention in passing that the Prime Minister complained that the honourable member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> did not leave a copy of the document- the basis of his allegations- with him when the honourable member raised the matter. We all know why. It is because the honourable member for Fadden said- this is on public record- that if he left it with the Prime Minister it would be put through the shredder.  His  own team does not trust him. They are late arrivals at this position. We could have advised them earlier not to trust him. The Prime Minister said that on 16 April <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> told him of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> intervention and that this was the first time he had heard about it. He has this case of convenient amnesia afflicting his recollection until that day. </para>
          <para>But let us not quibble about that today because we intend to explore these matters further. Let us settle on his admission of today. If he really stands by that then there are serious implications flowing from that statement which require a defence from him. Why is it that the Prime Minister set up terms of reference for a royal commission of inquiry on the night of 23 April- a week later- which specifically excluded consideration of the role of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in this matter? The role of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> went right to the heart of the complaint of the honourable member for Fadden. Honourable members will recall that the complaint was that the name of the electorate of Gold Coast, as proposed, was improperly changed to that of McPherson, and that that was a very significant change. Indeed the royal commission makes that clear, as does the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alan</inline> Hulme, the evidence attributed to the Minister for Finance and the evidence attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sparkes,</inline> the State  President  of the National Country Party in Queensland. The Prime Minister knew that complaints were being made that improper conduct was responsible for that change of name. He knew that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> who was responsible for the improper intervention. He was aware, however, that while his back benchers knew there had been an impropriety, they were, perhaps wrongly, blaming the Minister for Finance and not correctly blaming the Minister for Administrative Services. So, secure in the knowledge that the Minister for Finance could not be found guilty of something done quite wrongly by the Minister for Administrative Services, the Prime Minister set terms of referencethat was his responsibility in administering the Royal Commission Act- which specifically excluded the Minister for Administrative Services. The honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley and the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull)</inline> all knew that something wrong had been done, but they got the wrong man and they were going to be played for suckers by the Prime Minister who set down limited terms of reference. The royal commission would have found nothing if it had not been for the persistence in this House of the honourable member for Fadden, of the Opposition and of the Press in this country. They exposed the quite improper behaviour not only of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers-</inline> he is the scapegoat in thisbut also of the Prime Minister, who used <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in the hope that he could keep some scars off his own political hide. The Prime Minister has to answer the question: Why was it that he limited the terms of reference, knowing full well that limiting them in the way he did wouldhopefully on his part- preclude the proper finding of guilt of the Minister for Administrative Services? The Prime Minister never recognised what a clumsy witness the former Minister for Administrative Services would prove to be. The dog that went in to bark ended up biting itself. </para>
          <para>There is another matter raised by the Prime Minister which causes a great deal of concern here. It reflects again the tendency of the Prime Minister to put the stiletto in the hand of someone else to do the back-stabbing within his own party. He proposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> McGregor that, if he considered fit, he ought to expand the terms of reference for the inquiry. Now that is a very happy arrangement, if one can get Justice McGregor to be foolish enough to take the responsibility to expand the terms of reference to net the Minister for Administrative Services. One anticipates what the plot was. There would be sympathy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> later from the Prime Minister but as for now his attitude would be: 'Stiff luck old boy, you cannot trust those judges. They do not know when to stay bought. He extended the terms of reference on you'. But it did not work out that way. The Prime Minister had to do his own dirty work again and, as you know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> he is not loath to do his dirty work when it will serve his own particular interest. </para>

              <para>- The reason the Prime Minister came somewhat clean today in the House- he is a long way from being lily white, and I think that task is impossible on his record in this Parliament- is that he was forced into a corner by the private briefings the former Minister for Administrative Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> was giving the Press about a week ago. </para>

              <para>-Senator Withers has disclosed that on 4 August he spoke to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said: 'I have good news and bad news. The good news is that the Royal Commission has exonerated the Minister for Finance, , our colleague, Eric Robinson'. No doubt Reg Withers said: 'What is the bad news?' The Prime Minister said: 'The bad news is that you are in trouble '. To that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> replied: ' We 're in trouble.'

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>has implicated the Prime Minister in this matter. In his new political newsletter entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Laurie Oakes Report,</inline> Laurie Oakes, the Prime Minister's favourite author, has pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> lifted the lid on the Prime Minister in these private briefings to journalists about a week ago, with about 20 journalists present taking notes. According to the report <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> pointed out to the Prime Minister that he would be in trouble for being conveniently unable to recall the evidence of the Minister for Finance about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> statement on 17 January, and Fraser replied that he would deny this. According to the report <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> then said that that would be tantamount to accusing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson</inline> of perjury, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> said that he would say he had no memory of this event. The Prime Minister has shifted some ground but he is trying to stick on that. It is our intention to budge him from it. I reassert that the behaviour of the Prime Minister is not the behaviour of an honest man. He should not be in this Parliament. </para>

              <para>-The Prime Minister has made a statement regarding the serious allegations that had been made concerning the redistribution in Queensland relating to the electorate of McPherson. I believe that that statement shows clearly that the Government has acted properly and reveals all the facts related to this situation. Today the Opposition and, to a degree, the media have tried to present the whole situation dramatically but 1 think it is fair to say that the view of the Australian public is one of massive indifference since the Prime Minister announced the Government's decision relating to the findings of the Royal Commission. I suppose it is a fairly common thing for those who sit in this place and for those who look down upon us in judgment to see our actions as being a lot more important and significant than they really are. Nevertheless, we would be wrong to fail to recognise, as did the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in an editorial of 9 August, that the issue involved in the matter we are now discussing is one of principle. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The principle, of course, is that Ministers are expected to act not merely in accordance with the law but in accordance with standards of ethics and conduct of a high order. When a royal commission declares that a Minister has acted with impropriety, there is no alternative but for the Prime Minister to ask for the Minister's resignation or, if necessary, to remove him from the Ministry. The Prime Minister must take this action no matter what he or his ministerial colleagues or anyone else for that matter might think of the findings of the royal commission. The Prime Minister must take this action no matter what the degree of guilt involved and no matter what the political and other consequences of his action might be. When a finding of impropriety is embodied in the report of a royal commission the Prime Minister is left in the most unenviable position of having to embark upon a course of action which allows no half measures. As a journalist in the Press Gallery put it, there is no way you can have a half hanging even though the crime may not be a hanging one. When the </para>
          <para class="block">Prime Minister is a man who has consciously and properly set great store on integrity and probity in government, there can be no doubt whatever as to the course he must follow. </para>
          <para>Perhaps it would be worth taking a couple of minutes to ask ourselves what the consequences would have been if the Prime Minister had not responded to the findings of the Royal Commission in the way he did. The criticism which the Opposition has already directed at the Government would be nothing compared with its criticism if the Prime Minister had failed to take the course of action he took. Yet today honourable members opposite are desperately trying to manufacture other issues, to imagine conspiracies and what have you. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> says that he will continue to bring up this matter day after day, month after month. If he does I think it will show the inadequacy of the Leader of the Opposition in coping with his job. The matter has been resolved properly and clearly and, I believe, to the satisfaction of the Australian people. When this matter became an issue of significance about 10 days ago there was a question in the minds of some people as to whether the Prime Minister should accept the findings of the Royal Commission and take the course dictated by those findings. Certainly there was a great deal of concern and sympathy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> When I became fully aware of the Royal Commission's findings- as I was away from Australia I did not know of them immediately- there was no doubt in my mind as to what must happen. I made it quite clear to the Prime Minister when I spoke to him from Manila late in the afternoon of Monday, 7 August, that I could see no alternative to what the Government proposed to do and what I fully supported. This should give the lie to the suggestion that I changed my attitude after I returned to Australia on Wednesday of last week or that I was in some way concerned about the attitude of my senior colleagues. These suggestions, which have been reported in a most irresponsible manner in at least one newspaper, are absolutely without foundation or truth. If the Prime Minister had not done what he did there would have been very serious and firm grounds for criticism of him. A royal commission is not established lightly. Its findings are not to be regarded lightly. To do so would be to weaken public respect for the standing of royal commissions as a means of inquiry. To disregard the findings of a royal commission which has been asked to examine specific allegations of malpractice would be to throw into contempt not only the commission directly concerned but future commissions as well. The Opposition and the media would have a real field day claiming, as they would have every right to do, that a government that ignored the findings of a royal commission could not be trusted to respect the findings of any future royal commission it set up. </para>
          <para>Every time in the future a government found it necessary to set up a royal commission for one reason or another, the opposition immediately would raise the cry that such action was a farce because the government could not be trusted to respect or act on the findings of a royal commission. The Australian people would have every reason then to be suspicious of the integrity and trustworthiness of the government and the Prime Minister if the Prime Minister failed to take such a course. I hope that those people who, with me, feel very deeply for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> will bear these things in mind. The question which arises now, according to the Opposition and the media, is why the Prime Minister and other Ministers, if they knew in April or on some earlier date what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had done, did not act on the information at the time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> as you probably know, I had some difficulty recalling with precision what happened on particular dates, or what I learned about particular matters and when. If I inadvertently misled anyone in regard to these matters, I apologise. </para>
          <para>The question now directed at me is why, if I learned in April of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> phone call to the Chief Electoral Officer, I did not immediately react as some people are saying now I should have reacted. The Prime Minister has told the House that he first became aware of this matter of a phone call on 16 April. To the best of my recollection I became aware of it the next day. I have to say, quite frankly, that when I learnt of this matter, apparently on 17 April, I was not seized with a sense of outrage, a feeling that something sinister or improper had occurred or a belief that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had done something which demanded immediate action on the part of the Prime Minister. Perhaps I should have experienced these feelings. Perhaps it is true to say, to borrow some words from an editorial in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> that a judge's conception of propriety is rather stricter than that of the average politician; but the fact is that I did not react as some people now tell me I should have reacted. </para>
          <para>On 23 April the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> said that he did not see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> actions as contravening the Electoral </para>
          <para class="block">Act, and of course the Royal Commission confirmed that view. But because the information was relevant to the inquiries about the Minister for Finance Ministers decided on 23 April that it should be made available to the Royal Commission. This decision was made one week after the Prime Minister first became aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> ' phone call. In that week the Prime Minister was in Japan. To suggest in these circumstances that there had been a cover-up is clearly nonsense. The fact now is that the Royal Commission has found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> acted with impropriety not because of what he did but because of the purpose with which he did it. That is the finding from which there is no escape. Many people who discovered after the event that they had some wisdom about the matter are now asking why we were not sensitive enough at the time to recognise the significance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> action. As I have indicated recently, I did not see any great significance in the electorate name from the point of view of my party. As the  chairman  of my party in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sparkes,</inline> said to the Royal Commission, while it was possible the party might have stood a candidate in the electorate such a decision was improbable. He pointed out that there would have been some reaction at the electorate level from people wanting the party to contest the seat but that our normal understanding is not to oppose ministerial colleagues. </para>
          <para>In summary, the following points should be made: The Government set up a Royal Commission to investigate serious allegations about an electoral redistribution as it related to the electorate of McPherson. This was seen by the Government as the most satisfactory way of dealing with this matter. A royal commission provided for an examination at the highest level. As soon as it was established the royal commission was advised of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> contact with the Chief Electoral Officer and of the message that was conveyed to the distribution commissioners as a result of that contact. There was no evasion or cover-up on the part of the Government. The terms of reference of the Royal Commission were widened twice to ensure that relevant matters could be examined and findings made. As we know, the most important findings were that there was no breach of the law or impropriety in regard to the redistribution in Queensland in 1977 involving the Minister for Finance, the distribution commissioners or the Chief Electoral Officer. But the Royal Commission also found that an action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> constituted impropriety. Those were the findings, and the Government accepted them. </para>
          <para>What then was the Government to do? The Prime Minister could not flinch from the resolution of the issue. There was no room for expediency. The principle was clear cut. The Prime Minister and the Government had either to accept the findings of the Royal Commission and act as such acceptance demanded or to walk away from the high principles of government which the Prime Minister has steadfastly demanded and achieved. All of us on this side of the House are saddened by the consequences which had to flow from acceptance of the Royal Commission's findings, but there can be no doubt whatever that the Government's decision is in the best interests of the good government of Australia. I believe that the Australian people accepted the decision because it was the right decision. Above all else the people of this country want to see integrity in their leaders. They want to have confidence in their Prime Minister and their Government. Any decision other than that taken by the Government quite rightly would have created doubts about the integrity of the Government. </para>
          <para>I believe that the statement made by the Prime Minister today and the decisions and actions taken by the Government clear up this matter once and for all and that there should be no doubts at all in the minds of the Australian public, although I know that we will never convince some people in this House. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to continue to raise this matter day after day he will show his gross ignorance and futility. </para>

            <para>- The excuse given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> is not accepted by the Opposition and could not be accepted by the people of Australia. The one excuse given is that the Prime Minister has no recollection of the matter. Can we trust the prime ministership of this nation to a person who suffers so much from lack of memory? Let us bear in mind the deceit and deception practised by this Government today. The Prime Minister read from a prepared statement of which he gave the Opposition no notice at all, let alone the usual two hours notice. The speech made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister, which was also a prepared speech, was read out on the basis that members of the Government knew beforehand what they were going to say. We should give credence to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said in a briefing would be said. He pointed out that if the Prime Minister were to disown the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> that would amount to saying that the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Minister for Finance was guilty of perjury; and, as to what the Prime Minister would say, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said that the Prime Minister would say that he had no memory of the 17 January conversation. It was remarkable perception on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> that he could give out that information 10 days before we heard it in this House. Ignorance is no excuse. Failure of recollection is no excuse. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the evidence given to the Royal Commission by Government people. The Chief Electoral Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> was extremely concerned by what he read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> He read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> something that he knew was a deception. He knew that it was appropriate and proper that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and others should be telling the chief law officers what had occurred in the conversations that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had had. Obviously we would not have had any idea of what transpired but for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson.</inline> Being an honourable man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> was convinced that he should tell the truth about his conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman</inline> as a result of which in the Queensland redistribution the name of the proposed electorate of Gold Coast was changed to McPherson. </para>
          <para>The change had the utmost political significance. If the name had been changed from McPherson to Gold Coast the National Country Party would have been allowed to contest the seat. We must bear in mind that the Minister for Finance had won the seat from the National Country Party some years ago and that Party was very anxious to get it back. The appropriate message was given to this House by the honourable member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> when he indicated clearly that it was a matter of the utmost political significance that by changing the name of a seat in Queensland a threecornered contest would have been invited. That is what this matter was all about. Do honourable members believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> a senator from Western Australia, on his own initiative would suddenly take a keen interest in the changing of the name of a Queensland electorate? That would have been done because he was prompted to do it on the basis that unless it was done the Minister for Finance would face a contest with the National Country Party which was anxious to get the seat back. </para>
          <para>What is the evidence given to the Royal Commission by the Minister for Finance? As recorded on page 1687 of the transcript of evidence, in answer to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gleeson</inline> about a meeting in the Prime Minister's office he said that he could not be specific about the date but would make it clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had raised the matter with the Prime Minister three times in his presence. He said that he thought one occasion was the day before 18 January, because that was the day of the Cabinet meeting, and that there were two other occasions after that. The Minister for Finance said that the matter was raised three times, and the Prime Minister has said that he has no recollection! Can we honestly believe that? Is that the truth that the Australian people will swallow? We come to the position that if the Prime Minister knew on 1 7 January that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had acted improperly it was his duty to sack <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> on that day. There has to have been a cover-up because no action was taken. A further complication arises when one looks at the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> What did he say to the Royal Commission? He said that a number of meetings were held. As far as he was aware the matter was certainly raised in January and it was raised with the Prime Minister. But the Prime Minister still has no recollection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">Six or seven meetings were held but the Prime Minister still cannot recollect it. This is the point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> was asked about who was present at those meetings. He replied that a group of Ministers were at The Lodge and the change of name was taken up following what had been disclosed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson.</inline> If these six or seven meetings were held at The Lodge, surely the Prime Minister cannot say that he has no recollection of them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> was then asked who was at one of those meetings. He replied that the Prime Minister was there, the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> was there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> was there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> was there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> was there and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> was thereand I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson</inline> was there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> is the Attorney-General. </para>
          <para>This is the point; there had been a number of meetings at The Lodge and at the Prime Minister's office from about 1 9 January onwards. They seemed to be occurring almost weekly. Are we to accept the statement given today that the Prime Minister knew nothing of this matter? Nobody could possibly believe that to be the true situation. Nobody could accept it as being the truth. It is fundamental to democracy in this country that we should be able to say to the people of Australia that we have fair distributions, that everything is honest and above board and that we guarantee that our electoral commissioners are not subject to any influence. The Electoral </para>

          <para>I remind honourable members to look at the advice given to the Prime Minister by the Solicitor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byers,</inline> and the Attorney-General, who seems to be under a cloud because of the evidence that has been given to the Royal Commission. That advice makes it very clear that the matter involved section 22 of the Electoral Act. That section prevents any unsolicited tender, outside the procedures pf the Act, designed to influence the determination of the Commissioners in the performance of their duties. An unsolicited tender of information was made through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson.</inline> The advice continued: </para>

            <para>Although it may be difficult to say that the offence-creating provisions such as section 1 70 apply to section 22 of the Act, we do not doubt that a breach of the section is likely to give rise to criminal liability . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is not a matter for a court of petty sessions in which one can plead guilty and hope to be let off on a bond. Influencing electoral commissioners for political advantage is the basic point to consider. If the Prime Minister is a man of honour, he would be able to say: 'I knew about this matter in January but I made a mistake; I should have taken action then but I did not'. But he came in here today and said: 'Look, I knew nothing about it'. That is the easiest way out. I do not know what the other Ministers are going to say. Have the six or seven other ministers had lapses of memory too? Did they know nothing about the matter? What about the Attorney-General who knew about the matter and apparently did not advert to it in his advice to the Prime Minister? It was left to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> to tell the Commission on 15 May about the conversation. When he did so other people suddenly had to come clean. </para>
          <para>Let us go back to the terms of reference for the Commission which the Prime Minister said were so wide in the first instance. Normally they would have encompassed the matters that related to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> but they did not do that at all. They were drawn up by, among others, the Attorney-General who had full knowledge of the conversation that had taken place between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson.</inline> They were drawn up in such a fashion that they were aimed solely at the Minister for Finance. He was the one person mentioned in those terms of reference. The terms of reference were: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>anything said or action taken by or on behalf the Honourable Eric Robinson; </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That is the position. In no way were the terms of reference going to encompass <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> They were aimed at the Minister for Finance, perhaps because it could be thought that the evidence would be covered on the basis that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> would not tell the whole truth about that conversation. That is the fundamental error of the statement made today. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> told the truth about what happened. We in the Opposition say, and the people of Australia should know, that Ministers, including the Prime Minister, were all involved in this conspiracy to cover up, to gain political advantage from a change of electorate name, and they tried to make out that it was innocuous. It was not innocuous in Queensland. The Commissioner has found that it is a matter of the utmost political significance. The  Deputy  Prime Minister adverted to the evidence given by the National Country Party. It made it very clear that it was very unhappy with the Liberal Party in Queensland. It was very upset that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Small,</inline> the Country Party candidate, had been opposed and defeated in the election. Background evidence was presented as to what was wrong if the name of Gold Coast was to remain. It would have meant that a Minister of the present Government could have been in jeopardy in a contest. That is why influence was exerted. </para>
          <para>One other most disquieting matter ought to be looked at by any responsible government but it will not be looked at by this Government. I refer to the reference by the Royal Commissioner to an exhibit which is called a 'political analysis'. The political analysis originated in the office of the Minister for Administrative Services and, by his direction, was forwarded to the commissioners in Queensland before they finished their deliberations. Could there be anything more scandalous or more criminal in its content than that sort of action? It was called Exhibit AAH. On the front of the exhibit are the following words: </para>

          <para class="block">It was signed 'R. G. Withers'. The political analysis was given to the commissioners to show how the distribution was really going to assist the Government. There was no need to worry about it. The conclusions in the document state: </para>

There is, however, the possibility, albeit unlikely, that the N.P. rather than the L.P. might win McPherson. </para>
            <para>Given the creation of an additional safe . . . seat (Gold Coast) and the slightly improved position of the L.N.P., in the metropolitan area, it appears that the redistribution favours the coalition parties as against the A.L.P. </para>

          <para class="block">What about honest government? That was sent by the Minister who deserved to be sacked on the first count and who should never be returned to office on this count because of the political analysis given to the commissioners showing what they were doing to favour the Government. People expect commissioners to be above any influence. The Electoral Act guarantees that they should be away from any such influence and the Royal Commissioner himself was not at all impressed with this sort of evidence. The political analysis showed that a redistribution would be less safe or safer for a government. How in the name of fortune could this evidence be given to a commission? The Royal Commissioner said: </para>

          <para class="block">That statement shows the insidious influence of this Government over the whole Queensland redistribution. If it was not so scandalous, it would be laughable to think that the Government of Australia can say in here today: 'Look, something might have gone wrong. There might have been a criminal act but the Prime Minister has no memory of it. ' But other Ministers were at the meetings. We have the evidence of Robinson and Withers in the witness box that they had clearly discussed this matter at six or seven meetings over a period of months and that day in and day out they were saying: 'Look, what are we going to do about this matter? We have obviously to face up to the fact that a telephone call went through to the Commissioners and that as a result of that the name was changed'. It is just not an innocent matter. It is a matter of the Government being guilty of the vilest corruption, using political influence to get the best results possible for a party in Queensland. The Government got those results. It was left to a back bencher- the honourable member for Fadden, who was sacked from the position of  Deputy  Government Whip some time ago- to raise again the matter of why the truth was subverted. The honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> says it was a dishonest redistribution and he was right. It was left to two men on the Government back bench to try to raise this matter. </para>

          <para class="block">After hearing what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has had to say it is not difficult to see why. The Opposition is totally unable to understand simple facts even when they are presented in the clearest terms. The Leader of the Opposition has disregarded them. I might say that he has been in the Australian Labor Party for too long. It has affected his thinking. He sees everything in the same light as the rest of the Labor Party. They see conspiracies at every corner, cover-ups at every turn. It is part of their political way of life. It is no wonder, knowing their recent history. I will come back to that in a few moments. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has set out the key events leading up to the establishment of the Royal Commission. These facts are clear. It is sad that the Leader of the Opposition is unable to grasp what has in fact been put forward by the Prime Minister. To help the Opposition I shall run through the essential facts again. On 2 1 December of last year the honourable member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> made certain allegations about the Queensland redistribution. On 17 January the Prime Minister discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> and the former Minister for Administrative Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> whose portfolio encompassed the Australian Electoral Office. On 1 8 January the Prime Minister, the former Minister for Administrative Services and the Minister for Finance met the honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull)</inline> in Canberra to discuss the allegations. Following that meeting the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> and the Solicitor-General were asked to examine the complaints of those honourable members. On 9 February the law officers reported. They stated that in their opinion the matters complained of neither required nor warranted government action. On 7 April the honourable member for Fadden again referred to his allegations. On the same day the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> tabled the reports from the law officers. </para>
          <para>Allegations had been made in the House, the Government had the matter investigated by the most senior law officers of the Crown and the law officers had reported. Their advice was tabled the same day as the allegations were made. The honourable member for Fadden, in his speech on 7 April, referred to some new evidence- some statutory declarations. On 10 April it was decided that this additional material should be submitted to the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General for further advice. On 16 April the Attorney-General told the Prime Minister about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> telephone conversations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> the Chief Electoral Officer. This was the first time the Prime Minister became aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had played a part in the change of names. The Opposition is now endeavouring to assert that the Prime Minister knew about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> involvement at some earlier time. </para>
          <para>No one on this side of the House who knows the Prime Minister has any doubt whatsoever about the Prime Minister's total integrity and propriety at these meetings. If the Prime Minister had been aware, he would have immediately informed the law officers. It is a nonsense to suggest otherwise. His fundamental concern for propriety has been shown time and time again. The facts of this case show that as soon as the Prime Minister became aware on 16 April immediate steps were taken to ensure that the law officers were asked to take that into account in their report. That was the proper course and that was the course that was taken. </para>
          <para>On 23 April there was a meeting at The Lodge of a number of senior Ministers. It was agreed then that a full public inquiry- a royal commission- should be established. The next day the Royal Commission was appointed. The letters patent specifically referred to the change of name of the electorate and details of the telephone conversations between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and the  chairman  of the distribution commissioners were made available by the Attorney-General. When the honourable member for Fadden made further allegations on 4 May about uranium the Royal Commissioner's terms of reference were widened to cover them. Following the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> statement on 26 May that he might have misled the Senate, Cabinet decided to have the Royal Commissioner's terms of reference widened again so that all allegations might be fully heard and determined. </para>
          <para>Where is this asserted cover-up? The plain fact is that there is not one. It never existed. It is a myth. It is a figment of the Opposition's fevered imagination. The truth is that the Opposition is in a fix and it knows it. Its members do not want to work on devising new policies because that is too hard for them. They have not produced a single new policy this year. The Opposition claims that there has been a cover-up. Too right there has been a cover-up! All this year members of the Opposition have been trying to cover up their failure to produce a single constructive idea to put before the Australian people. They have been trying to cover up their total inability to come to grips with all of the basic issues confronting the working men and women of Australia. The Labor Party knows it is in real trouble and so do honourable gentlemen opposite. They do not know what they stand for. The Government is saying that the posturing by the Opposition is a matter of complete and utter hypocrisy. </para>
          <para>Let us examine the manner in which the present Government has approached this matter. Throughout all aspects of this matter the Government has consistently sought to get the truth. When allegations were first raised the two most senior law officers of the Crown were asked to investigate. The matter was referred to in the House and their reports were tabled. When further material was brought forward it was again referred to the law officers for their advice. When the Prime Minister became aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> the law officers were asked to include that in their report. When the report was received the Royal Commission was established and positive steps were taken to ensure that evidence about the telephone calls was put before the Commission so that the facts could come out. When it became apparent that the terms of reference should be widened, this was done. There was no attempt to cover up. At all times in this matter the Government has acted as it should have acted. I believe that the Opposition has learned to its cost that this Government is one of the strongest and most united governments that Australia has had for many years. The Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> have led the coalition parties to the two most massive electoral victories in Australia 's history. I want to put beyond doubt that the coalition team stands squarely behind the Prime Minister and his Ministry. </para>
          <para>The tactics of the Opposition in this debate are clear. They are to forget about the real issues confronting Australia and forget about developing alternative policies and to concentrate instead upon the peripheral issues, the trumped up allegations, the smears and the innuendoes. The Opposition recognises, just as the people of Australia recognised last December, that this Government's policies are succeeding in pulling the country out of the economic quagmire into which the Labor Party dragged it. But members of the Opposition, for their part, want to distract public attention from this Government's solid record of achievement on the economic front. The Opposition's approach, of course, is completely negative and it has been shown by the people to be completely negative. That is not surprising given the leadership that the Opposition has at the present time. The Opposition should have learned during its period in government. The truth, of course, is that the Opposition's leader is a leader in name only and no one would follow him except out of a misguided sense of curiosity. </para>
          <para>All honourable members on this side of the House representing the Liberal and National Country parties have been completely appalled by the manner in which the Opposition has sought to distort the findings of the Royal Commission. There has been a royal commission. The findings have been handed down. Honourable members on this side of the House have lost an experienced and most valued colleague. As the Prime Minister has indicated, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has a fine record as a Minister. He was an exceptionally able leader in the Senate where his affability and unflappable nature, which are his hallmark, did much to serve the national Parliament.  His  advice and counsel will be very much missed around the Cabinet table and will be missed by me. At the same time, we are delighted that every single allegation made against the Minister for Finance has been found to be totally without foundation. We welcome him back to the front bench. </para>
          <para>The Australian Parliament rightly demands the highest standards in the conduct of its national affairs. Those standards are fundamental to our parliamentary system. The guardianship of the public trust is a responsibility which this Government takes most seriously. </para>

              <para>- The Government's stand in relation to this Royal Commission, as the honourable member well knows, has been endorsed very strongly by newspaper and editorial comment throughout the country. This Government and this Prime Minister have shown their basic and fundamental concern for propriety. The actions which the Prime Minister took had the full support of the Liberal and National Country parties. I believe that the Australian public is sick and tired of the Labor Party's peripheral politics. We reject the distortions, the smears and the innuendoes which have been put forward in this debate. I believe that members of the Australian public outside the Parliament are saying that it is time to get on with the job. The Budget which will be brought down tonight by my colleague the Federal Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> will represent a further major and most significant step on the path to economic recovery. This Government, in fact, was elected to beat inflation. It was re-elected because it was beating inflation. The Budget will continue that process. This Budget will be a direct response to the mandate which has been given to us in two elections. Honourable members on this side of the House want to get on with the job. We intend to get on with the job and we reject decisively the smears, distortions and innuendoes which the Opposition has sought to put forward. </para>

          <para class="block">Parliament. Among the other things that have occurred today, it is nice to see that the  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia has been resurrected. This is the first major debate in which he has been allowed to speak since he was doing more tricks with the loopholes in the tax system in Australia than a monkey would do on a yard of rope. We have the  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal Party back in the fray, telling us how he supports his leader. It is absolutely amazing. We can expect to see a bit more of this because honourable members on this side of the House do not expect that the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> will be in that position for very much longer. </para>

I will keep my remarks within the confines of the subject matter of the debate. I take the point that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> made with our leader about what he had to say. But these words actually appear in the speech made by the Prime Minister of Australia. He stated: </para>

          <para class="block">The Prime Minister of Australia is telling us that he is to be forgiven because he cannot remember the matter being discussed in his presence. I remind the Prime Minister that on 27 November 1975 he said: 'We will maintain Medibank'. Are we to forgive him because his memory does not serve him correctly and now he forgets about that promise? What absolute nonsense it is for Government members to tell us in the Parliament today that the matter is all finished, that the Royal Commission has cleared the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson),</inline> has found the former Minister for Administrative Services guilty of impropriety and that that is the end of the matter. As I said, what an agonising event this has been for the Government. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> raised the issue and on three occasions in this Parliament the Government gagged the Opposition when it wanted to debate the matter. As I said previously, this matter was not initiated by the Opposition. It was initiated by the honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull).</inline> Colleagues of honourable members on the Government side, including the </para>
          <para class="block">Minister for Finance, initiated this investigation. But on every occasion that we requested some parliamentary debate on the matter and on every occasion that we wanted this issue to be discussed, in came the heavy boots of the Government with its vast majority. It said that the Parliament could not deal with this matter. Now it comes to light why we could not deal with the matter. It is convenient for the Prime Minister to say that he does not remember. I wish we all had that privilege. If only every member in the House of Representatives could say to his constituents: It might have been a mistake; I am sorry, I do not remember doing it'. I wonder whether the Prime Minister could bestow that privilege on every member of the national Parliament. I wonder whether this will be the guiding light for all Government Ministers when they make a mistake. I wonder whether the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> now does not remember saying to the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island: 'The Federal Government will step in to save you from the Queensland Government'. Is this going to be the practice? Is this going to be the standard for a government which presumed to take office in 1975 to bring integrity back into government in Australia? What an absolute sham this is. Now we have the  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> after eight months on the sideline as the nineteenth man, coming back into the Parliament to tell us about what he will do and about the people of Australia wanting us to talk about the real issues. This matter has been orchestrated absolutely beautifully by the Government. In reply to questions the Prime Minister said today: 'I will make a statement. I will not say anything at this stage'. The procedures and the decency of this House demand that the Opposition be given two hours' notice of any ministerial statement to be made by the Government. But on this occasion no statement is issued and no notice is given. No one is notified of the position. The Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> does not come near Opposition members to say what will happen. We have the Prime Minister saying, 'I refuse to answer questions on this matter'. But when honourable members on this side of the House pressurise the Prime Minister to say something about the matter, all of a sudden the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> who recently returned from Manila after making several thousand phone calls to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> come into the House with prepared speeches. I ask honourable members: Is it not amazing that the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister should have prepared speeches in their pockets on the off-chance that they might have to make speeches about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and the Royal Commission into the electoral redistribution in Queensland? Why is it done today? No one has to ask the question twice. There are no prizes for guessing why the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister, acting as decently as they always do, have prepared speeches in their hands without giving notification to the Opposition. They are hoping that tomorrow the people of Australia will be talking about the extra 10c that it will cost to buy a packet of cigarettes or about the price of whisky or petrol or whatever else will be done tonight to try to damage the economy even further. They do not want the Royal Commission into the Queensland electoral redistribution mentioned by the public in Australia tomorrow. They do not want this matter to carry on because it threatens the Government more than has any other issue since the Government came to power at the end of 1 975. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister say: 'We have meetings of Ministers on several occasions'. The Ministers they are getting together are those who agree to carry out the directions of the Prime Minister. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> is left out, the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> is left out, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> is left out. The Prime Minister gets his few friends together to carry out his directions. The meeting of Ministers just adds to the conspiracy charge which is made against this Government. People on the government benches- led by a number of senators- ask what is so serious about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> ringing the Chief Electoral Officer. It is only that the chief judicial officer in the land says that it is a criminal act. That is what is so serious about it. Trying to influence the electoral commissioners is what is so serious about it. But that is not the only point. The  Deputy  Prime Minister says: 'It is not serious because I have just had a chat to our mate in the Country Party in Queensland and we would not have stood against Eric Robinson'. One has to be joking to believe the Country Party. The honourable member for McPherson has been at war with the Country Party for 20 years, but the  Deputy  Prime Minister expects the national Parliament to believe that sort of claptrap. The  Deputy  Prime Minister says: 'It is not serious because we were not going to stand for the seat, irrespective of what it was called'. That is not Queensland politics. The  Deputy  Prime Minister knows it and certainly the honourable member for McPherson knows it. That is why action was taken. </para>
          <para class="block">It is completely unsatisfactory. Who is going to  accept that because the Prime Minister has a bad memory everything is clear? These people of such integrity who flew Khemlani out to Australia, went through his briefcases and booked him into the Lakeside Hotel, these people who act with such decency, these people like the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party who tell us now that the Australians want them to get on with the job, do not have answers to the questions. It is not the end of the matter. The Government has brought on this matter today and hopes that it will be submerged as a result of tonight's Budget. I completely agree with that. The Budget will be of enormous importance to the Australian people, but the Government cannot get out of this matter because it has raised the matter today and because it has orchestrated the matter in such a way. </para>
          <para>Let us examine the background briefing given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> after his dismissal because it tells us a great deal about this rotten Government. It tells us about the relationships between Ministers and about the sort of trust that honourable members opposite have in this Prime Minister whom they are defending today. Apparently background briefings will tell us what is occurring in the Government; official statements, handouts and parliamentary speeches do not do so.

The meeting that took place in the Prime Minister's office was not so much a meeting as an instruction from the Godfather to the honourable member for Fadden that he was not to proceed. The Prime Minister found the honourable member for Fadden guilty without a trial. The honourable member for Fadden raised a complaint about what had happened in Queensland and he was dismissed from his position in this Parliament without a trial. </para>
          <para>That is the sort of action that was taken by the Prime Minister to clam up this matter. It was not to get out into the Parliament and it was not to get out into the public. Well, it is out in the public and it is in the Parliament. We have a responsibility to see that it continues to be raised until we have a full explanation. We on this side of the House, together with many people opposite will not accept it. Even some of the people opposite who are not being bribed about going into the Ministry, which is old hat, will not accept it. We will not be bribed on the basis that the Prime Minister cannot remember what happened. Is not that convenient? Is not that beautiful? Can honourable members imagine the Prime Minister of Australia talking to an international forum and saying: 'I am sorry we went into Vietnam. I forgot we went there. It is terrible. I am sorry I said that we would maintain Medibank. I forgot I said it. I am sorry I said that under the Liberals everybody would have a job. I did not mean to say it; I forgot that I said it'. </para>
          <para>Here is the Prime Minister expecting 124 of the most seasoned political people in this country to accept that he does not remember and that clears his name. Sacco and Vanzetti would wish they had the Prime Minister representing them. It is not accepted by this side of the House. This is not the end of the matter. It will not end until we have an explanation from the person who leads this Government as to his role in the cover-up of the electoral redistribution in Queensland, about what he was doing, what he said and what in fact, in truth, he recollects. </para>

            <para>- The public could be excused for wondering what on earth it is that the Opposition is trying to do in this debate and what point it is trying to make. It has harped upon the matter of a suggested cover-up when in fact we have had a complete royal commission; a most exhaustive inquiry by an honourable and reputable judge. He heard all the evidence that was available to him or could be sought by him. In listening to Opposition members one could pick out perhaps only one or two matters which they dwelt upon. If, as was said by one honourable member opposite, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> involvement in the change of name of the electorate of McPherson became known only by the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> in revealing it to the Solicitor-General then all the facts as presented to Parliament and which are Government made sure that the terms of reference of the Royal Commission which it had decided to hold were wide enough to encompass those facts revealed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and confirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> If, as was said by the Opposition, there was political advantage in the change of name then, indeed, that is what the Royal Commissioner found. He found that there was political advantage. It was from that finding of the Royal Commissioner that flowed the finding of impropriety by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I should like to recapitulate some of the history of this matter and when I have done so it will show the public that there cannot be any substance whatsoever in the allegation of a cover-up. On 18 January at the request of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> the honourable member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron),</inline> the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull)</inline> and the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns),</inline> in company with the honourable member for McPherson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> discussed the allegations of the honourable member for Fadden. Having heard those allegations, the Prime Minister was determined to expose all the facts known to him to the Solicitor-General and to the Attorney-General for their report. That report was in two parts. There was a report dated 9 February and, after further discussion of other matters with the honourable member for Fadden, there was another short report dated 1 5 February. In their joint report the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> were firm in their conclusion that, on the basis of the accusations made by the honourable member for Fadden against the Minister for Finance and on the basis of the known facts, there was no impropriety on the part of the Minister for Finance. The report of the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General was incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 10 April at the request of the honourable member for Port Adelaide so no doubt he has had an opportunity to read it and understand it, aware of the fundamental point that the accusations were being made against the Minister for Finance. </para>
          <para>There was then a hiatus and the matter did not arise again until 7 April when the honourable member for Fadden made a statement in this House. The joint report of the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General was tabled that day. In other words, there was immediate disclosure by the Government of what had happened from the time when these allegations against the Minister for Finance first surfaced. On 1 1 April <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> upon reading in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the report of the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General, referred his involvement to the Solicitor-General. One can understand the anxiety of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> in making it known. This was the first time that the matter had come to the knowledge of the Attorney-General who promptly reported it to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister immediately reported it to his senior Ministers because, as the Prime Minister said in his statement, both he and the Attorney-General were concerned about the relevance of that fact to the accusations against the Minister for Finance. </para>
          <para>The House will recall that the Prime Minister immediately went to Japan and was there for the week. While he was there he indicated to the Acting Prime Minister that there should be a report for him when he returned. The Prime Minister returned either on late Saturday afternoon or early Sunday, 23 April and that evening called his senior Ministers together to receive the advice of the law officers of the Crown, the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General. That advice was given in a joint letter by the two law officers and I think it would be of advantage to the House if I read that letter. It reads: </para>

          <para class="block">I emphasise the last paragraph: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is our view that further investigation is required. The investigation would need to establish the correctness of conflicting allegations and is therefore of a nature we are unable to undertake. Whilst it is our view that the form any investigation should assume is a matter for the Government to determine, we consider that a judicial inquiry would be preferable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Acting promptly on that report, the Ministers and the Prime Minister decided that a royal commission was the only way to conduct a judical inquiry. Thereupon a royal commission was set up and, upon the advice of the law officers, its terms of reference were deliberately drawn so as to be wide enough to ensure that the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> would be available to the royal commission. That is a point to be emphasised. It is a point not understood by the Opposition but I am quite sure that it is a point which the public well understands. </para>
          <para>As we know, both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> gave evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> on 1 5 May and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> on 22 May. Prior to that there had been an extension of the terms of reference to cover further allegations regarding statements alleged to have been made by the Minister for Finance about uranium. I remind the House that on 1 1 May the Attorney-General wrote to the royal commissioner saying that the Government was willing to extend the terms of reference if the royal commissioner thought at any time that that would be appropriate by reason of any evidence or material which came before him. That is another example of how at all points along this road of events the Government was concerned to see that every opportunity was open to the royal commissioner to have before him all material and evidence bearing upon allegations which, at that time, had been made against the Minister for Finance only. As the Prime Minister's statement shows, on 26 May <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> answered a question in the Senate concerning a statement he had made on 4 November 1977. On 28 May there was a meeting of Ministers to consider the evidence which had been given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> statement in the Senate. Resulting from that meeting was a decision to widen further the terms of reference so as to encompass all allegations of illegality or impropriety against any person, whether that person was a Minister of the Crown, a public servant or any other person who might be implicated, so that all allegations could be fully heard and determined. That, I emphasise, is not the action of a government seeking to cover up but the action of a government seeking to expose to the rigour of a royal commission all the known evidence and material, that is, everything known to the Government. I think that needs no repetition. The facts speak for themselves. </para>
          <para>If there is one thing that the Opposition needs to remember it is that the currency of the coin of accusation by it is quickly debased by the frequency with which it makes those accusations on baseless grounds. The Opposition may go on day after day, week after week, making its accusations and repeating the same things but always the facts, as disclosed to this Parliament, will be available to show that the accusations are baseless. If that is what the Opposition wishes to do it should not hesitate to do it because the Government can always answer the accusations emphatically, categorically and absolutely. </para>
          <para>I think we have already had an indication today, if I heard the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> correctly, of the lengths to which the Opposition is prepared to go in making accusations against not only the Government but anybody. I was disturbed to hear, and I think I heard it correctly, the Leader of the Opposition make a veiled attack on the credibility and the integrity of the royal commissioner, a distinguished Queen's Counsel at the Sydney Bar and a distinguished judge, when he suggested that  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> McGregor could be bought. </para>

              <para>- I say again, having listened to the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> and the honourable member for Port Adelaide: What were they trying to get at? It is a question that we on this side of the House will ask ourselves again and again, a question that the public will ask again and again. Nothing that has been said today has revealed what they are trying to get at. The public could be excused for wondering just what the Opposition thinks it is doing. As I have said, nothing that has been said in this debate has shown any grounds for attacking any of the actions of the Government or of the Prime Minister in particular in instituting the Royal Commission and in twice widening its terms of reference to ensure that all evidence and all material was before the Royal Commissioner and that he was in a position to make all necessary findings against any person as to illegality or impropriety. Once the Royal Commissioner had completed his job and brought down his report and it was made available to the Government, the Opposition does not deny that the Government acted properly on the report. It does not deny that the Government was bound to accept the findings of the Royal Commissioner and to act in the way in which it did, with the consequences which most regrettably had to fall upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline></para>

            <para>-In speaking to this matter I want to deal in two ways with the statement made to the House. Firstly, the Opposition is dissatisfied because the statement made to the House by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> is a totally inadequate, totally dishonest presentation of the facts of this case, and I will illustrate that substantively later on in my argument. Secondly, there is the matter of the Prime Minister's behaviour. He was asked question after question during Question Time today and he refused to give any answers to the House. It was only on the initiative of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> that the Prime Minister eventually chose to make a statement. I say that the behaviour and the evasiveness of the Prime Minister during Question Time was typical of his behaviour right throughout this sorry matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me deal with the statement of the Prime Minister, his own statement, his own record. He informed the House that this matter was first raised on 21 December by the honourable member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron).</inline> It was then a matter for discussion on 17 January, although not by the honourable member for Fadden. The first three Ministers who were involved in considering the political and other implications of this matter were the Prime Minister himself, the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> and the then Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> Obviously at that stage the Prime Minister must have thought that there was some seriousness in the allegations, that it was a matter of concern, because a meeting was then held, not in the office of the Minister for Administrative Services, not in the office of the Minister for Finance, but in the </para>
          <para class="block">Prime Minister's office. As a responsible political leader he called in all the relevant parties because present at that meeting were the honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull).</inline> One may well ask: Was this an exercise by the Prime Minister in order to glean the truth? Was it an exercise by a political leader trying to produce calm within his own party? Or was it the action of a Prime Minister who was concerned to ensure that none of these allegations saw the light of day? </para>
          <para>I ask the House to consider the Prime Minister's own statement. He called a meeting of all the principal persons concerned. The matter was raised by the honourable member for Fadden, who was then the  Deputy  Government Whip. To use the Prime Minister's own words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline>had a lengthy document which he showed me briefly about his allegations. He did not leave a copy with me . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Here was a serious allegation which goes ultimately to the whole nature of the electoral structure upon which the parliamentary system depends. Here was a  Deputy  Whip who had a substantive document and the Prime Minister was trying to get to the truth of the matter. However, in the Prime Minister's own words, although the honourable member for Fadden had a lengthy document he did not leave a copy of it with the Prime Minister. Is that not an extraordinary state of affairs? Is it not likely that the Prime Minister would have said to the honourable member: Give my a copy of your document. I will have it photostated so that we can explore the detail of it'. Would not the Prime Minister have said that? Of course he would have, but nowhere does that statement appear. What we have is a very glib statement by the Prime Minister that the honourable member for Fadden had a document but the Prime Minister never actually saw the contents of it and the honourable member walked away with it. I will deal with the importance of that later on. </para>
          <para>The next relevant date is one that is not mentioned in the statement. It was significant for the honourable member for Fadden because on that date his services as  Deputy  Government Whip were summarily terminated. Those of us in the Parliament who had been impressed by the vigour of this young  Deputy  Whip were left pondering. How could it be that such a dutiful servant of the Government could be sacked without as much as a smile from the Prime Minister? There would be some who are cynical enough to suggest that when the honourable member for </para>
          <para class="block">Fadden would not back away from his allegations and desist from them the Prime Minister used his ever-trusty knife. Either the honourable member for Fadden had to toe the line in terms of party loyalty or he would lose his job. It was the actions of the honourable member for Fadden that produced this Royal Commission of Inquiry, not the Prime Minister's love of justice or his desire to see that the truth came out. The inquiry was brought about by the honourable member for Fadden and he has paid dearly for his position. He is even referred to by the Prime Minister in his statement as 'the present member for Fadden'. Obviously some things are going to happen in the future to that unfortunate gentleman. </para>
          <para>Turning again to the Prime Minister's statement, he refers to 'the best of his belief. The Prime Minister has these strange lapses of memory. He cannot recall details. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> was one of the first Ministers who discussed this matter with the Prime Minister at the very first meeting that was held but he cannot recall <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> involvement in the matter. I should have thought he would recall a phone call from someone as experienced as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> a man who knows how the political machine operates and how the numbers operate. The Prime Minister knows the significance of a phone call to an electoral commissioner. Yet what we are asked to believe is that either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> forgot to tell the Prime Minister or that, if the Prime Minister was told, he forgot all about it. I do not believe that. No honourable member of this House believes it. I venture to suggest that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> being a man of some integrity and capacity, do not believe it either. </para>
          <para>When does the Prime Minister say that he recovered from this temporary amnesia? According to his statement, he believes that the first occasion on which this matter was drawn to his attention was 16 April. Accept that as the Prime Minister's statement. If that were so and he knew about the extent and the depth of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> involvement, why were the terms of the inquiry so narrowly fixed that in order for the Royal Commissioner to glean the truth of the Withers' involvement ultimately the terms of the inquiry had to be extended further on 30 May? The Prime Minister glibly says about that: 'Oh well, we were acting on legal advice'. But it is quite appropriate for a government or a Prime Minister or Minister, if he is acting on legal advice, to table the documents and to make them available. What is so secret about them? If, as we are told, the Prime Minister was acting on the best legal advice available to him, why were the documents not tabled as an integral part of the Prime Minister's statement? The highest level at which one could put the Prime Minister's statement on his own terms was that he did know on 16 April but that at that date he was not concerned to make the matter either specifically or generally a term of reference of the inquiry. Why? He says: 'Because we were really concerned about what Robinson was up to. Although we had known that Withers had been on the telephone, we did not want to give that any undue reference. We were really thinking about Robinson'. I do not believe that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> and I do not believe that any person who looks objectively at the evidence in this case believes it. That is the best the Government can do in this matter. It is a serious matter and it may well come to the question of the privileges of the Senate. </para>
          <para>I turn to the statement which has already been quoted in this House of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oakes,</inline> a reputable journalist. Any journalist can misquote a statement or get a fact wrong, but does anybody in this House believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oakes</inline> would invent a story concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers?</inline> Does anybody in this House believe that any accredited member of the Press Gallery would deliberately falsify or invent a story which he said was based on statements that were part of a briefing that went to members of the Press Gallery. Again, I do not believe that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> and I do not think that you believe it either. Therefore I think the credibility of the Oakes document is established. All the way through it are very interesting dates and facts which, of course, prove conclusively that the Prime Minister has not given all the facts to the House and that his statement is less than adequate, is purposely evasive and is deliberately misleading and dishonest. </para>
          <para>What is the Oakes account of Withers' recollection of these events? First of all, on the factual question of the time, Withers says that there was a record of his having had this conversation with a senior electoral officer and that that had been shown to the Attorney-General as early as 6 January. Again the involvement of the Prime Minister is clearly indicated because what Withers says occurred was that he was going to write a letter to Cameron saying that his allegations were really a matter for police investigation. It was at that point that it was suggested that the Prime Minister had better look at the letters. What is Withers reported to have said? Having shown these to the Prime Minister, whom we are told is an honourable man who wants all the facts to emerge, we are told that the Prime Minister's reaction was to say: 'I don't want to go down this track. Well be able to deal with this internally'. To quote <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> it was going to be buried. </para>

              <para>- The only person who has been buried to date has been the honourable member for Fadden. Certain Ministers in this House today are now as guilty as the Prime Minister. It is interesting to note that the back bench members who have been involved in this matter have not entered this debate to defend the Prime Minister. The men who are party to this conspiracy to cover up were in there saying: 'Well, all we have to do is accept the Prime Minister's word and accept that occasionally he has amnesia '. I ask the House to consider why it was that the Prime Minister, on being confronted with a lengthy document from the honourable member for Fadden, did not ask him for a copy of it. Of course, that is dealt with again by Withers, who says that at one stage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> had asked to borrow the documents to have them photocopied but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> had refused permission. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> he had said: 'I know what you'd do. You'd put them through the shredder'. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The House, the Parliament and the people of Australia therefore have available to them two quite alternative views of what took place. One is the view that was peddled in this House today, no matter how inexpertly, by the Prime Minister- amnesia and all- and by a couple of Ministers who did their best to bolster him. But it is a view which, on the face of his documents, simply does not hang together. Then, of course, there are the alternative facts, which certainly have the ring of truth about them because the dates coincide. The alternative Withers statement points to the fact that the dates coincide with those in the statement produced by the Prime Minister. He just believed that it would be covered up. What occurred was simply that as the matter got under way someone had to be buried. First it was the honourable member for Fadden. Then it came to a matter of choice. The Prime Minister, having mishandled the situation, decided that if somebody else had to go it had to be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> If the situation is such that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has been guilty of impropriety, his guilt is no less than that of his political leader, who was party to these discussions and party to these negotiations and who, on this occasion, has grievously misled the House in an attempt to escape his own culpability. When all the facts  emerge it will be shown that the Prime Minister has lied to the House. </para>

        <page.no>38</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>The Australian economy is now responding positively to policies directed to its basic problems. </para>
      <para>The economic scene is characterised by declining inflation, moderately expanding demand and activity and a more settled and predictable policy environment. </para>
      <para>The great success story of 1977-78 was on the inflation front. </para>
      <para>I simply record the facts. </para>
      <para>For the year ended June 1976, the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 12.3 per cent; for the year to June 1 978, it had fallen to 7.9 per cent. </para>
      <para>Through 1977-78, inflation fell much faster than had been predicted in last year's Budget. </para>
      <para>Reduced inflation has relieved pressures and strains throughout the economy. </para>
      <para>A start has been made in reducing interest rates. </para>
      <para>Lower inflation has also boosted private sector confidence and spending. </para>
      <para>Despite these achievements, 1977-78 was not without its disappointments. </para>
      <para>The Budget deficit substantially exceeded the original estimate, largely as a result of an unexpected shortfall in revenue. </para>
      <para>However, there was no relaxation of expenditure restraint; in fact, actual outlays for 1977-78 exceeded the Budget estimate by only one-half of one per cent. </para>
      <para>Many problems still remain to be solved. </para>
      <para>High unemployment persists. </para>
      <para>Real wages are still too high and this remains a major cause of the unacceptable levels of unemployment. </para>
      <para>The inescapable truth which cannot be too heavily emphasised is that the real cost of labour continues to be out of line with its productivity. </para>
      <para>Until this is put right, growth in jobs will be held back and unemployment will be difficult to reduce. </para>
      <para>The company profit share is still too low, having changed little in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>Externally, world demand and activity are subdued and this has had consequences for our trade account and the overall balance of payments. </para>
      <para>Nonetheless, the second half of 1977-78 saw a modest resumption of private capital inflow reflecting in part improved overseas perceptions of the Australian economy and its management. </para>
      <para>The maintenance and improvement of these perceptions are crucial to the further recovery of our economy. </para>
      <para>In a world of subdued demand and fierce competition for markets, our comparative performance in domestic economic management is of acute and increasing significance. </para>
      <para>It will not be sufficient for us merely to hold our own with the average performance of our trading partners. </para>
      <para>We must do better. </para>

        <title>THE BUDGET TASK</title>
        <page.no>39</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>Against this background, the Government decided that adherence to our basic economic strategy called for a substantial reduction in the Budget deficit from last year's outcome. </para>
      <para>We realised this meant that difficult and unpopular decisions had to be taken. </para>
      <para>There was no other way of keeping faith with our commitment to responsible economic management. </para>
      <para>To explain the magnitude of this task, let me spell out the background. </para>
      <para>The forward estimates of expenditure implied, on the basis of existing tax rates, a deficit to the order of $6,000m. </para>
      <para>These estimates normally include new spending proposals, which can be more readily put aside. </para>
      <para>Nevertheless, it was a formidable task. </para>
      <para>A very significant element of this projection was that the Government faced, for the first time in 20 years, a reduction of revenue in real terms. </para>
      <para>We began the Budget process with a stringent and painstaking review of our outlays. </para>
      <para>In that process, the prospective growth in outlays was cut to less than one half of that suggested by the forward estimates. </para>
      <para>They are now expected to grow by only 7.7 per cent in 1978-79. </para>
      <para>This will represent the lowest increase in outlays for ten years. </para>
      <para>Some might argue that the Government could have achieved greater restraint in expenditures. </para>
      <para>Further savings could indeed have been achieved by an actual cut in the money level of benefits such as pensions and family allowances. </para>
      <para>But we were not prepared to place a disproportionately large burden upon the recipients of such benefits. </para>
      <para>Having completed its review of outlays, which embraced decisions on health care financing arrangements with both expenditure and revenue implications, the Government faced a deficit in the order of $4,500m. </para>
      <para>Such an outcome was utterly unacceptable to the Government; anything approaching it would have squandered the hard won gains against inflation and progress towards economic recovery. </para>
      <para>It would have reversed our anti-inflationary policy, delivered a sharp blow to business and consumer confidence and put in jeopardy our external account and exchange rate. </para>
      <para>The prospect of further interest rate reductions would have been replaced by the certainty of sharp interest rate increases. </para>
      <para>Therefore to achieve our deficit target, it was necessary to raise substantial additional revenue in 1978-79. </para>
      <para>Our task was further complicated by the need to avoid the imposition of taxes that would have significant effects on business activity and inflationary expectations. </para>
      <para>In the final analysis, the Government decided, as an element of this revenue raising effort, to increase the standard rate of personal income tax as a temporary measure. </para>
      <para>Let me be clear. This particular decision is a severe disappointment to a Government which has demonstrated better than any of its predecessors its commitment to tax reduction and reform. </para>
      <para>I say now to those who might criticise this decision that the alternatives were far more inequitable and would have been detrimental to economic activity and inflation. </para>
      <para>Let those who question it demonstrate that a different mix of tax measures or a significantly higher deficit would have been more conducive to the attainment of our economic objectives. </para>
      <para>Alternatively, let them argue that a particular group such as pensioners or families should have borne a greater burden. </para>
      <para>I turn now to the details of the Government's expenditure and revenue decisions. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Subject to two important modifications, all pensions and benefits subject to indexation will be increased from the first payday in November by 3.4 per cent, the increase in the Consumer Price Index in the first half of 1978. </para>
        <para>The standard or single rate of social service pensions and benefits, for example, will rise by $1.75 to $53.20 a week while the combined married rate will rise by $2.90 to $88.70 a week. </para>
        <para>The two modifications are: </para>
        <para>First, in future pension increases for persons aged over 70 will be subject to an income test. This decision will apply to the November pension increase but will not apply to blind pensioners. I emphasise that present levels of pension for persons aged over 70 are not affected by this decision; they will continue in full and will not be subject to an income test. </para>
        <para>Secondly, in future unemployment benefits will be automatically indexed only for recipients with dependants. For recipients without dependants, benefits will be reviewed annually at Budget time. The Government does not propose to increase benefits for these recipients in this Budget. </para>
        <para>The Government has also decided that, after the November increase, indexation adjustments to pensions will be made annually each November. </para>
        <para>This decision has been taken in the light of the significant reduction in inflation which this Government has achieved since its return to office. </para>

      <para>We have therefore decided upon several major changes to existing arrangements which, while producing an immediately adverse budgetary effect, are more consistent with our longer-term objectives in this area and remove much of the confusion and complexity from present arrangements. </para>
      <para>These changes keep intact our belief that the Government should provide a certain basic but universal health cover for all Australians. </para>
      <para>They preserve our existing commitment to a more generous system of cover for pensioners and socially disadvantaged people. </para>
      <para>The changes also reflect the Government's view that, having provided a basic cover, it should be left to the individual to decide whether he or she wishes to take out further insurance and, if so, the type and quality of that further insurance. </para>
      <para>The changes, to be effective from 1 November 1978, are: the abolition of the health insurance levy and associated with that the abolition of compulsory private health insurance for non-levy payers; the entitlement of all eligible residents to a basic medical benefit totally funded by the </para>
      <para>Commonwealth from general revenue which is the greater of 40 per cent of schedule medical fees or the amount of schedule medical fees less $20 per professional service; and the termination of the Medibank Standard functions of the Health Insurance Commission. </para>
      <para>These changes will not disturb existing arrangements whereby all eligible residents without hospital insurance cover are entitled to standard ward accommodation and treatment in public hospitals at no direct cost to them. </para>
      <para>The current arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States for hospital costsharing will continue. </para>
      <para>Those desiring shared or private ward accom'modation with choice of doctor or private hospital accommodation will be free, as at present, to take out insurance with registered private health funds. Such insurance will be, of course, entirely optional. </para>
      <para>The Government is looking at the level of public hospital bed day charges for shared and private ward accommodation in the course of achieving its stated objective of greater rationalisation and efficiency in hospitals- extensive negotiations with the States are already under way. </para>
      <para>The 40 per cent/$20 medical benefit, which will be paid by registered private health insurance funds on behalf of the Commonwealth, will leave substantially unchanged the recently announced arrangements relating to Pensioner Health Benefit card-holders or to people identified by their doctors as socially disadvantaged. </para>
      <para>Doctors will continue to bulk bill the Commonwealth in respect of Pensioner Health Benefit card-holders on the basis of 85 per cent/$5. </para>
      <para>People identified by their doctors as socially disadvantaged will be bulk-billed on the basis of 75 per cent for all services, regardless of cost. </para>
      <para>Fuller details of these changes will be provided by the Minister for Health later this evening. </para>
      <para>The immediate significance for existing levy payers is that from 1 November 1978 when they cease paying the levy they can choose, if they wish, to make arrangements either through Medibank Private- whose functions will be continued- or a private health insurance fund to secure cover for part or all of the schedule fee not covered by the Commonwealth's proposals. </para>
      <para>For persons with private health insurance the Government expects a significant reduction in health insurance premiums as a result of these measures. </para>
      <para>The new measures will add an estimated $138m to Budget outlays in 1978-79 and $305m in a full year; in addition, abolition of the levy will reduce receipts by an estimated $197m in 1 978-79 and $3 16m in a full year. </para>
      <para>Finally, these measures can be expected to substract significantly from the Consumer Price Index for the December quarter. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>Since the OPEC countries quadrupled the world price of crude oil in 1973-74, Australians have continued to enjoy artificially low prices for crude oil. </para>
      <para>While the rest of the world was facing up to the inescapable fact that the days of cheap energy were over, Australians- even after the imposition in the 1975-76 Budget of a $2 per barrel production levy- were continuing to pay less than half of the world price for Australianproduced crude oil. </para>
      <para>Subsidized indigenous oil prices encouraged a wasteful use of a key energy resource and inhibited the adoption of more energy-efficient processes and technologies; in recognition of this the Government moved last year towards a more realistic pricing policy for Australian-produced crude oil. </para>
      <para>The move towards world prices for producers of 'old ' oil announced at that time was a gradual one, with correspondingly gradual benefits to conservation and improved exploitation of known reserves. </para>
      <para>In 1 978-79 the proportion of local crude oil production sold to refiners at less than world prices would have been about 70 per cent, involving, in effect, a subsidy to petroleum product users of some $800m. </para>
      <para>In the light both of the budgetary situation and the desirability of improving energy use and the allocation of resources, the Government has decided that all Australian-produced crude oil should, from tomorrow, be priced to refineries at import parity levels; this will mean that consumers of petroleum products will in future pay prices based on world oil prices. </para>
      <para>However, the proceeds of the increased price paid by refineries as a result of this decision will accrue in the first instance to the Government; the price to producers will continue to reflect the arrangements announced last year. </para>
      <para>These results will be achieved by, in effect, increasing the present productiion levy on 'nonparity* oil by an amount that will bring the price of such oil to refiners to import parity levels; this will bring the price to refiners of all domestic production to import parity. </para>
      <para>The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs will introduce legislation later tonight to give effect to these proposals; in brief, however, the new arrangements involve the imposition of a production levy at the rate required to bring the price of 'non-parity' oil in Bass Strait up to import parity, with variable rebates being allowed to reflect, on the one hand, the maintenance of a net levy of about $3 a barrel on 'import parity' oil and, on the other hand, the slight differences between Bass Strait and elsewhere in both import parity prices and non-parity prices. </para>
      <para>The net effect of these arrangements will be to increase immediately the production levy on Bass Strait 'non-parity' oil from the present rate or $18.90 per kilolitre (about $3 per barrel) to $64.53 per kilolitre (about $10.26 per barrel) for the period ending 31 December 1978; for Barrow Island the net levy on 'non-parity' oil will be $6 1 .39 per kilolitre (about $9.76 per barrel). </para>
      <para>It is anticipated that this decision will add about <inline font-style="italic">Vh.</inline> cents per litre to the price of petrol (roughly 16 cents per gallon). </para>
      <para>Retail prices for petrol in Australia vary considerably; however, the maximum allowable retail price for premium petrol in Sydney is now 2 1 cents per litre, and even with the increase expected, would remain much lower than the price paid by consumers in most countries comparable to Australia. </para>
      <para>For example, during the first quarter of 1978 consumers were paying 49 cents per litre in Italy, 44 cents in France and Japan, and 28 cents in the United Kingdom. </para>
      <para>New rates for the standard levy and rebates for the period 1 January to 30 June 1979 will be announced at the appropriate time following the determination of import parity prices for tha* period by the Minister for National Development. </para>
      <para>On the basis of existing import parity prices, this increase is estimated to raise additional revenue in 1978-79 of $676m; there will be some offset in excise collections from petroleum products, reflecting the effects of the rise in the prices of such products on the demand for them. </para>
      <para>In other respects, the pricing arrangements announced in last year's Budget will be unchanged. </para>
      <para>As then indicated, producers of 'old' oil will obtain import parity prices (less the existing levy of $ 1 8.90 per kilolitre) for increasing proportions of production from existing fields, with the proportions specified over the period to 1 980-8 1 and moving to 100 per cent as soon as possible thereafter; only for refiners (and hence consumers) is the inevitable move to world prices being accelerated. </para>
      <para>The levy will remain at $ 1 8.90 per kilolitre on import parity' oil; as the proportion of that oil in total production increases, collections from the new rates of levy will fall. </para>
      <para>Those fields currently producing less than 6 million barrels per day, including Moonie, already attract full import parity, and the levy in respect of their total production will remain unchanged. </para>
      <para>As announced in last year's Budget Speech the Government will review, prior to the end of 1980-81, the further progression to be made towards import parity for producers from existing fields. </para>

      <para>The increased costs of petroleum products flowing from the change in crude oil policy are estimated to have a direct impact on the December quarter Consumer Price Index of about 0.7 percentage points, with some further indirect effects in later quarters. </para>
      <para>As the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission recognised in its judgment arising out of the December quarter 1977 CPI increase, if the increase in the CPI resulting from these oil pricing policies were to flow through into wages, the Government's policy objective of more restrained energy use would be thwarted. </para>
      <para>Accordingly, at the approatpriate time, the Government will be asking the Commission to again discount the CPI for the effects of the oil conservation policy before considering any wage adjustment. </para>
      <para>In the same way, the other indirect tax changes I announced earlier tonight have been introduced to maintain responsible fiscal and monetary management; the Government intends that their net effect should fall on purchasers of the goods involved and not, through the wage determination mechanism, upon employers. </para>
      <para>It would defeat that intention if the effect which these taxes will have on the CPI- about half a percentage point- were allowed to flow through into wages. </para>
      <para>Consequently, the Commonwealth will also be arguing in the appropriate National Wage Case that the CPI should be discounted, for wage adjustment purposes, for the effects of these taxation measures. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>As foreshadowed, earlier, the Government has decided that as a temporary measure for 1978-79 only, the standard rate of personal income tax will be increased by Ite per cent, from 32 to 33te per cent; there will be corresponding increases, to 47 te per cent and 61te per cent, at higher levels of income. </para>
        <para>The relevant legislation will be expressed to terminate at the end of the current financial year. </para>
        <para>The full-year gain to revenue from this change is estimated to be $5 70m. </para>
        <para>It is intended to adjust pay-as-you-earn instalment deductions from 1 November 1978. </para>
        <para>The increase is effective from 1 July, and therefore the extra deduction to be made from a taxpayer's wages or salary after 1 November will be designed to meet his or her additional tax liability for the whole of 1978-79 and not just for the period after 1 November. </para>
        <para>The Ite per cent rate increase for 1978-79 will also be reflected in the calculation of provisional tax. </para>
        <para>Even after this change, gross PA YE collections in 1978-79 are estimated to increase by 7.1 per cent compared with 7.8 per cent in 1977-78; total collections from individuals are estimated to increase by 6.7 per cent this year, compared with 9.7 per cent in 1977-78. </para>
        <para>This temporary increase should also be seen in the light of the cumulative benefits that individual taxpayers have derived from the tax reforms of this Government. </para>
        <para>To illustrate, the cost to revenue of full tax indexation in 1976-77 was $990m; in 1977-78 the cost of full indexation and the rate scale reform was $ 1370m; the cost in 1978-79 of half indexation and rate scale reform, after allowance for the temporary standard rate increase I have just mentioned, will be about $700m. </para>

        <para>This decision reflects the Government's concern at mounting evidence of deliberate underestimation of taxable income for provisional tax purposes. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>There will be no change to the existing situation where superannuation and other retirement benefits are taxable as to only 5 per cent of the amount of the lump sum benefit. </para>
        <para>However, the Government has decided to alter the existing basis for taxing lump sum payments received on retirement or termination of employment for unused annual and long service leave. </para>
        <para>At present, with only 5 per cent of lump sum payments received for unused annual and long service leave subject to taxation on retirement, there is an encouragement not to take such leave during the taxpayer's working life; we believe that the tax system should not have that effect. </para>
        <para>After tonight, the whole of lump sum payments for unused annual leave will be taxed in full as ordinary income. </para>
        <para>Lump sum payments in respect of unused long service leave (including payments in the nature of long service leave) for qualifying service after tonight will be taxed at the standard rate of tax (33 te per cent this year); however, such payments in respect of long service leave for service prior to tonight will continue to be taxed under the present arrangements. </para>
        <para>The changes will not alter the existing rule that payments on death to a spouse or dependants or legal personal representative of a deceased employee in respect of accrued annual leave or accrued long service leave are not subject to taxation. </para>
        <para>The change to the taxation of payments for unused annual leave entitlements is estimated to produce a gain to revenue of $70m in1978-79 and $110m in a full year; reflecting the long phasing-in arrangements that are proposed, the change in respect of the taxation of long service leave payments is estimated to result in a revenue gainof$6m in 1978-79. </para>

        <para>Tuberculosis housekeeper allowance. </para>
        <para>People in receipt of these payments will not be disadvantaged by comparison with other income recipients; almost all of those solely dependent on the benefit will be below the tax threshold; others will become liable for tax only if they have other income above their social welfare payments sufficient to bring them above the tax threshold. </para>
        <para>The gain to revenue from this proposal is estimated at $3m in 1978-79 and $5m in a full year. </para>
        <para>Rebates for the Maintenance of Overseas Dependants </para>
        <para>The present law allows rebates for the maintenance of dependants overseas- a spouse, parents or parents-in-law and invalid relatives. </para>
        <para>In many cases, the dependant in question may have never been to, nor have any intention of coming to Australia; in other cases, the provision has led to flagrant abuse. </para>
        <para>In the light of this, the Government has decided to withdraw the rebates for overseasresident dependants as from 1 November 1978; for 1978-79, the maximum amount of rebate claimable for each eligible overseas dependant will thus be reduced to one-third of the present amount. </para>
        <para>Withdrawal of the rebates will not affect the rebate claimable for a dependent spouse overseas pending early migration to Australia. </para>
        <para>The gain to revenue in 1978-79 is estimated to be $8m and for a full year $20m. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>In recent months the Government has made a vigorous assault on tax avoidance; this will continue in 1978-79. </para>
      <para>The time is long since past when Governments or the community should tolerate the blatant, artificial and contrived means whereby certain sections of the community seek to pay little or no tax to the detriment of the general body of taxpayers and the equity of the tax system. </para>
      <para>As a further initiative in this area, the Government has decided upon a number of measures designed to curb avoidance of tax liabilities in cases where cash is paid for various forms of services without deductions for tax. </para>
      <para>Full details are provided in a separate statement I have released tonight. </para>
      <para>The Government has also decided to make some adjustments to the averaging system for primary producers, so as to confine its benefits more strictly to income derived from primary production; under these new arrangements averaging will still apply to taxable income from primary production, and may also apply to a limited amount of income derived from other sources. </para>
      <para>If non-primary production income is $5,000 or less in the income year, averaging will apply to all of it; the allowance of $5,000 will shade out by one dollar for each dollar of non-primary production income in excess of $5,000, thus shading out entirely when non-primary production income reaches $ 10,000. </para>
      <para>This change will ensure that persons with minimal interests or activities in primary production are not able to abuse the system to reduce their tax on non-primary production income, and will thereby inhibit the use of tax avoidance schemes based on primary producer status. </para>
      <para>Further details are contained in Statement No. </para>
      <para class="block">4. </para>
      <para>The change, which will apply for 1978-79 and subsequent income years, is estimated to raise $ lm in 1978-79 and $27m in a full year. </para>

        <page.no>1</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>In 1977-78 the broadly defined volume of money (M3) expanded by 8 per cent over the course of the year, which was at the lower end of the range projected in last year's Budget Speech. </para>
      <para>The firm control of the monetary aggregates which the Government has put in place since early 1976 has contributed much to the subsequent wind-down in inflation. </para>
      <para>The 1978-79 Budget will again contribute to an appropriate monetary environment. </para>
      <para>With continuing success against inflation, the Government looks forward to further sustainable reductions in interest rates. </para>
      <para>The Government has been careful to ensure that its policy of monetary restraint does not unduly restrict the supply of finance to certain key sectors such as housing. </para>
      <para>The policy of monetary restraint will of course strengthen the demand for housing in the longer term through reduced inflation and lower interest rates. </para>
      <para>However, the Government has acted decisively with a view to the short term as well. </para>
      <para>The banks and building societies are being reminded of the Government's desire that they lend <inline font-style="italic">to homeseekers to</inline> the maximum extent. </para>
      <para>In addition, to facilitate the provision of housing finance, the regulations relating to savings banks subject to the Banking Act are under urgent review. </para>
      <para>To expand savings banks' capacity to lend for housing in 1978-79, the proportion of savings bank deposits required to be held in public securities and liquid assets will be reduced from 45 to 40 per cent. </para>
      <para>As a longer term measure, the present method of controlling the investment of savings banks' funds is being reviewed with the intention of giving them more flexibility in determining the composition of their assets. </para>
      <para>Lending levels will, of course, remain subject to lenders' own commercial judgments. </para>
      <para>These actions should make it easier for homeseekers to obtain finance. </para>
      <para>These decisions have been taken within the framework of an overall monetary policy which remains directed at providing adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down steadily on inflation and inflationary expectations. </para>
      <para>In this regard- and despite the acknowledged uncertainties in such projections- I now state that this Budget is consistent with an outlook for financial conditions indicated by growth in the broadly defined volume of money (M3) in the range of 6 to 8 per cent over the course of 1978-79. </para>
      <para>Within this monetary projection, the outlook for employment will be affected by the outcome of the wage determination process both within the arbitral tribunals and outside them. </para>
      <para>But before I develop this point in more detail, let me say something about the link between jobs and money wage gains. </para>
      <para>The sharp increase in labour costs, relative both to the price of output and the costs of other factors of production, which occurred in 1973 and 1 974- and which has not so far been wound back- has encouraged firms to shed as much labour as they can. </para>
      <para>They have been replacing workers with machines; replacing full-time staff with part-time; replacing wage and salary earners with self employed contract labour; in short, making do with less labour all round. </para>
      <para>That is the major reason why employment, especially of wage and salary earners, has hardly been growing at all even while output has been expanding. </para>
      <para>This has been to the particular detriment of young people and the unskilled. </para>
      <para>For five years now, businesses have been coping as best they can with those excessive labour costs. </para>
      <para>Since the wages explosion of 1973 and 1974, there has, it is true, been some closing of the gap between real wages and productivity. </para>
      <para>But the partial closure of that gap has been a result of productivity increases, not of real wage reductions. </para>
      <para>In accepting this protracted means of closing the gap, we are, as a nation, condemning ourselves to a second-best solution. </para>
      <para>A considerably more rapid recovery would be possible- if a greater measure of wage restraint could be obtained. </para>
      <para>The Government has been fostering a moderate uplift in economic activity. </para>
      <para>However, excessive wages have pushed unemployment to levels that could otherwise have been avoided. </para>
      <para>At wage hearing after wage hearing, the Government has sought to demonstrate to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the inescapable inter-dependence of economic recovery and wage restraint. </para>
      <para>It is regrettable that the Commission has not paid greater heed to the views the Government has put to it at these hearings. </para>
      <para>Its failure to do so has, in our view, been costly to the Australian community both in terms of inflation and unemployment. </para>
      <para>We cannot, as a Government, regard this situation as satisfactory. </para>
      <para>Within the monetary framework which I outlined earlier, there is a limit to wage increases that can be awarded without throwing even more people out of work. </para>
      <para>The Government has limited flexibility in monetary policy, which cannot be assumed to passively adjust so as to accommodate money wage decisions inconsistent with the Government's objective of continuing to bear down on inflation and encourage economic recovery and sustained growth in employment. </para>
      <para>Employers also should not assume that the finance to accommodate excessive wage rises will be readily available. </para>
      <para>If wages increase faster than responsible growth in the monetary aggregates permits, there will be inadequate scope for growth in real activity. </para>
      <para>If this occurs the result will be lower economic activity and therefore higher unemployment than would otherwise be attainable. </para>
      <para>Consistent also with this position, the Government will not allow excessive increases in money wages to undermine its own Budget. </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth will, as a major employer, act like any other employer. </para>
      <para>If wages rise faster than we have budgeted for, we will respond by effecting offsetting economies through a further critical examination of Budget expenditures. This critical examination will include the number of staff employed. </para>
      <para>In so doing, we will be seeking to bring the conduct of our own affairs more into line with conditions prevailing in the private sector. </para>
      <para>That will also demonstrate, in the most practical way, the vital need to ensure sensible outcomes in the area of wage determination that will permit employers both to preserve present jobs and to make more new jobs available. </para>
      <para>The Government will be advising the Commission along these lines at the next National Wage Case. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>As I have just indicated, the outlook for the economy depends heavily on the future course of award wages. </para>
      <para>Unfortunately it is not generally recognised that, despite partial indexation, the actual level of real wages has hardly fallen at all in recent years. </para>
      <para>Real household disposable incomes rose in both 1976-77 and 1977-78. </para>
      <para>Notwithstanding the temporary increase in the standard rate of personal income tax, real household disposable incomes are again expected to rise in 1978-79. </para>
      <para>The personal saving ratio is likely to continue to decline and private consumption expenditure can be expected to grow at a healthy pace. </para>
      <para>Forward indicators suggest that the buoyant performance of private business investment in 1 977-78 will be sustained in the coming year. </para>
      <para>The Government draws considerable satisfaction from this evidence of increasing community confidence in its policies. </para>
      <para>While policy has, of course, been looking to the private sector as the source of sustainable growth, total public sector expenditure is again expected to show a real increase in 1978-79, although smaller than last year. </para>
      <para>The growth in production is also expected to be strengthened by a turn-around in the stock cycle as stocks begin to rise again during the coming year. </para>
      <para>Externally, our export growth will be constrained by the continuing moderate growth of the world economy in 1 978-79. </para>
      <para>However, from the point of view of the current account balance and domestic incomes, the sluggishness in export volumes is likely to be offset by a significant improvement in our terms of trade. </para>
      <para>The expected build up in stocks domestically will no doubt be mirrored in stronger growth in imports. </para>
      <para>On balance, therefore, the external deficit on current account seems likely to continue running at about the rate recorded in the second half of 1977-78, producing some increase for the year as a whole. </para>
      <para>Offsetting that, the improvement in the investment climate generally in this country seems likely to lead to a gradual strengthening of the private capital account. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, the Government remains committed to a program of official borrowing overseas to supplement the temporarily depleted levels of private capital inflow and, in the process, to maintain reserves. </para>
      <para>Overall, gross non-farm product is projected to grow by around 4 per cent in real terms in 1978-79. </para>
      <para>With a return to more normal seasonal conditions there should be a significant recovery in farm product and farm incomes this year. </para>
      <para>That would mean stronger growth in total GDP than in the non-farm component. </para>
      <para>However, while this growth should be sufficient to ensure an increase in employment, unemployment may well increase somewhat during the year as the labour force continues to grow, unless a better outcome can be achieved on the wages front. </para>
      <para>So far as prices are concerned, the indirect tax increases and the move to import parity for domestic crude oil may temporarily slow the deceleration in the broadly-based price deflators. </para>
      <para>In terms of the Consumer Price Index, those increases seem likely to be more than offset by the effects of the changes to the financing of health services. </para>
      <para>With even reasonably sensible outcomes for wage determination, inflation is expected to be running at an annual rate down towards 5 per cent by mid- 1979. </para>

Expressed as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product total outlays remained very steady at 24 to 25 per cent until 1974-75 when the proportion jumped to over 29 per cent, followed by a further rise to over 30 per cent in 1975-76. Since then the proportion has edged back marginally; on the basis of the projected increase in outlays of 7.7 per cent, a further reduction in the ratio can be expected in 1978-79. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The following commentary upon the changes in gross domestic product and its major expenditure components during 1977-78, including the accompanying charts, refers to half-yearly movements. All figures mentioned, apart from full-year changes, are seasonally adjusted and at constant (1974-75) prices. Since the economy is an interrelated whole, to use developments in real expenditures as the starting-point for discussion is, though conventional, to some extent arbitrary. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The year began with the economy emerging from a brief period of flat demand and activity. Statement No. 2 a year ago discussed the reasons for this flatness and concluded that: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Signs that they were largely transitory, rather than indicative of a petering out of recovery, began to emerge late in 1976-77.' </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">As detailed below, subsequent events have borne out that assessment. The rise in demand and product aggregates during 1977-78 was more even than in 1976-77 (see Chart 1, panels f, h, k, 1), although the recovery continues to be uneven both over time and across sectors. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private final consumption expenditure</inline>(Chart 1, panel a) was weak in the first half of 1977. It rose more rapidly and consistently during 1977-78 to be 4.1 per cent higher in the June quarter 1978 than a year earlier. The presently estimated increase for the year as a whole of 2.3 per cent was a little lower than in other recent years, but that owed much to the weakness in the first half of 1977. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Since private consumption expenditure accounts for nearly 60 per cent of gross domestic product, an examination of its determinants - see Table 1  -  is important both for an appreciation of the forces governing economic activity as a whole and as a basis for predicting trends in total consumer spending. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In terms of the movements shown in Table 1, real private consumption growth has averaged 2.9 per cent during the past two years, compared with 2.3 per cent during the previous two years. This slight strengthening has occurred notwithstanding a tendency for the increase in gross incomes to slow. One reason is that, whereas in 1974-75 and 1975-76 <inline font-style="italic">disposable</inline> income (i.e. after tax and transfers) grew noticeably less rapidly than gross income, over the last two years disposable income has, on average, grown a little faster. This has mainly reflected the operation of personal tax indexation and the February 1978 tax cuts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The behaviour of the personal saving ratio is also relevant. Since 1975, the saving ratio has fallen - though unevenly, reflecting lags in consumers' reaction to sudden changes in disposable income, particularly those occasioned by tax reductions. Occurring at a time when inflationary pressures were easing, this fall in the saving ratio from its atypically high level in 1974 and 1975 illustrates the important contribution which the control and reduction of inflation can make to strengthening demand and activity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private dwelling investment</inline>(panel b) was markedly out of step with other components of final demand in 1977-78, falling by 7.3 per cent for the year as a whole (although signs of an upturn appeared late in the year). Indeed, dwelling construction activity has moved quite differently from movements in domestic final demand (panel f) over a longer period. Private dwelling construction expanded rapidly for six consecutive quarters to the December quarter 1976, producing a trough-to-peak increase of more than 40 per cent. Towards the end of this period, and into 1977, large stocks of unsold new dwellings built up. The subsequent decline in activity reflects attempts to lower these stocks to a more normal level. Why did this sector display a cycle so markedly out of phase with developments in activity as a whole? </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">One reason is that new dwelling construction activity - typically sensitive to  credit conditions - was stimulated by the brief but very sharp expansion of housing finance in 1975. It is clear from the stock build-up that the rate of construction of new dwellings in 1976, although no higher than in earlier periods of buoyant activity, moved well ahead of effective demand. Whether the lower level of demand was a reflection of general recession, or more fundamental factors specific to the housing industry, is an important question for policy. While general economic conditions - including the more restrained growth of monetary aggregates since 1975 - have been partly responsible, there are undoubtedly other influences at work. Of primary importance have been basic demographic factors - lower migration and fertility rates, slower population growth (including in the most relevant age groups), fewer marriages, and a reduced rate of household formation - affecting the level and pattern of dwelling demand. In addition, there has been an apparent increase in consumer preference for previously-occupied dwellings, and greater resort to modification of the existing dwelling stock. This is, at least in part, a result of the continuing price advantage enjoyed by established dwellings. These developments carry such weight that an extrapolation of past trend levels of new dwelling construction would substantially overstate sustainable demand today. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In marked contrast to the fall in dwelling investment, <inline font-style="italic">private gross business fixed capital expenditure</inline> (panels c and d) rose quite strongly in 1977-78. Expenditure on <inline font-style="italic">non-residential building and construction</inline> registered a significant increase - although unevenly - following persistent falls since the early 1970s while private investment in <inline font-style="italic">plant and equipment,</inline> after a pause in the first half of 1977, showed a return to strong growth. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There can be no doubt that the climate for decision-making concerning busi  ness fixed investment has improved. As with personal consumption, the lift in spending has coincided with the trend to lower inflation and lowered inflationary expectations. The depression of corporate profitability in 1974-75, as indicated by the decline in the profit share of non-farm product (see Chart 6a), discouraged investment through the reduced availability of internal funds and effects on expectations of prospective profitability and business confidence generally. Although there has been little recovery in gross profitability since that time, tax concessions have considerably improved the internal funds position of the corporate sector taken as a whole and there has, therefore, been some recovery in net profitability. (Part II contains a more detailed discussion of these developments.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Two additional factors underlie the generally stronger revival in investment  in plant and equipment. First, the continuing pressure of high real labour costs has induced substitution of capital for labour. Second, the tax incentives just mentioned have borne more directly on plant and equipment. More particularly, the scaling down of the investment allowance to 20 per cent for eligible plant <inline font-style="italic">ordered</inline> after 30 June 1978 was probably a factor in the particularly strong performance of this category of investment in the second half of 1977-78, although the 40 per cent rate will continue to apply to (and hence influence) eligible plant ordered up till 30 June 1978 but put in place by 30 June 1979. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The expenditure categories dealt with so far - private final consumption and  gross fixed capital expenditure - sum to <inline font-style="italic">private domestic final expenditure.</inline> This aggregate showed moderate but sustained growth in 1977-78. As Table 2 shows, in contrast to the erratic pattern in past years, private domestic final expenditure contributed firmly to GDP growth in both halves of 1977-78. </para>
        <para class="block">

        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Government final expenditure</inline>(national accounts basis, all levels) expanded quite strongly in 1977-78 (Chart 1, panel e). Growth for the year as a whole was 3.8 per cent, with current expenditure increasing by 5.5 per cent and capital expenditure by 0.5 per cent. As Table 2 indicates, the direct contribution of public expenditure to product growth was rather greater in 1977-78 than in the two previous years. In fact, the share of total public sector spending in non-farm product has changed little since its rapid build-up in 1974 and 1975 (see Chart 2). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Export</inline>volumes (panel g) recorded strong growth in the first half of 1977-78, making a substantial contribution to the increase in <inline font-style="italic">total final expenditure</inline> (panel h) and product growth (Table 2) for that period. Factors affecting the timing of exports were partly responsible for that strength. This was, however, partly offset by a fall during the second half, and for 1977-78 as a whole exports were only moderately higher than for 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Import</inline>volumes (panel j) responded with a lag to the November 1976 devaluation, with a downward trend emerging in the June quarter of 1977. This continued over the remainder of 1977 and, with exports growing strongly, <inline font-style="italic">net exports</inline> made a sizeable contribution to product growth in the first half of 1977-78 (Table 2); the ratio of imports to sales (Chart 3) moved down somewhat. These trends were reversed in the first half of 1978 as exports fell and imports rose strongly; the very rapid growth of expenditure on plant and equipment - a relatively high proportion of which is imported - was presumably partly responsible for the rise in imports, which were, however, also affected by timing factors. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">As Chart 3 and panels (i) and (j) of Chart 1 show, there is often a close relationship between the more marked swings in <inline font-style="italic">stock accumulation</inline> and variations in imports. This was so in 1977-78, when the impact on GDP of the stock cycle was cushioned by changes in imports. In the first half the dramatic turnaround from stock accumulation to decumulation was accompanied by a sharp fall in the rate of importing; in the second half renewed growth of imports was accompanied by a return to stock accumulation. The pattern of negative contribution to product growth in the first half of 1977-78 and positive contribution in the second half was present for both the <inline font-style="italic">non-farm</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">farm and miscellaneous</inline> categories of stocks. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">However, with the very large run-down in stocks- in 1977-78 as a whole only partially offset by the decline in imports, and with exports growing modestly, the <inline font-style="italic">expenditure-based estimate of gross domestic product</inline> (that is, excluding the statistical discrepancy) rose much more slowly than domestic final expenditure in both halves of the year (panel k). In turn, with the statistical discrepancy slightly depressing apparent product growth in both halves (see Table 2), the <inline font-style="italic">income-based</inline> estimate of GDP rose a little less than the expenditure-based estimate; the presently estimated increase in income-based GDP for the year as a whole is 1.4 per cent, compared with 4.0 per cent for 1976-77 and 2.7 per cent for 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Within total GDP, trends in non-farm and farm components differed markedly. For 1977-78 as a whole <inline font-style="italic">gross non-farm product</inline> increased by 1.8 per cent (panel 1). This compares with increases of 4.2 per cent for 1976-77 and 2.4 per cent for 1975-76. Over the course of the year - from the June quarter 1977 to the June quarter 1978  -  non-farm product increased, on present estimates, by 2.2 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Farm product</inline>fell by 5.1 per cent in 1977-78. In the first half of the year seasonal conditions were poor in many areas. The effect on the supply of farm produce was cushioned by a sharp run-down in <inline font-style="italic">farm stocks.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">gross value of farm production</inline> (at current prices) was little changed between 1976-77 and 1977-78. However, within the total there was considerable variation: the gross value of <inline font-style="italic">wheat</inline> production fell by about 13 per cent, with substantially reduced output more than offsetting a rise in prices; the value of <inline font-style="italic">sugar cane</inline> cut for crushing fell by about 5 per cent on account of lower prices; the gross value of <inline font-style="italic">wool</inline> production was slightly below a year earlier on account of lower volumes; and the value of <inline font-style="italic">livestock</inline> slaughtered rose by about 18 per cent, reflecting both higher prices and increased slaughterings. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The slowing in total product growth between 1976-77 and 1977-78 is therefore partly accounted for by the decline in farm product. The other main factor was the sharp turnaround in the non-farm stock cycle. The slowing does not, therefore, indicate a weakening in total domestic <inline font-style="italic">final</inline> expenditure, which on present estimates rose by 2.5 per cent, compared with 2.7 per cent for 1976-77. Furthermore, total domestic final expenditure accelerated through the year (Chart 1. panel f), rising at annual rates of 2.8 per cent in the first half and 4.6 per cent in the second half following the small decline in the second half of 1976-77. </para>

While attempts have been made to iron out resulting irregularities and inconsistencies with earlier survey estimates, discontinuity of survey-based series during 1977-78 may remain. This possibility is underlined by the inexplicable movements in some of the key series in November and February - the months in which the above-mentioned changes were effected. Thus, while the direction of trends during 1977-78 seems clear enough, not much weight should be accorded the precise magnitudes of estimated movements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The recorded figures point to a decline in the participation rate during 1977-78. This cushioned the effects on total unemployment of the slight decline in employment during the course of the year; none the less, unemployment in the second half was still substantially higher than twelve months earlier. In the closing months of the year unemployment appeared to stabilise; movements in the CES series were similar to the seasonal pattern, and were consistent with the ABS monthly labour force survey. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The fall in the participation rate in the past two years represents the first sustained decline since 1971-72. On earlier occasions declines in the participation rate have occurred more or less concurrently with the down-turn in economic activity and rising unemployment; on this occasion the apparent fall has appeared well after the onset of high unemployment in 1974. One possible explanation for at least part of this phenomenon is the attraction which much higher real wages (and, perhaps, much higher real unemployment benefits) may for a time have had in holding up participation rates and thereby nullifying the normal 'discouraged worker' effect of a weak labour market. Another factor may have been the different composition of unemployment in this recession; increased job opportunities for women led to a rise in female participation rates while the greater relative  decline in the manufacturing sector, in particular, led to a rise in the level of male unemployed, the latter being less likely to leave the labour force. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Several other important aspects of labour market experience in 1977-78 deserve mention. First, part-time employment continued to grow and the surveybased estimate of unemployment among the part-time labour force actually declined over the course of the year. Secondly, female employment was again stronger than male employment. Thirdly, among industry groupings, manufacturing and community services recorded the major changes over the year, the former declining and the latter increasing. Fourthly, government employment continued to rise (but showed some flattening in the second half), while private employment continued to fall. Finally, in marked contrast to earlier years, junior unemployment rates rose by relatively less than adult rates. The Special Youth Employment Training Program would seem to have been an important factor in this development, in effect resulting in some substitution of youth employment for employment of other members of the work force. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">While there was an <inline font-style="italic">overall</inline> deficit of $542 million for 1977-78 as a whole, there was a small surplus in the second half. Total <inline font-style="italic">private</inline> sector external transactions were in approximate balance in the second half of the year compared with a deficit of over $1200 million in the first half. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">International reserves at the end of the year ($3225 million) were only slightly lower than at the beginning, mainly because the overall deficit was offset by increases in the market value of Australia's official gold holdings and other valuation effects (such effects are excluded for purposes of calculating the overall deficit). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The turnaround in the balance of payments position during the course of the year was entirely due to a reversal of private capital movements; an apparent outflow of private capital (including marketing authorities) of over $600 million in the first half of the year was more than matched by an apparent inflow of about $1000 million in the second half, resulting in a small net apparent inflow for the year as a whole. Factors in this turnaround included the improvement in Australia's international competitiveness and the increasingly favourable attitude of overseas investors to domestic economic policies pursued by the Australian Government; a net inflow of trade credit, associated with a weakening of the balance of trade and the seasonal tightening of domestic liquidity conditions in the latter part of 1977-78; and the firm indications by the Government that, pending the resumption of a more normal rate of private capital inflow, it was prepared to undertake substantial official overseas borrowings to help support the exchange rate. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Overseas borrowings on official account (including banking arrangements entered into by the Reserve Bank with the Bank for International Settlements) amounted to $1955 million gross (SI 806 million net) in 1977-78, with borrowings fairly evenly spread throughout the year. The trade-weighted average exchange rate for the $A was depreciated by 6.8 per cent during the course of 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The pattern on current account was the reverse of that on private capital account. The current deficit was appreciably higher in the second half than in the first, mainly because of a decline in the trade surplus, which had increased between the last half of 1976-77 and the first half of 1977-78. For the year as a whole, the current account deficit of $2410 million represented 2.7 per cent of GDP. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The deterioration in the trade balance between the two halves of 1977-78 reflected some once-for-all factors, as well as changing domestic and external economic conditions. On the export side, there appears to have been some concentration of sales, notably of sugar, in the first half, so that higher export volumes more than offset the sharp fall in export prices. By contrast, lower export volumes in the second half more than offset the appreciable recovery in export prices, so that the total value of exports declined. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the import side, a concentration of imports of ships and defence equipment contributed to the strong increase in the second half of the year. In addition, demand for imports increased in the second half as a result of increased domestic expenditure both generally and, in particular, on plant and equipment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The net invisibles deficit showed little change between the first and second halves of 1977-78. For the year as a whole the net invisibles deficit was about 9 per cent higher than in 1976-77, mainly as a result of increased net property income payments overseas (including undistributed income). </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">For a number of years prior to 1976, domestic financial conditions were accommodating to rising inflation. That period also saw large short-term fluctuations in the monetary aggregates and unsettled financial markets. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An important element in laying the foundations for sustainable recovery in economic activity has been a return to more stable financial conditions through the achievement of slower growth in the monetary aggregates. With steady progress on that front helping to wind down the inflation rate, there was in 1977-78 a general lowering in nominal interest rates, for the first time since 1972. This was achieved without the volume of money deviating from its projected growth path. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The announcement in each of the last two Budget Speeches (and initially in March 1976) of a successively lower projected range for M3 growth in the financial year has contributed substantially to a return to stability and greater certainty in financial markets. The projections have effectively fulfilled their intention of indicating the Government's expectations for the appropriate monetary environment consistent with progress towards its economic objectives. Given the outcomes, it must be judged that these projections have made an important contribution to the success of anti-inflation policy. So far as 1977-78 was concerned, an M3 outcome of 8 per cent (i.e. at the bottom of the projected 8 to 10 per cent range) was consistent with the faster than expected reduction in inflation during the year. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="110131197808155_72_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In recent years the size of the Commonwealth Budget deficit and, closely related to that, the size of the public sector borrowing requirement, have had a dominant influence on the evolution of domestic financial conditions (Chart 7) and the private sector balance of payments. That influence has derived from the impact both of liquidity and of expectations. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The expected financial implications of the 1977-78 Budget were clearly stated when it was brought down. But largely because of the substantially different outcome for the Budget deficit, the elements of liquidity and money formation departed from what was then foreseen. Slowing in the growth rates of the monetary aggregates continued in 1977-78, but the mix of money formation items was less than wholly satisfactory: growth in liquidity on account of the Budget was higher than in any year except 1975-76; a large share of private saving was acquired by the public sector; growth in overall credit from domestic sources remained at about 11 per cent; and private sector foreign exchange transactions were in large deficit. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Private external flows have clearly demonstrated some sensitivity to the pace of domestic credit expansion in recent years. This linkage is undoubtedly strengthened at certain times, and particularly when domestic inflation is seen to be out of line with the inflation rates of Australia's major trading partners. The effects can be exacerbated when, as in recent years, a deficit on private overseas transactions has coincided with the seasonally flush period in domestic financial markets associated with the Budget liquidity cycle. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Following the Government's policy announcements of an expanded official overseas borrowing program to maintain the level of international reserves, the large private external deficit in the early months of 1977-78 gave way to approximate balance in the second half of the year. Over the full year, however, the deficit in private sector foreign exchange transactions considerably offset the Budget's contribution to private sector liquidity; with strong non-bank demand for government debt, sizeable releases of funds from the Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) accounts of the major trading banks were required to support their lending. As shown in Table 6, this marked a significant change in SRD policy compared with the previous two financial years, when increases in the SRD ratio were used to moderate the growth in private sector liquidity and secondary credit creation. Reductions during the September and June quarters of 1977-78 left the SRD ratio at an historically low level of 4.0 per cent at the end of the year. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="110131197808155_74_8.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Despite slower growth in Budget outlays, and the re-phasing of company tax instalments, the within-year swings in the Budget's contribution to primary liquidity in the last three years have been markedly larger than in the preceding three years. This has presented problems for policy in endeavouring to ensure that the necessary consequential adjustments to monetary instruments do not run counter to longer-run policy requirements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of the financing of the 1977-78 deficit are contained in Table 7 and Budget Statement No. 5. The strong demand for Commonwealth bonds throughout most of 1977-78 owed much to heightened expectations of falling nominal interest rates and consequent prospective capital gains. These expectations reflected a perceived connection with progress in reducing both inflation and the Commonwealth Budget deficit. Expectations gathered strength as the rapid fall in inflation became evident, but were tested towards the end of the year as it became apparent that the deficit would be larger than expected. No doubt with a view to maximising prospective capital gains, demand was concentrated on longer-dated Commonwealth securities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On account of these factors, non-bank take-up of Commonwealth Government securities was again sizeable in 1977-78, maintaining the equivalent established in recent years of about one-half of the domestic Budget deficit. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For much of 1977-78, more particularly in the first half of the year, bonds were used more extensively as a short-term financing instrument than Treasury Notes, which give limited potential for capital appreciation. The peak stock of Treasury Notes in non-official hands at the end of the liquidity run-up period was less than half that in 1977, when Treasury Notes were the main instrument employed in preparation for the seasonal liquidity contraction. Australian Savings Bonds continued their useful financing role. Net subscriptions of $401 million, or 32 per cent of total non-bank take-up, were largely concentrated in the seasonally flush period of the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The large seasonal transfer of funds to the Commonwealth in the June quarter was effected smoothly with the aid of a 2.5 percentage point reduction in the SRD ratio, Reserve Bank purchases of relatively short-term Commonwealth Government securities, strengthening private capital inflow, and only modest Reserve Bank lending to the financial sector. In general, sensitive short-term interest rates increased less than in the preceding two June quarters. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At this time last year, some scope was foreseen for easing restrictions on bank lending during the course of 1977-78 following a prolonged period of restraint on banks' balance sheets. In particular, encouragement was given to an increase in lending for housing, and the requirements of small businesses, rural producers and exporters were drawn to banks' attention. Guidelines for major trading bank lending were eased somewhat. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The intake of funds by major trading banks had been moderating since about 1975 and, with strong growth in advances in 1977-78, the consequent pressure on free liquid assets became evident, leading the authorities to release funds from SRD accounts. In the event, with bank lending rates remaining attractive to borrowers, loans and advances outstanding of major trading banks increased by 12 per cent. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="110131197808155_76_9.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As a consequence of some diminution in demand for finance from the finance companies, the growth of about 13 per cent in loans outstanding by these institutions was somewhat slower than in the previous two years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Housing loan outstandings of savings banks and permanent building societies grew by about 18 per cent, a faster pace than most other financial aggregates. Finance approvals by major mortgage lenders of $45 1 1 million were about 8 per cent higher in value, but 2 per cent lower in number, than in 1976-77. Borrowing and lending interest rates of the major mortgage financiers were generally reduced in the first half of 1978. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the past several years wider measures of the volume of money have grown more rapidly than M3. A blend of policy instruments that bears most directly on the banking sector results in borrowers seeking funds at more expensive rates from other financial intermediaries. In 1977-78, however, there were signs of an easing in the degree of this disintermediation to more expensive sources of funds. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The total public sector borrowing requirement remained high during 1975-76 and 1976-77, and expanded further in 1977-78 on account of increased realised deficits at the various levels of government. In this latest year a larger proportion of the Commonwealth deficit was, in the outcome, financed by increased official overseas borrowing undertaken to maintain international reserves. The monetary implications of this method of financing are broadly similar to those of central bank financing. The increase in the public sector borrowing requirement outside the Commonwealth Budget area appears to have been met in aggregate largely by miscellaneous financing transactions (such as running down holdings of LGS assets and bank balances), with only a modest increase in borrowing from the public through Loan Council programs. Despite other sizeable demands on them, the savings banks were again major subscribers to local and semi-government loans. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Sectoral lending is put in historical context in Part II below. Preliminary estimates indicate that in 1977-78 net lending by the household sector may have been much the same as in the previous year - that is, less than the record 1974-75 level, but still fairly high. Tentative estimates suggest that the corporate sector's borrowing requirement fell in 1977-78 from the relatively high level of the previous year. This was a result of continued moderate growth in gross operating surplus, net effects of tax changes and a swing to stock decumulation from the high rate of accumulation of the previous year, which more than matched the call on funds to finance the solid growth in fixed capital expenditure. So far in the recovery, the demand of the corporate sector for bank loan funds has been limited, as has demand for new debt and equity capital. Reflecting the improving overall economic climate, some expected restoration of the corporate profit share, and brighter expectations for inflation and nominal yields on fixed interest securities, both the Sydney Stock Exchange All Ordinaries Index and share turnover rose strongly through 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In summary, in 1977-78 the borrowing requirements by the public and corporate sectors were met with increased overseas borrowing by the public sector, within slower growth in the monetary aggregates, and within a generally falling interest rate structure. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="110131197808155_78_10.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Most of the fall in rates on Commonwealth Government securities was concentrated in the first half of the year, with smaller reductions in the second half. The yields on local and semi-government authority debt fell in step with Commonwealth Government security rates, and these securities were sufficiently attractive for loans to be fully subscribed. Recent movements in Commonwealth Government security rates are shown in historical perspective in Chart 8. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The income velocity of circulation of money (M3) has tended to grow over the long term as a result of more efficient financial practices and, at least in certain periods, more rapid funds intake by financial institutions that are not covered by the M3 monetary aggregate. That velocity has been above its trend for some years is an indication of the downward pressure that monetary policy has been exerting on the rate of inflation. Over 1977-78, M3 velocity appears to have increased by one percentage point. </para>

      <para>Part II Economic Policy and Recovery </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The decline in inflation rates is the outstanding feature of economic developments over the last two or three years. This has been accompanied by growth in economic activity, with a noticeably stronger private sector. At the same time, the demand for labour has remained very subdued and unemployment has risen further. It is natural to ask whether, in all the circumstances, substantially different settings of macro-economic policy would have led to a more rapid restoration of high employment stability. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">Economic policy in recent years has been based on the premise that sustained economic growth can be achieved only through a revival in the private sector; within the constraints operating upon the policy framework, policy instruments have therefore been set so as to achieve the <inline font-style="italic">pre-conditions</inline> for a sustained recovery in private sector activity. Central to this has been the endeavour to control and reduce inflation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Some indicators of the broad stance of policy are shown in Table 9. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Some of the key features of the Commonwealth's economic policy actions are indicated by the figures in the table: restraint on Budget outlays; a bearing down upon the Budget deficit; notwithstanding that, major taxation concessions both to individuals and to the corporate sector; moderation in the growth of monetary aggregates; and partially successful advocacy of wage restraint before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The higher Budget deficit outcome for 1977-78 represented a marked departure from the lower levels evident since the first half of 1976. The reasons for that outcome, and the deviation from the 1977-78 Budget estimate, are spelled out in Budget Statement No. 5; the prime explanation is to be found, not in any change in the setting of fiscal policy during the year, but in revenue short-falls of a non-discretionary' kind. </para>
        <para class="block">Macro-economic Constraints </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The rate of economic expansion, both achievable and achieved, has been inhibited by several deep-seated influences. The degree of unemployment and under-utilisation of capacity that now exists is not primarily the product of deficient demand in the private sector of a kind that can be lastingly boosted to any desired degree by conventional fiscal/monetary stimulus. The following discussion, which examines the shifts in some key economic relationships that have occurred in the 1970s, attempts to elucidate the constraints at present operating on such an approach; it supplements and elaborates analysis which has appeared in this Statement in recent years. </para>

          <page.no>82</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">Paramount among these constraints is the effect of inflation on private sector decisions. Mention was made in Part I of the depressing effects of inflation on both private consumption and private investment. The easing of inflationary pressures has been a major factor in the recent gradual strengthening of these components of expenditure. However, the effects of high inflation on activity do not stop there: high domestic inflation, and in particular inflation in excess of that abroad, tends both to erode the price competitiveness of the economy's export and import-competing sectors and to reduce their profitability, leading in turn to a contraction in activity and employment in those sectors. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A major element of the policy background at present is, therefore, the success of anti-inflation policies. Prices have decelerated to a rate of increase less than half the peak reached in 1974-75. At 7-8 per cent, however, inflation - while now much the same, on average, as in other OECD countries - is still clearly excessive even by past Australian standards (as to the relevance of which today, there is a further question). Furthermore, the community's 'inflation psychology' must be judged highly sensitive to shocks such as would be signalled, for example, by any basic shift in the thrust of policy. It may therefore be regarded as a <inline font-style="italic">necessary</inline> condition for the maintenance of the recovery process that prices continue to decelerate, and be expected to continue doing so. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Inflation sensitivity' is not confined within national boundaries. Decisions affecting the balance of payments, particularly through private capital movements, can also be profoundly influenced by the perceptions of decision-makers, whether at home or abroad, of domestic performance and policies. Policies that are perceived as being attuned to the domestic economy's fundamental problems are bound to enhance the likelihood of favourable investment decisions whether by domestic investors or by foreigners. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The experience of recent years clearly implies that, under current conditions, an attempt to force the pace of aggregate demand growth would tend to result more in a higher price level and adverse balance of payments responses than in enhanced domestic activity. By contrast, policies aimed at the continued unwinding of inflationary pressures have already begun to lead to positive effects on private sector spending from both domestic and foreign sources. The question is not so much whether these have served to compensate for the lower direct impact effects of those more restrained fiscal/monetary settings, although in fact they appear to have done so. The question has been, rather, whether any alternative course of policy has been open which could have avoided the twin dangers of renewed inflation and growing instability in the external account. The answer to that question has been in the negative. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">In addition to inflation it has to be recognised that the sharp factor share imbalance which developed in 1973 and 1974 is still acting as a constraint on the growth of economic activity. While some reduction in the magnitude of this imbalance has occurred since that time, that has not been large - and certainly not large enough. That is to say, and as is elaborated below, at the macro-economic level there remains a <inline font-style="italic">relative</inline> as well as an <inline font-style="italic">absolute</inline> price distortion. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This subject, which has attracted growing attention in recent years, is conventionally approached in terms of the shares in non-farm or total GDP of wages, salaries and supplements on the one hand, and gross operating surplus of corporate trading enterprises on the other. The discussion in Part I, which employed these measures (Chart 6), showed clearly enough that despite some corrective movement since 1975, gross income shares remain out of line with their long-term averages. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although sufficient for purposes of general exposition, this conventional approach masks some important detail. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">First, it ignores incomes other than wages and company profits. Chart 9 seeks to rectify this by presenting information for the whole economy since 1966-67; it is a representation of the breakdown of <inline font-style="italic">national disposable income</inline> into its sectoral constituents on a factor (earned) income basis and is derived from the Australian National Accounts (see footnotes to charts for elaboration). National disposable income is defined as domestic factor incomes <inline font-style="italic">plus</inline> net indirect taxes <inline font-style="italic">less</inline> net income paid overseas (national income) <inline font-style="italic">less</inline> net transfers to overseas. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Movements in the profit and wage shares over the period have broadly mirrored each other, but they have not done so exactly. Over the two years to 1974-75 the wage share of national disposable income rose by 4.2 percentage points and the corporate trading enterprise share fell by 2.5 percentage points. Between 1974-75 and 1977-78 the wage share fell by 2.7 percentage points while the corporate trading enterprise share is presently estimated to have shown no change. The main movements in other sectoral income shares making up this latter difference were increases of 1.4 percentage points in dwellings, 0.7 percentage points in government enterprises and 0.7 percentage points in net indirect taxes; the share of unincorporated enterprises fell marginally. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Income share analysis should not stop at the breakdown of national income into <inline font-style="italic">factor</inline> incomes; there is a complex <inline font-style="italic">transfer</inline> process of current account payments between sectors. Of particular interest in this respect, given the major changes in personal and company tax and in cash benefit arrangements in recent years, is the set of transfers between <inline font-style="italic">general</inline> government, which does not generate any factor income, and the income-producing sectors. Chart 10 provides the relevant presentation: it shows the sector shares of national disposable income after current transfers involving government. (Public enterprise income is combined with general government to form the public authorities sector in the chart.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The decline in the corporate trading enterprise share in 1973-74 and 1974-75 is similar whether measured before or after transfers with government. Since then the post-transfer basis reveals some recovery, in contrast to no change on the pre-transfer basis. This reflects the influence of tax changes - principally the double depreciation provisions which operated until June 1976, the investment allowance and the trading stock valuation adjustment. On both pre-transfer and post-transfer bases, however, the corporate share remains well below long-term averages (see Charts 9 and 10). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After transfers, the income share of households (excluding unincorporated enterprises) reached a peak in 1975-76 a little above the share in 1974-75, a year in which there was a very sharp jump. In the two succeeding years it has changed very little and still remains well above its longer-term average (Chart 10). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Movements in the factor income share of unincorporated enterprises (which, after tax payable, are naturally not as great) are strongly influenced by fluctuations in farm income, which accounts for one-third of total unincorporated enterprise income. The relative decline in the size of the farm sector is part of the explanation for the downward trend in the total unincorporated share over the period, but the non-farm component seems also to have trended down. After taxes, there has been a slight rise in the share in the most recent years (Chart 10). </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Several features of Chart 11 are worth comment. The first is the marked increase in National Capital Funds accruing in the household sector. This proportion rose through most of the decade, reaching a peak in 1974-75; the household saving ratio has shown broadly similar movements. Secondly, with the exception of financial enterprises, all other sectors have displayed <inline font-style="italic">trend</inline> movements opposite to the household sector. (As is readily apparent, there have been shorter-term fluctuations. ) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The proportion of National Capital Funds coming from overseas has been on average much lower in recent years - although, after the sharp declines of 1971- 72 and 1972-73 (there being actual net lending abroad in the latter year), there has been a subsequent upward tendency. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The proportion of National Capital Funds accruing in the corporate trading enterprise sector, after a sharp increase in 1972-73 associated, like the household sector movement, with the external borrowing turnaround, recorded an equally sharp decline in 1973-74 and a further decline in 1974-75. At that point it accounted for only 16 per cent of National Capital Funds, compared with 26i per cent on average from 1966-67 to 1972-73. Since 1974-75, the capital funds position of the corporate sector has improved, mainly finding its counterpart in the household and government sectors. The corporate sector's net borrowing is estimated to be equivalent to about 10 per cent of internal capital funds in 1977-78, compared with an average of 28 per cent for 1966-67 to 1972- 73 (Chart 12), and the peak figure of 56 per cent in 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">During the period 1966-67 to 1972-73 public authorities contributed, on average, 27 per cent of National Capital Funds. In the subsequent five years the proportion has been 19 per cent. Public authorities have not, however, accounted for a reduced proportion of capital spending and, in consequence, there has been a marked shift in their net borrowing (Chart 12). Whereas from 1966-67 to 1973- 74 public authorities borrowed, on average, the equivalent of 20 per cent of their internal finance of gross accumulation (14 per cent of their capital acquisition), the ratio jumped to 85 per cent in 1974-75 (46 per cent of capital acquisition) and has averaged 125 per cent in the period since then. That is to say, <inline font-style="italic">more than half of the public sector's capital expenditure has been financed by borrowing in the years since 1974-75, compared with one-seventh for the period 1966-67 to 1973-74.</inline></para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This analysis of the income and borrowing positions of the major sectors can now be related more explicitly to the discussion of constraints with which this section is concerned. The general picture is one in which some very sharp movements were superimposed on slowly developing trends in income and capital shares, first in the capital accounts in 1972-73, and then in both the income and capital accounts in 1973-74 and, in particular, 1974-75. These latter shifts have for the most part been only slowly and partly reversed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The household sector continues to command an elevated proportion of national income after current transfers with government; it is still spending a reduced fraction of its income and lending a greater fraction - although both proportions have moderated from their extremes. The corporate income position has been bolstered to an extent by government transfers; but government (at all levels) is not obtaining, by taxation, current income to finance these transfers and its own enlarged spending, but is financing them instead by vastly expanded borrowing. The corporate sector's income position required, for a time, greatly elevated borrowing to support capital expenditure growth; more recently that shift has moderated somewhat, in large part due to those transfers from government. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These developments are consistent with many of the characteristics of traditional stabilisation policy - an expanded private <inline font-style="italic">ex ante</inline> propensity to save (in the household sector) being matched by increased public borrowing in order to support the aggregate level of spending in the economy (by government directly and via transfer to the corporate sector). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There are, however, aspects with connotations of an opposite kind that deserve at least equal attention. Of particular note is the lift in the household share of capital financing (saving) in 1974-75 <inline font-style="italic">at the same time as,</inline> rather than leading to the response of, a sharp increase in the government's own borrowing (deficit budgeting). The connection is to be found of course in the effect on household behaviour of inflation, inflationary expectations and uncertainty flowing from the policy environment of the time. As the inflation rate has been brought down and a measure of policy stability attained, reflecting both the stabilisation in public net borrowing and the associated conduct of monetary policy, the personal saving ratio has been coming down and the share of National Capital Funds from households falling towards its trend level. Total household spending has in the meantime grown moderately; so has corporate final demand (investment), particularly recently, being financed however with proportionately less borrowing by the corporate sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">That is one illustration of the influence of the structure and share of government expenditure, taxation and borrowing on private sector propensities to spend, save, invest and engage in productive activities. Such influences cannot be ignored, as they typically are by advocates of 'traditional' stabilisation policy, in addressing current economic problems. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Relative Prices and the Labour Market</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The sectoral movements just described are part and parcel of what was referred to above as the 'relative price' distortion. Against the background of this analysis of sector shares, specific attention is now directed to the labour market consequences. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It was shown in Part I that moderate product growth has been met in large part by increased product per unit of employment; employment growth, particularly for wage and salary earners, has remained sluggish and well below that required to check unemployment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These developments seem to owe much to the continuing process of adjustment of the market for labour to the rise in the real cost of labour over the early 1970s and the particularly rapid rise in 1974 (the unit factor cost counterpart of the aggregate share movements in Charts 9 and 10). Firms have naturally sought to offset this rise in costs by economising on labour input and substituting capital for labour. There has, moreover, been a marked shift within the workforce away from wage and salary earner employment to self-employment and contract labour (a good deal of which is also part-time). This shift reflects among other things the cost savings that can thereby be made by avoiding holiday pay, superannuation contributions, long service leave obligations and other loadings on basic pay rates which, between them, have been steadily pricing labour - and particularly inexperienced or unskilled labour - out of jobs. The influence of the whole framework of 'penalty rates' is also very evident in this area. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As noted, the relative unit prices of capital and labour are mirrored in their factor income shares; that the corporate sector's share has been supported through the tax system in the manner discussed above has not negated the consequences of these market forces for labour demand. It is true that, by lifting the post-tax profitability of firms, assistance through the taxation system is providing an incentive to invest and thus to growth in activity and employment in the sector producing investment goods. However, that very incentive to invest is, at any given level of output, favouring capital inputs at the expense of labour inputs and thus reinforcing the consequences for the labour market of the factor price distortion. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The possibility for. longer-term reconciliation of this seeming paradox lies in the higher rate of investment yielding greater than normal productivity gains, with these gains (and perhaps the 'normal' ones as well) accruing largely to the corporate sector for the time being. Given time, this would have the effect of correcting the factor share imbalance. There is a strong indication (see below) that a development of this kind has been in train. Indeed, unless there is faster progress through the arbitral tribunals in winding back the excessive level of real wages, the more prolonged route of gradually improving productivity will provide the only effective remedy for the still prevailing real wage/productivity imbalance. Unfortunately this remedy is at the expense of stronger growth in employment. The market's adjustment to correct for the persisting real wage overhang is, one way or another, inevitable. The only way in which the burden for that adjustment can be shifted from the unemployed is for some of it to be borne by those, more fortunate, who are employed - that is, for there to be a reduction in real wages. This is the issue to which, so far, neither the advocates of 'full indexation' nor the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission have been prepared to face up. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Statement No. 2 last year presented some measures of the real labour cost/ productivity imbalance - an imbalance which, of course, is also reflected in movements in factor income shares, although as time passes and the economy adjusts, factor shares become a less reliable guide to movements in the real labour cost imbalance. Last year's presentation is repeated in Chart 13 below; the unavailability of requisite employment data prevents updating beyond the December quarter of 1977. The chart shows that the imbalance, though lessening, was still large at the end of 1977; movements in relevant indicators since then suggest no major change in the imbalance. There has been some narrowing in recent years as a result of productivity growth, which is more marked for the non-farm 'market' sector than for the whole non-farm sector (see footnote to Chart 13). Even so, real labour costs remain a powerful incentive to labour shedding and capital-labour substitution. This constraint would seem to provide part of the explanation for the sluggish employment response of recent years, and hence, against the background of a growing work force, for the consequent growth of unemployment. Several other developments also not unrelated to the real labour cost situation - the relative decline in manufacturing, the rapid disappearance of excess demand in 1974 and the high labour force participation rate - also contributed. All in all, it has been noted that, whereas the fall in production in the most recent recession has not been as severe as in the 1951-52 and 1960-61 downturns, the deterioration in the labour market has been greater.'1' </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The inflation rate and the associated gross factor income share distortions and real wage/productivity imbalance have thus been important constraints on economic performance; to reduce these constraints has been a central objective of policy in recent years. As Chart 13 indicates, progress to date has stemmed mainly from productivity growth. As noted above, this is a possible 'capital accumulation' route to rectification of the imbalances. No doubt, <inline font-style="italic">if</inline> the economy could jump to the end of that process there might well be no remaining factor price imbalance even though the real wage might <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> have fallen in the interim. Unfortunately the economy cannot jump in that way: both commonsense and theory would suggest that the process is a slow one, and that there is little that can be done directly, outside the wage determination processes, to speed it up. The events of the past few years bear that out. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As has been the case since 1974, what <inline font-style="italic">could</inline> accelerate that otherwise drawnout process is a more rapid winding down of money wage' inflation. In circumstances such as the present, such deceleration might be matched by a more or less equal slowing in price increases so that, on balance, the real wage level might be little affected; evidence of the past few years, particularly in the wake of the 1976 devaluation, does indeed suggest that outcome. However, the lower price inflation rate would, of itself, be conducive to stronger private domestic and net overseas demand through the mechanisms described earlier and would thereby produce more rapid growth in activity and strengthen the demand for labour. This point is not well understood, discussion having usually focused erroneously on the proposition that an award wage increase less than the <inline font-style="italic">inherited</inline> rate of price increase would necessarily imply a reduction in the average real wage. Whether or not money wage restraint gave rise to real wage reductions - and it might well not - it must be judged the most efficacious way in which sustainable recovery could be more speedily achieved. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It follows that the stance of fiscal and monetary policy must continue to be supportive of wage and price restraint. Of course, direct government policy influence does not run beyond the general setting of those policies; the desired eventuality of wage increases running below the <inline font-style="italic">inherited</inline> rate of price change for a time lies very much in the hands of the arbitral tribunals. Such a <inline font-style="italic">desideratum</inline> has underpinned the Government's advocacy, for the past two and a half years, of a much smaller degree of wage indexation than that which has, to date, prevailed. As noted in the Budget Speech, it has also led the Government to consider whether it might not be able to exert greater influence in that direction. </para>
        <para class="block">Australia in the World Economic Situation </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Chart 14 presents indicators of growth and inflation for the OECD area, and provides comparisons with Australia. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the years of world economic downturn - 1974 and 1975 - product performance weakened less in Australia than in the OECD area generally. Thus, while the OECD area as a whole has recorded a stronger rate of expansion during the subsequent recovery, Australia's performance over a slightly longer span of the cycle compares not unfavourably. Moreover, the growth rate for the OECD area as a whole in recent years is heavily influenced by the strong recovery of the US economy, and to a lesser extent Germany and Japan, since 1975. The more typical experience abroad has been that of a modest and uneven pick-up since 1975; Australia's growth rate has been very similar to that of the OECD area excluding the three major industrial countries. The continuing upward drift of unemployment has also been a common experience; again, the strengthening of the US labour market is atypical. After a later start towards bringing inflation under control, Australia has now succeeded in lowering it approximately to the OECD average. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This international perspective adds an important dimension to a review of the Australian economy's current position. With a large degree of self-sufficiency in oil, and with longer-term contracts for a significant proportion of exports, Australia was relatively insulated from the direct effects of the oil price rises and for a time from the 1974 recession in the OECD area. However, the increasing malaise in the world steel industry since 1975, together with the continuing shake-out of international commodity markets generally, has increasingly acted as a constraint on Australia's own recovery. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Thus the continuing decline in Australia's terms of trade (Chart 15a), which owes a good deal to external influences in more recent years, has outweighed the strengthening, in volume terms, of the balance of trade in goods and services (Chart 15b). The result has been a widening of the current account deficit and a loss of real income which may well have acted to depress product growth. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">External prospects are discussed below. It suffices here to observe that, with continued progress in reducing domestic inflation, and given continued economic growth overseas, even at relatively modest rates, the external situation may become rather less of a constraint as the current year progresses. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">So much for Australia's own position in the world economic situation. However, the international perspective is also important in drawing out the similarities in the conjunctural positions confronting policy-makers in many countries. That is, notwithstanding some progress in terms of policy adjustments and improvements in key indicators, recovery generally remains sluggish, with labour markets continuing to weaken, while inflation remains uncomfortably and unacceptably high. As far as generalisations are possible within such a complexity of particulars, other national administrations are, like Australia's, espousing the reduction of inflation as a high priority in promoting sustainable economic growth. While in international fora some encouragement has been given to reflationary action by some countries, in accordance with the room for manoeuvre allowed by the constraints facing them - their degree of success in reducing inflation and their balance of payments positions - there remains a keen appreciation of the limited scope for such action and the need to avoid any relapse into higher inflation rates. This flavour was embodied in the communique issued on 15 June 1978 following the most recent OECD Ministerial Council meeting: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The scale and timing of expansionary action by this group [of stronger economies] should be determined in the light of their internal and external circumstances; in this respect a particular responsibility lies with countries in a strong balance of payments position. Such action should not undermine anti-inflationary policies. All other Member countries who are not currently in a position to take explicit action to expand domestic demand beyond what is now in prospect should concentrate primarily on reducing inflation and improving their balance of payments position.' </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Part II discusses the background of economic conditions and economic policy considerations which underlie the Government's approach in shaping this Budget and its immediate predecessors. The Budget is expected not only to contribute directly to the principal objectives of policy, but also to facilitate a further easing of the settings of monetary policy should circumstances unfold as foreseen. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The growth of Budget outlays in 1978-79 has been reduced to 7.7 per cent in nominal terms, compared with 11.1 per cent in 1977-78; receipts are budgeted to grow by 11.0 per cent, compared with 9.8 per cent in 1977-78. This yields a deficit of $2813 million, $521 million less than the 1977-78 outcome; the reduction in the domestic deficit is estimated at $782 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Within the composition of receipts and outlays there are several elements to be noted as background to a discussion of the outlook for the economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the absence of new taxation measures it is estimated that receipts would have risen by only 4± per cent. The additional revenue flowing from the new measures is in both the direct and indirect tax areas. There will thus be direct effects on disposable income and on general and relative prices from the Budget measures. These are discussed further below. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Real aggregate consumption spending seems unlikely to be greatly affected by the price changes although there could be noticeable short-term responses in the sales volumes of the commodities most affected (petroleum products, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and, in a positive direction, motor vehicles). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the outlays side, a disaggregation of outlays estimates by economic type is presented in Statement No.  1.  In general this indicates firm growth in nondefence current expenditure and transfers to the private sector, a smaller rise than last year in payments to States and local government, and a decline in Budget capital expenditure (see footnote (a) to table on page  4  qf Statement No.  1  concerning the special influences on these statistics).

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">The following assumptions, in addition to those embodied in the Budget estimates, underlie the overall forecast: © The broad aim of the Government's monetary policy remains the provision of adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down on inflation and inflationary expectations. Given the sizeable reduction now in prospect for the budgetary contribution to primary liquidity in  1978-79,  growth in  M3  in the range  6  to  8  per cent, which is seen as consistent with that broad objective, would be compatible with an assumption of further gradual easing in monetary ins', ruments during the course of the year.  o  A return to normal seasonal conditions in  1978-79  should see a fairly strong recovery in farm product after the  5  per cent fall in  1977-78. o  The forecasts assume continued moderate growth in economic activity and in most of Australia's export markets, and an improvement in Australia's relative inflation performance internationally.  A  continued program of Government borrowing overseas is assumed broadly to maintain reserves.  e  The forecasts adopt a strict 'existing arrangements' assumption concerning centralised wage determination. Following the current hearing into wage fixing principles it may well be that, as the Commonwealth has submitted, the system will involve hearings less frequently than at present. In that event projections for  1978-79  would be modified. Because of timing considerations the extent of the modification to the year-on-year increase in wages in  1978-79  would not be large; it would of course be greater in respect of subsequent periods. The Budget Speech discusses further the relationship between the fiscal and monetary environment and the outcome of the wage determination process. Because of the stage reached in the institutional developments in this area, wage inflation forecasts below are obviously subject to a more than usual degree of uncertainty. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The discussion in Part II has stressed the fundamental forces which have been and are still acting to constrain the process of recovery. The Budget, like its immediate predecessors, takes its place in a continuing medium-term policy strategy which is gradually succeeding in loosening those constraints. Given an absence of major unforeseen shocks, some confidence should therefore attach to the <inline font-style="italic">underlying</inline> trends already observable and which will further unfold in the period ahead, although differences of detail will doubtless emerge. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private consumption expenditure</inline>is expected to grow fairly strongly in 1978-79. Real household disposable income has been expanding under the influence of changes in the personal tax schedule and the firm recovery in farm incomes. Incomes have a good deal of scope to meet the increase in the standard rate of income tax announced in the Budget and that temporary impost is not seen as affecting real consumption growth more than marginally. The reduction in sales tax on motor vehicles should provide a substantial boost to that component of consumption expenditure; the other indirect tax changes will of course lead to some reductions in the level of consumption of those items. Factors which have lowered the saving ratio in recent years are still at work and the ratio is expected to fall further in 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private investment in dwellings,</inline>after recording a sizeable fall in 1977-78, is likely to pick ut somewhat ever the course of 1978-79. This scenario draws on recent estimates of loan approvals and of dwelling commencements although the strength of the recorded rise in dwelling investment in the June quarter has been discounted in view of the volatility of the commencements data over the past half year. The new degree of freedom for savings bank lending for housing referred to in the Budget Speech will be working to strengthen lending for housing. The growth in dwelling construction for the year is expected to be somewhat lower than the growth in aggregate mortgage lending, as excess stocks of unsold new dwellings continue to be cleared. Borrowers will probably maintain their enhanced preference for established dwellings; reduced rates of household formation, relative prices and locational preferences continue to condition the demand for new housing. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After recording real growth of 4.4 per cent in 1977-78, <inline font-style="italic">private business investment</inline> is expected to continue growing strongly in the present financial year. <inline font-style="italic">Private non-residential building and construction investment</inline> increased by 8.3 per cent in 1977-78 in real terms, albeit from a level of activity in 1976-77 that was the lowest for ten years. Activity slowed in the second half of 1977-78 but, on the evidence of approvals and commencements data, further growth in building and construction activity is in prospect for the coming year. Investment in the heavy <inline font-style="italic">construction</inline> area, in particular, should receive a continuing stimulus from new and expanding mining projects. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Investment in <inline font-style="italic">plant and equipment</inline> in 1978-79 is expected to rise by more than the 3.1 per cent preliminary estimate for the year just ended. The persistence of the factor price imbalance referred to earlier offers continuing incentive for investment in labour-saving equipment. Corporate cash flows, and financial conditions generally, should provide no impediments. Although the tax allowance for eligible investment was lowered from 40 per cent to 20 per cent from 1 July 1978, the higher allowance still applies to plant ordered prior to that date, provided it is installed by the end of the current financial year. Investment in 1978-79 will consequently continue to reflect the higher rate of allowance. Expanding activity in the mining sector is also likely to contribute to growth in this category of investment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The recorded growth of 5.5 per cent in <inline font-style="italic">government current expenditures</inline> in 1977-78 reflected growth at all levels of government. The Commonwealth Government component was bolstered statistically by the delivery of defence equipment, which will continue to lift national accounts estimates of Commonwealth Government expenditures in 1978-79. Growth in current expenditures for the public sector as a whole is expected to be less in 1978-79 than in 1977-78. <inline font-style="italic">Government capital expenditure,</inline> which rose by 0.5 per cent in 1977-78, again seems unlikely to show much if any growth in 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The foregoing assessment i; made against the background that, in practice, the distribution by State and local governments of total funds available to them between current and capital expenditures is, to a considerable extent, at their discretion. There is, therefore, some uncertainty as to the mie of public sector expenditures. The <inline font-style="italic">total,</inline> however, is not expected to grow by as much as the 3.8 per cent recorded in 1977-78. The ratio of total government expenditure on goods and services to gross non-farm product (see Chart 2), which peaked at 26.7 per cent in 1975-76, and which is estimated to have averaged 26.5 per cent in 1977-78, is expected to fall to around 26 per cent in the current financial year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A modest underlying decumulation of <inline font-style="italic">private non-farm stocks,</inline> which was masked in the March quarter 1978 by a substantial build-up of sugar stocks (refined sugar is included in non-farm stocks), is thought to have run its course by now and accumulation of stocks throughout 1978-79 is expected. <inline font-style="italic">Farm and miscellaneous stocks,</inline> especially of wheat, were run down substantially in 1977-78, primarily because of the drought and the resulting low levels of production. Stocks of some farm products, especially wheat, seem likely to build up in 1978-79 (largely in the second half) before being reflected in exports. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The present financial year is unlikely to see major changes in Australia's balance of payments position. The conjunction of a number of factors is likely to maintain a deficit in private sector external transactions and there will thus be a need for a continuation of the Government's overseas borrowing program, which has indeed already got under way in 1978-79. As the year proceeds, however, further improvement in Australia's relative inflation performance, and continued moderate recovery in overseas economic activity, should bring about an improved balance in private sector external transactions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At current prices, <inline font-style="italic">exports of goods and services</inline> may rise more rapidly in 1978-79 than in 1977-78, although overall volumes seem likely to remain subdued. Assuming continued moderate recovery in Australia's main export markets, non-rural export prices and volumes are expected to show modest growth in 1978-79. Rural export receipts should increase rather more strongly, but wholly on account of substantial rises in average export prices (particularly for meat and wheat); present constraints on the supply of several important commodities are likely to produce a decline in rural export volumes in 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Import values</inline>are forecast to rise more strongly than exports for 1978-79 as a whole. This outcome partly reflects the fact that imports at the beginning of the year were well above their average quarterly 1977-78 level. In addition, import volumes are expected to rise during 1978-79 in line with the continued growth in final spending and a turnaround in the stock cycle from decumulation to accumulation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The current account deficit in 1978-79 is expected to continue running at about the rate recorded in the second half of 1977-78. This would result in a higher deficit for 1978-79 than in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On <inline font-style="italic">capital account,</inline> it is expected that <inline font-style="italic">net apparent private capital inflow</inline> will strengthen gradually over the course of the year.

As the projected Budget domestic deficit means a lower direct contribution from that other major source of primary liquidity, the increase in private sector LGS and SRD assets in 1978-79, after allowance for other formation factors, could be comparable to the 1977-78 outcome. </para>

The investment and stock valuation tax allowances will continue to enhance the liquidity position of the sector; thus, even with the projected growth in private investment expenditures and the reversion to stock accumulation, the sector as a whole should have a net borrowing requirement in 1978-79 little different from that in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The balance of factors in the demand for and supply of funds can thus be expected to be conducive to interest rates declining gradually as the underlying inflation rate continues to fall. The outcome of policy as a whole and conditions generally should continue to foster an environment in which sales of Commonwealth Government securities to the private non-bank sector remain strong. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Growth in the broadly defined volume of money (M3) is projected to be in the range of 6 to 8 per cent during 1978-79; after allowance for the private sector external deficit, domestic credit expansion would be somewhat higher than that. Growth of this order in the money stock, given other elements of the outlook, would imply some continuation of the rising trend in the velocity of circulation observed over the past few years, which has remained compatible with a gradual decline in interest rates. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In contrast to the situation in 1977-78, the outlook described above for the balance of trade on goods and services implies a negative net contribution to product growth in 1978-79 from this source. However, this change should be more than compensated for by the expected move to stock accumulation and the somewhat faster expansion of domestic final demand (which increased by 2.5 per cent in 1977-78) in 1978-79. This combination of factors implies growth in <inline font-style="italic">gross non-farm product</inline> of around 4 per cent for 1978-79 as a whole; growth over the course of the year is likely to be similar. Given the expectation of much stronger growth in real <inline font-style="italic">farm product, gross domestic product</inline> would increase by something over 4 per cent in 1978-79 as a whole. These projections allow for a neutral contribution from the statistical discrepancy to year-on-year growth in product. The volatility and size of that component of the national accounts in recent times makes it difficult to attach any degree of precision to the estimates, and particularly to their pattern over the course of the year. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">With no immediate end in sight to the continuing cost disincentive to the demand for labour, <inline font-style="italic">employment</inline> gains in 1978-79 are likely to be moderate. On the evidence of the past few years, growth in <inline font-style="italic">product per unit of non-farm employment</inline> over the course of 1978-79 could be expected to be at least 2 per cent. As a result of a steady shift towards self-employment and contract labour - much of it part-time - total wage and salary earner employment appears to have shown little growth over the past three years. After allowance for some slowing in this compositional drift in 1978-79, wage and salary earner employment might increase slightly over the course of the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The projected growth in total non-farm employment is lower than the underlying trend rate of growth in the supply of labour. With the present rates of natural population growth and the likely net intake of migrants, the <inline font-style="italic">labour force</inline> could be expected to grow by at least <inline font-style="italic">H</inline> per cent and possibly as much as 2 per cent over the course of 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The precise outcome depends on the labour force <inline font-style="italic">participation rate.</inline> As discussed in Part I, while there is some doubt as to the reliability of recent recorded movements in the labour force data, there has been a slight underlying fall in the participation rate over recent times. If that trend were to continue, growth in the labour force would be toward the lower end of the range mentioned above, in which case recorded <inline font-style="italic">unemployment</inline> would show little change in underlying terms over the course of the year. An unchanged participation rate or re-emergence of an upward trend in the rate would be accompanied by a further rise in unemployment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A situation of persistent under-utilisation of available labour resources is, on mounting evidence, a seemingly inescapable consequence if the cost of labour, and particularly some categories thereof, continues to be excessive (see Part II). Only with a break-through by way of a reduction of the rate of money wage increases could a significantly brighter outlook for unemployment in 1978-79  be  expected. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">As stated above, the wage rate forecasts take as a working assumption continuation of the present wage determination system; they assume continuation of quarterly hearings and adjustment of awards for approximately 75 per cent, on average, of the undiscounted rises in the CPI, an assumption which represents the average of indexation decisions in 1977-78. <inline font-style="italic">Award wages</inline> are projected to rise by about 6 per cent in 1978-79. Some allowance has been made for some increase in overtime hours and some small 'slippage' outside the wage determination guidelines. As noted in the discussion of the revenue estimates in Statement No. 4, the estimate that has been adopted for average weekly earnings is an increase of 7i per cent in 1978-79. That would be accompanied by a less rapid increase over the course of the year. Average weekly earnings are estimated to have risen by 9.8 per cent in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The corresponding price forecasts are for a rise in the <inline font-style="italic">consumer price index</inline> in 1978-79 of around 6 per cent, compared with <inline font-style="italic">9t</inline> per cent in the previous year. These forecasts embody a reduction in the December quarter CPI as a result of Budget measures. The indirect price effects of the accelerated move to import parity for crude oil will take some time to flow through into final expenditure deflators but that response can be expected to moderate slightly the deceleration in prices that is foreseen over the course of 1979. Even so, a further steady slowing in the rate of inflation is projected with an on-going rate approaching 5 per cent per annum being attained in mid-1979 or perhaps before that time. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because of different composition and weighting patterns the <inline font-style="italic">consumption deflator</inline> is expected to increase by about 1 percentage point more than the CPI in year-on-year terms; this would mean an increase 2 percentage points lower than its 9 per cent rise in 1977-78. This general picture is also expected to hold for the more broadly defined <inline font-style="italic">deflator of major gross national expenditure components;</inline> however, given the projected improvement in the terms of trade, the <inline font-style="italic">aggregate non-farm product deflator</inline> would not show as marked a slowing. Although the improvement in the terms of trade is expected to be sizeable, offsetting volume movements imply a negative contribution to growth in aggregate incomes in 1978-79 from the external sector. All price estimates allow for some recovery in the gross profit share. More favourable wage developments and/or a slower rise in unit profits would mean lower inflation rates than those mentioned above. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">If the foregoing outlook is realised, at least in the broad, then by mid- 1979 further significant progress will have been made in correcting the imbalances that remain in the economy. The one front on which little early progress is currently in sight is the labour market, an area where improvement depends importantly on participants other than the Government. As discussed in Part II above, it is no coincidence that wage and salary earner employment has changed little over the past several years in the face of reasonable increases in overall activity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The employment, price inflation and activity forecasts described above are heavily dependent on the wage inflation prospect. Should parties to wage determination and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission place greater weight on the view that wage increases are retarding employment recovery, the outlook would be brighter. If, for example, average awards were to be adjusted during 1978-79 by 50 per cent of past price increases (compared with the 75 per cent assumption mentioned above), and there were a move to less frequent wage hearings, then average weekly earnings could grow by 6 per cent or less in 1978-79. Such an eventuality would strengthen the outlook for activity and employment beyond that suggested in this review. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The following chart gives a broad impression of the relative size of the major functional blocks of total outlays and recent and projected movements in those proportions. It is emphasized that changes in these functional blocks from one year to another are affected by a number of special factors, such as introduction of family allowances in 1976-77, large repayments by the Australian Wool Corporation in 1976-77 and 1977-78, and changes in administrative arrangements, particularly those relating to the transfer of functions to the Northern Territory as part of the self-government arrangements. </para>

This estimate, which is at May 1978 prices (plus June National Wage), does not make any provision for increases in wages and salaries of defence personnel or other possible cost increases during 1978-79; provision for wage and salary increases is, however, included in the separate bulk allowance of $50 million. The total provision of $2500.9 million implies an increase of about 1 per cent in real terms over 1977-78. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Provision has been made for a net increase of $59.8 million in defence manpower costs in 1978-79. The main reasons for the increase are the full-year effects of awards and determinations made in 1977-78 and increases in service strengths. Service manpower increases of 220 are provided for the manning of new equipment coming into service. The estimates also take into account a reduction of 425 in civilian personnel, with the rundown occurring largely in the latter part of the financial year. The main factors accounting for the net increase of $16.6 million in the defence forces retirement and death benefits provision are the annual update of pension rates in July 1978 in line with the increase in the Consumer Price Index; and the number of new pensioners, estimated at 1484, about the same number as in 1977-78, who will enter the scheme during 1978-79. Defence manpower costs, including those in this category, are estimated to account for 56 per cent of total defence outlays in 1978-79, about the same as 1977-78. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on defence equipment and stores are intended to ensure that operational equipment (ships, aircraft, armour, artillery, etc.) are adequate to meet likely contingencies. Outlays on 'capital' type equipment in 1978-79 are estimated at $354.5 million, or $39.7 million more than in 1977-78. This amount makes provision for many on-going acquisitions of new equipment, including 3 patrol frigates, and 15 patrol boats for the Navy; 101 Leopard medium tanks and 20 Rapier surface to air guided missile fire units for the Army; and 12 Hercules CI 30 aircraft, 10 Orion long-range maritime patrol aircraft and ancillary equipment for F111C aircraft for the RAAF.

        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on supporting equipment and store;; - such as ammunition, rations, clothing, etc. for the maintenance of the forces - is estimated at $246.5 million in 1978-79, an increase of $19.7 million over 1977-78. Outlays on repair and maintenance of equipment and stores already in service - including periodic refit of naval vessels and overhaul of service aircraft, vehicles, etc. - is estimated to increase by $10.0 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This category includes most of the periodic payments, estimated to total $156 million in 1978-79, into the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Trust Account. The FMS Trust Account is an account established and controlled by the US Department of Defense to record transactions relating specifically to Australia's acquisition of military equipment and stores through the US Defense Security Assistance Agency.

Future arrangements for Service housing are currently under examination. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The balance of the total reduction of $21.9 million in the Defence Facilities category stems from the priorities accorded to the many competing claims on the funds available for defence purposes. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A large proportion of the expenditure envisaged in 1978-79 is for projects that were committed in 1977-78 and earlier years. These include the establishment of a naval supply centre in the former Leyland property at Zetland (NSW), construction of new accommodation for Army personnel at Randwick (NSW), development of facilities at Edinburgh (SA) for the operation of long-range maritime patrol aircraft, and acquisition of large tracts of land at Yampi (WA) for use as a training area and at Puckapunyal (Vic.) for tank exercises. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on new works projects in 1978-79 is estimated at $15.3 million. Significant works to be commenced include a further major phase in the development of Williamstown Dockyard (Vic); provision of facilities at Garden Island Dockyard (NSW) for the patrol frigates on order, including an upgraded power supply system, a new crane and a comprehensive repair workshop; the first phase of new working accommodation for the Army at Enoggera (Qld); and commencement of new facilities at Pearce ( WA) . </para>

Other expenditures relate to the costs of production/development of special defence projects in government factories, such as the Ikara antisubmarine weapon system and the Turana target drone system, and in industry; the continuing development and production of Nomad aircraft; and the acquisition and maintenance of reserve stocks of essential war material. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on defence science and technology is aimed at assisting the Services to keep abreast of advances in defence technology and at developing weapons and weapon systems suited to Australia's defence needs. The estimated expenditure of $91.3 million in 1978-79 covers the salaries, other administrative and operating expenses, machinery, plant and works services of defence science establishments and laboratories, and the Woomera range. A reduction in overall manpower levels is planned in 1978-79 but provision has been made for continuation of a modest level of trials activity at Woomera, in conjunction with the United Kingdom in particular. Provision has also been made for funds to enable further development of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The net reduction of $1.9 million in respect of this category of expenditure reflects the transfer of financial transactions relating to Woomera Village to a Trust Account titled 'Defence Support Centre Woomera Trust Account'. Australia's payments to the Trust Account are recorded under General Administrative Expenditure. </para>
        <para class="block">Defence Co-operation </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Through defence co-operation the Government aims to help friendly countries in the region to strengthen their own and the region's defence capacity. Estimated expenditure of $24.6 million in 1978-79 includes $6.9 million in assistance to Indonesia for such purposes as survey and mapping work in Irian Jaya, provision of Nomad aircraft, Sioux Helicopters and Patrol Craft, as well as training in support, maintenance and communications skills. Continuing assistance is also provided for Malaysia ($3.6 million) and Singapore ($0.5 million). Bilateral programs with these two countries include the Armed Forces Manufacturing Workshop, the Special Warfare Centre Project, the Defence Research Centre Project (Malaysia) and the Cataloguing Project (Singapore). Training assistance and combined exercising are also important aspects of defence co-operation with Malaysia and Singapore. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $12.0 million is included for defence co-operation activities with Papua New Guinea in 1978-79. The decrease from $14.6 million in 1977-78 reflects the progressive reduction in numbers and support costs of Australian servicemen in Papua New Guinea in line with the continuing localisation of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. Project assistance in Papua New Guinea includes the provision of Nomad aircraft and communication and radar equipment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A large part of the increased allocation of $1.6 million for 'other countries' is devoted to the development of a co-operative relationship in defence matters with countries of the South West Pacific.

        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth fully funds the operations of all universities and colleges of advanced education through the Tertiary Education Commission. The estimates for 1978-79 comprise broadly the second half of the 1978 programs and the first half of the 1979 programs. Details of the 1979 programs were announced by the Minister for Education on 9 June. In real terms the base programs for 1979 imply a decrease of about 2 per cent compared with 1978. This reduction will be confined to capital expenditures; recurrent expenditures are expected to increase slightly so as to sustain intakes of students at present levels in 1979, which implies a projected small increase in total enrolments in universities and CAE's in 1979. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commission has been requested, however, to do what it can to achieve further reductions in intakes to pre-service teacher education courses in view of the present and prospective surplus in the supply of teachers. </para>

Staff recruitment for the College has begun and a training vessel is expected to be acquired in 1978-79.

        <para pgwide="yes">The estimates for 1978-79 in the table are in estimated June 1978 prices. The wage and salary components of recurrent grants to universities and CAE's - which make up the bulk of total grants - are subject to escalation in line with increases in wages and salaries. Provision for such increases is included in the bulk provision of $45 million which appears in the table (see below). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government has decided, with a view to facilitating more orderly planning in the tertiary sector, to reintroduce fixed triennial funding in 1979-81 in respect of recurrent grants other than equipment grants. Under these arrangements recurrent funding (excluding equipment) for universities and CAE's in 1980 and 1981 will be maintained at the same levels in real terms as those approved for 1979. Funds for equipment and for capital works will be determined annually. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In July 1977 the Government requested the Tertiary Education Commission to examine study leave and staff development leave schemes in universities and colleges of advanced education and to report on the desirability of modifications to those schemes. A Working Party appointed by the Commission released its draft report in April 1978. The Working Party concluded that the existing schemes require substantial revision to better accord with contemporary circumstances. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commission has indicated general support for the Working Party's conclusions but, before finalising its Report, the Commission has invited comments from interested persons and organisations. The Commission's final report is expected to be completed shortly. As announced in the Budget Speech the Government also has been considering possible action to change present arrangements for study leave in universities and colleges of advanced education but will await the final report of the Commission before announcing its decisions. </para>

The bulk allowance of $45 million included in the Budget figures (roughly $33 million for tertiary sector programs and $12 million for schools) is an estimate of the supplementation which will become necessary during 1978-79 on account of increases in costs of the relevant components. Because of lags in identifying the actual increases, the supplementation payments provided for in 1978-79 will relate mainly to cost increases for the 1978 programs of the Commissions.

It is designed also to compensate veterans for war-caused disabilities and the dependants of those whose deaths are war-related and to assist parents with the expenses associated with raising children. </para>

When the death of a veteran has been accepted as related to his service, his widow qualifies for the war widow's rate of pension and for associated benefits, while his children each receive pensions at 'orphan' rates and other benefits. If a veteran's death has not been accepted as related to service, but at the time of death he was receiving, or is later adjudged to have been eligible to receive, a pension at the Special Rate or as a double amputee, his dependants qualify for pensions as if his death had been accepted as related to service.

Home purchase assistance will be directed to those who are unable to obtain mortgage finance in the private market. The Agreements will not, however, impose specific means tests or prescribe how assistance is to be provided; each State will be able to determine for itself the conditions of eligibility for home purchase assistance and to apply its funds to schemes of its own choosing. Assistance will be provided on flexible terms so as to limit concessions, as far as practicable, to the period of real need.

        <para pgwide="yes">Direct industry assistance takes the form of bounties and subsidies, reconstruction, adjustment and emergency relief schemes, contributions to research and promotion programs, disease eradication schemes, price support and other payments to or for the benefit of industry. It includes some outlays by Government departments and instrumentalities (e.g., the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Primary Industry, Trade and Resources and the Australian Tourist Commission) which provide many services either free of charge or for charges which do not recover fully the costs incurred. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Apart from these direct outlays from the Budget, substantial additional assistance has been provided through the Budget by way of special taxation concessions which, as they result in a reduction of Government revenues, are as much a call on the Budget as are direct outlays. The amount of revenue forgone in 1977-78 through the main taxation concessions for which data are available is estimated to have been in excess of $820 million. Further information relating to these taxation concessions is provided following the commentary on direct assistance to various industry categories. </para>

It is this reduction of $87 million in repayments to the Commonwealth which is responsible for the change in net outlays on direct assistance for wool marketing; if repayments of advances made to the Corporation in earlier years are excluded, there is no change in net outlays between the two years. </para>

This scheme, to apply from the 1979 season, is intended to replace the industry's voluntary equalisation arrangements. Under the scheme, levies equivalent to the difference between assessed average domestic and export returns would be raised on production of each variety of fruit, but with exemptions for production which was exported. These levies, together with export returns in excess of the assessed average export return, would be paid into equalisation funds and disbursement would be made to packers to achieve the equalised return. No levy receipts or disbursements under this scheme are expected in 1978-79. </para>

Under this scheme (which replaced the Rural Reconstruction Scheme, the Dairy Adjustment Program and the joint Commonwealth/State scheme of carry-on finance for specialist beef producers) assistance is made available to the States for purposes of farm debt reconstruction, farm build-up, farm improvement and rehabilitation, carry-on finance and household support. Assistance for debt reconstruction, farm build-up, farm improvement and rehabilitation is made available by the Commonwealth on an overall 85 per cent loan/ 15 per cent grant basis, with the Commonwealth contributing a further amount to assist in defraying administrative expenses. For the household support component the Commonwealth finances all assistance and contributes towards administrative expenses; the States repay to the Commonwealth all principal and interest recouped by them. For carry-on finance, the States share equally with the Commonwealth both the financing of loans (and administrative costs) and all principal and interest payments received from producers. The Scheme was modified during 1977-78 to provide for more liberal conditions of carry-on finance for beef producers and household support, and to make wine-grape growers eligible for carry-on finance.

The double depreciation scheme was extended in both time and coverage in 1975 but when the income tax law was amended to provide a new investment allowance, provision was also made for the discontinuar.ee of the double depreciation scheme for plant first used or installed after 30 June 1976. The new investment allowance is applicable to new plant and equipment purchased, leased or constructed under a contract made on or after 1 January 1976.

        <para pgwide="yes">Such concessions result in a reduction of, or a delay in the receipt of, Commonwealth revenue (and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients). They are, in fact, as much a call on the Budget as equivalent direct outlays would be, and for this reason have sometimes been described as disguised expenditures. Assistance of this type through the taxation system has been provided mainly by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their assessable income additional to those authorised under the general provisions of the income tax law. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The amount of revenue forgone in 1977-78 through the main taxation concessions is estimated to have been in excess of S820 million. Details are shown below.

        <para pgwide="yes">Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely: </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1977-78 under the main provisions in categories A and B are shown in the following table. A miscellany of other provisions is not included, in some cases because of lack of data on revenue forgone or questions about the extent to which they may properly be regarded as wholly 'Industry Assistance'. These provisions include the concession whereby primary producers are allowed to adopt artificially low values for natural increase in their livestock accounts for taxation purposes; drought bonds and income equalisation deposits; and the accelerated depreciation of expenditure on employees' amenities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The averaging provisions applied to primary producers are also not included. Taxpayers to whom these provisions apply are assessed on their taxable incomes for the current year at rates of tax corresponding to the lesser of the taxable income for the current year and the average of their incomes for the current year and the preceding four years. The purpose of the provisions is to ensure that <inline font-style="italic">fluctuations</inline> in income in conjunction with progression in rates of tax do not lead to those taxpayers bearing higher tax rates than other taxpayers having incomes which, over a period of years, are comparable but non-fluctuating. The effects go beyond that when there is an upward trend in incomes over a number of years and, even if there are fluctuations in income superimposed on that trend, the averaging provisions result in the taxpayers covered by them bearing lower tax rates than other taxpayers whose incomes over a period of years are comparable. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Even in the absence of an upward trend in income, the effects can go beyond levelling out the treatments, because of the provisions introduced in 1977-78 which, in effect, permit averaging to be applied only in years when it benefits the taxpayer and tax at ordinary rates in other years. </para>

Rebates are set at $12 per day for apprentices attending stages 1 and 2 of a basic trade course, increasing to $16 per day for stages 3 and 4, if not completed in the first year.

As announced in the Budget Speech, the period of training under SYETP is to be reduced from six to four months in 1978-79 and the rate of wage subsidy payable to employers will be reduced from $67 a week for training to $45 a week; this will bring SYETP allowances more closely into line with other NEAT training allowances and is intended to correct the present tendency for SYETP to favour unduly younger age groups to the detriment of older age groups. Of the estimated total throughput of about 110 000 trainees under NEAT in 1978-79 about 80 000 are expected to be trained under SYETP. </para>

The cost to revenue of this measure in 1977-78 was about $400 million;  o  the trading stock valuation adjustment, estimated to cost $307 million in 1978-79, compared with $316 million in 1977-78; and ° the investment allowance, estimated to cost $410 million in 1978-79, compared with $325 million in 1977-78 and $100 million in 1976-77. </para>

From that date PAYE deductions will increase by an amount designed to make deductions received over 1978-79 broadly equivalent to the increased tax to be assessed on the income of 1978-79 as a whole. Allowing for a month's lag in PAYE collections (PAYE deductions made by an employer in one month are not received by the Taxation Office until the next month) this means, in effect, that the rise in PAYE deductions from 1 November 1978 to 30 June 1979 will be increased by the factor 12/7.

Provisional tax based on the previous year's income is calculated by applying, unindexed, the previous year's rate scale. If, however, the taxpayer elects to self-assess, the current year's indexed rate scale is applied to the estimate of taxable income to derive the amount of provisional tax payable. In line with these procedures, basic provisional tax in respect of 1978-79 will be calculated on 1977-78 income at 1977-78 "composite scale" rates plus the additional11/2 per cent applied to taxable income in excess of $3402. Self-assessed provisional tax in respect of 1978-79 will be calculated by applying the 1978-79 rate scale, including a standard rate of 331/2 per cent, to estimated 1978-79 income. </para>

The cost to revenue of the investment allowance and the trading stock valuation adjustment in respect of other individuals is expected to be a little higher in 1978-79 ($144 million) than in 1977-78 ($135 million). As noted above the temporary increase in the standard rate will affect collections in 1978-79 as will several of the other measures affecting individual income taxation. </para>

An estimated $15 million of the increase relates to payments from non-resident companies on account of the branch profits tax to apply to that part of the 1977-78 tax year after 4 November 1977. The relatively low increase in prospective collections reflects subdued growth in company incomes during 1977-78; in addition, the investment allowance is estimated to reduce revenue from companies by $300 million in 1978-79, compared with $225 million in 1977-78. The trading stock valuation adjustment for companies involves an estimated cost to revenue of $273 million in 1978-79 ($281 million in 1977-78). </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The increase of $4.1 million in revenues from broadcasting and television station licence fees reflects mainly the increase in gross earnings of stations in 1977-78 on which fees are payable in 1978-79. The increased revenue expected in respect of radio-communications licence fees results mainly from the full-year effect of the 1977 increase in licence fees (from $20 per year to $25 per year). About 240 000 civil stations and 160 000 Citizens Band operators are currently licensed and those numbers are expected to increase slightly during 1978-79. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The further decline in receipts from the stevedoring industry charge reflects the effect of the changed arrangements operative since December 1977. Under these arrangements the industry itself has assumed responsibility for certain payments made previously by the Stevedoring Industry Authority and subsequently recouped through the stevedoring industry charge. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total collections of miscellaneous taxes and charges in the territories are expected to remain at much the same level as in 1977-78. From 1 July 1978 the Northern Territory Government has been collecting directly a number of the taxes, fees and fines collected previously by the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory. Offsetting this reduction are increases totalling $4.1 million in receipts from A.C.T. rates and other levies.

Interest  received from the States, the bulk of which is in respect of advances for general purpose works and housing programs, is estimated to increase by $106.6 million to $1280.8 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other interest receipts are estimated to decline by $5.0 million. Interest receipts from the Australian Wool Corporation are estimated to be only $1.2 million in 1978-79 compared with $8.9 million in 1977-78; the Corporation has now repaid almost all advances previously made to it from the Budget. In recent years both the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian Shipping Commission have raised loans on their own behalf and, as a consequence, reduced their drawings from the Budget. That factor has contributed to the overall decline in other interest receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Rent and dividends are estimated to increase by a net $6.7 million. Provision is made for a dividend of $6.4 million from Qantas in respect of 1977-78 operations; the previous dividend payment from Qantas was in 1975-76. The increase of $5 million in offshore petroleum royalties reflects an increase in the proportion of oil production attracting import parity prices.

        <para pgwide="yes">The payment of $216 million to the Commonwealth in 1977-78 from the profits of the Reserve Bank was made up of $126 million as the Commonwealth share of 1976-77 profits and an interim payment of $90 million from the Note Issue Department profits for 1977-78. This was the first such interim payment since 1971-72. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget provides for payment of $262.9 million in 1978-79 made up of $92.9 million as the balance of the Commonwealth share of 1977-78 profits and $170 million from expected profits of the Note Issue Department in 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Prior to 1967-68 the whole of the net profits of the Note Issue Department in each financial year were paid to the Commonwealth in that year. In succeeding years, drawings by the Reserve Bank on the operating profits of the Note Issue Department were made to assist in liquidating exchange losses, with the amount, if any, remaining available for payment to the Commonwealth being determined after the close of the profit year. Following a very marked increase in 1977-78 in the Reserve Bank's reserves, the likelihood of any significant call on the operating earnings of the Note Issue Department to meet contingencies is greatly diminished and it can therefore be expected that the full profits for 1978-79 will be payable to the Commonwealth. Provision is therefore being made for receipt by the Commonwealth this year of $170 million from expected 1978-79 Note Issue Department profits. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth Banking Corporation is expected to pay $28.2 million to the Commonwealth in 1978-79, representing one half of the net profits for 1977-78 of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Responsibility for the supply of electricity in the Northern Territory was transferred to the Northern Territory upon attainment of self-government on 1 July 1978. The 1978-79 revenues of $3.5 million are in respect of electricity operations prior to the transfer. In 1977-78 the figures reflect the loss on electricity operations in the Northern Territory, but in 1978-79 this is subsumed in the global allocation to the Territory (see Statement No. 3). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 'other' category includes an estimate of $2.6 million for Northern Territory water and sewerage revenues attributable to operations in previous years, to be collected by the Northern Territory and paid to the Commonwealth in 1978-79. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays in 1977-78 exceeded the Budget estimate by $146 million (0.5 per cent) while total receipts fell short by $970 million (4.0 per cent). As a result the deficit of $3333 million exceeded the Budget estimate by $1117 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As the summary table indicates, the increase in the deficit was attributable mainly to the shortfall in receipts. This in turn reflected shortfalls in several items but especially collections of income tax from other individuals (generally provisional taxpayers) and net collections from PAYE taxpayers (mainly because of higher than estimated refunds). The small over-run on outlays was more than accounted for by increased natural disaster relief payments ($44 million) and by post-Budget decisions, including the provision of assistance for beef producers ($85 million), for mining operations at Mary Kathleen and Mt Lyell ($11 million in total) and for sole fathers ($8 million). </para>

This increase reflected mainly salary and wage increases awarded during the year. (Provision was made for these increases in the bulk allowance for wage and salary increases rather than in the Defence estimates - see footnote to above table). Other variations from the estimates were offsetting. General administrative expenditure exceeded the Budget estimate by $11 million, of which $5 million was accounted for by increased travelling and subsistence and reflected higher than expected discharges and consequential postings; cost increases and a higher than expected level of compensation claims also contributed to the over-run here. Outlays on defence facilities were $6 million less than estimated, mainly on account of a shortfall of $4 million in advances to the States for service housing. Recoveries were $6 million more than estimated and reflected greater recoveries from other Governments. </para>

Outlays on education programs for migrants and refugees were $4 million more than estimated and reflected post-budget decisions in October 1977 and March 1978 to increase the level of activity under the adult migrant education program and to provide postarrival services for an increased refugee intake. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on health fell short of the Budget estimate by $115 million. Medibank medical payments were $91 million less than estimated partly because usage of medical services was lower than estimated; this factor also contributed to a shortfall of $7 million in pharmaceutical services benefits. Assistance for community health facilities was $6 million less than estimated, reflecting lower claims by the States. Private health insurance funds did not seek their full entitlements under the hospitals insurance subsidy arrangements and this resulted in a further shortfall of $6 million. Outlays on health services in the Territories also fell short of the estimate by $6 million, reflecting relatively small variations over a large number of items. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These shortfalls were partly offset by over-runs in a few areas. Payments for hospital benefits reinsurance were $9 million more than estimated, reflecting the drawing down of the balance of the Hospital Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund accumulated in the previous year. Nursing home benefits were $4 million higher than estimated at Budget time because the number of eligible patients was higher. Nursing care and medical services for veterans exceeded the Budget estimate by a total of $6 million, reflecting a higher demand for services together with increased charges for nursing home accommodation (effective from 1 October 1977) and increased fees for various medical practitioners (effective from 1 January 1978). </para>

In all these cases the numbers of benefit recipients were greater than had been estimated at Budget time. Supporting parents' benefits cost $8 million more than had been estimated, mainly because of the introduction of a sole fathers' benefit during the year. Partly offsetting these increases were shortfalls in respect of family allowances ($11 million less than estimated, primarily because of the introduction of a new system for reviewing family allowance entitlements for students over 16 years of age) and of homeless persons assistance ($4 million less, because of delays associated with some construction projects). </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">The manner in which the Budget deficit in 1977-78 was financed is summarised in Tables 1 and 2. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Table 1 is the presentation of Budget financing transactions, as published monthly in the Statement of Commonwealth Government Financing Transactions, rearranged to indicate the concept of <inline font-style="italic">Domestic Borrowings</inline> and its composition; see Statement No. 5 attached to the 1977-78 Budget Speech. While this presentation is useful for purposes of describing aggregate financing transactions - and in particular the <inline font-style="italic">securities</inline> (financing instruments) involved in those transactions - it does not bring out the net changes in the holdings of government debt of the various sectors with which the Budget sector transacts. This further information is relevant to analysis of the monetary implications of the financing transactions. Portfolio movements, reflecting both net proceeds (subscriptions to new issues less redemptions) and subsequent market transactions in government securities, are shown in Table 2. The link between the tables is Domestic Borrowings. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As defined here, Domestic Borrowings is that portion of the Budget deficit financed by the issue of Commonwealth securities to domestic non-budget sectors or by the use (running-down) of Commonwealth cash balances with the Reserve Bank (see footnote (c) to Table 2). Subject to minor qualifications set out in Statement No. 5 attached to the 1977-78 Budget Speech, Domestic Borrowings thus represents the increase in the indebtedness of the Commonwealth to domestic non-Budget sectors arising from Budget financing. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Economic effects of financing transactions depend importantly on which of the non-Budget sectors hold the stock of government debt and the changes in those holdings. Private sector holdings of Commonwealth debt constitute the bulk of the liquidity base of the economy (see also footnote (b) to Table 2). Private sector take-up of Commonwealth debt instruments reflects a large number of influences on domestic liquidity conditions, including the size of Domestic Borrowings, interest rates, private sector external transactions and Reserve Bank transactions with the private sector. Other things being equal, take-up of government securities by the non-bank private sector provides an offset to the direct increase in banking sector liquidity and the volume of money that would otherwise accompany an increase in the domestic liquidity base. Table 2 therefore distinguishes between banks and non-banks and, within each category, the major institutional groups which it is useful, and possible with available data, to identify. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Changes</inline>in debt by the main <inline font-style="italic">forms</inline> of security are also shown. This too is relevant information for the analysis of the economic impact of Budget financing transactions, although a full exposition would go beyond the fairly direct effects of those transactions reflected in Table 2. Other relevant effects include those on the maturity structure of the stock of government debt in private portfolios, the level and structure of interest rates and associated expectations. </para>

Also in September a Schuldscheindarlehen - a form of loan offered by German commercial banks - and a direct bank loan were undertaken in Germany; the proceeds amounted to $97 million and $194 million respectively. A DM1250 million borrowing package' was completed in October with two further operations in Germany: a $97 million private placement and a public issue of $98 million. In November, $199 million was raised through a public issue on the New York capital market. The Commonwealth's second public bond issue in Japan, which was undertaken in February 1978, produced $184 million. A further Eurodollar bond issue was undertaken in March and $306 million was raised. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In terms of percentage increases, the experience in 1976-77 and 1977-78 represented a return to the more 'normal' rates of increase recorded in the late sixties-early seventies and was in marked contrast to the rapid acceleration in outlays over the period 1973-74 to 1975-76. The increase of 7.7 per cent projected for total outlays in 1978-79 is the lowest increase since 1968-69 (6.2 per cent). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expressed as a proportion of GDP it can be seen that total outlays remained very steady around 24-25 per cent until 1974-75 when the proportion jumped to over 29 per cent, and to over 30 per cent in 1975-76. Since then the proportion has edged back marginally, with sluggish growth in GDP in recent years contributing to the limited extent of the decline. On the basis of the projected increase in outlays of 7.7 per cent, however, a further reduction in the ratio can be expected in 1978-79. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Budget transactions classified by function for the period 1968-69 to 1977-78 are shown in Tables 1 and 3 at the end of this Statement; Table 2 shows the proportions of total outlays represented by the major functional and subfunctional blocks over this period. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the nine year period to 1977-78, total Budget outlays have grown at an average annual rate of 16.9 per cent. Outlays for 'Education', 'Health' and Social Security and Welfare' have grown much faster than this and have accounted for over half of the total increase over the period. The following table shows the rates of increase for the main outlay categories for the period as a whole: </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Comparisons of trends over the period covered in the tables are affected by a number of important factors, including the transfer of payroll tax to the States, 'offsets' to grants to the States, changes in the operation of certain retirement benefits schemes, changes in the arrangements for funding tertiary education, the introduction of family allowances, changes in health care funding arrangements, the transfer of the South Australian and Tasmanian railways to the Commonwealth, the granting of self-government to the Northern Territory and off-budget funding of the capital program of the Australian Telecommunications Commission. These and other factors, such as differential rates of price increase among functions, affect the relative rates of growth and should be borne in mind when comparing movements in different categories of expenditure. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Average annual rates of increase over a period of years can, of course, mask significant changes within that period. The charts below give a broad indication of movements within each of the main functional blocks of outlays. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Details of Commonwealth Budget sector receipts for the period 1968-69 to 1977-78, together with the 1978-79 estimates, are shown in Table 5 at the end of this Statement. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total Budget receipts have increased at an average annual rate of 16.7 per cent in the period since 1968-69, compared with a rate of growth of 15.3 per cent in GDP over the same period. As the following table shows, the rate of increase in Budget receipts has slowed significantly in recent years, and specially in 1977-78. The projected increase of 11 per cent in 1978-79 reflects in large part the revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Income tax on individuals remains by far the most important single category of Budget receipts. Expressed as a proportion of total receipts income tax collections from individuals have risen from 38.2 per cent of total receipts in 1968-69 to 51.7 per cent in 1977-78. This increase stems largely from the effects of 'the progressive rate scale in a period of strong growth in personal incomes, particularly wage and salary incomes. This growth occurred despite various adjustments to the rate scale and other elements of the personal income tax system that &lt; were made over the period with a view to reducing rates of tax for most taxpayers. The figures for 1976-77 and 1977-78 reflect, inter alia, the net effects of the introduction of personal income tax indexation, the abolition of tax rebates for dependent children and students which accompanied the introduction of family allowances, and the imposition of the Health Insurance Levy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Movements in some other categories of receipts are also affected by certain special factors: 'Other General Taxation', for example, is affected by the transfer to the States in September 1971 of payroll tax and the decision to abolish broadcast listeners' and television viewers' licences from September 1974. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In each of the past ten years there has been an overall deficit in the Commonwealth's budgetary transactions. The following table shows the size of the total deficit in relation to GDP since 1968-69. Also shown are the estimated 'domestic' deficits (see below). These deficits increased sharply in 1974-75 and 1975-76 when the overall deficit was equivalent to over 5 per cent of GDP; expressed in these terms the deficit was significantly lower in 1976-77 and 1977-78 and, on the basis of present projections, a further significant reduction can be expected in 1978-79. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is no satisfactory single measure of the economic impact of Budget transactions. Although the Budget deficit (or surplus) is often taken as a shorthand or summary measure of Budget impact, its use for this purpose is subject to a number of important qualifications. The deficit really does little more than indicate the difference between aggregate outlays and aggregate receipts; it cannot adequately reflect the differing economic impacts of the various components of total outlays and receipts - or of changes in those components. Consequently, the 'mix' of Budget outlays and revenues, as well as their total size, is very relevant to the assessment of the Budget's overall impact on the economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For analytical purposes it is important also to distinguish between domestic and overseas transactions: government payments made overseas do not add directly to domestic incomes and the demand for locally produced goods and services, while government receipts from overseas sources increase total receipts without withdrawing purchasing power from the domestic private sector. In the table above overseas transactions have been netted out to arrive at estimates of the domestic deficit/surplus in recent years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The transactions by which the overall Budget deficit is financed are also of considerable significance for monetary conditions and economic developments generally. Table 6 at the end of this Statement provides a summary of Commonwealth Government Budget Financing Transactions for each year since 1968-69. The main transactions undertaken to finance deficits in the Budget have been domestic and overseas loan raisings, the issue of Treasury Notes and borrowings from the Reserve Bank through the issue of Treasury Bills and other securities. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">While Commonwealth budget transactions are of central importance in their own right, the Commonwealth budget sector forms only a part of the total public sector. For many purposes of economic analysis it is relevant to look at the transactions of the total public sector as well as its constituent parts. Commonwealth budget payments to other areas of the public sector do, of course, have an important influence on the transactions of those other areas. This section outlines those linkages in broad terms and indicates certain trends in the total public sector, and in its main components over the past decade. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The main feature of these charts is the sharp increase in the size of the public sector in 1974-75. This jump occurred at all levels of government and was followed by a further - though less sharp - rise in 1975-76. The size of the total public sector has tended to stabilize since 1975-76, owing relatively more to the movement in the Commonwealth sector in that time. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Looking behind the figures for the public sector as a whole, total outlays (which include transfer payments as well as direct expenditure on goods and services) of the Commonwealth sector in 1974-75 rose more sharply than total outlays of State and local government authorities (Chart 1), but the State and local government sector registered the more pronounced increase in net expenditure on goods and services (Chart 3). This reflects the lift in Commonwealth budget payments to State and local government authorities (see following table). As Chart 2 shows, the State budget sector has clearly experienced the strongest growth of all the sub-sectors of the public sector over the period covered by the chart. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As noted above, payments from the Commonwealth budget constitute important sources of funds for other parts of the public sector. This is illustrated, for the Commonwealth non-budget sub-sector, in Chart 4. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In most years up to 1975-76 the deficit (or, more broadly, the financing requirement) arising from the transactions of non-budget authorities closely approximated the level of advances from the Commonwealth Budget i.e. changes in outlays of the non-budget authorities were linked with changes in advances from the Budget. In both 1976-77 and 1977-78, however, the deficit of the nonbudget sector was considerably larger than Budget advances; this reflects the substantial borrowings undertaken by some of the larger authorities on their own account during those two years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Commonwealth budget payments to State and local government authorities represent a very sizeable element of Commonwealth budget outlays and of total sources of funds for the recipients. The following table provides relevant figures: </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Combined grants and advances from the Commonwealth accounted, on average, for just on one half of sources of funds during the period shown, with an upward trend until 1976-77. In addition, the larger authorities borrowing program, which is subject to Loan Council approval, accounted for about 7 per cent of total sources of funds, on average, over the period. At the same time, however, the States have considerable flexibility in their taxing, pricing and financing policies, including, prospectively, the flexibility offered by the Stage 2 Income Tax Sharing Arrangements outlined in Budget Paper No. 7. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of State and local government sector outlays are available in the ABS publications: Public Authority Estimates (Catalogue No. 5501.0), and State and Local Authorities (Catalogue No. 5504.0). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Consolidating the transactions of the Commonwealth budget sector, Commonwealth non-budget authorities and State and local government authorities into figures for the public sector as a whole removes much of the incomparability over time of figures for individual sectors consequent upon changes in transactions between them. (Details of the consolidations are given in Budget Paper No. 10 and ABS: Public Authority Estimates.) Even then comparability is not wholly ensured; for example, in Chart 1 the series for outlays of all public authorities is broken in 1976-77 because of the introduction of family allowances to replace the tax rebate for dependent children, which effectively transferred assistance of that kind from the receipts to the outlays side of the public account. </para>

Two main features are noteworthy - the increased share of total taxation accounted for by income tax on persons, and the fact that total public sector receipts did not rise as fast as total outlays in 1974-75 (c.f. Chart 1), the public sector deficit rising considerably as a result. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The implications of the deficit in Commonwealth budget transactions for financial conditions are discussed in Statement No. 5. Deficits of other sub-sectors of the public sector must also be financed - whether by transfers from the Commonwealth budget or by their own borrowing. The implications of borrowings by these other sub-sectors will differ to an extent from those of Commonwealth borrowings because of the liquidity characteristics of Commonwealth securities, the Commonwealth's power to borrow from the Reserve Bank, and for other reasons. Nevertheless the size of the total public sector deficit, indicating the public sector's overall net demand for borrowed funds, is an important conditioning factor in its own right in domestic financial markets. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">At the Premier's Conference in June 1971 it was agreed that the Commonwealth Government would cease to levy payroll tax in the States as from 1 September 1971 and that the States would levy their own payroll taxes as from that date. This decision resulted in a reduction in Commonwealth payroll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue, financial assistance grants paid to the States in 1971-72 were reduced. The full-year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the 1972-73 figures for outlays and receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The transfer arrangements had the effect of reducing the growth of Commonwealth Budget outlays and receipts below the rates that would otherwise have been recorded by approximately 3 percentage points in 1971-72 and by about 1 percentage point in 1972-73. The figures shown in the tables reflect these lower growth rates. Comparisons between 1972-73 and subsequent years are not affected by the transfer since no significant effects of the changeover continued beyond 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Increases in special purpose payments to the States are recorded under the appropriate functional headings, while 'offsetting adjustments' to General Revenue Assistance Grants to the States are taken into account under the heading 'Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec'. The assumption by the Commonwealth Government in 1973-74 of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education contributed to an increase in outlays classified to 'Education' but also involved a compensating decrease in general purpose funds provided to the States. As a consequence, the rate of increase in Commonwealth Government resources devoted to education, as shown for the function 'Education' in 1973-74 is somewhat over-stated. A similar effect occurred in 1974-75, which was the first full financial year of the new tertiary education arrangements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in the operation of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Schemes affect outlays for 1973-74 and subsequent years under the relevant functions and receipts under the heading 'Other Taxes, Fees and Fines - Unfunded Retirement Benefits Contributions'. These changes involved a move from funded schemes to unfunded benefit schemes. The implementation of the new Commonwealth Superannuation scheme from 1 July 1976 gave rise to similar effects. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The scheme of Family Allowances introduced in 1976-77 involved the abolition of taxation rebates for dependant children and students, offset by substantial increases in family allowances in place of child endowment. The effect of this measure was to increase significantly the level of outlays under the 'Social Security and Welfare' function in 1976-77, and to increase receipts from personal income taxation above what they would otherwise have been. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On 1 July 1978 the Northern Territory of Australia became a self-governing territory. Functions transferred to the Ministers of the Territory from that date are mainly those of a State-type character; this is true also of the functions transferred to the Northern Territory on 1 January 1977. In terms of financial arrangements, 1977-78 and 1978-79 are transitional years pending development of a financial framework for the Northern Territory similar to that which operates for the States. During this transitional period, the Commonwealth is providing the bulk of its assistance to the Northern Territory through global (general purpose) allocations which are classified to the heading 'Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec'. Prior to 1977-78 outlays associated with the functions transferred to the Northern Territory have been classified as direct Commonwealth outlays under relevant functional headings.

        <para pgwide="yes">The 1956-66 Housing Agreement was not renewed on its expiry at the end of 1970-71. Instead, the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed on arrangements under which housing allocations were to be met by the States out of their approved  Loan  Council borrowing programs. Amounts totalling $160 million in 1971-72 and $166.9 million in 1972-73 were subsequently allocated by the States for housing projects similar in nature to those covered by the 1973 Housing Agreement. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show these amounts classified to 'Payments to or for the States, etc' instead of 'Housing'. However, for the purposes of the calculation of the trend rates of growth and the charts of proportions of total outlays, these amounts have been included under the function 'Housing'. </para>

        <title>APPENDIX TO THE BUDGET STATEMENTS - THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF BUDGET OUTLAYS</title>
        <page.no>268</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">The functional classification brings together outlays serving like objectives or purposes. As such it facilitates meaningful presentations of information on the nature of government activities and on the resources devoted to particular objectives. </para>
      <para class="block">Basis of the Functional Classification </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The functional classification is applied to aggregates derived using national accounting conventions and is therefore conceptually consistent with the economic (national accounts) classification. The conventions and principles adopted are broadly those set out in the 1968 United Nations publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts</inline> which provides widely accepted international standards for the classification of public sector outlays. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The major functional headings adopted for Budget purposes are conceptually consistent with those used by the Australian Statistician in his publications, but it should be noted that in the latter's publications Commonwealth Government outlays cover both Budget outlays (shown in the Budget Statements) <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> outlays by Commonwealth Government authorities which operate outside the Budget sector. Information on the transactions of authorities operating outside the Budget sector is shown in the document <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities</inline> published with the Budget. Two further significant differences should be noted. First, outlays on primary industry assistance are shown in the Budget Statements 'net' of the relevant primary industry levies and charges but are shown on a gross basis by the Statistician. Secondly, for the years prior to 1974-75, part of the expenditure incurred by some Commonwealth Government departments and instrumentalities operating in Papua New Guinea is classified by the Statistician as foreign aid. In the Budget Statements these outlays are shown under the same, functional heading as similar outlays made within Australia. </para>
      <para class="block">The Structure of the Functional Classification </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The contents of each function are described briefly in the final section of this Appendix. It will be evident from those descriptions that the functional classification is relatively aggregative in nature. Outlays under each functional heading have, however, been grouped together into identifiable and meaningful blocks which lend themselves to comment and analysis. These blocks do not, as a rule, purport to represent detailed purpose-oriented sub-functions or programs; on the whole it is not possible, for example, to dissect administrative outlays of departments and to allocate them to particular sub-functions. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Given the need to monitor actual monthly outlays and receipts on a basis consistent with the annual estimates embodied in the Budget documents, it has been necessary to work largely from existing central acounting records. These records are built around the Appropriation Acts which are the legal authority for expenditure, rather than detailed costing documents. The figures in the functional classification, therefore, have been derived essentially by reclassifying appropriation data, supplemented by a limited amount of additional data on substantial appropriation items which cover more than one function or purpose. </para>
      <para class="block" pgwide="yes">A reconciliation between total outlays shown in Statement No. 3 and in the appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund is set out in Tables 1 and 2 of Budget Document No. 4 <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure.</inline></para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Functional categories do not necessarily correspond with appropriation or departmental structures. Furthermore, some outlay and receipt figures are netted in arriving at aggregates. Expenditure votes and revenue heads under the control of a particular department may, therefore, be classified under more than one functional heading and it is not always possible to identify individual appropriation items in the Statements. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although the basic aim of a functional classification scheme is to reveal the broad purposes for which government outlays are undertaken, it is acknowledged that such a classification cannot always be applied unambiguously. Particular outlays will often serve two or more distinct functions: military colleges, for example, may be said to serve both a defence and an education purpose. The application of a functional classification scheme, however, requires that an outlay be classified to the function which it is considered primarily to serve. In the example quoted, the primary function is considered to be defence; this is in line with United Nations recommendations. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Any single classification system, cannot of course, focus at one and the same time on every outlay characteristic that may be of interest to the Government or the public. Supplementary information on particular aspects of outlays is therefore provided in other documents; details of wage and salary estimates, for example, are shown in the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure</inline> and a separate Budget Paper is provided on <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities.</inline> Other supplementary Budget Papers issued with the Budget Speech deal with the <inline font-style="italic">Civil Works Program</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Australia's Official Development Assistance to Developing Countries.</inline></para>

          <title>The Implications of Using National Accounting Conventions</title>
          <page.no>1</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">The principles underlying the national accounting presentation of Budget data are set out in the Appendix to the supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities, September</inline> 1974. The use of definitions of Budget outlays and receipts based on national accounting conventions places Budget data on a basis which, in the main, is conceptually consistent with national accounting information published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and can he related to that information. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">The adoption of these conventions requires that the receipts and outlay figures shown in the Statements attached to the Budget Speech show the net transactions of the Budget Sector with the rest of the economy. Some important characteristics of the national accounting treatment shown in the Statements are: (a) The transactions of various Funds forming the Public Account (the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consolidated and inter-fund transfers are eliminated. For example, payments to Trust Accounts are not shown as part of outlays; rather, the expenditure from Trust Accounts is included. The aim is essentially to record the transactions between the Budget sector and the rest of the economy. Allowance is made, however, for adjustments between functions arising from the transfer of existing assets where financial adjustments for these transfers are recorded; </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>Receipts derived from activities which are essentially of a governmental nature, involving regulation and compulsory payment, are normally treated as revenue items. As mentioned earlier, however, various primary industry levies and charges which are collected by the Government and applied more or less directly for the purposes of commodity stabilisation, research and promotional activities are offset against the relevant outlays. Other recoveries and repayments are normally offset against the relevant outlays to arrive at net figures. For example, repayments of principal on advances are offset against the corresponding advances. Bringing together the relevant outlays and recoveries or repayments facilitates assessment of the extent to which resources are directed through the Budget to a particular activity. Other taxes, compulsory charges, licence fees and the like which are of a general revenue nature, are treated as receipts items under the heading 'Other Taxes, Fees and Fines'; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>The operating revenues, net of operating expenses, of activities with the Budget Sector which are carried out as business-type enterprises are shown as receipts items, along with dividends and similar receipts from business enterprises operated outside the Budget Sector. The current operations of enterprises are therefore reflected in the Budget Statements to the extent that they contribute to general Budget revenues; and </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(d)">
            <para>Certain transactions which are netted in published totals of the receipts and payments of the Public Account are shown in gross form. The more important of these are interest on loans raised by the Commonwealth Government for State works programs and for the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Ltd. Interest paid on these loans is included under the outlay heading 'Public Debt Interest', while interest received on advances made to the relevant authorities is included as a receipts item. This has the effect of making the coverage of interest in the Statements the same as the coverage of the debt to which it relates. </para>

        <para class="block">Changes in the Functional Classification </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">From time to time, it is necessary to amend the functional classification to reflect changes in the organisation and coverage of government activities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The more significant changes made this year relate to the treatment of <inline font-style="italic">Payments to the Northern Territory Government.</inline></para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On 1 July 1978 the Northern Territory of Australia became a self-governing territory under the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978. Functions for which executive responsibility was transferred to Ministers of the Territory from that date are mainly those of a State-type character. (Executive responsibility for some functions previously administered by the Department of the Northern Territory and the Attorney-General's Department was transferred to the Northern Territory on 1 January 1977 and 1 January 1978 respectively. The current year is seen as a transitional year during which financial arrangements will be developed to bring the Northern Territory within a framework similar to that which operates for the States. During this transitional period, the Commonwealth will provide the bulk of its payments to the Territory Government, for functions already transferred or to be transferred during 1978-79, through a global allocation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In terms of the functional classification for 1978-79 this global allocation is included under the heading 'Not Allocated to Function - Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec'. (In Statement No. 3 attached to last year's Budget Speech similar bulk allocations to the Northern Territory were shown under 'Administrative Services'; the 1977-78 figures have been adjusted to include these funds in the 'Not Allocated to Function' category.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Two functions have yet to be transferred to the Northern Territory Government, namely health which is to be transferred on 1 January 1979 and education which is to be transferred on 1 July 1979: outlays by the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory for these purposes will continue to be classified to relevant functional headings until formal transfer takes place. The Commonwealth also will make a small number of specific purpose payments to the Territory during 1978-79. These payments have been classified to relevant functional headings in the same way as similar specific purpose payments to the States. The treatment of outlays in respect of the Northern Territory will need to be revised further as the transitional financial arrangements give way to arrangements similar to those now operating for the States. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Historical data for the period 1968-69 to 1977-78 classified by function are presented in Statement No. 6. Because the functional classification is derived from the appropriation accounting system, adjustments to the historical series are constrained by the availability of data in that system. In particular, major changes to departmental administrative arrangements announced in December 1972, June 1974, June 1975, and December 1975, have made it difficult to produce a strictly consistent series of outlays for the periods covered in the Budget Statements. Wherever possible the more important discontinuities have been eliminated by sub-costing and regrouping appropriation data, but it has not been practicable to eliminate all inconsistencies. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-by leave- In his Budget Speech, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> advised that changes will be made to the health insurance arrangements from 1 November this year. Before outlining the proposals in more detail, it would be appropriate if I commented briefly on the recent history leading to these changes. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Background to changes </para>
          <para>The House will recall that the Government in 1976 made certain modifications to Medibank and renegotiated the hospital cost-sharing agreements with the States. Although Medibank provided universal health insurance cover, it did so in a way which was open-ended and costly. Health costs were escalating at an alarming rate, and when the Government took office it was apparent that modifications to the scheme were necessary in order to reduce this rapid acceleration. </para>
          <para>As recently as May this year, I announced on behalf of the Government further modifications designed to reduce excessive use of medical services and to rationalise the use of hospital resources. The changes to Medibank which became effective on 1 October 1976 and the subsequent amendments have resulted in a significant decline in the rate of acceleration of health costs. This is confirmed by figures which were released earlier this year. </para>
          <para>The figures, announced in March, indicated that in relation to expenditure, including capital, on a financial year basis, the rise in health costs of 27.1 per cent in 1975-76 had been slowed to 19.7 per cent in 1976-77. </para>
          <para>The figures also showed that the rate of increase in health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product has been slowed. Further statistical information on these matters will be available in due course. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, the rate of increase of health costs has continued to be unacceptably high. In addition, although the existing arrangements have been achieving their original purpose, they are none-the-less complex and involve the imposition of a high degree of compulsion on the individual. Indeed the cost of health insurance premiums has become uncomfortably high for many people. </para>
          <para>Because of these factors, the Government has continued its review of the health insurance system. In October last year, I asked the Hospitals and Health Services Commission to review the financing of health services in Australia. The Commission's report, 'A Discussion Paper on Paying for Health Care', was tabled in this House on 1 5 March this year. That report was one important component of the very comprehensive reconsideration of the health insurance system undertaken by the Government in recent months. </para>
          <para>Our review has pointed to an obvious fact: That to maintain a balance between the numbers of health insurance levy payers and those privately insured- an essential element in the existing scheme's strategy to contain costs- clearly the levy rate could not be held at its present level much longer. </para>
          <para>A further complexity has emerged because of the different health cost structures in different States, and the consequent variation in private insurance rates, which suggest a need to examine the imposition of different levy rates in different States. This, of course, could not be countenanced in a federal levy. Accordingly, we reached the conclusion that, rather than make any adjustments to the health insurance levy, it was more practical and desirable to introduce a new and better Medibank system by abandoning the levy and introducing a new Commonwealth medical benefit and other changes. </para>
          <para class="block">Summary of changes </para>
          <para>Let me now summarise the major features of the changes: </para>
          <para>As announced by the Treasurer, the health insurance levy will be abolished. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth will pay a new universal medical benefit from Consolidated Revenue. </para>
          <para>This new Commonwealth benefit, to cover 40 per cent of schedule medical fees with a maximum patient contribution of $20 for any one service where the schedule fee is charged, will be paid through private health insurance funds, including Medibank Private. This is not to say that where the doctor charges in excess of the schedule fee the patient will be denied the advantage of the universal Commonwealth medical benefit. </para>
          <para>Medical insurance premiums should fall considerably for comparable levels of cover. </para>
          <para>The present compulsion on every Australian to pay for one type of health insurance or another will be removed, although those people currently covered by Medibank Standard will need to consider whether they wish to insure for their present level of benefits. </para>
          <para>Private health funds, including Medibank Private, will offer medical benefits in addition to the new Commonwealth benefit, and will continue to provide hospital benefits. </para>
          <para>The funds will be given considerable freedom and flexibility to devise attractive benefit packages. </para>
          <para>Accommodation in standard wards of public hospitals, with treatment by doctors engaged by the hospital, will continue to be available free of charge to those who are not privately insured for hospital care. </para>
          <para>Bulk billing of Public Health Benefit pensioners and their dependants who are not privately insured for medical benefits will continue as at present. As previously announced* the new concept of bulk billing for socially disadvantaged patients will be introduced. </para>
          <para>Subsidies for hospital-only insurance will be discontinued. The subsidy of $ 1 6 per occupied bed day paid to private hospitals will remain. </para>

          <title>Further Details of Changes</title>
          <page.no>277</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>As honourable members will have noticed, a  number of the best features of existing and previous schemes are being brought together in the modifications. For example, Medibank introduced the concept of universal medical benefits and standard hospital coverage for all Australians, regardless of means. This principle is being retained. Those people who are not covered by hospital insurance will continue to be eligible for accommodation in standard wards of public hospitals, with treatment by doctors engaged by the hospital, at no cost- although in Queensland, of course, all citizens will continue to be eligible for free standard ward care irrespective of their insurance status. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth and the States will continue to share the approved net operating costs of recognised hospitals. Bulk or direct billing will continue to be available for pensioners with health benefit cards and their dependants, except for those who are privately insured for medical benefits and, as I announced recently will be introduced for socially disadvantaged people. </para>
        <para>The most important change, of course, is the abolition of the health insurance levy- a move which means that everyone in the community will be entitled to receive a basic level of protection against the costs of medical and hospital services without having to pay any direct contribution, either by way of levy to the Government or by premium payments to private insurance funds. The health funds- including Medibank Private- will continue to play an important role in the provision of insurance cover, but people will no longer be liable to pay the health insurance levy if they do not insure privately. </para>
        <para class="block">Medical benefits </para>
        <para>As I stated earlier, the new universal Commonwealth medical benefits will be payable through the registered funds. This arrangement will apply both to those who elect to take Commonwealth benefits only and to those who take private medical insurance in addition. The latter group will receive their Commonwealth benefit as an integral part of any refund claimed for a medical service. No one, of course, will be obliged to take out medical insurance with a private fund if he or she is satisfied to receive the Commonwealth benefit only. </para>
        <para>It should be emphasised that those people who are now receiving standard Medibank benefits at 75 per cent of the scheduled fee for medical services with a maximum patient payment of $10, and who wish to retain the same benefit level, will need to insure privately to do so. In fact, as from 1 November, it will be a condition of registration of the private funds that they offer a basic medical benefits table. This table, together with the Commonwealth benefit, will cover 75 per cent of the scheduled fee, with a maximum patient payment of $ 10 for any one service where the schedule fee is charged. In other words, people insured for basic medical fund benefits will receive combined Commonwealth and fund benefits at the rate of 75 per cent of the schedule fees, with a maximum patient contribution of $10. That is, the fund will increase the level of benefit from the universal Commonwealth benefit of 40 per cent with a $20 gap, to 75 per cent with a $10 gap. </para>
        <para>In addition, funds will be free to offer a variety of other medical benefits packages up to a maximum of the schedule fee level, and other ancillary benefits. Under the scheme, therefore, the Commonwealth will meet all costs over and above $20 for any medical service, provided the doctor charges the schedule fee. </para>
        <para>It must be emphasised that those people currently paying the health insurance levy will be eligible to receive only 40 per cent of the schedule medical fee, with a maximum payment by the patient of $20 for any one service where the schedule fee is charged- unless they take the necessary steps to insure for additional benefits. Those who wish to retain their present 75 per cent/$10 gap benefit will need to insure by 1 November. </para>
        <para>As I said earlier, no one will be obliged to insure privately. Undoubtedly there will be many who will wish to carry a higher risk themselves and will decide to accept a 40 per cent benefit as payment in full, especially in the light of the knowledge that, where the schedule fee is charged, they will have to pay no more than $20 for any one medical service. </para>
        <para>I will be meeting with representatives of the health funds within the next few days to discuss the most practical and simple method for people to obtain their universal Commonwealth medical benefits. I will also be advising them that they will be required to submit a proposal to my Department by 29 September concerning their basic medical benefits table. </para>
        <para>Such proposals will be considered by the Registration Committee with a view to registration of the new tables by 1 November. Funds which do not offer this new basic medical benefits table will be unable to pay Commonwealth medical benefits. </para>
        <para>For the many people who are already enrolled with a fund for hospital and medical coversome 57 per cent of the population- the change will mean little apart from the fact that they should also have an opportunity to review the level of cover they require. </para>
        <para>They will also have the opportunity to make significant savings in the process. In turn, the funds will be in a position to offer a variety of innovative insurance tables, including 'deductibles' in some form. Apart from the basic table, the funds will be able to devise competitive and innovative benefit schemes, subject to guidelines. </para>

          <title>Hospital Insurance</title>
          <page.no>278</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Turning to the hospital side, insurance and benefit arrangements will remain largely unchanged. People who are not privately insured will continue to be eligible for standard accommodation and treatment in public hospitals at no charge to them. Those who are covered by private insurance will be expected to contribute towards the cost of any hospitalisation in public hospitals, except in Queensland, as I have stated previously. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth-State hospital costsharing arrangements will continue. The subsidy of $16 per occupied bed day paid to private hospitals will remain. The Commonwealth will continue to contribute the sum of $50m to the reinsurance pool. </para>
        <para>Hospital funds will continue to offer the basic standard table covering hospital accommodation at $40 a day and will also be obliged to continue to cover their contributors against nursing home charges in all tables. Apart from this, they will be able to devise competitive benefits packages, and to introduce deductibles if they choose, subject to guidelines. The Government and the industry are already in the process of developing acceptable guidelines for deductible schemes. </para>
        <para class="block">Hospital-only insurance </para>
        <para>With the removal of the health insurance levy, the present system of subsidised hospital-only insurance will be discontinued. From 1 November, former levy-payers and those pensioners and others exempt from the levy who wish to continue coverage for shared ward accommodation with doctor of choice in hospital will need to take basic hospital insurance. </para>
        <para>However, the additional premium payable is not large. On present rates it should not exceed an extra 75c a week for family cover in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, 35c in Victoria, 30c in Queensland and 25c in Tasmania. So that there will be no misunderstanding, I could add that those figures are the existing level of subsidy payable for hospitalonly insurers within the various States at present contribution rates. It is possible that the additional premium could be higher, depending on the varying experiences of funds with their hospital tables. </para>

          <title>Bulk Billing</title>
          <page.no>279</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>There has been considerable debate over recent years about the merits and demerits of bulk billing. The system has administrative advantages in meeting the needs of pensioners and socially disadvantaged people. The arrangements recently announced for assisting the socially disadvantaged through the use of bulk billing will be implemented. Doctors who do so will receive from the Government 75 per cent of the schedule fee as payment in full for the service rendered- provided the patient is not privately insured- and will not be permitted to recover a cash payment from such patients. Doctors will continue to be able to bulk bill the Commonwealth to the extent of 85 per cent of the scheduled fee for pensioners with pensioner health benefit entitlements, and their dependants, with a $5 gap. </para>

          <title>Commonwealth-State Hospital Cost-Sharing Arrangements</title>
          <page.no>279</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>As I said earlier, the Commonwealth-State hospital cost-sharing arrangements will continue. However, as previously mentioned, my announcement in May of this year emphasised the need to rationalise the use of hospital resources to improve efficiency and productivity and to reconstruct the hospital charging pattern. My Government recognises that an important key to the containment of health costs rests in the hospital area. It is therefore vigorously pursuing the rationalisation initiatives with the aim of producing real results. </para>
        <para>These matters have been under discussion with the States during recent weeks. The question of the level of hospital charges is directly related to these considerations, especially the varying levels of hospital operating costs in and between the various States. Therefore, my Government is not in a position to finalise its views on the levels of hospital charges until these negotiations and discussions are further advanced. </para>
        <para class="block">Effect on Private Fund Contribution Rates </para>
        <para>I do not wish to forecast in any detail the effect the November changes might have on the current contribution rates for private insurance. However, it should be stressed that the new basic medical benefits table, which all funds will be obliged to offer, will meet from fund resources only 35 per cent of the schedule fee and no more than $ 10 for any medical service, compared with the present 75 per cent/$10 'gap' met entirely by the funds. The Commonwealth, of course, will meet the other 40 per cent. As I said earlier, the Commonwealth will be meeting all costs above $20 for any medical service, provided the doctor charges the schedule fee. </para>
        <para>The registration committee will be taking into account these new subsidised medical benefit arrangements in relation to the basic table before considering the new premiums for such insurance as from 1 November. I will await with interest the packages and contribution rates the funds will be offering for hospital insurance in due course, once they have had a chance to assess the freedom and flexibility the new scheme offers. </para>
        <para>Future Role of the Health Insurance Commission </para>
        <para>With the ending of the present Medibank Standard benefits system the Health Insurance Commission's activities after 1 November will be confined to the operation of Medibank Private. The Government has decided that the Department of Health will administer the new universal Commonwealth medical benefit. </para>
        <para>It would obviously be inappropriate for an organisation operating a private fund- that is, the Health Insurance Commission- to pay to other funds Commonwealth benefits for insured and uninsured persons; to be in a position where it had related information on the activities of the other funds; or to exercise supervisory or inspection functions. Similarly, in the new circumstances, bulk billing activities which represent the payment of medical benefits directly to doctors by the Commonwealth for pensioners and the disadvantaged, Commonwealth payments under the hospital cost-sharing agreements, per diem payments to private hospitals and health program grant payments are more appropriately placed within the Department of Health. </para>
        <para>At this stage I cannot be precise about the number of staff who will be required to handle Medibank Private or to deal with the additional functions within the Department of Health. It does seem, however, that some- indeed a considerable number- of the present employees of the Health Insurance Commission will be surplus to requirements. We will make every effort to redeploy any surplus staff to the Public Service, to other Commonwealth authorities, to the private health insurance funds or elsewhere. </para>
        <para>I will be raising employment possibilities with the private funds, and have asked that the Public Service Board and the Commonwealth Employment Service give particular attention to the placement needs of Commission staff. Meetings will be arranged by the Government as soon as possible with relevant staff organisations to discuss these important matters. </para>
        <para class="block">Summary of Effects on Various Groups </para>
        <para>Let me now summarise briefly the effects of the 1 November changes on various groups in the community: </para>
        <para>For the 57 per cent of the population who are currently insured with private health funds for both medical and hospital benefits, there will be little change, although their medical insurance premiums should be lower from 1 November. Individuals can, of course, elect to take the new Commonwealth medical benefit and standard hospital care if they choose. For pensioners with pensioner health benefit cards, and their dependants, there will be no change in respect of present levels of medical and hospital coverage. </para>
        <para>Pensioners and others who currently have hospital-only insurance will be required to pay extra if they wish to continue coverage for shared ward accommodation with doctor of choice in hospital. For low income earners and others who are socially disadvantaged, doctors will be able to bulk bill their medical accounts, as recently announced. For health insurance levy payers, a clear-cut choice will need to be made- whether to accept the new universal Commonwealth benefits, or whether to take out private insurance in order to retain their existing level of medical benefits. It is a choice they should make by 1 November or soon after. </para>

          <title>Summary of Advantages</title>
          <page.no>280</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In summary, the revised Medibank arrangements will provide a better and simpler system of universal health insurance for all Australians. Under the existing arrangements, people have faced complex decisions- whether to pay the health insurance levy only, whether to add hospital-only insurance to the levy, or whether to take out full private insurance. These complexities would have been increased by any future adjustments to the levy rate in line with rises in health insurance premiums. The new scheme removes these difficulties. In future an individual will have to decide only two major questions: Do I wish to take out private health insurance over and above my universal Commonwealth, medical benefit and standard hospital entitlement; and, if so, how much do I want? </para>
        <para>The whole income tax collection system will be simplified from 1 November. Paymasters will no longer have to concern themselves with levy collections. Self-employed people and others with unpredictable incomes will not have to cope with the uncertainties of deciding which options are most suitable to them. In spite of these simplifications, it is recognised that there are people who find any change unsettling, and who may feel immediate uncertainty about what they will be required to do. I assure those people that the Government will be undertaking an extensive information program between now and 1 November to ensure that everyone in the community will be fully aware of the choice to be made and the steps necessary to implement that choice. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, the very real advantages of the modified arrangements are: </para>
        <para>Everyone will continue to be automatically entitled to coverage for health care at a uniform level. </para>
        <para>The present element of compulsion by which people have to pay for one form of health insurance or another will disappear, and a substantial monetary saving should be available for most people. </para>
        <para>Those who wish to insure for a higher level of benefits may do so on a completely voluntary basis. </para>
        <para>Pensioners and the socially disadvantaged will be covered for medical benefits and standard ward hospital care. </para>
        <para>The complexities of income tax returns in relation to the health insurance levy will disappear. </para>
        <para>Acquisition of statistical data on medical services will be simplified because of the payment of a uniform Commonwealth benefit for every medical service. </para>
        <para>The principle of greater patient contribution by way of lower levels of universal medical benefits, introduced in the May modifications to encourage users and providers to use services responsibly, is carried forward in the new arrangements. </para>
        <para>Although considerable subsidy is being provided to people for medical benefits, the Government is introducing a form of voluntary deductible system by leaving it to contributors to decide whether they will insure for a larger or lesser percentage of benefits. </para>
        <para>There have been many representations from people wanting the opportunity to carry a higher proportion of risk in return for lower health insurance premiums. The November changes to Medibank will provide that opportunity. </para>
        <para class="block">The modifications will, in effect, allow people to enter into their own voluntary deductible systems, knowing that they are largely covered for high-cost, catastrophic illness. Put in another way, the system will enable people to accept higher risks in return for lower insurance premiums. This will provide an incentive to people to use medical services responsibly. </para>
        <para>Whilst special arrangements have been made for pensioners and the socially disadvantaged, the Government will monitor the scheme carefully to ensure that it serves their needs satisfactorily. The Government is confident that these changes will not only ease some of the financial strain from individuals in paying for health care, but also simplify the health insurance system while at the same time maintaining a constraining effect on health costs. I commend the changes to honourable members. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>-by leave-I would like to deal with a number of points raised in the ministerial statement by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt).</inline> It is not easy to make an absolute judgment on these new proposals within about an hour of receiving notice of them, but I will try to do so. Undoubtedly, new aspects will be drawn to my attention and the attention of other honourable members during the next few days as we look at the ramifications of what is proposed, and I might well change my mind about the proposition. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In some ways it is deplorable that this and other aspects of the Budget were leaked completely to the Press. I think this is wrong in principle. I do not think that the leaking of the Budget health proposals matters much; nobody could have gained a significant financial benefit from knowing of them before they were announced. But the leak applied not only to health aspects but also to other proposals from which there was a possibility of people making money. I therefore deplore the leaking of the Budget content. When the story of the new health care arrangements appeared yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> I did not believe it. I will explain why I did not believe it. I assumed that any new arrangements announced in the Budget or any alterations arising from it would come within the parameter of the Government's efforts to save money. I did not realise that the Government was trying to pump more money into the health care system. I will not criticise the Government for this. </para>
          <para>As the Minister for Health and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> have pointed out, in a full year the extra cost involved in the alterations to the system is estimated to be $62 lm- $305m in added Budget outlays and a reduction of $3 1 6m in receipts because of the abolition of the health insurance levy. That is a huge amount of money for a government which I notice is going in for taxing a number of benefits, such as the tuberculosis allowance, which will yield only $3m or $5m in a full year. That is why I did not accept that move as a likely change. The explanation for the change appears in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer. Dealing with health, in the second paragraph, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We have therefore decided upon several major changes to existing arrangements which, while producing an immediately adverse Budgetary effect, are more consistent with our longer-term objectives in this area and remove much of the confusion and complexity from present arrangements. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I knew that some members of the Government, especially the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> were very keen on ideology but I did not think that they would be prepared to pay $62 lm in any one year for an ideological proposition concerning universal health insurance. What in fact has been done? In some ways this situation is a return to what we of the Australian Labor Party had. I know that in some ways it is different. Under our scheme that was in operation until 1 October 1976 people did not have to pay a levy. They were entitled to free standard hospital care and 85 per cent of their medical costs, with the maximum expenditure being $5 per item. This Government then introduced a levy of 2.5 per cent, which encouraged over 50 per cent of the population to leave Medibank. What the Government has done now is to remove that levy which, by the time the change was introduced, had operated for only two years. But the patient will still get free standard hospital treatment. Instead of receiving 85 per cent of medical costs the patient will receive only 40 per cent, and the maximum patient contribution per service will be $20. </para>
          <para>It is difficult to criticise this proposition absolutely and to see no benefits in a proposal which, in effect, saves the taxpayer in the first instance in one way or another- or the people who take advantage of it- $62 1 m. It is not easy to just say that $62 lm will be paid and that it is all bad. I draw the attention of the House in a reasonable and rational approach to some of the difficulties that will arise. To my mind the first difficulty is that there will be no point in joining a medical or hospital fund unless the contributor is terribly keen on having a doctor of his own choice because it will now be much more expensive for him to do so. The subsidised hospital only insurance is being discontinued. Therefore whilst people were being encouraged to pay the levy and then to pay $ 1 35 a year extra for a family so as to get treatment by a doctor of their choice in a public hospital, they will now not be given that insurance in a subsidised form. It has been suggested that the extra cost will be 75c a week but as a calculation is not shown I cannot comment on it. However, it will certainly be more expensive. The contributor will get only that alleged doctor of choice benefit for which at present he pays $135 a year. My suggestion to most people would be not to insure themselves. It is difficult to tell that to people but if they think about it reasonably and rationally I think they will agree with me. It is certainly the sort of thing which I have done until now and which I have advised other people to do. Until now it has cost me the ceiling of the levy. Without contributing anything from now on the patient will get free hospitalisation in a standard ward and 40 per cent of medical fees. On top of that, if one is well off in the community one gets a 33 per cent tax rebate on one's medical and hospital expenses. </para>
          <para>I think it is an unfair aspect that the 10 per cent or so of the community who are able to exceed the automatic tax deduction of about $1,600 a year will be able to get from now on a <inline font-style="italic">33Vi</inline> per cent discount on whatever medical fees they are paying above the 40 per cent and that others will not be able to do so. This is not fair in equity, but in any case it is another encouragement for people not to join a private fund. It was not clear from the Minister's speech, because he kept on referring to people who at present pay the levy, whether people will be able to take advantage of that provision only if they pay the levy at present. I asked him earlier whether anybody can make that choice, and it appears from his speech that anybody will be able to make the choice, even people who at present belong to private funds. My own view would be that people ought to leave those private funds before or on 1 November and take advantage of what the Government is offering. </para>
          <para>I have some specific criticism to make which some people may consider to be nit picking, but I do not think that it really is. I refer to the question of the Health Insurance Commission and the abolition of the Health Insurance Commission as far as Medibank Standard is concerned. On 24 May the Minister announced the intention to abolish bulk billing, and early in June the Parliament passed legislation to that effect. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> in a letter to the Minister's staff said that the staff increase required by the Health Insurance Commission, which it would start recruiting, to handle the increased work load that this change would bring about, was approximately 390. That was due to the elimination of direct billing for all Medibank Standard nonpensioner patients. The Commission started to recruit that staff. Then the Minister about three weeks ago announced that in fact bulk billing will still continue for certain groups in the community, depending on doctors being prepared to accept 75 per cent of the schedule fee. So the Commission obviously did not need an extra 390 staff members; it may have needed an extra 100 or 200. Now the Health Insurance Commission is being abolished altogether so far as Medibank </para>
          <para>Standard is concerned. I notice that the Minister slipped in a few extra words to those contained in the copy of the speech which I have. At page 12 of the speech which was circulated this passage appears: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It does seem, however, that some of the present employees of the Health Insurance Commission will be surplus to requirements. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>In other words, they will lose their jobs. In his actual speech he said:  lt does seem, however, that some- indeed a considerable number- of the present employees of the Health Insurance Commission will be surplus to requirements. </para>
          <para class="block">So I suppose it is a muck-up. It is bungling, quite signifiant bungling, caused by political interference with the Health Insurance Commission. A couple of months ago the Government decided that the Commission needed more staff. Now the Government has decided that the Commission does not need any extra staff. I think that is rather poor. </para>
          <para>Complications will arise from people leaving the funds. Certainly young and healthy persons, especially males, would be quite silly to take out private health insurance because the likelihood of their having to pay a significant amount of money in any one year on hospital and medical fees is very low. So obviously they would be quite silly not to settle for standard ward treatment in hospitals for nothing and the greater of 40 per cent of schedule medical fees or the amount of schedule medical fees less $20. It would be quite silly to insure oneself in any one year to cover a $20 maximum payment on any one thing. Of course, the net result of that is what we have discussed previously. The Minister has realised and the papers submitted to the Minister reveal that the Government is destroying the average pool that exists as far as health insurance is concerned. If we pull out from the pool the people who collect relatively little in health insurance, the net result will be that the people who are left in the pool are the people who are more likely to collect money, the higher risk group in the community, and obviously the contribution rates will have to be increased by the funds. This is one of the difficulties. I think in the end one has the philosophical attitude- I certainly have it- that the whole community should contribute towards the health costs of those who have larger families and sicker families- some members of the family are chronically ill- and who therefore have to take out extra insurance. The Government is going against that philosophy, and I think it is even going against the advice of organisations such as the Australian Medical Association and the funds themselves. It distorts the pool and it removes the concept that the better off and the healthier in the community ought to be contributing towards the health and hospital costs of those who are sicker. </para>
          <para>As I see it another difficulty is the definition of a low income and socially disadvantaged person for whom the doctor can bulk bill. I assume such a person cannot be defined and that it will depend purely on whether doctors are prepared to accept 75 per cent bulk billing from persons instead of collecting 40 per cent from the Commonwealth and hoping that they will get the extra 60 per cent from the patient. My own advice would be that people should exert a lot of pressure on doctors to accept the 75 per cent bulk billing. It is possible to spread that bulk billing, provided there are some doctors prepared to bulk bill for the 75 per cent. More and more doctors are coming onto the market. I know it has been argued that the more doctors there are the more it actually costs in the long run. That argument may be partly true. In fact new doctors coming into areas, in order to establish themselves, will accept 75 per cent of the fee on a bulk billing basis, and hopefully other doctors will be forced to accept that. If that in fact happens the Government, of course, will be up for much more than the $62 lm that it has calculated. I do not know on what basis the Government has calculated or estimated the cost of bulk billing for low income and socially disadvantaged people. I would think that the Government has just grabbed a figure out of the air. Maybe the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson),</inline> who in the last couple of weeks has been occupied with other matters, has not noticed that departmental officers may have queried that figure. </para>
          <para>I predict that the Government will get itself into more and more financial strife by introducing these changes. The Government's proposals are unfair to some of the lower income groups in the community such as those families who will need to insure themselves because they require a lot of medical attention. It is the total of the services in their cases which makes it necessary for them to take out insurance. I am talking of large families, of which one or more members have some sort of chronic condition, who do not have access to doctors who bulk bill. These families will have to take out extra insurance. The cost to them will be greater than it has been when they have paid the levy. However, at the same time, the cost to the Government will increase. I predict that within a very short time the Government will try to introduce means tests in respect of hospitals. Hopefully it will get into trouble with the States, especially the State Treasurers, if it tries to do that. The Government will try to introduce means tests because the cost of hospitalisation will be so great without money coming back by way of the levy. I believe that there will be a steady reduction in respect of the 40 per cent Commonwealth refund on medical services so as to reduce the Commonwealth contribution. This in summary is my criticism, and hopefully a reasoned criticism, of the amendments that have been proposed. </para>
          <para>I conclude by saying that the Prime Minister said: 'We are not going to interfere with Medibank, we are not going to abolish Medibank'. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health as recently as May this year said: Whatever we do we will keep a universal health scheme under which everybody has to take out some sort of insurance '. </para>
          <para>They have changed their minds on both those issues during the last few weeks when this decision was taken. It is just another episode which illustrates quite clearly that one cannot trust the members of the Fraser Ministry when they make what appear to be absolute statements as to long-term attitudes on services which are provided by government. I hope that the discussion on this issue will continue. I hope that we will get more details from the Minister for Health and more figures, as promised in his speech, so that we will be able to make an intelligent judgment as to whether the figures are true or are predictions that have just been pulled out of the air. </para>

          <para class="block">These Bills will give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget Speech to reduce the rate of sales tax on motor cars and station wagons from 27V4 per cent to 15 per cent. The nine amending Bills are necessary because sales tax is imposed by nine separate Acts in order to meet the constitutional requirement that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with only one subject of taxation. Vehicles affected by the reduction are listed in the Fifth Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The ones more commonly used are sedans, station wagons and taxi cabs. In aggregate terms, this reduction in sales tax is expected to involve a revenue loss of $155m this year. It also will be significant for the individual car buyer as it should mean that the price of an average family car now costing around $7,000 will fall by some $530. The new rate is to be effective tomorrow, 16 August 1978. This accords with the normal practice under which changes in rates of sales tax take effect on the day following their introduction into Parliament. A memorandum explaining the provisions of the Bills in detail is being circulated for the information of honourable members. </para>

The proposals, which will operate from tomorrow, 16 August, increase the excise duty on crude oil by $45.63 per kilolitre.

The conjoint effects of these proposals and of the Excise Bill will be to achieve the net rate of excise duty required to bring up to import parity prices all indigenous crude oil presently priced below import parity level. I commend the proposals. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the allowing of rebates of the excise duty payable on certain categories of indigenous crude oil. The Bill, in conjunction with Excise Tariffproposals No. 3 ( 1978), constitutes the legislation required to bring into effect the Government's decision, announced in the Budget Speech, that all indigenous crude oil is to be priced at import parity levels. As stated in the Budget Speech, this objective is to be achieved by increasing the present excise duty, that is the levy, on 'non-parity ' oil by an amount which will bring the price of that oil to import parity levels. </para>
          <para>The rate of excise duty required to raise the current price of Bass Strait 'non-parity' oil to import parity level is $64.53 per kilolitre- about $ 10.26 per barrel- and this is the basic proposed new excise duty rate for stabilised crude petroleum oil for the period ending 31 December 1978. However, Bass Strait oil currently priced at import parity, although liable to the higher rate of excise duty, will be allowed, in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, a rebate of duty of $45.63 per kilolitre to ensure that the net duty payable will remain at $18.90 per kilolitreabout $3 per barrel. </para>
          <para>Similarly, the quantity of Barrow Island oil which is currently priced at import parity and the total production of Moonie and other smaller fields- currently at import parity price- will be allowed the same rebate to provide an effective excise duty of $18.90 per kilolitre. The quantity of Barrow Island oil currently at 'non-parity' price will be liable to an effective duty rate of $61.39 per kilolitre-about $9.76 per barrel-to bring its price to import parity level. To achieve this the Bill provides for a rebate of $3.14 per kilolitre from the excise duty liability of $64.53 per kilolitre. </para>
          <para>The Bill requires that the Minister for National Development shall, from time to time, determine prices for crude oil to take account of changes in the import parity price and so enable appropriate rates of duties and rebates to be calculated in terms of the relevant provisions. It also allows for the making of regulations related to the administration of the scheme of rebates. I commend the Bill. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker</inline>announced this afternoon the resignation of the  Hon.  Edward Gough Whitlam after 26 years as a member of the House of Representatives. He was, by universal consent, the greatest member of the present Parliament- the largest in spirit, the loftiest in aspiration, the greatest orator and the member with the widest and deepest range of interests. Gough Whitlam sat here as the honourable member for Werriwa for a quarter of a century, was  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition for seven years, Leader of the Australian Labor Party for 10 years and Prime Minister for three years. Whilst he was passionate in his Australianism, he was also a man of universal interests who thought and tried to operate, to his political cost, in a larger time frame than the three years between Australian elections- or 18 months when the ALP is in office. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The problem with democratic processes is that they often come up with the wrong result. In a free vote people will often vote for a Barabbas even where there are other choices. There is little doubt that Hitler and Mussolini would have won free elections at the height of their influence. The electors of Australia passed damning judgments on the prime ministership of E. G. Whitlam. This is not the time for a final judgment but I am confident that the verdict of history will be more generous. Conversely, the verdict of the electors in Australia was almost consistently generous to the recently deceased Prime Minister who had seven straight victories from 1949 to 1963. Yet the political world that was so triumphantly endorsed at the polls in that period now seems as remote as the Victorian era. Its values are largely obsolete and its vision of Australia as an outpost of Empire, tied to the United States alone in this region and resisting contact and cultural exchange with our neighbours in China, Japan or Indonesia, seems dangerously anachronistic. Yet it was enormously popular at the polls. </para>
          <para>As late as 1966 the electors voted overwhelmingly to endorse the Vietnam war and to reject the Australian Labor Party's position. Who would endorse that verdict today? Gough Whitlam was, I think, a man for all seasons, not especially for this one. He made many mistakes. He offended many rich and powerful groups. He was not always easy to work with and he liked to get his own way. The expression that he often used- 'crash through or crash'- is something we often have thought.  His  judgment was not infallible. Nevertheless, in a political Lilliput he was our Gulliver. I believe that all of us, of all political parties, are diminished by his withdrawal from the House. </para>

            <para>- It would not be often that this House has placed on record words of praise for a wife of a former member of this House. But yesterday in the fading afternoon light within Christ Church, South Yarra, Melbourne, I stood with a congregation who remembered with thanks the life work of a very gallant and great Australian lady, the wife of the former honourable member for Balaclava, and the Minister for Air between 1949 and 195 1. Lady Vera Deakin White, O.B.E., was the daughter of Australia's founder, Federal statesman and Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin. She had lived a brilliant life having been born in 1891 and after her education at Melbourne Church of England Girl's Grammar School, Melbourne University, Berlin and Budapest, she became a talented musician in her own right. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>Nimmo in his eloquent tribute yesterday reminded us of her life service of over 60 years to t'.e Australian Red Cross Society in two world wars. It was of the highest order. Thousands of ex-servicemen and women, the disabled, the handicapped, and later the crippled children, knew and recognised her concern for them. It is perhaps fitting, therefore, that this House takes note of the passing of this wonderful Australian lady whose life was an example of Christian humility and simple affection towards all whom she met. She certainly requires no memorial. Immortality is hers as it is her distinguished statesman father who showed this nation the meaning of untarnished public service. I believe that this honourable House would wish to convey its respects to this distinguished family. </para>

              <para>A precise measure of this is not available. As skilled workers selected overseas are recruited only for occupations in which vacancies exist, the number of vacancies filled should be approximated by the number of skilled workers arriving. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3">
              <para>) There is no specific information on this. Vacancies may exist in an area where there is a shortage of labour, or to which available skilled labour is unable or unwilling to travel from localities where the availability of labour may exceed the number of job opportunities. Moreover, the situation changes frequently and it would not be productive to give precise numerical assessments of skilled labour shortfalls at a particular time. The approved occupations list for migration is based on ongoing qualitative assessments of the future labour demand for various occupations. </para>

            <para>The direct cost incurred by the Department of Health in actions taken against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> F. Toomer in 1 974 and 1 977 is approximately $13,700. This figure includes counsel fees and costs of transcription of evidence in appeal hearings held during September/October 1974 and October 1977, fares and travelling allowance for Departmental representatives on the Appeal Boards and the costs associated with the transfers of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Toomer</inline> and his family. Departmental officers were involved in these actions as part of their normal duties but because records have not been maintained which would enable the time commitment of these officers to the case to be identified, an accurate costing of the proportion of salaries attributable to these actions cannot be provided. The Department continued to pay <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Toomer's</inline> normal salary during the periods of his suspension from duty and the total salary paid to him during those periods was approximately $17,600. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The costs of providing facilities for the interconnection of telephone exchanges increase with distance. There is therefore a limit to the distance over which Telecom Australia can economically provide local call access. In the case of the Melbourne metropolitan zone, local calls have not been provided to exchanges more than about 40 km radially from the GPO. This limit is already in excess of that which normally applies and is made possible by the greater concentration of subscribers in the metropolitan area. It has not been possible, however, to extend the zone to include the Cranbourne exchange which is approximately 43.5 km from the GPO. </para>

              <para>Telecom Australia does not at this stage intend to expand the Melbourne extended local service area to include other exchanges. Late last year, however, my predecessor, the  Hon.  E. L. Robinson, requested the Commission to review the whole question of local call access so as to correct any anomalies. The question of extending metropolitan zones to include the larger developments adjacent to the existing defined areas is part of this review. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) to (4) The future structure of industry and any related shortages of skilled labour depend upon a large number of inter-related variables. Some of the main factors include the rate of growth of the economy, investment, labour market participation rates, consumer demand and overseas trade; the development and application of technology; the level and kind of assistance provided to particular industries; and increases in labour costs and labour-related costs. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Both the Inquiry into Education and Training, chaired by Professor Williams, and the Study Group on Structural Adjustment, chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Crawford, are giving attention to future supply and demand for manpower. Their reports are expected later this year. </para>
          <para>The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations produces twice a year short-term forecasts for up to 3 years, of the demand for a range of occupational groups. These forecasts assist immigration selection officers and officers of my Department dealing with applications for vocational training assistance. </para>
          <para>It is hoped that the development of the IMPACT project will enable us to acquire a better understanding of the kinds of changes in industry and manpower requirements that are likely to emerge in the medium term. </para>
          <para>Regarding training for the skilled trades, the following measures have been taken: </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training (CRAFT) was introduced in January 1977. CRAFT provides rebates for employers who release apprentices during paid time for technical education and approved off-the-job training, and allowances to apprentices compelled to live away from home to follow their apprenticeship. In the year 1976-77, the national apprentice intake increased significantly over the previous year. In 1977-78, a further small increase over the 1976-77 figure has been recorded. However, it is apparent that this national improvement embraces wide variations between States and the Territories and my Departure will be studying this aspect further in the near future. </para>
          <para>The Group One- Year Scheme provides for apprentices taken on by private employers to receive their first year of training in a Commonwealth establishment before returning to their employers to complete the term of apprenticeship. The Commonwealth pays the wages and all related training costs during the year, the employers remaining responsible only for Workers Compensation premiums. The Scheme was introduced in 1975 on a pilot basis and has since been expanded. Currently, some 220 apprentices are being trained in this way. Additionally, in 1978, the scheme has been extended on a pilot basis to certain State Government establishments in South Australia and Queensland, the Commonwealth refunding costs on the same basis. This extension is still under development, but currently some 54 apprentices have been placed for training. </para>
          <para>The Special Assistance Program for Apprentices under NEAT provides assistance to employers in order to sustain apprentices in training whose employment is jeopardised by work shortage or temporary financial problems encountered by their employers. At the end of June 1978, employers of 871 apprentices were being assisted in this way. </para>
          <para>At my request, the National Training Council has for some months been studying the possibility of supplementing the output to the skilled labour force from apprenticeship. The operative word here is "supplementing'. It is not the intention that any such proposal should replace apprenticeship. I expect to receive proposals from the Council in the very near future for consideration and discussion with all parties concerned. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Hospital admissions in the Northern Territory are not statistically categorised in a way that could confirm the honourable member's statement. However, statistics from the Northern Territory hospitals in 1976 indicate that 19.65 per cent of total hospital separations related to the conditions mentioned by the honourable member. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>It is believed that many of the admissions to hospital are associated with alcohol or drug misuse but detailed information is not available. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The safe limit of alcohol use is generally accepted as 40 grams per day with 80 grams per day seen as a hazardous level. Adult male average consumption in the Northern Territory is 48.9 grams per day which would indicate that many may be drinking at a dangerous level. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>(a) The percentage of Aboriginal income spent on alcohol varies from community to community. The few figures available for the Northern Territory vary from 5 per cent on Maningrida outstations to 27 per cent at Bamyili and 50 per cent at Oenpelli. </para>
              <list type="loweralpha">
                <item label="(b)">
                  <para>While statistics are not available it is considered that the level of clinical alcoholism would be well below this rate. Problem 'binge' or episodic drinkers would be likely to reach the level stated in many communities. Unless this group can modify its drinking behaviour there is a danger of a higher level of clinical alcoholism developing. </para>
                </item>
                <item label="(c)">
                  <para>Yes. However it would appear that alcohol abuse is mainly a means of escape from a depressed physical, social and economic environment. It is obvious that this form of escape mechanism adds to the severity of the problem being faced. </para>

            </item>
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>No. Some element of control over the provision of alcohol in Aboriginal communities exists in the permit system where permits are only issued with the approval of the local Aboriginal council. Other Aboriginal communities have decided either that they wish to be dry or that limits are to be placed on the type and quantity of alcohol on sale. Some communities, using legal means, have caused storekeepers to lose liquor licences. In some instances Aboriginal communities have made arrangements with local liquor sales outlets for restrictions on the type and quantity of alcohol sales. Following a number of recent reports on alcohol problems faced by Aboriginals, the Northern Territory Legislative Council has sought Aboriginal viewpoints on the development of new liquor legislation. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(">
              <para>6 ) The development of liquor outlets in the wake of both mining development and the expansion of tourist areas has meant that many Aboriginals have easier access to alcohol supplies; this has led in some instances to increases in alcohol abuse. While this is unfortunate, prohibition either by direct legal measures or by the restriction of sales outlets is not a long-term solution to the problem. People must develop attitudes and behavioural patterns that allow them to cope with such social dangers as the availability of alcohol and this is essential for all Australians not merely Aboriginals. </para>

              <para>I am willing to negotiate on any matter relating to the health of Aboriginals. Arrangements have been made for me to discuss with other Ministers the final report on alcohol problems of Aboriginals prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. My Department has also been involved in discussions on the control of alcohol and the protection of Aboriginal interests in the new liquor legislation now being prepared in the Northern Territory. </para>

It does not hold records of payments made in relation to these grants. I am further advised that a full list of payments made by the Commonwealth Literary Fund would require an extensive search of archival records of several departments. In the circumstances I am not prepared to release scarce staff resources for this task. Records are readily available of payments made from the Literature Board from 1 July 1973, when it was established. The 10 major recipients of grants from the Board are set out below: </para>

            <para>- the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>I have seen reports in the media to the effect that Englehard Minerals and Chemicals Corp. of the United States has negotiated an agreement with West Australian Kaolin Pty Ltd to undertake the development of a Kaolin deposit at Gabbin in Western Australia. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>to (4) I have been advised by the Bureau of Mineral Resources as follows: </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Clays are a potential source of aluminium although their use in aluminium production is currently uneconomic and not competitive with the Bayer process for the extraction of alumina from bauxite. From an average of chemical analyses carried out by CSIRO, the alumina content of the Gabbin coating clay is 38 percent, or about 20 percent aluminium. </para>
          <para>Gross reserves reported by West Australian Kaolin Co. Pty Ltd (in terms of clay content) are- </para>
          <para>Coating clay 10,700,000 tonnes </para>
          <para>Filler clay 6, 1 50,000 tonnes </para>
          <para>No analysis of the filler clay is available, but it is a less pure variety than the coating clay, and the alumina content is probably lower. </para>
          <para>It would seem from reports that the Gabbin clay owes its economic importance mainly to its suitability as a paper coating clay because of its very high grade. There are several large deposits of clays in Western Australia better situated in respect of transport and ports, which would be equally as suitable as sources of alumina should there ever be a demand for clay for this purpose. </para>
          <para>The United States Bureau of Mines has been involved for more than 50 years in research on methods of extracting alumina from its vast domestic resources of nonbauxitic materials. Studies of a variety of process technologies developed within the outside USBM have shown that to date none of the alternative processes is competitive with the Bayer process using bauxite. </para>
          <para>The USBM reported in 1976 that it was not possible to predict which alternative process might eventually prove to be commercially feasible. A pilot plant based on the most promising mini-plant technology would need to be built and operated to provide data for scaling up the selected process to commercial size and enable cost estimates to be made. The main advantage of the research to date is that it has demonstrated that the US could, in national emergency and if necessary, satisfy its need for alumina from its own resources. However, because of the uneconomic nature of the alternative processes any such project to produce alumina would need to be a government venture and could not be undertaken economically by a private company. </para>
          <para>The importance of titanium as a by-product of any process for the extraction of alumina from clay would depend on the concentration of titania in the clay, the form in which it occurs, and the feasibility of extracting it from the residue resulting from the alumina production process. It is important to realise in this context that Australian bauxites contain titanium (usually in higher proportion than that in the Gabbin kaolin yet the titanium is not in a usable form in the red mud residues, and so far extraction has not been feasible. </para>
          <para>An average of analyses carried out by CSIRO on the Gabbin clay showed it to have a ti02 content of 0.41 percent. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>(a) In view of the above technical advice, it would seem highly unlikely that development of a kaolin deposit in Western Australia would be based on its potential as an alternative to bauxite in aluminium production. (b) Any proposal by Englehard to jointly develop these Kaolin deposits would need to be submitted to the Foreign Investment Review Board for examination under the Foreign Investment Guidelines and would be considered by the Government in the light of the Board 's report. </para>

              <para>and (3) No. The Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, as a part of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, is subject to staff ceiling restrictions as are all other Commonwealth Departments. The Repatriation Commission has directed that no patient is to be admitted unless an adequate standard of medical care can be provided. Patient intakes are carefully monitored in compliance with this policy and where the appropriate standard of medical care cannot be provided, arrangements are made for patients to be admitted to other hospitals. This is not a new development as no hospital can handle all medical situations. To attempt to do so would mean a concentration in numbers and quality of manpower and equipment which would be quite wasteful. In excess of $1,000,000 has been spent on specialised equipment at Greenslopes over the past five years. However, all items of equipment cannot be purchased immediately, as priorities must be set within the limits of funds available, but patient treatment has not suffered. </para>

            <para>As I stated in my second reading speech on the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1978 the Government accepted the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry's recommendation that consideration be given to the resumption of Goodparla and pan or all of Gimbat, with a view to their incorporation in the park. Their significance to the park is well recognised and the Government will be looking at this matter at the appropriate time. </para>

            <para>I am aware of the recent press report concerning alleged views of the GROW organisation on drug education. The claim that the Federal Government's National Drug Education Program is doing more harm than good is not in accordance with the true situation. Demands from all sectors of the community are increasing for the programs, which are conducted by Federal and State Health authorities. </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth Government, in 1977-78, provided $825,000 for the National Program which is developed, coordinated and evaluated by the Drug Education SubCommittee of the National Standing Control Committee on </para>
            <para class="block">Drugs of Dependence. The Sub-Committee comprises Federal and State Health education administrators as well as members with special expertise in the education, management and law enforcement fields and has developed a national approach to drug education. </para>
            <para>This approach stresses the fact that all drugs can cause harm depending upon the dose taken, the frequency of use, the kind of individual and the setting in which the drug is taken. </para>
            <para>The Drug Education Sub-Committee considers that the provision of information on drugs is only one aspect of an education program. It recommends that drug education be conducted in the broad context of health education with emphasis on personal relationships, lifestyles, decision-making and 'alternatives' to drugs. The National Program follows the principles advocated by the World Health Organization and UNESCO for effective drug education. </para>
            <para>Developments, both local and overseas, associated with all aspects of drugs of dependence are closely watched by my Department and up-to-date information from authoritative sources is provided in various publications for use by people working in related areas as well as the public. </para>
            <para>You can be assured that there is no substance in the alleged views of the GROW organisation concerning the Federal Government's Drug Education Program. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Yes. Insect pests in stored grain and seeds are showing increased resistance to a range of insecticides, including malathion. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Of the insect-control methods now in use, CSIRO considers fumigation with toxic gases to be the preferred method. It has particular application in controlling insecticide-resistant strains of pests. However, fumigation cannot readily be adopted in most Australian bulk grain storages because they are not gas-tight. The most commonly used method of insect control is still with contact insecticides such as malathion. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Recent CSIRO research on a variant of fumigation- using controlled atmospheres- has established the value of the atmospheric gases nitrogen and, more particularly, carbon dioxide, in place of highly toxic gaseous chemicals. Associated with this work have been efforts to develop ways of sealing existing grain silos to make them sufficiently gas-tight for fumigation control. </para>
          <para>Widespread adoption of the controlled atmosphere method (or any fumigation method) depends largely on whether Australia's existing and future bulk grain storage and handling systems can be sealed to the required degree of gas-tightness. This is a long-term proposition. In the meantime, other solutions to the insecticide-resistance problem are needed, and CSIRO is experimenting with new chemicals and improved methods of insecticidal control. Both this and the controlled atmosphere research are carried out in cooperation with the Australian Wheat Board, State grain elevator boards, and State Departments of Agriculture. There is similar co-operation with two other CSIRO research programs on the control of stored grain pests, namely, control by cooled/refrigerated air, and control by hot air. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Although full details of the United States budget proposed by  President  Carter are not yet available, preliminary figures indicate that agriculture is not the only sector to be affected by  President  Carter's proposed stringency measures. However, the tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication programs will not be affected by these proposed reductions in expenditure. The proposed allocation to the USDA for brucellosis eradication in 1978-79 is $64m, an increase of $8.1 m on the allocation for 1977-78. A slight reduction in funds allocated to the USDA for tuberculosis eradication is proposed but this is due largely to the success of the program, with the disease now being virtually eradicated from the USA. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>(a) The USDA has directed substantial funds and resources to the brucellosis problem over the last few years, with USDA expenditure on brucellosis eradication being $36.8m in 1975-76, $41.5m in 1976-77 and $53.9m in the current fiscal year. The proposed USDA allocation of $64m for the next Financial year indicates that the priority given to the complete eradication of this disease has not been reduced. </para>
              <list type="loweralpha">
                <item label="(b)">
                  <para>With regard to the States' contribution to the funding of the brucellosis eradication program in the USA it is understood that in the past the States together have at least matched the USDA expenditure. For the next fiscal year it is reported that most States plan to increase their contribution to cover at least increased costs due to inflation. </para>
                </item>
                <item label="(c)">
                  <para>Significant progress has been made in brucellosis eradication over the last three years and although there are some problems in a number of the southern States the goal of complete eradication is now in sight. For example, the number of infected herds has been reduced from 16,000 in December 1975 to only 8,000 in September 1977. With only 8,000 infected herds, 99.6 per cent of the 1.8 million herds in the USA are now free of the disease. The increased funds and resources that have been made available for brucellosis eradication and the recent progress indicate that the 1983 deadline for complete eradication should be met. </para>

            <para>Details of the percentage contribution to the gross domestic product of primary, mining, manufacturing and all other industries are shown below. The ABS does not separately define a tertiary industry. In the following table all other industries notionally would include a tertiary industry but also include such industries as electricity, gas and water and construction which generally would not be considered to be tertiary industries. </para>
            <para>Data used in the calculations for he last three years specified below are classified according to the Australian Standard Industrial Classification, while the data for earlier periods are classified according to the 1 966 Population Census 'Classified List of Industries'. The change in classifications has not had a significant effect on the reported shares of the primary and mining industries but it has resulted in a net reduction of about two percentage points in the share attributed to manufacturing industry during the last three periods shown. </para>
