            <para>I resent Dedman&#39;s dictatorship as does every one in Western Australia.  His  latest blunder concerning the rationing of clothing has resulted in goods being grabbed up by wealthy people. Working men&#39;s wires and daughters are unable to obtain necessary clothing. 1 have a daughter, working from 9 to 5, and a married one with three children, the eldest five, the youngest one year. What chance hove they in this mad rush? This, applies to thousands of women working here. </para>

          <para class="block">In view of the continuance of the buying rush referred to in the telegram, which is not confined to Western Australia but is general throughout the Commonwealth, and the ability of those who have money and leisure to make purchases to the exclusion of working people, including those engaged in war industries, what action is proposed by the Minister for War Organization of Industry with a view to correcting the position? </para>

              <para>- I do not admit that the restriction of sales has enabled the wealthier sections of the community to obtain a greater quantity of clothing than  they are entitled to have; &#34;Workers, too, have participated in the buying rush. However, the Government is watching the position closely, and will later take whatever action it may deem necessary in order to effect adjustments. </para>

Is the honorable gentleman aware that some bakers have been allocated such zones that their deliveries have been - reduced by nearly 1,000 loaves a week, and that the reduced prices are operating on one side of the street but will not operate on the other side until the 1st June next? </para>

            <para>- I have seen the press statement that a reduction of the price of bread has been made in certain suburbs of Sydney. This reduction was the result of a decision by the Commissioner of Prices. That gentleman has in my department a liaison officer, who keeps him in touch with our activities, in order that he may pass on to the public, by way of a price reduction, the benefit of any lowering of costs thus revealed. The Commissioner of Prices is under the control of the Minister for Trade and Customs. It is true that the reduction of the price of bread is due to the introduction of the zone system. Meeting the contention that the allocation of zones has been such, that some bakers have been placed at a disadvantage, I would say that in the early stages of a plan of this sort it is impossible to ensure that each baker delivering in a zone will be able to deliver the same quantity of bread as he previously supplied. Re-adjustments are being made from time to time, and it is hoped that inequalities in relation to the number of loaves delivered will be rectified at an early date. </para>

              <para>- A committee is operating in the industry. It consists of representatives of the bakers and the trade union concerned, with an officer of my department as  chairman.  Readjustments must necessarily take some little time. However, they are being made; and it is hoped that the position will be stabilized at a very early date. I am not aware that the reduction of price is operating on one side, and not the other, of a street; but, as I have already said, that matter is within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Trade and Customs, because the reduction of price has been made by the Commissioner of Prices. </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the interest rate charged on first mortgages in the circumstances mentioned by the honorable member. However, the matter of interest rates on mortgages has been under consideration by me, and also by previous Treasurers. I believe that it was referred by previous Treasurers to the Capital Issues Advisory Board for advice as to how the interest rates charged could be controlled. The ranges of rates and risks associated with first and second mortgages are extremely difficult matters to determine. It has been hoped, as I think it was hoped by previous Treasurers, that the control and reduction of interest rates on bank advances would influence the rate charged on first mortgages. The matter is being further examined, but I can give no indication as to the likelihood of a regulation being promulgated, in view of the many difficulties associated, with an equitable adjustment of the matter. </para>

              <para>- I am this afternoon having an interview with the representatives of the Miners Federation, and I have no doubt that they will make submissions to me. I can only say that I shall weigh them fairly and fully. I have no doubt that various tribunals do arrive at different assessments, but it is not the province of a government to set aside the decisions of properly constituted tribunals. The Government must leave the law to take its course, and the decisions of competent authorities must be respected. At the same time, I am satisfied that events on the coal-fields cannot be explained in terms of ordinary industrial disputes. Some of the stoppages cannot&#39; be explained by anything hitherto, known in the history of industrial relations, and I am most anxious to discover the. cause. To. this end, I shall be glad to avail myself of any help I can get. I shall consult with the representatives of the employees this afternoon. I shall, also be quite willing to hear what the owners have to say; but I. put it to the owners and to the workers, and to the country generally, that anything which has to be suffered at the present time, in order to- ensure the maximum! production of coal, is worth suffering, and must represent a smaller&#39; disability to those who suffer it than would be the consequences of not continuing1 to- produce coal. I say deliberately to the owners that it is their business to assist the Government to remove those irritations  and  exasperations- which,, in their knowledge: of the industry, lead to stoppages:; and,, on the other- hand, I put. it to. the miners that it is .their duty not to beeasily provoked into creating stoppages. I know enough about, this business to understand that all the fault is&#39; not on one. side. It, never has been, and. it is not so to-day. Therefore,, I ask. those associated with the industry, employers and employees alike, to put, aside their own sectional outlook,, and have regard to. the needs and welfare of the nation-. </para>

            <para>- I do not know whether the Australian Broadcasting Commission can answer that question. I cannot say how many times Tokyo radio has quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch, myself  or anybody else. I am not interested as to how many times Tokyo radio quotes anybody, because it ought to be patent to the Australian public, and to the world at large, that what Tokyo says is not necessarily the truth, and that, in any case, Tokyo is prompted by the desire to advance the cause of the enemy. I know well that statements lend them-elves to quotation, but that is rarely done without either misquotation, the placing of a wrong interpretation upon what has been said, or the suppression of some essential part of the statement allegedly quoted. The people of this nation would do well to place no reliance on what is -said by enemy propagandists. </para>

The honorable member asked whether I would consider an amendment to Statutory Rules 1941, No. 318, to provide that grant of probate might be made in the ordinary way. As promised, I referred the matter to the Solicitor-General, who has advised that, where national security regulations impinge on the law of the six States, legal difficulties may be expected and, in the present case, difficulties have arisen in New South Wales. The question of amending regulation 25 of the National Security &#39;(Supplementary) Regulations to remove these difficulties is at present receiving earnest consideration. </para>

            <para>- On Thursday last, it was ascertained that six German prisoners of war were missing from a party which was employed in wood-cutting about <inline font-style="italic">%i</inline> miles from a camp near Murchison. The civil police and military personnel immediately commenced a search of the area, and all the  escaped  prisoners have since been recaptured. A court of inquiry has been assembled and  is  now sitting. It is anticipated that the proceedings will be completed by Friday of this week. Pending&#39; the receipt of the report ofthe court of inquiry, the camp commandant has been suspended. The circumstances under which these persons made their escape emphasize the risks associated with the guarding of active, youthful, prisoners of war when they are made available for labour outside of the prison camps. Great difficulty is being experienced in providing a.n adequate number of guards to control the prisoners and to make escapes impossible&#39;. </para>

          <para>.- The definition of &#34;deserted wife&#34; is: &#34;a wife who has been deserted by her husband for a period of not less than six months &#34;. Does the Minister propose that a pension shall be payable to every wife who has been deserted, irrespective of who is responsible for the desertion? Under the New South Wales law, a deserted wife who is a claimant for relief payable under local charitable legislation must prove that at least she has endeavoured to compel her husband, by means of a court order, to observe his financial responsibilities. There is no such qualification in this measure. I raise the matter in order that the Minister may realize the <inline font-style="italic">possible</inline> result. Great difficulty will be experienced in proving that a wife who is living apart from her husband has been genuinely deserted, and that her husband is shirking responsibility for her maintenance, unless she furnishes to the Deputy Commissioner evidence that satisfies him that she is in fact a deserted wife and has taken court proceedings to compel her husband to maintain her if he is able to do so. There should be some proof apart from her own statement that she is a genuinely deserted wife. Many marriages are dissolved by mutual consent. A wife may be as willing to be apart from her husband as the husband to be apart from her. </para>

          <para>.- The definition of &#34; widow &#34; should be extended so as to include the wife of a person who is in receipt of an invalid pension. I drew the Minister&#39;s attention to this matter at an earlier stage of the bill. The honorable gentleman should realize that a woman whose husband is totally and permanently incapacitated, and is consequently in receipt of an invalid pension, should be entitled to receive a widow&#39;s pension. Because she has no means of livelihood for herself and her children, she is probably in more unfortunate circumstances than a woman whose husband is an inmate of a hospital for the insane, or one who has been deserted by her husband, yet women in both of those categories will be entitled to be classed as widows. The wife of an invalid pensioner would receive child endowment in respect of any children after the first child, but would not have any assistance for herself or the first child. She might be in- the position of having to care for her invalid husband. Such a woman should be covered by the definition of &#34;widow&#34;. Where the wife of a man who is in receipt of the old-age pension goes out to work in order to supplement the family income, half of the income earned by her is deemed to be the income of the husband, and the amount by which the pensioner&#39;s income exceeds 12s. 6d. is deducted from her husband&#39;s pension. Therefore, this is an appropriate opportunity to provide that a woman whose husband is incapable of earning any sum towards the maintenance of his wife and family should receive the same financial assistance from the Commonwealth as will be granted to a widow under this measure. I ask for an assurance that an amendment to cover cases of this kind will be included in the bill. </para>

          <para>.- This clause is deficient in another respect, apart from those mentioned by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> and the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark).</inline> Provision should be made so that a woman whose husband is an inmate of a gaol or penal establishment may receive financial assistance. There is no good reason why a woman whose husband is an inmate of a hospital for the insane should be treated differently from a woman whose husband is an inmate of a gaol. In many countries such women are placed both in the same category. Some years ago, when I was a member of the Victorian Public Service, I was appointed investigating officer for a select committee of the Victorian Legislative Assembly that made inquiries regarding the granting of widows&#39; pensions and child endowment, and I had an opportunity to ascertain the condition under which many unfortunate families live. Some harrowing stories were told before the committee, and about 40 cases were submitted by the Children&#39;s Welfare Department to me to investigate. The conditions under which families were being maintained constituted a striking tribute to maternal affection under the most adverse circumstances. I can recollect hearing of women whose husbands were in gaol being compelled to work in order to maintain themselves and their children. In some instances they went to work at an early hour and left their children huddled together in school sheds from 7 a.m. until school commenced at 9 a.m. After school hours the children were left to play in the streets until their mothers returned from their work in the factories or shops. Women should not be treated as social pariahs, merely because their husbands have committed crimes against the State. If a husband is forced to go to gaol, and pay the penalty for his misdeeds, surely punishment should not also be visited upon his dependants. The Bible records that the iniquity of the fathers shall be visited upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation ; but there is no justification for a Labour government causing the iniquity of the erring father to be visited on his wife and children. If the Minister will not adopt my suggestion I shall submit an amendment to provide that a woman whose husband is in gaol shall receive the benefits of this measure. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In another part of the bill it is provided that a widow who has had five years&#39; residence in Australia immediately prior to the date of her claim for the pension shall be eligible for the benefit of this legislation. I am not opposed to that provision, but I visualize the possibility that payment of the widow&#39;s pension may be made in future to many unfortunate European refugees who may settle in Australia. It might so happen that a woman who could scarcely speak English would be eligible for a pension under the bill, whereas an Australianborn woman with Australian-bora children would be denied the benefit of the legislation, because her husband happened to be in gaol. I do not believe that such a discrimination would be supported by the people of this country. Under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act a person must have resided in Australia for twenty years before being entitled to the pension, but in respect of widows the residential qualification is to be reduced to -five years. I agree with that proposition, but we should not make an exception in the case of the unfortunate Australian-born woman whose Australian-born husband happens to be in gaol. As was mentioned by the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark),</inline> the wife of an invalid pensioner would be far better off financially if her husband were dead. The invalid husband will receive 25s. a week, and will be expected to maintain his wife and himself on that sum. Of course, it is impossible for a wife who has an invalid husband to leave him unattended. If he died his widow would immediately become eligible for benefits to be provided under this bill. It is desirable in the interests of society that a mother should be with her young children, and that they should not be forced to roam the streets or be sent off early in the morning to school while the mother goes out to earn her living. Experience has shown that lack of parental control is often responsible for children turning to crime at an early age. Where the home influence is strong, there are fewer potential criminals. We do not want to see our gaols filled ; we want them to be empty. What a government saves by refusing assistance to destitute mothers it often pays out later in the maintenance of prisoners. </para>
        <para>We have made provision for a divorced wife when she is the innocent party. I do not object to that, but I fail to see why the divorced wife of an erring husband should be placed in a better position  than  tho  undivorced  wife - if I may use the expression - of a man who has broken the law of the land, and has been sent to gaol. </para>

            <para>- Yes, in sin, as the honorable member for Watson states, then surely we can make provision for a legally married wife whose husband, perhaps in a fit of passion, has broken the law and is imprisoned as a result. It is quite possible for men in these troubled times to be sent to gaol for political offences, and as the law now stands, their wives would be compelled to suffer for the opinions of their husbands. There are in this House to-day several honorable members who, at one time or another, have committed political offences against the law, and have been prosecuted. I ask them to think what might have happened to their wives and children if they had gone to gaol instead of paying fines. What would be their reaction to-day if they were not members of Parliament and heard that legislation was being passed that made no provision for cases similar to their own ? The legislation of at least one State in Australia provides that a woman whose husband is in gaol may receive some assistance from the State. In other States, there is no such law, and I believe that, whether there is any State provision of the kind or not, this bill should be amended so as to make eligible for pensions women belonging to the last two remaining classes unprovided for, namely, those whose husbands are in gaol, and who have young children in their care. I do not know whether the Minister has been sufficiently impressed with my arguments to be able to state now that he is prepared to agree to my proposal, or whether I should at this stage move an amendment to give effect to it. </para>

          <para>.- The observations of the two honorable members who preceded the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> cause me to direct attention to the fact that no Australian-wide scheme of widows&#39; pensions or child endowment will ever be complete unless accompanied by and. administered in conjunction with a child welfare scheme. In the State of New South Wales, where widows&#39; pensions have been paid for many years, a scheme of child welfare operates. I am not prepared to say that it is the best available, but it provides a wonderful opportunity for the Commonwealth Government to examine the matter of child welfare. I do not desire that the thorough work of the- Joint Committee on Social Security be duplicated; but there is need for some investigation to supplement the committee&#39;s report. Evidence could be obtained from experts in child welfare. Without the operation of a child welfare scheme, widows&#39; pensions and child endowment will become, in many cases, mere financial hand-touts, and will not go to the root of the problem of the human and cultural rehabilitation of the family in need. I hope that the Minister will take that matter to Cabinet and set in motion such an investigation as. will cause to be brought into operation a child welfare scheme which will make the widows&#39; pensions and &#39;child endowment schemes more successful. </para>

Many women are reluctant to apply to the courts for maintenance orders against their husbands.

As the bill now stands the fact of desertion has only to be established for the claimant to be entitled to a pension, notwithstanding that the desertion may be more pretended than real. The suggestion of the honorable member for Dalley could be met by an amendment of clause 14 which deals with disqualifications for pension. </para>

          <para>. -  With the general purpose of the amendment I am in agreement, but in my opinion a proviso should be added in order to vest in the Commissioner the right to disallow pensions in cases in which a claimant is obviously unworthy. I do not suggest that every guilty party to divorce proceedings is unworthy of social benefits, but it needs little imagination to visualize a person who is entirely undeserving of a pension. </para>

          <para>. -  I again stress the necessity for inserting a provision to cover the wife of an invalid pensioner. The Minister&#39;s argument that an amendment of this character would involve an expenditure of &#163;650,000 is, in my opinion, justification for acceptance of the amendment, as it shows that numbers of women, whose husbands are incapable through ill health of providing for them, have difficulty in maintaining adequately themselves and their families. Would I be in order in moving that the definition of &#34; widow &#34; shall include &#34; a wife whose husband is totally and permanently incapacitated &#34; ? </para>

            <para>-  I rise to a point of order. I understand that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> have ruled that the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> cannot move to alter the qualifications required of a candidate for a widow&#39;s pension under clause 4 of the bill, and that you have given as your reason that the proposed amendment would increase the appropriation. Clause 4 is not an appropriation clause. I ask that the message transmitted to the House by the Governor-General be read to this committee. It did not state whether the persons who were to qualify for pensions under the bill should be <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> widows, or women whose husbands were in gaol, or in Hong Kong or anywhere else. The message requested that an appropriation of money be made in order to provide a fund from which to pay pensions to widows. The definition of &#34;widow&#34; is a matter to be dealt with in the bill, and, therefore, it is a matter for this committee to decide. I ask that the GovernorGeneral&#39;s message be read to the committee. </para>

            <para>-  There is plenty of cause for such .criticism. If your ruling is to stand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> the result will be that, no matter what measure comes before this committee, honorable members will not be permitted to move any amendment affecting qualifications for the receipt of public money, on the ground that any such amendment would increase an appropriation. The recommendation for an appropriation of .money for widows&#39; pensions provides, according to my recollection, &#34; for the payment of pensions to widows &#34;. The word &#34; widows &#34; was not defined in that message from the Governor-General, nor was the amount of the appropriation mentioned. Two important matters must be considered by this committee. One is the definition of the term &#34; widow &#34;, which should be considered now; the other is the amount of money to be appropriated for the payment of widows&#39; pensions, which should be considered at a later stage.

            <para>-  I say &#34; Yes &#34;. En any case, amendments requiring increases of appropriations have been agreed to time after time in this place. If .this ruling is to stand, honorable members will be able to do nothing more than assent to or dissent from any recommendations for the appropriation of public funds. They will be prevented from deciding in detail the purposes for which appropriations shall be used. I should like to see the standing order which, according to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> provides that in committee honorable members may not vary the qualifications required of a person who receives money from the Crown. Recommendations made in messages from the Governor-General are always wide, because this committee must have full power to decide what should be done with -appropriations so recommended. For the time being, I shall leave the matter at this stage, but I request that the Governor-General&#39;s message, recommending an appropriation to meet the requirements of this bill, be read to the committee. Honorable members will find that it imposes no limitations. It is for this committee to decide the definition of &#34; widow &#34;. </para>

            <para>-  I hope that honorable members will not allow their desires to overrule their judgment in considering the issue before the Chair. The Chairman&#39;s ruling is undoubtedly correct, as the honorable member for Barker (Mt. Archie Cameron) must realize when he considers the matter carefully. The bill provides for the payment of pensions to a widow, a <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> widow, a deserted wife, a woman who has  been granted a. divorce from her husband and has not re-married, and a woman whose husband is an inmate of a hospital for the insane. The honorable member for Melbourne (Mr:. Calwell) now desires to include in the definition the wife- of a man serving a term of imprisonment exceeding three months. Obviously, such a provision would increase the amount of money required to meet the cost of the scheme. </para>

            <para>- The amount was determined when the Government completed its plan to pay these pensions. If the classes of persons eligible for the pension be increased, obviously the amount of money necessary will also have to be increased.

            <para>- I support the motion of dissent. If the Chairman&#39;s ruling be correct, honorable members of this Parliament are obviously debarred from moving amendments to bills of this character. The term &#34; widow &#34; was not defined in the Governor-General&#39;s message.. If the amendment which has been ruled out of order had proposed an increase of the pension from 25s. to 26s. a week, or the payment of pensions to children, or to other persons, an assumption that the appropriation would need to be increased would be justified. But how can an accurate estimate be made of the amount of money involved in this scheme, seeing that provision is being made, for the payment of pensions to persons in Australia who have been widows for five years immediately prior to the date of their claim?&#39; Pensions canbe paid to widows of enemy soldiers who come to this country with their children when the war is over because they believe that life under1 the. Southern Cross will be safer and. happier than in war-torn Europe. If this ruling be sustained the members of this Parliament will be reduced to the status of members of the German Reichstag and the  Chairman  of Committees will become a kind of Marshal Goering whose call for &#34; &#34;Fni-1. &#34; must bo responded to by every one. My amendment to provide for the payment of pensions to women whose husbands are serving a term of imprisonment of more than three months, and also the proposal of the honorable member for Barling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark),</inline> have been ruled out of order on the ground that their acceptance by the committee would increase the appropriation, but how can it be assumed with any exactitude that the appropriation would be increased? There might be a saving in the amount of money estimated to be necessary to pay pensions already provided for in the bill. As no evidence has been submitted to the committee that my amendment would necessarily increase the appropriation I support the motion of dissent. </para>

            <para>- Of course it is an estimate, but it is the amount covered by the appropriation, for which the Government must make provision. The Constitution makes it perfectly clear that no expenditure of this character may be authorized by the Parliament except as the result of the consideration of a message from the Governor-General. Our practice in this regard has not varied since the inception of federation. As the  Chairman  of Committees has pointed out, when the Minister for Social Services indicated that the Government was prepared to accept two amendments suggested during the second-reading debate, the honorable gentleman had to fortify himself with an additional appropriation message. Although the  Chairman  of Committees rightly declined to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Melbourne, it would, nevertheless, be quite proper for that honorable gentleman to submit a case to the Minister in support of his proposal. If the Minister were convinced of the soundness of the case, and if the Government agreed to a proposal of the nature outlined, an amendment could be moved by the Minister himself, or else the Senate may be invited to request that the bill be amended in the desired direction. The point is that only a member of the Parliament who is qualified to present a message from the Governor-General providing for an increase of the appropriation is competent to move such an amendment. I do not see how public expenditure could be  controlled except on that basis. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister has explained very carefully the practice of Parliament, but he might have made the position clearer for those honorable members who have had little experience of parliamentary procedure, by explaining to them the underlying principle, namely, that responsibility for financial measures belongs to the Government itself. It is rather misleading to suggest that there is some mysterious procedure associated with the receipt of a message from the Governor-General in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution. The fact is that the Government is responsible for financial measures, and Parliament cannot amend those measures except by taking action which would displace the Government from office. In this instance, an amendment has been propose.-! which would increase the amount of money to be expended. The interesting piece of sophistry indulged in by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> namely, that in some other category the expenditure might not come up to the estimate, and that, therefore, the total expenditure might not be more  than that contemplated in the bill in its present form, does not alter the situation. The Government must necessarily estimate future expenditure, and if an amendment be passed providing for increased expenditure in a particular category, then it must be assumed that the total expenditure also will be increased by that amount. It is surely straining the language to say that a woman whose husband is in gaol for a period of three months or more is a widow. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister advanced a clever and specious argument. I remind honorable members, however, that the message of the Governor-General recommending an appropriation merely stated that this committee should provide a sum of money for the purposes of a bill, and that sum of money is not named in the bill or anywhere else. The only figure mentioned in the bill is the rate of pension or allowance that shall be paid to a widow. It is for this committee, and for no one else, to determine who is entitled to receive that pension. It is absurd for the Prime Minister to argue that every proposal is out of order which does not fit in with the Government&#39;s ideas in regard to a bill which has not yet been passed by the Parliament. There  may be important and honest differences of opinion regarding what a bill means. I have always had a great admiration for Charles I. and the other Stuarts, and it seems to me that their methods were, in some respects, much more intelligible than those of the Prime Minister. </para>

If the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> wants to press his point, he may, when the Appropriation Bill is brought down, move that the amount be reduced by &#163;1 as an instruction to the Government to do what he wishes.

          <para>.- What would happen in the case of a widow who had been maintaining children until she had reached the age of 40 years or 45 years, and whose last child had passed the age of sixteen years? Would she be suddenly thrown on the world without a pension ? This provision would operate harshly in respect of widows who had spent the greater part of their lives in raising families and were suddenly cut off from all financial help. I suggest for the consideration of the Minister that some thought should be given to helping women in this category. They might be granted a period of, say, six months, in which to seek employment, before the pension is taken from them, or discretionary power might be given to the Commissioner to continue the payment of the pension in certain cases in which it appears that there is reasonable ground for doing so. I hope that the anomaly will be corrected. </para>

          <para>.- I. support the request of the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan).</inline> The bill does not make clear what is to happen to a woman who has been drawing the pension under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> and whose child has passed the age of sixteen years or has died under that age. Clause 21, which is the disqualifying clause, sets out certain events upon which a widow&#39;s right to the pension should be devested, but it makes no reference to the case where the child whom she is maintaining has reached the age of sixteen years or has died younger. It provides, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that the pension shall not be payable for any period after the pensioner ceases to be resident in Australia, marries or remarries, or, being a deserted wife, ceases to be a deserted wife otherwise than by the death of her husband. No provision is made for the woman who, having been entitled to a pension under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 13, and whose child has passed the age of sixteen years, or has died before attaining that age, is deprived of the pension. Under clause 25  an  allowance of 25s. a week for  a  period not longer than 26 weeks is provided for, but I suggest that the pension of the widowed mother should continue after the child&#39;s death, or after the child has reached the age of sixteen years, either at the discretion of the Commissioner or definitely if the mother has passed a certain age. In my view, the pension shouldbe continued automatically to a mother who has passed the age of 45 years, even though her child has died or reached the age of sixteen years. </para>

I am not sure whether the legislation has yet been passed, but I know that it was introduced in the Legislative Assembly. Is it intended to permit the benefit to be conferred under the Commonwealth Widows&#39; Pensions Bill to be augmented by the amount payable under the State legislation; or, does the Treasurer intend to deduct from the grant to be made by the Commonwealth to the State not&#34; only the amount actually expended by it in respect of widows&#39; pensions during the last two years, but also the amount involved in the State legislation at present under consideration ? </para>

            <para>- It ought not to be true of any State. Legislation of this kind should contain provision for the protection of the Commonwealth Treasury against State governments obtaining a benefit which this Parliament intended should be enjoyed by children, widows, or other persons. The Minister for Social Services has said that the matter will be raised at a Premiers Conference. That does not satisfy me. I am not assured tha t the Premiers would be in a receptive mood if the Commonwealth should tell them that they must not make such profits. Commonwealth legislation should be so framed that its validity may, if necessary, stand the test of appeal to the High Court. </para>

        <para>I should be immensely intrigued to know exactly how the officers who are to administer this act ascertained the number of persons widowed, or likely to he widowed, during a period of five years immediately preceding the date of a claim for a widow&#39;s pension. I said at an earlier stage that it is possible that quite a lot of persons will wish to come to Australia from European countries at the termination of the war. Many of them will be the widows of men killed in the conflict. After a residence of five years in Australia, they will be entitled to claim the benefits of this legislation, whether they were widowed before or after their arrival in this country. Whatever appropriation has been fixed; the Governor-General has been misled; because it is not possible for any official to say what this scheme is likely to cost. What irks me considerably is the thought that a number of refugees who will come to Australia because they think it will provide them with an asylum in which the conditions are much easier generally than they have experienced in the land that gave them birth will obtain an advantage over Australian-born subjects whose husbands happen to be in gaol or are invalid pensioners. I can see no reason why, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> respect of future substantial social benefits, those who might never speak our language, but, on the contrary, may congregate in settlements and speak a foreign tongue, should receive better treatment than those of our own kith and kin who have assisted to advance the welfare of this country, and whose parents or grandparents laid the foundations of the prosperity which we of this generation enjoy. Several days have elapsed since I raised this matter on the second reading. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us more than has been vouchsafed to us so far in respect of the probable cost of this bill. </para>

          <para>. I oppose the proposed amendment, the meaning of which is that, if a widow receives a widows&#39; pension from a State, no matter what the amount may be, she shall be disqualified from receiving a widows&#39; pension from the Commonwealth. If that is to be the policy of the Commonwealth Government, it will simply mean that the powers of the State are to be dried up altogether. Is it the policy of this Parliament that the States shall go altogether out of the field of social service? Clause 15 provides that the permissible income from other sources of a recipient of the widows&#39; pension shall not exceed &#163;32 10s. per annum, and that the annual rate at which the amount of the pension is determined shall be reduced by the amount by which the income exceeds that limit. That is sufficient safeguard, and we should be satisfied and should reject any proposal designed to forbid the States to provide social services. Some writers held that it would be possible for the States to pay an old-age pension at the same time as the Commonwealth Government was paying an old-age pension, but, of course, the States retired from the field when the Commonwealth entered it. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> warns the States off the field of social services altogether. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily. I am opposed to uniform taxation, but the proposed amendment merely rubs salt into the wound. It would mean, if agreed to, that the States would never be able to offer anything by way of social benefits <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> their people. The Commonwealth would provide all social services and the States would be forbidden to provide an auxiliary benefit of the same kind,  because, if a widow received 7s. 6d. from a State, sbe would, under the proposed amendment, lose 25s. a week from the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will not agree to amend the clause in the direction desired by the honorable member for Lilley. </para>

            <para>- No, but the honorable member for Bourke was dismayed lest it should. No State persevered with old-age pensions after the &#39;Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme was instituted. The State of New South Wales vacated the field of child endowment when the Commonwealth Child Endowment Act was passed. I am sure that the great majority of honorable members and of the community anticipate that there will be a similar result from the passage of this legislation. It is inconceivable, although I admit that it would not be illegal - I support this proposed amendment because I desire to make it illegal - to have operating concurrently in some States, State widows&#39; pension schemes and a Commonwealth widows&#39; pension scheme. The situation is made worse in this instance because in New South Wales at present there is a generous widows&#39; pension, in Victoria one much less generous, and none at all in the other States. I warn the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> that unless action along the lines of the amendment be taken the effect on another bill which is to come before us will be serious. Prom the remarks of the Treasurer on Friday last, honorable members generally assumed that it was proposed to adjust the finances as between those States which had certain social services and the Federal Treasury. If, however, we take no steps to prevent New South Wales from running a scheme of widows&#39; pensions concurrently with the Commonwealth scheme, there will be no justification for making a financial adjustment with New South Wales in that connexion. No one will accuse me of lack of sympathy with widows and orphans, but it is almost Gilbertian to suggest that we should have a Commonwealth scheme of widows&#39; pensions operating throughout Australia concurrently with a scheme of widows&#39; pensions operating in certain States, but not all States. I shall support the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I shall probably be compelled to support the amendment of the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly).</inline> At present there are schemes of widows&#39; pensions in operation in New South Wales and Victoria, although the basis of the schemes is different. Bills to provide for uniform taxation  have been introduced to this Parliament. Should they become law, there will be only one system of income taxation in Australia. With that scheme of uniform taxation in operation, certain moneys would have to be allocated to certain States to pay for State pension schemes. That would mean that the Commonwealth Government would be paying two pensions to widows in New South Wales and Victoria and only one pension to widows in the other States. I emphasize that the whole of the money will have to be found by the Commonwealth once the States vacate the field of taxation. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to accept the amendment. </para>

As the position is now, a widow in New South Wales or Victoria would be able to receive at least 12s. 6d. a week from the State Government. Before this legislation was introduced into this Parliament, no pensions were paid to widows outside New South Wales and Victoria,  so&#39;  that persons who now benefit from the legislation of those States will be in no worse position, relatively, than the persons who will benefit by the addition of this pension to the amount of 12s. 6d. a week. As the bill stands, without the amendment, widows in New South Wales and Victoria will be entitled to receive from the State Government an amountequal to 12s. 6d. a week. I believe that they should be allowed, to have that money. I do not agree that 25s. a week, or even 37s. 6d. a week, is an adequate payment to them. </para>

          <para>.- I should not be prepared to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> unless I were satisfied that it had been investigated thoroughly in order to ensure that there would be no unfavorable repercussions. It is unfortunate that, after the announcement of a Commonwealth-wide scheme of widows&#39; pensions, there should have been introduced into one State parliament a measure to provide for a pension to widows at the same rate as is proposed in this bill. I understand that in New South Wales a widow is entitled to a pension of 25s. a week for herself and 10s. a week for each child. This bill provides for 25s. a week for the widow and 5s. a week for the first child, any other children being covered by the existing scheme of child endowment. That will cause complications. In replying to one honorable member, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said that the means test would protect the revenue of the Commonwealth. That is so. The application of the means test will ensure that a widow shall not receive the full Commonwealth pension while she is receiving more than &#163;32 10s. a year from other sources, including any State pension scheme. There is no foundation for the fear which has been expressed by some honorable members that a widow may receive two full pensions. That position cannot arise. </para>

            <para>- The New South Wales widows&#39; pension is &#163;1 a week. The State will have that amount deducted from its compensation. If it decides in the year 1942-43 to increase the rate of widows&#39; pension payable under its own scheme, the Commonwealth cannot be  expected to compensate it on that account. Compensation will be payable only in cases where a widow prefers to remain a recipient of the State pension. <inline font-weight="bold">-Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart. - The Minister has told us that a widow may draw both pensions. </para>

            <para>- The honorable gentleman has misunderstood the Minister&#39;s statement. As I understand the position, if a widow applies for a Commonwealth pension, the means test must be applied to her. If she is in receipt of a State pension amounting to more than &#163;32 10s. a year - as the New South Wales pension does - she will not be allowed to receive Commonwealth pension in excess of the allowable sum. </para>

Under the legislation that has been introduced, the &#39;Commonwealth will deduct from the compensation payable to the State the amount that has been lifted off the financial shoulders of the State.

            <para>- I desire to summarize the position that was discussed before dinner. It is unfortunate that after an announcement had been made that the Commonwealth Government intended to introduce a Commonwealthwide widows&#39; pension scheme, the Government of New South Wales, which was already administering a widows&#39; pension scheme, should have chosen to increase its pension rates. Under the amended legislation of New South Wales the widow&#39;s pension will be 25s. a week, with 10s. a week for a child. Under the Commonwealth scheme the payment will be 25s. a week for the widow, and 5s. a week for the first child. I point out, however, that the allowance for the child will not be considered in the application of the means test to a widow claiming a pension. The means test will apply only to the income of the widow herself. Any moneys she receives for her children will be understood to be for the children and not for her. After the passage of this bill widows in New South Wales will be able to choose whether they will apply for a pension under either or both schemes, but the Commonwealth Parliament should be concerned with the effects of this legislation on the Commonwealth as a whole and not with its effects upon New South Wales only. If a widow obtains a State pension and then applies for a Commonwealth pension the Commonwealth authorities will apply to her a means test under which she will he entitled to receive &#163;32 10s. per annum without detriment to her Commonwealth pension. It appears to me to be likely that the widows in New South Wales will apply for the State pension because of the more liberal allowance for children. In that case the Commonwealth authorities would apply a means test under which a widow might be granted a Commonwealth pension of 12s. 6d. a week, giving her 37s. 6d. a week in all. I repeat that any income she may receive in respect of children would be disregarded for the purposes of the means test. If a State government chooses to subsidize the Commonwealth widows&#39; pension scheme with a scheme of its own, it is not for the Commonwealth to interfere. I cannot support any amendment which will have the effect of imposing a limitation upon what a State government is doing. I believe that the ultimate and, in my view., desirable, effect of this legislation will be the disappearance of the widows&#39; pension scheme of New South Wales. But we are not likely to ensure equality of social service payments throughout the Commonwealth by refraining from passing such legislation in this Parliament. Our business, as a Parliament, is to provide a uniform Australian widows&#39; pension  scheme. If a State government subsidizes that scheme the matter is beyond the control of this Parliament. The Treasurer has already foreshadowed certain compensation payments in connexion with the uniform income tax legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament. Amongst these will be a deduction from the compensation payable to New South Wales of an amount equal to &#163;1 a week for widows, that being the amount payable under the New South Wales pension scheme during 1941-42. Here, also, payments in respect of children will be disregarded. That deduction will not apply in respect of States where there is no similar widows&#39; pension scheme. We must face the fact that, after the passage of this bill, a widow in New South Wales may receive a pension of 37s. 6d. a week, whereas a widow in another State may receive a pension of only 25s. a week, although she may have an income of 12s. 6d. a week from some other source. It will, of course, be quite competent for the Governments of States other than New South Wales to supplement the widows&#39; pension payable by the Commonwealth, although I do not think that that is likely, and I do not lend any support to the suggestion. It is not possible, constitutionally, for this Parliament to interfere with a pension scheme in a State, nor is it desirable that such a course should be followed. </para>

            <para>- The situation in that regard is not quite on all fours. I am referring to income from State sources, or superannuation or provident funds, or property of any kind. If a widow has an income of, say, 25s. a week from any source other than the Commonwealth widows&#39; pension scheme it will be considered in fixing her rate of pension. It is a matter for any State government concerned to consider whether, after the passage of this legislation, it will continue any widows&#39; pension scheme that it may have in operation. It is certainly not for the Commonwealth Parliament to attempt to deprive widows of benefits which they may now enjoy under such legislation. The Government will not be a party to anything of that kind. The principal widows&#39; pension scheme in operation in Australia at present is administered by the Government of New South Wales, although modest schemes are also in force in Victoria at a cost to that State of about &#163;30,000 a year, and in South Australia at a cost to that State of about &#163;8,000 a year; but this Parliament should not try to interfere in such schemes or in any provident schemes organized by private firms. </para>

Almost invariably a contribution, apart from the subscriptions of the beneficiaries is paid by the firm itself. It would create an intolerable situation if the Commonwealth Government interfered in such matters. The insertion of a provision in this bill which would have that effect would bring criticism upon the Parliament. For these reasons the Government cannot accept the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I understand the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spooner)</inline> to contest the statement that there would be a duplication of pensions, and yet to admit that if this bill passes there will be, to some degree, a duplication of widows&#39; pensions. The committee should attempt  to avoid such duplication. The honorable member stated that under the amended New South Wales scheme it would be possible for a widow to receive a pension of 37s. 6d. a week in that State, aggregating the State pension and the amount of pension that would be obtainable from the Commonwealth. Consequently a widow pensioner in New South Wales would be in a much more comfortable position than a widow pensioner in any of the other States. </para>

          <para>-HUGHE S . - My view is that we should not duplicate pensions in this way. As the Government has already introduced certain measures to provide for uniform income taxes throughout the Commonwealth, we are justified in asking that, where practicable, pensions also should be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. If we pass this bill we shall offer a direct inducement to States other than New South Wales to introduce widows&#39; pension schemes in order that benefits available to widows may be uniform in all States.

        <para>The Commonwealth Government has already taken steps in certain directions to avoid duplication of pensions. I direct the attention of honorable members to Statutory Rules 1942, No. 9, covering National Security (War Injuries Compensation) Regulations. Regulation 19 reads - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A pension shall not be granted or payable in respect of the death or incapacity of any person if a pension is payable in respect of that death or incapacity under the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act 1920-41 or the Seamens War Pension and Allowances Act 1940. or compensation is so  payable  under the Naval Defence Act 1910-34, the Defence Act 1903-41, the Air Force Act 1923-39 or the National Security (Civil Defence Volunteers Compensation) Regulations. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The object of the Government, in making that regulation, clearly was to obviate the payment of two pensions to the one person in respect of the same set of circumstances. I admit that, normally, both would be payable by the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para class="block">But surely the rule applies equally where one pension would be payable by the Commonwealth and the other by a .State ! I can see no difference; the result would be the same. The amendment is not only sound but also equitable. If adopted, a certain degree of uniformity would be maintained ; consequently, I intend to support it. </para>

          <para>.- I support the amendment. It is not to the point to state, as the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has done, that other income of a widow will be taken into. consideration under the means test, in determining the amount to be paid under this legislation. The vital principle is whether this committee, in considering for the first time social legislation of this character, which is designed to have uniform application throughout Australia, should, by refusing to adopt the amendment, encourage supplementary provisions on similar lines in the States. If there be agreement upon the principle that widows&#39; pensions shall be payable throughout the Commonwealth, there must also be agreement upon the hypothesis that the amounts payable are such as should properly be made out of public funds. The cold fact is, that this matter cannot be divorced from the uniform income tax proposals introduced by the Government. These moneys will come from the one source and, at least during the period of the war, from the one governmental source; because the Commonwealth, if its legislation be passed by this Parliament, will be the sole taxing authority. If the amount be a proper one, there can be no justification for any State being able to pay in respect of the same obligation an additional sum, which will vary and have a different incidence in the respective States. If it be not proper, either the committee or the Government should increase it. The matter is governed by simple propositions. The first is, whether this legislation is intended to operate throughout the Commonwealth on the basis of payment to a widow in respect of her needs, in accordance with the maximum sum which this committee considers should be payable out of public funds. If that be answered in the affirmative - apparently it must be - it is idle to contend that any State should then contribute an additional sum in respect of the same obligation. I understand that it is the Government&#39;s desire to seek to have this field of social legislation taken over by the Commonwealth. True, it cannot be taken over immediately ; but, as the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hollo way)</inline> has said, the Commonwealth desired to enter this field and ultimately to take control of it. That is an objective which I particularly welcome; but 1 cannot see how it may be attained if, concurrently, encouragement be given to supplementary legislation by different States, particularly as one State or another would, in effect, contribute to what would be payable in New South Wales. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spooner)</inline> has said that he is opposed to supplementary State provisions involving two parallel forms of legislation dealing with the one subject. Although I agree with that, his approach to the matter is different from mine. Refusal to adopt the amendment would encourage such supplementary provisions, and place on them the imprimatur of the committee. </para>

            <para>- For the first time, the Commonwealth is entering a field of social legislation, apparently, with the intention that the States shall concurrently engage in. supplementary legislation in respect of that particular matter. It is amazing that this committee should be considering widows&#39; pensions at a time when a State legislature also is considering them. My simple approach to the matter is that, if the amount provided in the bill is not what should properly be paid to a widow out of public funds, it should be increased. If, in the view of the Government, it is sufficient, there is no justification for supplementary legislation by any State. </para>

          <para>. - I support the amendment, because J regard it as particularly bad to draw distinctions between Australians of any class. It would be utterly wrong to give preferential treatment to a woman who happened to be a widow in New South Wales, compared with a widow in Western Australia, South Australia, or any other State. For many years, the system of unification for Australia has been a part of the platform of the Government party. If effect were given to it, there would be only one parliament - a national parliament. That a national parliament would fix differential rates of widows&#39; pensions in various parts of the Commonwealth is inconceivable. Every effort should be made to have this pension rate uniform throughout the Commonwealth. If the rate be too low, let it be raised and let the Commonwealth pay it, but do not have a mixed rate, whereby widows in one State would receive more than widows in other States. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> and the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spooner),</inline> have said that, to try to dictate to any State what it should do in regard to social legislation would be intolerable. Such qualms did not exist when bills were brought down to implement a uniform income tax throughout the Commonwealth; because I understand that, if a State levies an income tax, it will not benefit by the compensatory payments to be made by the Commonwealth. In effect, the amendment merely asks for what the Government proposes in relation to State income tax. I can see no reason why the States should not be coerced to the utmost strength of the Commonwealth. For goodness&#39; sake, let the people realize that this is the National Parliament, and that it intends to do national work! Do not kow-tow to the States, and whine and cry for fear that they will be upset. It is extraordinary that any government with a unification plank in its platform should shilly-shally, and not undertake widows&#39; pensions solely as a Commonwealth matter, blasting the States out of that field. If the rates are too low, let the Minister raise them; but do not have a bastard rate operating in some portions of Australia compared with other portions. </para>

            <para>- The States have certain rights, of which they cannot be deprived by honorable members of this Parliament without offering insult to the people in those States. This matter is not concerned with unification. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act provides for certain considerations. This bill has been brought in to provide for certain other considerations in respect of widows and orphan children. An invalid or old-age pensioner may have an income of 12s. 6d. a week without his pension being varied. I cannot see why a similar principle should not apply in this case. What does it matter to this Parliament whence the income is derived? It is no concern of the Commonwealth if the source be a State widows&#39; scheme. </para>

            <para>- That is an absurd remark. If any State government were to continue a widows&#39; pension scheme, it would materially assist Commonwealth finances, because any amount received in excess of 12s. 6d. a week would be deducted from the pension payable under this scheme. The coal-miners of Queensland have a pension scheme, to which they make contributions and from which payments are made to the widows of former contributors. Is the Commonwealth to divest those persons of their rights? The Commonwealth Constitution does not permit the Government to filch the rights of the States without the consent of the people. Those who talk about unification should study literature on the subject in order to learn what it means. If the committee carried the amendment it would be acting unfairly to both the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. - I see nothing in the amendment inconsistent with the general attitude of the Commonwealth Government towards the States in recent times. If the view of the Government prevails, widows in New South Wales who have no other source of income whatever, and who simply have the widows&#39; qualification upon which to base their claims, will receive a maximum of 37s. 6d. a week. In Victoria, where a modified State pensions scheme is in operation, widows will receive from 31s. to 37s. 6d. a week. In the other States, the payment will be 25s. a week. That, of course, abrogates all federal sentiment, and prevents similar treatment for all Commonwealth citizens without regard to the artificial State boundaries. But there is also a mechanical difficulty that the Treasury will be called upon to face in connexion with this matter. It, is proposed under the bill that a certain rate of pension shall be paid to a widow with one child. The bill does not provide for the payment of so much for the widow and so much for the child, but it stipulates that there shall be a pension of 30s. a week for the widow and child. How is that provision to be correlated to the New South Wales or Victorian systems under which the provisions for the widow and children are separate and distinct? The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has told us that, in pursuance of the uniform taxation proposals of the Commonwealth, provision has been made for compensation to those States in which social benefits, including the widows&#39; pension in New South Wales, are being conferred. The Minister intimated that &#163;1,600,000 was proposed to be taken from the New South Wales compensation payment in consideration of the Commonwealth Treasury assuming the obligations provided for under this bill. He said that the amount had been arrived at by calculating the pension at the rate of 20s. a week for the widow, which was the rate prevailing in New South Wales until the last few days. I am not sure that that rate does not still prevail in that State. But, if what has been said in this chamber in the last hour or so comes true, the Commonwealth will not pay 25s. to widows in New South Wales, as would seem to be the case under this bill, nor will it pay 20s. a week as is predicated under the Commonwealth&#39;s uniform taxation proposals. The maximum payment under this legislation to widows resident in New South Wales will he 12s. 6d. a week, and even that sum will be reduced if, as happens in many cases, the widows have income from extraneous sources. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I draw attention to clause 33, which specifically states that no claim for a pension for a widow who is already in receipt of an invalid or old-age pension, will be considered. What justification is there for discriminating between the widows who are now receiving invalid pensions in all States and those who are receiving widows&#39; pensions in New South Wales and Victoria only? Under the Government&#39;s proposal, a widow in New South Wales is to receive the widow&#39;s pension provided under the State scheme, and is also to have the Commonwealth pension superimposed upon it, with, of course, certain income qualifications. I should like the Minister to attempt to justify that, discrimination. I agree with other speakers that perpetuation of such discrimination is not justified. If 37s. 6d. a week is considered the correct provision for a widow in New South Wales, which contains two-fifths of the population of Australia, let this Parliament be honest and make that the rate for widows throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- No; those children are excluded. The act excludes from the definition of &#34; child &#34;, a child maintained in an institution, but it does not exclude a child who is boarded out to his own parent or to a foster parent. It was said that as a result of the Commonwealth child endowment legislation the Government of Victoria would cease its child welfare payments. The Minister in charge of that measure stated at the time that that Government did not desire the State governments to act in that way. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member is not so much concerned about the amount to be paid to widows as he is about the whole field of social service being reserved to the Commonwealth. According to my reading of the debates in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, that State is not likely to continue the payment of widows&#39; pensions under the State scheme once that field is occupied by the Commonwealth. That State could do much better for itself than directly compete with the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth could not prevent it. It could pay pensions under certain conditions. It could pay widows&#39; pensions at an earlier age than that at which they are to be paid under the Commonwealth scheme. If the Commonwealth provided that the pension was to be paid to the childless widow at the age of 50 years, the State could provide that a pension should be paid to the childless widow at the age of 40 years. The State now makes its scheme supplementary to the Commonwealth scheme of invalid and old-age pensions. The New South Wales act provides that, as soon as a widow becomes qualified for an old-age or individual pension, she loses her right to the widows&#39; pension. What is there to prevent the State from vacating the field now occupied by the Commonwealth and deciding that it will grant the pension to a widow on reaching the age of not 50 years, but 40 years? What was stated as the desideratum by the Opposition was that the States should be driven out of the field of social services altogether, and that, if that were not done, it would reconsider its attitude towards uniform taxation. I think that the honorable  member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> said that without qualification. Then, subsequently, in reply to honorable members on their own side, objection was taken by members of the Opposition to widows receiving an extra payment. I do not believe that the widows in New South &#34;Wales will receive 37s. 6d. a week. I cannot conceive of a State overlapping Commonwealth legislation in that way. The States may make their scheme supplementary to that of the Commonwealth. From my study of the New South Wales act, it appears to me that a widow applies for and obtains a pensions certificate. While she holds that certificate, she draws a pension. If she has children under the school-leaving age, in addition to drawing 25s. a week for herself, she gets 10s. a week for each child under the school-leaving age. </para>

            <para>- No, the age may go up to fifteen years in some cases. A widow has not two separate rights under the act. She has not one right to draw a widow&#39;s pension and another separate right to draw an allowance for her children. She gets the allowance for her children because she holds a widow&#39;s pension certificate. If the bill were amended to provide that the Commonwealth pension shall not be paid to a woman who is in receipt of a widow&#39;s pension in New South Wales that would deprive the widow with one child, or with children under the school-leaving age, of the benefit of the payment of 10s. a week. T do not think that that is the intention of any honorable member. I suggest that we are over-anxious to drive the State out of this field altogether. The amendment submitted to the committee is merely provocative. If the scheme provided for in the bill is agreed to, the States will not have enough money to carry out double-banking schemes. If the New South Wales politicians are as astute as I believe them to be, and if they want to grant pensions to widows, I think that they will decide to grant them where the Commonwealth scheme makes no provision for them at all. The tenor of the debates in the New South Wales Parliament, on both sides of the House, seemed to be that New South Wales was getting in before the Commonwealth Government made its declaration, without any intention to compete with the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>.- A vital principle is involved in the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly).</inline> We should not coerce the States, or, as the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> suggested, blast them out of this field; but this Parliament is entitled to legislate as it thinks fit. The honorable member for Lilley is seeking to introduce an entirely new principle into Commonwealth legislation. I remind the committee that invalid and old-age pensions were paid by some of the States before federation and for some years afterwards. Then, in 1908, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and from that year until 1942 no government has sought to amend the Commonwealth act by inserting a provision that no invalid or aged person is entitled to a Commonwealth pension if he or she is in receipt of one from a State. Child endowment has been paid in some States for years past; yet, in 1941, when the Commonwealth Child Endowment Act was passed, no attempt was made to insert in it a provision similar to that which the honorable member for Lilley is now seeking to insert in the Widows&#39; Pensions Bill. There seems to be a fear lest the States may, in special circumstances, provide additional benefits for widows. If they do, they will, having regard to the uniform tax proposals now before this Parliament, have to answer to their own electors for their action. I hope that the amendment will not be carried, and that the </para>

          <para>.- Evidently the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> fears that New South Wales may continue to pay widows&#39; pensions even after this bill becomes law, so that a widow may be drawing a pension from both the State and the Commonwealth. I should say that that is far from the intention of the Government of New South Wales. I am glad that what has been described as the &#34; means &#34; test in the New South Wales Act has been omitted from this bill. In the New South Wales legislation the income of children living in a home wa3 regarded, up to 50 per cent., as the income of the mother, and in the case of children living away from home the amount was fixed at 25 per cent, and the assessment of a widow&#39;s pension was arrived at on this basis whether or not the children paid. I have always objected to the principle that children should be made to contribute towards the pension of their parents. Great credit is due to the Government of New </para>

        <para class="block">South Wales for having introduced a widows&#39; pension scheme, and credit is due in particular to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> who was Premier of New South Wales when the measure was brought in. As a matter of fact, the measure was better when it was first passed than it is now, because it has been mutilated by various governments. New South Wales has led the other States in such social legislation as workmen&#39;s compensation, widows&#39; pensions and child endowment, and has suffered because of its advanced social legislation. Its markets have been flooded by goods manufactured in States where wages are lower and social conditions not so good. I compliment the Government upon having introduced this measure which is long overdue. I was for many years associated with the coal-mining industry, and on more than one occasion it was my unpleasant duty to break the news to women when their husbands had been killed. Widows often had a hard struggle to rear their families. Sometimes their health broke down, and they had to go into hospital. From now on women similarly placed will have the benefit of a pension, and will be able to keep their homes together, and bring up their children in reasonable comfort. Widows&#39; pensions have been paid in New South Wales for some years, and it is very desirable that a similar scheme should be in force in all the other States. This is an example of humanitarian legislation, and I ask the Government not to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Lilley. </para>

Although some of those who have opposed it have tried very hard to convince themselves that they are right, I do not believe that they have succeeded in doing so. On other occasions we have heard a good deal from honorable members opposite regarding the desirability of the Commonwealth taking over all social services, of doing away with overlapping as between Commonwealth and State activities, and the desirability of operating on an Australian basis, instead of on a State basis. Nevertheless, some of those honorable members are to-night advocating that the States should be free to enter into competition with, one another in supplementing Commonwealth social legislation. </para>

          <para>- I have heard the  honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> say that something should be done to amend the Constitution to make Commonwealth authority all powerful. I believe that widows in all States should be entitled to the same benefits, just as are the aged and invalid, and the recipients of child endowment. I see no reason for differentiation in the case of widows. We must not forget that it is proposed very shortly to make the Commonwealth the sole taxing authority as regards income tax - the Commonwealth to make a grant to the States by way of compensation. Are we to understand that the Commonwealth is to pay such an amount to the States as may enable some of them to supplement the social benefits provided by the Commonwealth? If so, the Commonwealth, and. not the States, would be providing the additional benefits. There is only one common sense basis for social legislation of this kind, and that is to provide that widows shall be treated alike, irrespective of the State in which they live. For that reason I strongly support the amendment of the honorable member for Lilley. </para>

          <para>. - In the framing of legislation one of the first considerations is to make clear beyond doubt the intention of the legislature, but it appears, from ministerial statements upon the issue before the committee, that it is intended to leave this point indefinite. The Government wants to have it both ways. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Government thinks that it will be extremely popular in New South Wales, because it will be able to say that, notwithstanding the fact that it instituted a system of widows&#39; pensions for the whole of the Commonwealth, it has not done anything to prevent the continuance of the system of widows&#39; pensions operating in that &#39;State. The attitude of the Commonwealth in this matter is that it is the authority that should grant pensions. If the States like to duplicate tho Commonwealth&#39;s efforts that  i3  their own affair, but they have no standing. It was a very different matter when the very unpopular question of the control of liquor came up for consideration at the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. The Government then said : &#34; Oh, no ! We leave that matter entirely to the &#39;States. It is no concern of ours. We shall not interfere.&#34; We had the spectacle of the Government whip, the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan),</inline> visiting Adelaide on the subject of horse racing. I wish the honorable gentleman had seen what the <inline font-style="italic">Stock and Station Journal</inline> had to say about him. But on the subject of horse racing the Government&#39;s attitude was, &#34; That is likely to be unpopular. We won&#39;t interfere. We won&#39;t bring in any federal regulation or law on such matters.&#34; But on the pensions question its attitude is entirely different. In a federation, particularly, one of the aims is division of legislative and administrative responsibility, but we endeavour to dispense with the overlapping to which the honorable member for Gippsland referred. On numerous occasions complaints have been made in this chamber that we have failed to dispense with such overlapping; yet the Government deliberately, with its eyes open, is perpetuating the system. </para>

            <para>- Under this bill she would become entitled to a widow&#39;s pension whether she is naturalized or not at the end of five years. In other legislation, now before Parliament, the Government says specifically that the State taxation officials, who will be taken over by the Commonwealth, shall not be entitled to both State and Commonwealth superannuation benefits but shall continue to make contributions to a State superannuation fund. To be consistent the Government must say that they shall be entitled to participate in the State superannuation scheme, if they like, and shall also be entitled to participate in the Commonwealth scheme. </para>

            <para>- That is the point. If it be just that the State of New South Wales shall have the right to supplement widows&#39; pensions payable under this legislation what will the Ministry do about the widows of soldiers? The Minister will have only one answer, namely, that the Government does not intend to allow soldiers&#39; widows to draw an additional pension under this measure. It is, therefore, the bound en duty of the committee to make clear to the taxpayers and to the States the intention of the Commonwealth legislature. One of the important points of the Australian Constitution is that when services and responsibilities are taken over by the Commonwealth, State services and responsibilities cease. When this Parliament passes a law in regard to banking, insurance, divorce or any other matter listed in the schedule of powers contained in section 51 of the Constitution, the corresponding .State law ceases to operate. Parliament must lay it down that a widow&#39;s pension is to be paid only to certain widows with certain qualifications and exempt from disqualification. The amendment provides that a pension shall be payable to any widow who is not paid a pension under the act of a State. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I say to the Minister and his supporters that it is not the intention of the Commonwealth to allow widows to draw a pension from the Commonwealth as well as from a State. So, what is wrong with expressing the intention in this bill ? The Government&#39;s refusal to accept the amendment leaves it open to suspicion. When we are asking for so many things these days, it ill-becomes any government, even in a measure of this description, to try to obtain full credit throughout Australia for having introduced a scheme of widows&#39; pensions and special credit in New South Wales. A cry which dominates every federal election campaign in that State is : &#34; At any rate, whatever we did as a Commonwealth we did not interfere with what the tiger did in New South Wales.&#34; </para>

          <para>.- The Opposition is fighting shadows. There is no indication that New South Wales will persevere with its scheme of widows&#39; pensions. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> fears that, unless the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> be inserted in the bill, there will be competition amongst the States in providing social service. What are the facts? Widows&#39; pensions were introduced in New South Wales in 1925. The only other Australian State with any semblance of a widows&#39; pension scheme is Victoria, which operates a scheme on a very limited scale. There has been no competition amongst the other States to bring their social legislation up to the standard of New South Wales. </para>

            <para>- The honorable gentleman is still beating the air, because New South Wales is the only State which has what could be termed a full-fledged scheme of widows&#39; pensions. Who has ever heard an honorable gentleman opposite advocate, in the interests of uniformity, that the other States should fall into line with New South Wales and institute widows&#39; pensions? Under this bill a widow may earn up to 12s. 6d. a week without impairing her right to a widow&#39;s pension, but honorable members opposite object to the thought of her receiving that 12s. 6d. from a State government. To be consistent, honorable members  opposite  must, irrespective of the possible  sources  of income, object to a widow receiving anything but a pension. I remind the committee that immediately the Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation for the payment of child endowment, New South Wales, the only State then paying child endowment, vacated the field. </para>

            <para>- How does the honorable member explain why the Commonwealth basic wage varies as between the States ? I cannot be accused of splitting hairs. If we had unification, every piece of social legislation would have to contain a provision similar to that contained in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act for adjustments to be made in accordance with the rise or fall of the cost of living in the different States. But we have not unification, and under the present conditions I do not see how I can logically support the amendment. </para>

          <para>- I have laid the basis for a very logical argument against the amendment. I point out. again that we have made provision in our industrial legislation for varying factors within the various States. The Commonwealth has accepted the principle of variations within the States, and therefore, when fixing the basic wage it takes into consideration factors within the States, and either increases or decreases the industrial rate accordingly. The ideal is an equitable widow&#39;s pension throughout the Commonwealth, but that ideal has not yet been reached. </para>

            <para>- That legislation was on the statute-book before I entered Parliament. Like the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> who, no doubt, has frequently been confronted with a <inline font-style="italic">fait accompli,</inline> I accepted the inevitable. Honorable members who are aiming at uniformity throughout the Commonwealth can achieve that objective by means other than those suggested by the honorable member for Lilley. If a rate of pension is decided upon without taking into consideration the factors which I have mentioned, some persons in the community will be placed at a disadvantage compared with others. I cannot support the amendment, but I ask the Minister to give consideration to the suggestions that I have made. The sooner we realize that unification is inevitable and take steps to meet such, a situation, the better it will be for tile Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. -  I cannot but wonder what has happened during the last  24  hours to cause honorable members who until yesterday were fa.vora.ble to this measure to try to defeat it to-day. For the last twenty years, the States have tried to lay the basis for a scheme of widows&#39; pensions on a Commonwealth  basis because they were agreed that it was a matter for the National Parliament. They hoped that, by refraining from introducing such legislation themselves, some Commonwealth government would be induced to do so. The BrucePage Government went so far as to appoint a commission which travelled all over Australia and examined witnesses in every State, involving the country in great expense. Some present members of this Parliament gave evidence before that body, but no scheme of widows&#39; pensions emerged. At last, New South Wales refused to wait any longer; it decided to introduce legislation providing for pensions to widows in that State, although legislators in the State parliament believed that it was a matter for the Commonwealth. Later, for similar reasons, New South Wales introduced its own scheme of child endowment. When a scheme providing for child endowment was introduced into this Parliament it was suggested that a coercive clause, under which the Commonwealth would be authorized to dictate to the States, should be inserted. With the enactment of Commonwealth legislation providing for child endowment, New South Wales gave up its own scheme. That the same result can confidently be expected in connexion with this legislation honorable members opposite are well aware. Why have some of the most astute politicians on the other side of the chamber seized upon this particular piece of legislation to cause dissension between the Commonwealth and the States? If ever there was a time when political unity and harmony was desirable in the Commonwealth, it is to-day. </para>

I urge the committee to reject the amendment, because it is both illogical and inopportune. It cannot do any good, and it may do a lot of harm. No State government would be bound by it, but some people who would benefit from this scheme would be placed in a false position. The carrying of the amendment would certainly lead to discord in the community, and therefore the Government cannot consider accepting the amendment, which is wrong from every point of view. </para>

The honorable member for Barker, in whose electorate there are many aliens, should know that aliens are not entitled to a widow&#39;s pension. I ask the honorable member for Lilley to withdraw his amendment, because it cannot achieve the purpose which he has in mind. The Commonwealth Government will continue with its policy of providing economic and social security by means of legislation, and whilst it hopes that the States will continue to co-operate with it to that end, it will not attempt to coerce them. </para>

          <para>.- Whatever may be the result of this debate, it will at least serve one good purpose, in that it will make clear to the people of Australia that the Commonwealth is moving towards uniform social conditions throughout the whole of its territory. Uniform taxation proposals presuppose uniform social conditions. The  committee which was appointed to consider whether the Commonwealth should be the sole taxing authority in the field of income tax for the duration of the war stated in its report - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>If, during the war, the Commonwealth should decide to provide uniformly for the whole of Australia a social service provided at present by some or all of the States such, e.g., as widows&#39; pensions, .the Commonwealth should use the machinery set out earlier in the report to effect a reasonable reduction from the income tax compensation paid to those States relieved from the cost of providing such a service.  &#91; agree that that paragraph supports what the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said earlier this evening,, but I draw attention to another paragraph of the report in which the committee said that, in order to preserve flexibility, the following formula should be adopted: - </para>
          <list type="upperalpha-dotted">
            <item label="I.">
              <para>A State may submit a claim to the Commonwealth that its financial circumstances arc such as to warrant an increase in the amount of compensation for any financial year subsequent to 1042-43. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That recommendation means that, ultimately, the Commonwealth must accept the financial responsibilities of the States. Why is it that the Commonwealth Government, in opposition to the desires of the State governments, intends to introduce uniform taxation proposals? The reason is, not that the proposal is popular, but that financial necessity compels the Commonwealth to do so. It is being done to assure an equitable distribution of the burden of taxation throughout Australia. If taxes are to be spread equitably over the whole community, the members of the community should share equitably in the distribution of benefits .paid .for out of taxation. Those who make equal contributions to revenue .should share equally in social services. The clause as it stands will enable a widow in New South Wales to receive &#163;97 1.0s.  a  year, whereas in any other State a widow will not be able to draw more than &#163;65 a year. There is no equity in that. I agree with the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> that the time has come for us to adopt a true national outlook in these matters. I was amused at the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> who said unblushingly that he was a supporter of unification. I remind him that, under unification, widows would receive the same rate of pension whether they lived in Darwin or Hobart. </para>

          <para>.- I draw special attention to a point that has received too little emphasis in this debate; in fact, only one honorable gentleman has referred, to it. I am afraid that the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> has not grasped fully the fact that under this bill &#163;1 5s. a week is not regarded as- an adequate widow&#39;s pension. Taking the various clauses in conjunction, it is clear that the measure contemplates &#163;1 17s. 6d. a week as the minimum income on which a widow can live, and towards- that amount the Commonwealth is prepared to contribute &#163;1 5s. a week. A widow may have an income of 12s. 6d. a week from other sources, but that will not be taken into account in computing the rate of pension payable to her. She may derive her 12s. 6d. a week from rents, contributions from relatives or friends, or in the form of board and lodging which she may receive to that value. The same principle applies to the New South Wales widows&#39; pensions scheme. If a widow in New South Wales has an income from rents of 12s. 6d. a week, and is entitled to receive the State widows&#39; pension, this bill will permit her to receive, in the aggregate, an income of &#163;1 17s. 6d. a week. A widow in Western Australia receiving 12s. 6d. a week from rents is also entitled to a total of &#163;1 17s. 6d. a week. It does not matter to the Commonwealth where the widow in New South Wales obtains her non-pension income. </para>

          <para>.- Provision is made in this clause for the payment of a pension at the rate of &#163;65 per annum to a widow who  is  not maintaining a child under 16 years of age, and is not less than 50 years of age, and of &#163;78 per annum to a widow who is maintaining one or more children. The extra &#163;13 per annum is calculated at the rate of 5s. a week, and in that respect the provision is in accord with the provision for each child after the first child made in the Child Endowment Act. The amount of 5s. a week is, in my opinion, too small. Under child welfare schemes in operation in various States a larger amount is provided for the first child. In Victoria, for example, 10s. a week is provided for the first child. If this clause is passed without amendment a widow with one child will receive a pension of 25s. a week for herself and 5s. a week for her child. She will also be permitted to earn 12s. fid. a week. Therefore she will have &#163;2 2s. 6d. a week on which to maintain herself and her child. Children are an expensive item these days, particularly if they are sickly. The cost of children&#39;s clothing and footwear is extraordinarily high. 1 know that from my experience with my own family. The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> told me a day or. two ago that his wife had recently visited a city store in order to buy a pair of pyjamas for a lad four years old. The only pair offered to her was marked 24s. 6d. She went to other stores to try to purchase a less costly pair but could not obtain a pair at any price. I mention this to indicate the cost of children&#39;s clothing. I suggest that a larger sum should be provided for the first child with, perhaps, a diminishing amount for succeeding children, until a static sum is reached. It is highly desirable in these days that everything possible should be done to assist the mothers of families. Whilst the mother of a family of several children, or a mother with a child beyond tender years, might be able to go out and earn 12s. 6d. a week, I do not think that any honorable member would desire that the mother of an infant should be obliged to go out to work. We should be doing everything in our power to encourage  family life, and to  assist  mothers  to rear their children under reasonable conditions. We must make the preservation of child life our greatest care. Provision is made in widows&#39; pensions schemes in Germany, France and Italy for a larger payment in respect of the first child of the family. A diminished amount is provided for the second child and the rate is varied for successive children until the static figure is reached. That principle is also followed in widows&#39; pensions schemes in other countries. It may be argued that the Government desires to achieve uniformity in payments for children, but I can see no reason why we should slavishly follow uniformity in this case. There are reasons why widows with children should be given even more sympathetic consideration, perhaps, than old-age pensioners. Widows have a heavy responsibility in the rearing of their children and in discharging it they are performing an invaluable service to the State. Ministers who are receiving more than &#163;2,000 a year as well as other valuable privileges including travelling expenses at the rate of &#163;2 12s. 6d. a day, and private members of the Parliament, who receive an allowance of &#163;1,000 a year, are far removed from the struggles and adversities of the average person in the community, and they should not deal with claims of widows in a niggardly way. It may be said that money is not available to make higher payments than those provided in the bill, but I remind honorable members that the Government is able to provide about &#163;1,000,000 a day for war expenditure. The full cost of this pension scheme is estimated at &#163;1,600,000 per annum. If, say, &#163;200,000 per annum be added to the cost in order to provide more liberal payments for the first child of a widow, the money would be wisely expended. It certainly would not be wasted. I do not think any one will deny that quite a substantial sum of money is being wasted in defence expenditure these days. Money is also being wasted in expenditure on munitions. Perhaps some waste in these matters is unavoidable. My point is tha t we could well make an additional sum available to assist widows to bring up their children with profit to the nation. If we can finance the war in so liberal a way, we should also be able to finance social services. We should not hesitate to provide money for social services, because of any fear of th( future. We hope that we shall pass from this war into a new social order and a new financial system. Consequently the yardsticks of the past will not be the yardsticks of the future. I impress upon the Minister for Social Services the importance of making adequate provision for the maintenance of children. </para>

        <para class="block">The clause would then provide that in the case of a claim for pension being approved the first payment would be made as from the first pay day after the date of the claim. I am aware that the clause, as it stands, is in accordance with a similar provision in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, but that provision has not proved to be satisfactory. We all have known of instances of serious delay in the granting of pensions. Sometimes some delay is inevitable, but when the delay is due to no fault of the claimant, the claimant should not have to suffer. If it should take six or eight weeks to reach a favorable decision on a claim, for a pension, the claimant should receive her first payment from a date not later than the first pay day after the application was lodged. That appears to me to be a reasonable provision. I appreciate the difficulties in granting pensions from dates which would involve broken pay periods. My amendment would avoid any such trouble but would ensure that pensioners would not have to suffer for delays for which they were not responsible. I appreciate the difficulty of setting up a department of this sort. I realize that  the administration of this act, in addition to the Child Endowment Act and the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, will add enormously to the work of the department, and that many delays may be occasioned by reason of understanding on account of war conditions. I should not blame the department for such delays; but an applicant for a pension should not suffer in consequence. </para>

          <para>.- This clause sets out the conditions upon which payment of the pension shall cease, but does not provide that a woman under 50 years of age who has been receiving a pension because she has been maintaining a child under the age of sixteen years, shall lose it. There does not appear to be any clause which makes such express provision. I suggest to the Minister that the pension should not be devested from the widow in such circumstances, and that something be done on the lines of section 38 of the New South Wales Widows&#39; Pensions Act 1928-1941, which provides that the right to, or the amount of, a pension shall not be affected during any period covered by a pension certificate, by reason merely of the fact that a child of the pensioner has, within that period, attained the school-leaving age, or by reason merely of the death of a child of the pensioner. Under the New South Wales scheme, the widow applies for a pension certificate. She may qualify for it because she is over 50 years of age and childless, or because, although she is under 50 years of age, she has a child. If, after she has obtained the pension certificate, the child should die, or pass the school-leaving age, she does not, by reason of that fact, lose the pension. </para>

            <para>- Clause 4 provides that that is a condition of obtaining a pension. The clause that I am now discussing, which contains the conditions upon which the pension right shall be lost, does not provide that it shall be lost by reason of the fact that the child has died or has reached the age of sixteen years. I suggest that this matter be favorably reconsidered, and that provision be made on the lines of the New South Wales section for the continuance of the pension, or that the Minister adopt the suggestion made this afternoon by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> and myself, that the widows&#39; pension shall not be interrupted merely because her child has reached the age of sixteen years or has died. That seems to be what the bill contemplates, although it does not expressly make that provision. If a child in respect of whom a widow is receiving a pension should die or reach the age of sixteen years, the pension is to cease. That is not how the New South Wales act appears to deal with the matter. I should like further consideration to be given to it. </para>

A widow with one child, of whatever age she may be, is to become entitled to a widow&#39;s pension. She may be only 20, 21, or 22 years of age at the death of her child. The general impression is, that she should fit into a profession or an industry. If not able to do so, she could obtain help from some other source. Surely it is not suggested that all widows, whatever may be the state of their health or mentality, need a widow&#39;s pension ! </para>

            <para>- If unable to work through invalidity, they become entitled to the invalid pension. The Government&#39;s view is, that a widow with a child is handicapped, and that when the child reaches the age of sixteen years its dependence on the mother ceases and it is able to engage in industry or a profession. The position of the widow then is not the same as it was previously. The Government considers that a healthy widow, 50 years of age, without encumbrance, may not be in need. Any one can visualize a first and only child dying when the mother is at an early age. There are thousands of such cases. There is a gap, I admit, which may be bridged when the act is made more nearly perfect. The honorable member for Bourke realizes that absolute perfection is not possible, and that what appear to be anomalies are always revealed. These two groups of widows are being fairly dealt with for a start. The adoption of the proposal of the honorable member would open the gate to much more than they have mentioned. The matter has been closely studied by the Government. Widows are of all ages. Provision is made in respect of group 0, because of the possibility of a young married woman losing her husband before the birth of the first child. The Government is able to visualize the difficulty in which such a widow would be placed. It is not suggested that she would never return to industry but, on the contrary, it is hoped .that she will return to the profession, trade or craft in which she was engaged before marriage. The belief is held that she should be nursed for a period of six months after the bereavement so as to enable her to think properly. </para>

That does not f ollow. &#34; Unable to work &#34; does not necessarily mean physically unable; she might be unable to obtain employment. A woman who has given up remunerative work in order to marry and become a wife and mother, is not so easily employable as a widow. There would probably be no prospect for such a woman other than some badly paid form of daily household employment. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has suggested what would probably be the best course - that in the case of a woman of a fixed age, or, for that matter, any widow, the Commissioner should have the discretionary power to continue the pension indefinitely or for such time as he .thought would meet the circumstances. It would be very hard for a woman- passing through the very trying period of the middle forties to find that her pension had suddenly been stopped by reason of the fact that a child in respect of whom she had been receiving it had died. </para>

          <para>. - This clause gives to the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner very wide powers. At any time he may cancel, suspend or reduce any pension if he considers it expedient to do so. The clause provides that any decision by a Deputy Commissioner shall be subject to an appeal to the Commissioner, but apparently there is no appeal to the Minister. A strong Commissioner would tell the Minister that he had no right to interfere in such a matter, if an attempt were made to exert undue political influence. Provisions making the Railways Commissioner immune from ministerial direction were included in the various railway acts of the States in order to protect the commissioners against the exercise of political influence. I do not know why this clause has been inserted. The provisions of clause 36 seem to be sufficiently wide. It provides that where the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that it is expedient that payment of any instalments of pension or allowance payable to a widow should be made to some other person for the benefit of the pensioner, payment may be authorized accordingly. </para>

          <para>. - This clause is taken in substance from the New South Wales act, and I offer two criticisms of it. It is not so generous as the provision contained in the New South Wales measure as recently amended. The clause as it stands, and as the New South Wales act stood before the recent amendment, provides that a widow not maintaining a child and less than 50 years of age, but still, in the opinion of the department, in necessitous circumstances, may, at the discretion of the department, get a pension for a period of not longer than 26 weeks immediately after the death of her husband. The New South Wales Parliament has inserted in the State act a provision that where, at the end of 26 weeks, it still appears to the  Deputy  Commissioner that the widow is in necessitous circumstances, he may grant the payment of the pension for a further period of 26 weeks, but not more than twelve months in all. I submit that proposal for the favorable consideration of the Minister. My second criticism is that the benefit of this clause is not extended to the widow who loses her pension by reason of the fact that her child has died or has reached the age of sixteen years. I suggest that the benefit of this clause be extended to widows in that class, and that if they cannot have their pension continued, it should be within the power of the Commissioner to grant to them the temporary allowance provided for in this clause. That would necessitate a redrafting of the clause. </para>

          <para>. - I  agree with the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn).</inline> The clause might well be widened to give to the Commissioner greater power with regard to the period for which discretionary payments might be made. I also suggest that such payments be made to widows who, having been left childless, have formed alliances, perhaps of only of a temporary character, with the result that children have been born of the union. Such women might be deserted by the fathers of their illegitimate children, but they would have no claim to payment in respect of those children. The mothers may be left in necessitous circumstances, but, under the hill as it stands, they would not be regarded as entitled to a pension. In such cases, a discretion should be given to the Commissioner to make payments from time to time to such women until they could obtain employment, particularly during the first few years after the birth of the illegitimate children. If the Minister is not prepared to consider an amendment along those lines at this stage, I hope that he will do so later. </para>

        <para class="block">Zealand, or any other country, with regard to invalid and old-age pensions but it is unfortunate that people coming to Australia from New Zealand have to live here for twenty years before they become entitled to the old-age pension. I presume that widows from New Zealand will have to reside in this country for five years before they will be entitled to the benefit of this bill. .1 believe that, although New Zealand is close to Australia, no reciprocal arrangements have been m,ade with that country with regard to pension payments, and that even New Zealand 2s. pieces are not legal tender in the Commonwealth. Although Australia&#39;s High Commissioner in London negotiates reciprocal arrangements regarding many matters with Great Britain, it seems anomalous that very few such agreements have been entered into between the Commonwealth and the sister dominion of New Zealand. An approach should be made to the Government of New Zealand, at any rate, in an endeavour to reach a reciprocal agreement in regard to invalid, old-age and widows&#39; pensions and child endowment. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot allow this clause to pass without making a further appeal to the Minister to remove an injustice. This clause provides that the pension of a widow shall cease when she  enters a mental hospital, and this applies, not only to the pension of 25s. payable to the pensioner herself, but also to whatever allowance she may receive in respect of her children. A widow who enters a general hospital will continue drawing her pension, and the same applies to one who enters an institution such as an eventide home. Therefore, I cannot understand why this discrimination should be practised against the widow unfortunate enough to enter a mental hospital. I know that it is argued that the maintenance of mental hospitals is a matter for the States, but until recently the same was said of widows&#39; pensions. It is also claimed that people, as a rule, stay in general hospitals for only a short while, whereas they usually stay in a mental hospital for a long time. However, they also stay in eventide homes for a long time, generally for the remainder of their life. Again, it is claimed that it would be impracticable for a mentally afflicted person to receive the pension. That is true, but in clause 36 it is provided that, in certain circumstances, the pension may be paid, not to the pensioner herself, but to some person approved by the Commissioner. The same could be done in the case of an inmate of a mental hospital. </para>

I am not permitted under the  standing orders to move an amendment, but I suggest to the Minister that he remove this anomaly. I know that if the suggestion were accepted, there would be reactions in other spheres, but that would not deter me. As a matter of fact, there is every reason why justice should be done in those other cases also. </para>

          <para>. - The penalty provided in this clause is inordinately severe. It is easier to prove an offence under Commonwealth legislation than it is under the New South Wales act. For instance, this clause provides that any person who makes a false or misleading statement in support of a claim, either for himself or for any other person, shall be guilty of an offence. In order to obtain a conviction under the New South Wales act it must be proved, not only that the statement was false, but that it was wilfully made. That means that the accused person must have known :it the time he made the statement that it was false. I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Draftsman, having the New South Wales act before him, omitted that provision. The clause also provides that proceedings may be commenced at any time within three years after the commission of the offence, whereas the New South Wales act provides that proceedings may be taken at any time within six months of the facts coming to the notice of the Registrar. That means that all the Commonwealth has to do is produce the document and say, &#34; We say that this is false ; it is for you to prove that it is true, and, if you do not prove to the satisfaction of the magistrate that it is true, you shall be guilty of an offence and shall be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment, or fined up to &#163;50 and also have to repay whatever amount the magistrate says you owe to the Commonwealth &#34;. The burden of proof is not cast upon the accused by the act of New South Wales. </para>

The corresponding section of the widows&#39; pension legislation of New South Wales provides that before the making of a false statement is rendered punishable the act must have been wilful. Under this legislation, however, all the Crown has to do is to aver that a false statement has been made. The onus of disproof is thrown on the defendant. That is contrary to all the principles of British justice. Unfortunately, however, the tendency in Commonwealth legislation seems to be to throw the onus of proof on the defendant. That is a tendency which ought not to be countenanced especially &#39;where widows are concerned. It would be quite conceivable that a distracted widow could unwittingly make a false statement and thereby render herself liable to all the penalties of this provision. </para>

          <para>.- I have received some rather disquieting information about the state of affairs in South Australia, which I am impelled to place before the House, particularly since in some respects the difficulties increased over the week-end. Matters will be serious unless the Government acts. The explanations of certain matters given by Ministers last week are not regarded as satisfactory or adequate. I shall not say very much about the clothing regulations, because their immediate effects have been brought thoroughly to the notice of honorable members, but there are serious complaints about the way in which the regulations operate, particularly as regards munitions workers. For instance, the State  president  of the Australian Railways Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> F. Page, points out that munitions workers and other people working overtime in South Australia are unable <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> buy essential clothing and boots. There are, however, more serious indirect effects from these regulations. Correspondents inform me that there is a considerable flight of currency and that people are patronizing shops whose trading hours remain unchanged, such as jewellers, in order to have something tangible rather than &#91;bank-notes. There are whispers that the Government intends to ration food, and the people are beginning to acquire stocks. So far as the flight of currency and securities is concerned the Lord Mayor of Adelaide has contradicted the statement that the  people are not disposing of war savings certificates in order to .buy clothing and other articles. Another development, which I do not think has been mentioned in this House, is that the large departmental stores hold the main stocks of certain essential articles such as toilet goods of various kinds. Those stores are closed for most of the time, or they will not sell. The small holders, such as chemists&#39; shops, have been depleted of stocks, and there is a demand that the large holders be permitted to dispose of their stocks in order to meet the need. The trouble in Adelaide is extending to country districts. For instance, Port Augusta complains of a clothing shortage. Another difficulty is the position of small businesses - the sellers of firewood, boot repairers and egg and milk suppliers. It is alleged - and I know of a number of instances - that these businesses cannot obtain supplies. Some of them, such as wood merchants, are beginning to close in disgust, and the public is being deprived of essential services. &#91;Newspapers which arrived here to-day confirm what I have been told by letter and telegram. The position is very serious so far as wood, milk and, possibly, egg suppliers are concerned. The feeling in South Australia is summed up by a statement of the secretary of the Dairymen&#39;s Association that if it were a case of the coal-miners the Government -would hurry to try to settle the problem. The third cause of the trouble is that Adelaide may be facing at least a partial meat famine. It is alleged that price fixing has already wrecked the businesses of many large wholesalers of meat. Master butchers in Adelaide have no reserves on which to draw, and recently they met to decide whether they themselves would not have to ration meat by 25 per cent. For some unexplained reason, South Australia and Western Australia are the only two States in which the price of meat has been fixed. On the 13th May, the price of lamb in the Adelaide market was lOd. per lb., but the butchers had to sell it at the fixed price of 8d. per lib. There are now hints that the price-fixing authorities in South Australia are contemplating fixing the price of live-stock; yet stock people in New South Wales say that if that happens there will be greater chaos than ever.  I  understood before  I  left Adelaide that part of the trouble was due to lack of transport, as the federal authorities were refusing to permit the back-loading of North Australian cattle from Alice Springs to the south. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>A further complaint is in regard to the anxiety which has been created by the Government&#39;s action in freezing capital. Although the position has now been remedied, the effects of the action taken are still serious. There have been long, unexplained, and seemingly unexplainable, delays in issuing detailed information about the Government&#39;s decision to reduce interest to 4 per cent. Legitimate and absolutely necessary business on the Adelaide Stock Exchange remains stagnant. How can any one buy or sell 5 per cent., 6 per cent, or fi per cent, preference shares when the Government takes so long to decide what interest those different types of shares ought to carry, and how they are to be compared with ordinary shares  as  regards dividend payments ? Most of the 16,000 or 17,000 people who own shares of different kinds in the Adelaide Electric Supply Company Limited, for instance, are small investors.  What  is  their  position, and what is their view of the delays which have taken place?  I  know of an instance in which the trustees of a deceased estate are unable to realize their assets; they cannot sell securities owing to the long delay which has taken place.  I  also know of instances in which perfectly solvent people cannot pay their taxes owing to the delay of the Government in coming to a decision. The chaos which has been caused is largely due to the fact that the Government will not look before it leaps.  I  raise these questions because they are of considerable importance, and are causing great indignation and commercial disorder in South Australia.  I  assure the Government that the people of South Australia regard these federal muddles as a most discordant overture to the comedy of errors which, under the name of uniform taxation, the Commonwealth Government proposes to force upon the people of Australia next week. </para>

        <para>One man who has been employed in the canteen service for the past twelve months claimed that non-commissioned officers in charge of canteens price their goods to suit themselves. &#34; Only thing which concerns them is figures,&#34; he claims. &#34;The more profit they show, the more chance they have of being promoted. Camp canteens have developed into a gigantic system of chain stores with readymade customers. &#34; Profits of the canteens are supposed to be returned to the troops in comforts, but mostly the men have left camp long before anything in the way of comforts is supplied. &#34; Comforts consist of such things as butter and fruit dishes for mess tables, things which the Army ought to supply anyway. &#34; No explanation can be obtained as to how accrued profits are being distributed.&#34; </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Smith&#39;s</inline>took these complaints along to Brisbane office of the Canteen Service and submitted them to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> manager and secretary, for comment. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall</inline>refused to say anything on the matter at all and stated that if <inline font-style="italic">Smith&#39;s</inline> said anything about the Canteen Service without the official sanction of the Canteen Board we would find ourselves in serious trouble. </para>
        <para class="block">The proprietors of <inline font-style="italic">Smith&#39;s Weekly</inline> then proceeded to relate the steps which they took to get to the bottom of the matter. It is clear that the prices charged for goods in military canteens are in excess of the rates charged for similar goods in city stores. I submit that the prices charged should certainly not be more than those charged in city stores, seeing that the canteens have a monopoly. Only reasonable charges should be levied. Should excessive profits be made, the money will probably eventually go into the coffers of the Government, as happened at the conclusion of the war in 1914-18, with the result that certain people were decorated with the Order of the British Empire, or honoured in other ways. I ask the Minister to inquire into these complaints as his reply to my question shows clearly that he does not know the facts. I urge that each canteen service should be required to supply a properly auditedbalance-sheet from time to time. </para>
        <para>Last week, the Minister for the Army announced that members of the Australian Military Forces would be allowed to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force. In doing so, he made it clear that such action would be voluntary on the part of individual soldiers, and that no pressure would be applied to cause men to make the transfer. In spite of that announcement, information has been supplied to me which indicates that certain officers in charge of units of the Australian Military Forces are using coercive and intimidatory methods to prevail on men to join the Australian Imperial Force as complete units. One case which has come to my notice is connected with the Army Service Supply Column with head-quarters at Willoughby. I am informed that a certain officer parades members of the unit before him when he asks them whether they are willing to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force as a complete unit. He then orders those who express their willingness to do so to stand on one side and those who are not willing to make the change to stand on the other side and their names are noted. The position is put to them in such away that those whoare in the minority are expected to abide by the decision of the majority. Should the motion for transfer be carriedby a majority. the whole unit isexpected to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force. Thispractice in addition to being undemocratic, is entirely  contrary to the announcement of the Minister that the decision to transfer would be left to men individually. </para>

            <para>- At this &#34;stage, I do not think it desirable to name the officer concerned, but I do ask that the complaint be investigated. In my opinion, it is not fair to name any one until after an impartial inquiry has been held. I have named the unit, and the officer can easily be identified. I am confident that an inquiry will disclose that the position is as I have stated. Moreover, the way in which the vote is taken is not democratic, because various sections of the unit are spread throughout the district and members do not know how their fellowmembers have voted. The officer concerned has told the men that they must not discuss this matter among themselves, it being regarded as of a political nature. Recently, when a debate took place in this House as to whether the Defence Act should be amended to enable members of the Militia to be sent overseas, this officer caused members of the unit to be asked to say whether they were prepared to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force and they were asked to sign a questionnaire. In that way, he tried to prejudice public opinion in this country. Such behaviour calls for action on the part of the Minister. I have advocated that members of the Australian Military Forces should be given the right to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force if they so desire, but I have always held that such a decision should be voluntary, as indeed the people of this country have decided shall be the case. </para>

            <para>. - The decision of the Government on the 12th May last to prohibit the advertising of controlled goods has had a serious effect on the country press, and may well prove disastrous to some sections of the press. At the best of times, a country newspaper is beset by many difficulties, whilst, particularly in war-time, costs rise considerably, and circulation falls owing to the transfer of population to the cities. In many country towns, businesses of various kinds are closing down. For in stance, &#39; many persons engaged in the motor trade have gone, or are going, out of business, new car advertising having practically ceased, with the result that advertising by those businesses has fallen off considerably. Petrol advertisements have also been withdrawn. Advertising of sports gatherings and entertainments generally have greatly diminished as owing to war causes many such entertainments can no longer be held. In addition to all of these difficulties the country press is now faced with the direction of the Government that goods subject to the sales restriction order, including all kinds of clothing and footwear, are not to be advertised. This means that very little advertising may be done. The country press is an important factor in rural life, and is necessary for the people who live beyond the metropolitan areas in order that they may exchange information of all descriptions. Moreover, the country press takes a large part in assuring the success of various war efforts and is eager to do everything in its power to promote the success of appeals for war loans, patriotic funds and the like. The Government itself uses the country press for propaganda purposes. In these circumstances, it is surely not too much to ask that some degree of advertising should be permitted even in respect of rationed goods. I can see no reason why any restriction should have been placed on the advertising of even rationed goods for, after all, storekeepers will only be able to sell the quantity of goods they are allowed, and the curtailment of advertising cannot affect the position greatly. Eventually, sales will be governed by coupons. I do not think it too much to ask that advertising should be permitted even though sales be restricted. Unless there is a lifting of the restrictions in relation to advertising, many country newspaper proprietors will find it extremely difficult to continue publishing their journals. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish now to bring to the notice of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lawson)</inline> the difficulties being experienced by country storekeepers in the delivery of goods. Instructions have been issued that meat and bread may be delivered on certain days but that groceries may be  delivered only once a week. That procedure may be satisfactory in the metropolitan area, but it is entirely unsatisfactory in country districts where the local storekeeper is often not only the grocer but also the butcher and the baker. Country deliveries by the general storekeeper very often include bread and meat, aud even pollard and bran, and clothing and drapery as well as groceries. It is most unfair, therefore, to oblige country storekeepers to restrict their deliveries in the manner required &#39;by the Government. If they are f orced to do so, they will have to stop delivery. In these days of petrol rationing farmers who live in outlying areas cannot visit their accustomed shopping centres as frequently as formerly. This makes it all the more necessary that facilities shall be provided for a more general delivery of goods than formerly by country storekeepers, yet the Government has restricted these activities. Not only do the country storekeepers deliver goods to farmers but also they often pick up cans of cream from the roadside and deliver them to the butter factories or railway stations. If the general delivery of goods be restricted, it will become more difficult than ever for farmers to get their cream to the f actories. I urge a more generous outlook in these matters. </para>

            <para>. - I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> whether he will do his best to convene an early meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee which has been appointed to deal with Government policy in respect of exemptions for military service? I have in mind, particularly, the case of men who were obliged to take the oath when they were attested and who now find that magistrates will not deal with their applications for exemption because they have taken the oath. Many such oases have been brought to my notice. A few magistrates have dealt with applications for exemption but most magistrates have  held that once a man has been attested he is removed from the jurisdiction of the. court. It is urgent that a decision a.= to policy should be reached by the Government on this important matter. I have been informed, unofficially, by certain Crown law authorities that magistrates have power to deal with these cases, but no authoritative opinion has been expressed publicly on the subject. I am aware that fifteen cases have been dealt with recently at North Melbourne, and two adjournments have been granted ; but that is an isolated instance. What  we  require is an immediate statement of Government policy on the question so that the men concerned will know their fate. </para>

          <para>I support the protest of the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> against military officers asking for mass decisions of units of the Australian Military Forces on the question of enlistment in the Australian Imperial Force. If it be true, as stated by the honorable member, that the names of men who have refused to volunteer in the Australian Imperial Force have been taken, it is most improper and amounts to a form of duress. In fact, it savours of the press-gang method of another age. I understand that it is the policy of the Government to place no difficulty in the way of members of the Australian Military Forces volunteering for the Australian Imperial Force, but that is a very different thing from subjecting the men to ballots, plebiscites, and the like in order to obtain mass decisions by units on the subject. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> promised me this afternoon, in reply to a question, that the attitude of the Government towards Myer Emporium Limited would be reviewed. I am advised that that firm recently allowed members of the staff to purchase goods at marked-down prices under conditions which did not apply to the general public. In purporting to comply with an order to return &#163;250,000 to the public which had been improperly taken from it, the management, on one day in particular, charged members of the staff only 2s. for every &#163;1 worth of goods bought. These conditions were not available to the general public. Consequently, the slick <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Myer</inline> converted the order of the Prices Commissioner into something in the nature of a staff bonus at the expense of the genera&#93; public. He is a most fruitful gentleman in adopting ways and means of ingratiating himself with his staff, but surely he cannot be allowed to divest himself of his ill-gotten gains in this way. My view is that the firm should be obliged to pay  &#163;250,000  into the Commonwealth Treasury. The same principles should apply to this big firm, and to other big firms for that matter, as those which apply to small shopkeepers. I can see no reason why the Government should treat Myer Emporium Limited magnanimously. The flimsy pretexts which the firm has offered in excuse for fleecing the public, such  a3  the multiplicity of small transactions and the like, are ridiculous. Public opinion everywhere has been outraged at the manner in which this firm has been able to avoid the consequences of its actions. The report of the Joint Committee on Profits showed clearly that many small firms had been fined amounts ranging from  &#163;10  to  &#163;50  for breaches of the prices regulations, yet this big firm has been able to escape any penalty. If the Government wishes to reestablish itself in the esteem of the people, it should prosecute this firm without delay. Beyond question, the firm should be obliged to return the  &#163;250,000  which it has illegally taken from the general community in Melbourne. </para>

              <para>- I am not aware that the honorable member for Dalley tried to protect any firm that had robbed the people of Sydney. A firm guilty of taking from the public  &#163;40,000, &#163;10,000  or  &#163;5,000  more than it was entitled to receive, should be treated as are small shopkeepers who rob the people of  &#163;5.  My complaint is in respect of differential treatment being accorded to big business. I refuse to believe that the people of Australia would condone preferential treatment in the matter of the infringement of price-fixing regulations by Myer Emporium Limited or breaches of the censorship regulations by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch. </para>

          <para>The honorable member said that the Lord Mayor of Adelaide had told him something in regard to the cashing of war savings certificates. All that I have to say is that there has always been a number of war savings certificates cashed. I replied to a question on the subject in this House recently. The opinions that I then gave were those of the Commonwealth Bank Board, which is as competent as the Lord Mayor of Adelaide to express views concerning the cashing of war savings certificates. That gentleman may have an axe to grind, and may have thought that some good would be served if he were to whisper in the ear of the honorable member. I have obtained my information, not from some person on a street corner or a lord mayor, but from the Commonwealth Bank Board, which has exact knowledge of such matters. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> has asserted that undue influence is being used in order to obtain transfer from the Australian Military Forces to the Australian Imperial Force.

          <para>I now inform the honorable member that the statement that personnel who have been serving at Darwin were to be granted leave of one month&#39;s duration is the result of a press announcement which emanated from unofficial sources.

Instances have occurred of personnel evacuated from islands adjacent to Australia being granted one month&#39;s leave on return to Australia. This was done on the recommendation of the medical authorities in order to assist such members to regain their health in a domestic environment, in cases where the member&#39;s medical condition permitted such a course to be taken. </para>
