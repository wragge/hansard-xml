The Australian Broadcasting Commission is a Commonwealth instrumentality, and has not been captured by any special interests in Australia. I am not able to answer the second part of the question, because I. have no knowledge of the circumstances; but I shall have the matter explained to me, and shall then let the honorable gentleman know whether or not I consider that the statement of the commission is puerile. </para>

                        <para>- The suggestion appears fair and reasonable. I do not, however, consider that the broadcasting service entrusted to the Australian Broadcasting Commission ought to be used in order to excite or continue a public controversy. The commission is a Commonwealth instrumentality. Those who have views to express should bo given what is regarded as a fair opportunity to state them temperately and fairly. I could understand the commission adopting the stand that, a case having been put once, before it was put again by the same interests an opportunity should be afforded to any one competent to speak for opposing interests, should they exist, to use this Commonwealth instrumentality for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- It is the desire of the Government that imported sulphur used in the manufacture of sulphuric acid shall be displaced as quickly as possible by the use of the available resources of sulphide minerals in Western Australia. The Mines Department of Western Australia, in association with the Controller of Minerals Production, is doing all that it can to accelerate this substitution. In particular, two possible sources of supply are being investigated, namely, the Iron King mine at Norseman, and the Great Victoria mine at Burbidge. </para>

The effect of the protocol is to give full force and effect to the original agreement as on and from the 1st September, 1937, and to extend the provisions of the agreement for a period of two years from the 3.1st August, 1942. The .International Sugar Agreement was of great value to world sugar producers before the war, and, although its operation during the war has been, and will continue to be, rather nominal, the maintenance of the agreement and the adherence thereto of as many contracting governments as possible, will probably ensure that Australia shall retain its basic export quota after the war. </para>

                        <para>- The whole subject of meat control is now under consideration by the Government, and a committee will be appointed this week to take control of the industry generally. As to vested interests taking advantage of the present glut of lamb, the producers can well protect themselves by sending their lambs to be frozen. The price for spring lambs has already been published, and summer lambs are to be dealt with on a similar bases. That will give protection to the producers. Formerly they glutted the market with sucker lambs, but now they will be able to hold them, and get the advantage of the increased weight. The Government is alive to the position, and will do all it possibly can to protect the interests of the primary producers. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Treasurer state whether many workers in heavy industries have not yet received their income tax assessments in respect of income earned during the year 1940-41, although as much a.s from £20 to £50 has been deducted from their pay? I understand that, deductions from their wages are already being made again in respect of tax on income derived in 1941-42. Will the Minister take up with his department the matter of establishing a taxation branch in Newcastle, owing to the congestion of work in the Sydney office, in order to obviate the present difficulty and have the assessments distributed as soon as possible? </para>

I shall make an investigation regarding the honorable member's suggestion that special facilities be provided at Newcastle. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that certain canteen facilities are provided in Great Britain. In Australia, the welfare section of the Department of Labour and National Service has given much thought to the subject of the provision of such facilities for workers, and at present it is concentrating its activities in that regard on government establishments mci annexes. It is also endeavouring to encourage private employers to provide canteens for their employees. One of the difficulties is  the lack of supplies, but the welfare section is pressing on with the work, and hopes later to be in a position to provide these facilities for all workers. </para>

                        <para>- It is difficult to say which is the more important, though at the moment it might, perhaps, be =aid that the need to conserve rubber is somewhat the more urgent. That, however, is contingent upon circumstances, and the position might alter at any time. It would probably be safer to say that the need for economy is urgent in respect of both rubber and petrol. The Government is watching the position wry closely in regard to synthetic rubber, and has a representative in the Hinted States of America at the present time studying developments. Naturally, processes for the manufacture of synthetic rubber are a close secret, but we have taken steps to procure all the information available, and only yesterday I received an important cablegram dealing with the subject. </para>

                            <para>.- The last pre-war budget presented to this Parliament provided for an estimated expenditure of £95,000,000, which sum included what was then a.  record  peace-time provision for defence. Since that time the expenditure on defence has naturally grown each year, owing to the outbreak of war. In the first year of the war, Australia's war expenditure amounted to £55,000,000; it increased to £170,000,000 in the second year, and to £320.000,000 in  the  the id  year  f hostilities. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has told us that his estimate of war expenditure for this year is £440,000,000, the total expenditure of the nation for the year being estimated at £549,000,000. Those are big figures for a country with a small population. Should war expenditure continue to increase in the same ratio, it may be that next year slightly over 7,000,000 people will have to face an expenditure of £700,000,000. Rut even that amount may not be final. The  President  of the United States of America, who probably is in a position to hazard a more accurate guess than any body else at the moment, has expressed the belief that, the war will last for another three and a half years. If that be the case, much heavier demands will be made on our national income than the considerable sum that has been forecast for this financial year. By any standard, the sum of £549,000,000 is a colossal amount for 7,000,000 people. It represents £78 a head of the population. If we were to pay for the war as we went along, every man, woman and child in the Commonwealth would have to contribute 30s. a week. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>How are we to raise this vast sum? The Treasurer indicated that he proposed to use three methods, namely, taxation, loans, and bank credit. Taxation and departmental receipts, he tells us, will bring in £249,000,000, leaving a difference of £300,000,000 to be financed by loans and bank credit. From loans last year, the Government raised £120,000,000. But 1 remind honorable members that last year, the Commonwealth had a new government exhorting the people to subscribe to war loans. Japan had entered the war, and for the first time Australia was threatened directly with the very real menace of invasion. All those elements were conducive to success in raising war loans. With the  assistance  of those factors, the Government was able to raise £120,000,000. In other directions, however, its loan programme fell down. The sale of war savings certificates reached £12,500, 0O0 in the previous year, and the Government expected to stretch that sum to £25,000,000. <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> succeeded in raising only £9,000,000. </para>
                    <para>Bearing those facts in mind, and with the knowledge of the cumulative effect of Commonwealth taxation on companies and subscribers with comparatively large private incomes, I am justified in saying that the Treasurer will have great difficulty in raising more than £150,000,000 this year on the loan market. Even if he gets that amount, there will still remain a gap of £150,000,000 to be spanned by bank credit. With honorable members opposite and even some Ministers, bank credit is a very popular solution of the problem. Not so very long ago, the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> was openly critical of the policy of the Government of which he is a member, regarding the payment of interest on war loans. He said that if he were given his way he would not pay interest on war loans. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite suggest that the money should be raised without paying interest upon it. The method which they suggest involves the issue of bank credit, or the raising of compulsory loans which do not bear interest. During this debate the Opposition has pointed out at great length, the dangers of such an extensive use of bank credit. Honorable members on this side of the  chamber have endeavoured to hammer home this point at every opportunity, but the disposition has grown on the part of honorable members- opposite to dismiss the danger with an airy wave of the hand as an inflation bogy. Last week-end, the Attorney-Genera] <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> lent his. support to those who say that the Opposition is raising the inflation bogy. Honorable members opposite appear to have forgotten that it was not the Opposition, but the Treasurer himself, who laid great emphasis upon the inflation bogy. As their memories are so short, I shall remind them of the Treasurer's words. </para>

When a country is seeking to expand its civil production and has resources of men and materials lying idle bank credit possesses obvious merits. As civil production is increased, the capacity of the general community to consume the goods must a'so be enlarged. But instead of producing civil goods, we are now forced to divert men and materials to the war effort. A substantial increase of bank credits at a time when civil production is being reduced will obviously lead to inflation. What will happen? The diminishing supply of goods will be accompanied by an increasing supply of money; and the competition among those who have the money for the diminishing volume of goods will force up prices. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Proof of this tendency is provided in the notice given by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to-day of his intention to introduce legislation to stamp out black markets. The black market is the misbegotten child of inflation. The Government, in its approach bo the problem of the diminishing supply of civil goods with respect to taxation particularly, takes an unreal view of the volume of purchasing power available at present. First, it is astray in thinking in terms of the individual, instead of the family. I shall give a specific example to illustrate my point in this respect. Honorable members generally know of many similar cases. Let us compare the pre-war income of the family of a typical artisan breadwinner, say, an electrical engineer, with its present income. Before the war he was probably receiving the basic wage, plus a margin for skill of approximately 30s. a week.  His  income was about &gt;£6 a week, or £312 a year. Let us suppose that, that man, as is the case in so many instances, has a son approaching manhood, two young daughters, and, perhaps, another son of about sixteen or seventeen years of age. To-day, the father as a skilled tradesman is probably earning from £12 to £14, allowing for overtime; the eldest son is earning from £6 to £S a week, say, as a trainee fitter; each of the two girls is earning about £3 a week, or more, in a textile or war production factory; and the younger boy, if he is of any use at all, is earning upwards of £3 a week. Thus the family's income can now be conservatively estimated at £27 a week, or £1,404 a year, compared with £312 a year before the war. Of that amount of £1,404, on the details I have mentioned, a sum of only £125 is paid in taxes, leaving the family a net income of £1,279 compared with its pre-war net income of £312. That is not a fanciful illustration ; it is a typical case, as every honorable member must admit. It is evidence of the vast volume of purchasing power represented by an accumulation of comparatively small incomes which are lightly taxed. Such incomes are creating a tremendous consumer demand at a time when the necessities of war are compelling us to reduce our volume of civil production. This state of affairs is general. Last week in Melbourne, for instance, a refrigerator which cost £75 when new brought £137 10s. at an auction sale. All of us have knowledge of similar incidents which prove that when the volume of spending power is increased, and, at the same time, production of civil goods is decreased, prices rise rapidly. Numerous evils spring from this development. What are these evils? Who are the sufferers from inflation? There is invariably a sharp rise of prices. The person with a fixed income is the first to suffer. The thrifty man who has put his money into savings in the form of insurance, &amp;c, finds that, in a time of rising prices, he is paid in a devalued currency. People who owe money are in a happier condition. They are able to pay off their debts much more easily. The patriotic and thrifty, public-spirited citizen who invests as much of his savings as possible in -war loans for the duration of the war is a sufferer. As the result of the depreciation of the currency, the income he receives is of much less value, as the war progresses, than that which he, in a spirit of patriotism, has invested in war loans. Most important of all, however, from the point of view of the Government, and of the nation generally, is the effect of inflation upon the wage-earner. The average wage earner is not on a. fixed income, inasmuch as cost-of-living adjustments of his wage are m,ade automatically every quarter. Nevertheless, there is always a lag between the time when the increases of prices occur and the time when the adjustment is made. Thus, the wage-earner directly suffers from a. policy of inflation. If one adds to all these cases of individual hardship the general hardship resulting from financial dislocation and general eco- nomic chaos caused by inflation, one realizes the real menace of the policy upon which the Government has embarked. What is the remedy for this evil ? The remedy is a sane financial policy instead of an irresponsible policy dictated by political expediency. That sane financial policy must, be applied to our methods of raising money for war expenditure. Obviously, if we must restrict production for the reasons I have mentioned, then we must also restrict consumption. This can be done by various methods. One method is rationing. The Government has adopted that method ; but rationing by itself will not bc effective. If the supply of civil goods be rationed, aud, at the same time, the volume of purchasing power be increased, that reserve of private money must be drawn upon through taxes of the lower ranges of incomes and through compulsory loans. In order to soften the harshness of such methods, because they oblige the people to make radical adjustments of their lives, we can institute a system of post-war credits. I do not think that honorable members opposite would ask the committee to increase the rates of tax in the higher ranges of income. These classes of incomes are already the most savagely taxed in any part of the Empire. The lower ranges of income represent 70 per cent, of the national income, and the bulk of the vast volume of purchasing power which is now creating financial havoc. So far, that pool remains practically untapped. As I pointed out earlier, when giving a typical example, only £125 of a family income of £1,404 may, under such circumstances, bc taken by way of taxes. In time of peace that could perhaps bc justified on the score of social justice, but it is a fatal economic policy in time of war. A single man earning £200 a year in Australia is taxed £7 18s. In Great Britain he would pay £32 10s., of which £10 16s. would be a post-war credit or a nest-egg. </para>

In Canada a man who earned 5,000 dollars last year paid 1,000 dollars of income tax. On a similar earning this year, he will pay 1,878 dollars,, and of the extra 878 dollars 500 dollars will be a post-war credit.

                    <para>If. we are to have a proper financial approach by the Government to the matter of wm finance, allied with a sane policy on what might be termed the negative side, that is the reduction of spending power, there must also, be revision of the Government's policy in respect of profits and taxation of company earnings generally. No more fallacious humbug has been talked, in this Parliament than onthe subject of profits. We have reached the stage at which success in business is regarded as a moral offence and the making of profits as a crime against <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> nation. The reason is entirely to be found in the attitude of honorable members opposite, to whose minds the making of reasonable profits is a sin and should be prevented. A short examination of the  facts  reveals how dangerously stupid such an attitude is. T do not say that profits should not be taxed, but they certainly should not. be taxed to the point of eliminating the incentive to private industries and individuals for greater effort. That creates a basic weakness in the production programme, because manufacturers will not take risks, exercise their ingenuity, or expand their operations, unless they consider that the prospective return justifies their doing so. </para>

                            <para>- It is not that they are mercenary. The manufacturer who works his machinery for longer shifts and takes risks and extends his plant in order to increase the production of munitions is no more mercenary than his employee who works overtime for the same purpose and receives extra wages as the result. I remind t ,he committee that other countries which have grappled with this problem have done so much more realistically than this Government has.. In Great Britain, for instance, the rate of profit permissible before the wartime profits tax operates on a new and struggling business is lifted to S per cent. Germany, whose control over public finance is more flexible and effective than that- of any other country engaged in this war-, at first took in taxation all profits in excess of 6 per cent. The German authorities found that the weakness of that policy was that, it discriminated against companies whose risks were greater and depreciation of assets more rapid than was the case with other companies, and, accordingly, they introduced a sliding scale of taxation. The present taxation of companies in Australia is not only discriminatory in that it makes no provision for added risk or added depreciation, but it is also grossly unfair to the individuals who derive their income from company dividends. That contention was borne out to the satisfaction of most honorable members when they examined the proposal to take all profits in excess of 4 per cent, on capital, it is most significant that, of the 200 or 300 letters which I received on that proposal, two-thirds came from women, most of whom were in receipt of small incomes. New Zealand is a country comparable with Australia, and it has a Labour government. Its system provides for income tax rebates to be made to shareholders in respect of payments of company tax. </para>

                    <para>One of the most serious weaknesses of this Administration is disclosed in its handling of the problem of waste. I use the term " waste " in all its senses, because, if we are to shoulder the enormous burden of £549,000.000 of expenditure his year, with the likelihood of the amount rising to £700,000,000 or more next year, quite obviously we must reduce to a minimum waste of men and mate rials. I remember the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin)</inline> telling honorable members a few years ago that, as Leader of the Opposition, he did not intend to examine microscopically the Estimates, because he realized that all the pruning he could suggest would not have the same effect in reducing expenditure as would result from a shortening of the war by even three months. That is one way of approaching this matter, but it is not a very satisfactory one. lt is looking at it only from the point of view of waste in the sense that we as a Government spend more for particular articles than there articles are really worth. That is waste in one sense but really the least important sense, normally speaking, in time of war. The really serious waste is the misuse, or foolish use, of man-power and materials. [ shall give three short illustrations of what I have in mind. No doubt each honorable member will have his own list, to which he could add just as I could add at great length to these three. I drew the attention of the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to one instance, which has a significance in view of the statements we have already heard to-day from honorable members of their difficulties owing to the man-power shortage. I told the Minister of 30 men in the Army who have been assigned, apparently as a permanent task, to washing the floors of the rooms and corridors at Wesley College, Melbourne^ which has been taken over for administrative purposes by the Army. </para>
                    <para class="block">This fact was brought to my notice by one of them, who was previously a primary producer on his own property, and in that capacity no doubt rendered very useful national service. He was classed as B2 physically, and therefore was not sent into the Army for combat purposes, but was one of those 30 men .stationed at the college to do cleaning work. I know the locality in question. If, in the past, more than five or six female cleaners were put to the task, I should be very much surprised. It is work which female cleaners were doing formerly in very much fewer numbers than the Army establishment apparently requires, and it is work which they could do to this day. </para>
                    <para>Again, to move to another sphere which will be of interest to the Minister assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> there goes on every day and every week in this country the wasteful expenditure of money, and the wasteful use of men, under the system of working regular twelve-hour shifts in munitions factories. I know that the Government is aware that this is a. wasteful use of man-power, and that it has attempted by way of negotiation to break down the twelvehour shifts to nine or ten hours. It was conclusively proved in the last war, and has been forcibly argued by expert medical opinion already in this one, that more production is obtained from men working regularly nine, or at the most ten, hours a day than from the same men attempting to work twelve hours. But the great weakness of the position now is that the employees have become accustomed to the wages they get for the extra hours of overtime, and, although it is doing their health no good, and they are not reaching the output that they should, they are resisting any move to reduce their hours to ten, or nine or less. A third continuing example of wastefulness in public expenditure, which the country cannot afford to carry in addition to the other tremendous burdens which the war is throwing on it, should also be made, known. This is my third illustration, on which I venture with some diffidence, because expert opinions are involved, but I shall have the temerity to express my views on it, because to me it is the height of stupidity. It relates to our tank production programme. Honorable mem- hers are aware that some considerable time ago the Government decided to manufacture tanks in Australia. Their manufacture is throwing, and will continue to throw, an enormous strain upon us, on top of the tremendous munitions programme we already have, in providing skilled personnel and valuable materials required for other munitions production. It adds another heavy burden to the many that the country is carrying, and for what purpose? If our policy is defensive, then we know that we have to resist a seaborne invasion. The number df heavy ranks, or tanks of any greater strength than, say, our 'ordinary Bren gun carrier, that could be brought to this country by a sea-borne force, is obviously limited. At the same time we are allied with countries, members of the united nations, which are turning out tanks in vast numbers. The tank production of America is growing by leaps and bounds every month, but with this knowledge in the mind of the Government and its expert advisers, they are still persisting in what. I insist is a most wasteful and useless additional burden upon our munitions programme. </para>

                            <para>- We may need tanks, a» we need many things, but our capacity to produce them is no greater than our capacity to receive tanks which are produced very much more easily and in much greater numbers from allied countries. I do not mean that we should simply rest on. our oars and leave it to other countries to do these things for us. The point I am. leading up to is that there are much more effective ways in which we can assist than by embarking on a form of production which is novel to us, and which will strain to the last degree our capacity to expand our munitions production generally. I have no doubt that the policy of continuing the production of tanks in Australia is supported by expert opinion, but I remind the House that a very sage old Frenchman, M.  Clemenceau,  said that war wa3 much too serious a. business to leave to the generals. Our experience in this war has confirmed that statement. The Prime Minister told us recently, when honorable members from all sections of the House were pressing him to permit greater numbers of nien to be engaged in munitions and food production, who would necessarily, in that event, have to be withdrawn from the Army, that his expert advisers had suggested a figure for our Army strength, and our Army was not yet as strong numerically as he would like it, or, for that matter, as they would like it. Was there ever a general who was satisfied that his army was big enough ? If the decision were left to the army chiefs, quite obviously and very naturally they v/ould see the problem through their own eyes, and in the light of their own immediate difficulties. There must be some authority able to survey the whole scope of our war-time problem, and not merely the individual problems of the Army, Navy, Air Force, munitions production, food production, or civilian needs in other directions. All of those elements must be surveyed, not by some person who is particularly interested in only one of ih em, but by a government which is prepared to see the task as a whole, and accept, responsibility for it as a whole. I think there will be general agreement on that point. It is not pleasant for honorable members to challenge policies which are dished up to them as having emanated from expert advisers, but there are aspects of our policy to-day which, if they do represent the views of expert advisers, prove that we need another set of experts. It is not many years since we were told by very much the same brand- of experts that all Ave required to defend Australia against the risk of attack by a sea-borne force was a force of 100,000 trained men. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> as a member of a former Government, will probably have that figure in. his mind, as no doubt other honorable members will also. Thai was only a few years ago. The. figure has been increased time and again. We have not forgotten that they were practically the same advisers who were responsible for the <inline font-style="italic">debacle,</inline> in Greece and the muddle in Malaya. Therefore, if we have any misgivings and serious doubts about some of these problems, there is an obligation upon us to express our views forcibly in relation to them. Speaking personally, </para>

                    <para>lt could be made strong enough at two-thirds or less of its present numerical strength. We can keep our Army strong by strengthening the civilian support behind it, and by civilian support I mean not only normal aspects of civilian life, but also the munitions front, and the food front. -Civilian morale is an important element in bolstering up the fighting qualities of an army. But what is happening to-day? We are draining from factory production and from every other aspect of community life, the energetic, able and vigorous men who comprise some of the potent elements in our war effort. What is the role of this country? That is a question that we must ask ourselves. Are we to take a leading role in terms of munitions, aircraft, and food production, and also in respect of the fighting services, or have we special opportunities, and as the result of these opportunities, special obligations in the common war effort of the United Nations? In my opinion we have a definite role. Whilst there is an obligation upon us to maintain a strong, well-equipped and mobile army in this country - I emphasize each of those three adjectives - we also have allies in this theatre of war. who as their numbers- grow, and as the Pacific offensive develops as we all hope that it will develop in good time, will need increased supplies of munitions and prepared foodstuffs. We have heard a great deal about the coming Pacific offensive, and about the shortage of shipping, which it is claimed is one of the most serious of the problems that are hampering us to-day, and preventing us from putting forward the most effective war effort of which the United Nations are capable. If that be so, is it not the task of this country to provide munitions and food for allied forces operating in adjacent Pacific territories rather than to allow those supplies to be brought by a long sea route from Canada and America? The policy that this Government is pursuing in regard to the expansion of our armed forces is so out of keeping with the common sense view of the matter, that it gives rise to the most serious misgivings. Last week I pointed out that other countries which are engaged in the war to no less a degree and in -no less a vital manner, than we are, have been able to organize their manpower in such a way as to make possible the withdrawal of large numbers of men from the front line to assist in the production of munitions and the harvesting of crops. Russia has been able to withdraw men from its fighting services to harvest crops in various districts, and Germany also took advantage of the lull in the Russian campaign last winter to transport. -thousands of men back to Germany to swell munitions production. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension</inline><inline font-style="italic">of time granted.']</inline> I fail to see any satisfactory reason why similar action could not be taken in this country. </para>

                    <para>What I have said may be summed up in this way. If this Government is to escape the charge of wilful ignorance and crass irresponsibility, it must reduce civil spending power to the same degree that it has reduced the production of goods for civilian use; if it is to escape the charge of squandering our meagre resources of men and materials, it must wage an offensive war on waste, in all its forms.

                            <para>.- This is the second record war-time budget that has been introduced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(.Mr.</inline> Chifley), and when we take into consideration the fact, that the expenditure which it envisages is five and a half times greater than that of our largest peace-time budget, wc get some idea of the tremendous proportions to which the problem of financing the war has developed. 1 commend the Treasurer for the manner in which he has bandied the formidable task which was imposed upon him and upon the Treasury officials who assisted him. I realize that there arc still some orthodox features in this budget, but it must be remembered that the Treasurer always has to depend upon the Government for  a  lead, and the Government has to depend upon the people for its .mandate. The Government still lacks n majority in the Senate. I <inline font-style="italic">am</inline> satisfied that the people have now been thoroughly educated on the subject of finance and that, if the Government takes up the challenge that has been issued by the Opposition, it will have a sweeping victory. The Opposition has, as usual, trotted out the usual bogys, including that of inflation. Nevertheless, when it was in office it made use to some degree of national credit. Of course, it did so very furtively, because it was afraid to associate itself openly with the protagonists of the new financial era that is just beginning. When the first Menzies budget was introduced, I said that it would ultimately break down under the weight of its own orthodoxy. My prophecy has been fulfilled, and to-day the Government, has to bridge a gap of £300,000,000. Despite what honorable gentlemen opposite may say, a considerable portion of that sum will have to be derived from national credit. In fact, long before the war ends, we shall have become accustomed to the use of national credit. Not the arguments of the theorists, but force of circumstance will compel this change. Wc shall not set foot on the road to victory until we adopt new financial methods. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, probably three-fourths of our time in this chamber has been occupied in considering means of raising the money needed to conduct the war. We are tackling the problem from the wrong direction. We should budget for objectives by fixing the numbers of men and the quantities of munitions and other materials required, and then deciding <inline font-style="italic">how</inline> to obtain the necessary money. Finance should be the servant of the nation, not its master, as it has been up to the present time. About twelve months ago, I pointed out in this chamber that the allied nations at that time had an advantage over their enemies of about five or six to one in man-power and about twenty to one in raw materials. The position has deteriorated since then, however, and, unless we adopt better methods of organizing and financing our campaign, it will be completely reversed. There seems to be a continual struggle between the exponents of old and new financial systems. Some of our taxation measures should have been scrapped long ago, particularly those which affect soldiers, munitions workers, members of the Public Service and others employed by the Commonwealth. There are many more people in the employ of the Commonwealth Government to-day than there were in peacetime. It is absurd that each one should be paid a salary or wage and then taxed upon that income, necessitating the maintenance of a large taxation staff. It would be much better to pay these people the net sums that they receive after payment of taxation. By this means, a great deal of man-power now employed in the Taxation Department could be released to give service to the nation in other ways. Some months ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ralph</inline> Clark, a Master of Arts, propounded a scheme by which, during this period of crisis, all of us would be guaranteed supplies of food, clothing and shelter by the Government so that we could concentrate on the successful prosecution of the war without being distracted by economic worries. There is a great deal of merit in that scheme. There is nothing mystical about finance. Only recently, I read the following article in a copy of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror :  -</inline> "  The restoration and maintenance of pros perityafter the war must be accomplished by the printing of additional money", declared Henry Ford, America'sNo. 1 industrial genius, inan interview with the magazine <inline font-style="italic">Liberty.</inline> "T  he first thing that should be done when peace comes is to issue currency to repay the people for money loaned to the Government", he said. " That money would provide purchasing power, keep industry going and provide jobs until we get squared all round". </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Ford laughed at a suggestion that " printing press " dollars would mean inflation. The dollar was good all over the world, he said, because there was plenty to make it good. </para>
                        <para>He is still a pacifist and conscientious objector, claiming that the last war threw civilization back 100 years. "Things are different now", he said, when reminded that depressions usually followed wars. " If this war ended to-morrow, there would be a big gap to be filled. Right now there are shortages of many things people want - andmany of these shortages are increasing. "If the war goes on for another year or two, there will be a demand for all we can make.",hesaid. "Production is the only way to prosperity - and there isn't such a thing as over-production ". </para>
                        <para class="block">That is the opinion  of the  world's most outstanding industrialist. Honorable gentlemen may have their own ideas about finance, but they should give heed  to  the views of this man,who has proved by his achievements that he knowsa <inline font-style="italic">great</inline> deal about finance. Hehas put his financial theories into practice, and has brought into being the finest industrial organization in the world. Some persons consider that, in  war-time,  it is not logical  to  use national credit to produce goods which probably will be destroyed. However, there is no sound argument against the use of national credit in times  of  peace, and any doubts about the wisdom of such a policy in war-time could be resolved by instituting a wealth tax  or  capital levy. Such a tax need  not.  be large, because  of the  vast amount of private wealth in Australia, but  for  those people who bad to pay the  tax  it would be an in- surance against the destruction of themselves and their wealth. After the  war  ended, those persons would still have a considerable amount of wealth. For every £1 00,000,000 of national credit issued, a similar amount could be obtained by means of the wealth tax. </para>
                        <para class="block">The one would be offset against the other; the proceeds of the wealth tax would replace the wealth destroyed by war. We shall be forced to resort to some form of capital levy before the end of the war, because we shall not be able to pass the cost on to posterity as some honorable members opposite propose. They advocate the raising of money by means of compulsory loans, which will bear interest. Who will have to repay these capital sums and the interest which accrues on them? Shall we expect those fighting men who are fortunate enough to return after the war and the dependants of those who give their lives to do so? The cost of the war of 1914-18 was charged to posterity, but future generations, and the men of our fighting services who are now making great sacrifices, will not allow themselves to be loaded down in that way. The war should be paid for while it is being fought. If it be good enough for men in the fighting services to risk their lives for their country, it should be good enough for the wealthy interest in the community to contribute towards what I regard as an insurance policy, by means of a wealth tax or something of the kind, so that the costs of war may be met, as far as possible, as they are being incurred. Our national debt has increased by more than £300,000,000 since the outbreak of the war. For this reason and others that I have stated I consider that national credit and a capital levy should be utilized to the fullest possible degree, to meet the current cost of the war. </para>
                        <para>If some such policy be applied honorable members would not be required to devote so much of their time in Parliament to the discussion of financial measures, but would be able to make their services available to the Government for other more effective duties. I consider that arrangements should be made to enable more private members to assist Ministers in their administrative work. In my opinion the parliamentary committee system which has been established has proved of value. Some criticism of this method has been offered, but I believe that the results achieved have entirely justified the experiment. Hitherto most of the committees have been engaged on special investigations  which have resulted in substantial savings of money to the Government. I was a member of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure for about a month. I know that it did good work during that period, and I have every reason to believe that it is still doing good work. The outlay of public money on these committees is relatively small. I drew only 30s. in expenses in connexion, with one visit to Melbourne. Most of my service on that committee was rendered in Sydney, and that being my home town, I did not draw expenses. This committee was able to save the Government £.100,000 in one instance for it caused a certain firm to refund that amount of excess profits that it had made on a certain undertaking. Another firm refunded £48,000 for a similar reason. The appointment of private members to assist Ministers in the onerous duties which devolve upon them in consequence of war has also been effective, for Ministers have been enabled to devote a great deal more of their attention, to major matters of policy. Some members of the Opposition have given good help to Ministers in this way. I believe that a number of their colleagues who have expressed a desire to co-operate with the Government, could also assist, by following the good example that has been set. </para>

                        <para>There is need for more attention to be given to the problem of production, in order to facilitate the war effort. During my travelling, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, I have observed considerable evidence of waste in certain war industries. Man-power, equipment and materials have not always been used to the best advantage. Because of this, I have advocated that a Director of Production should be appointed, to perform duties of a kind performed by such officers in Great Britain and the United States of America. As it is impossible for Ministers to give close attention to the detailed operations of various industries, there is scope for the employment of nien with high organizing and administrative capacity to assist in eliminating waste in production. Either a Director of Production or a Production Board should be established. I am aware that a sub-committee of Cabinet has been appointed to coordinate production, but Ministers have too many other duties to perform to be able to devote to this particular activity the time that it demands. If a Director of Production were appointed, he should be given over-riding authority that would permit him to co-ordinate the activities of departments engaged in war production which are now operating in more or less watertight compartments. If such an officer learned that one factory had a surplus of material, whereas another was suffering from a shortage; or that one factory had too many machines and another too few; or that one factory had a surplus of man-power and another a deficiency of it, he could co-ordinate these various resources with great advantage to the nation. Many employers, as well as employees generally, would welcome such a move. I have known of certain factories being slack, and of employees being stood down for two or three weeks, because materials or equipment have not been available for some reason or other. The men have received their wages because the employers have not wanted to risk losing them. Under the cost-plus system, such unproductive expense has been passed on to the Government, of course. Sometimes, parts of machines have not been available to remedy breakdowns. We all are well aware that ships carrying machines and spare parts to Australia have gone to the bottom of the sea. This also has caused idle periods in certain establishments. I believe that a Director of Production would be able to readjust available supplies so as to alleviate troubles of this kind. On occasions, factory workers who have been stood down for short periods have been very fretful over this procedure. Sometimes they have not been informed of the reason why work has not been available for them and they became suspicious. The workers generally would welcome the establishment of what might be called industrial shock troops who could be moved rapidly from one factory to another as occasion demanded. It is particularly necessary !"h at some such policy should be applied in relation to sub-contractors. It sometimes happens that from 30 to 50 sub-contractors supply equipment to an establishment which is engaged largely in assembling operations. Obviously, the rate of production in such an establishment is governed by the rate of the delivery of goods by the subcontractors, and a breakdown by one sub-contractor may seriously impair the rate of, production of the assembled article. The Government should give close attention to this problem. Production committees have been appointed in various establishments in Great Britain in order to increase efficiency and output, and many workers there have co-operated most successfully with the factory management in stimulating production. I have seen many places where production committees could operate with good effect in Australia. In one establishment in my own electorate, a committee of 50 workers representative of various branches of the industry has been able to co-operate with the management in complete harmony and with marked advantage to the 2,000 employees in the factory. Whenever production is lagging, they go into the matter with the management, and try to discover the reason. If there is a shortage of orders, they try to encourage sales, because they are just as anxious that the enterprise shall be a success as is the management. If an industrial dispute occurs they confer with the management regarding it, and the matter is settled amicably, with the result that, during the last three years, there has not been a stoppage of work for even one day. This shows what can be done by effective co-operation between the management and the workers. I realize that there are some employers who frown upon anything that may tend to give the workers a say in management. One corporation recently dismissed the eight members of the production committee which had been set up by the workers. The result is that the most highly skilled and responsible workers often refuse to serve on production committees; but, if the Government  recog- nized  the committees officially, as does the Government of Great Britain, this difficulty would be overcome. After all, the man at the machine is often in the best position to say how efficiency can be improved. The Government is itself interested in many industries at the present time; it has financed them, and is their chief customer. Therefore, it should seek representation upon the directorates. I look forward to the time when we shall have, acting in close cooperation, the workers, the private shareholders - who will draw limited profits - and the Government as the representative of the general community. Eventually, under a system of this kind, the workers may expect to become shareholders in industry, and to participate in the profits of their own labour. </para>
                        <para>Reference was made in the budget speech to the need for reform of the Constitution, and we were told that the Government proposed to bring down legislation on this subject. I hope that, before proposals are put to the people, the Commonwealth Government will confer with the State governments. I agree with the ex-Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, that the Commonwealth should not take advantage of the war, and of the weak financial position of the States, to foist proposals for constitutional reform upon the country. The only fair and honest way is to discuss the matter with the State governments, which are just as anxious for a measure of constitution reform as is the Commonwealth itself. The State governments have ideas on the subject of postwar reconstruction, but they distrust central control, and they have reason to. I myself have had experience of the difficulties of trying to get anything done by a central authority far removed from the scene of action. In 1938, I visited Canberra to interview the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> on behalf of the cooperative building societies of New South Wales. I explained to him that the societies had, up to that time, raised about £10,000,000 for housing, and were anxious to obtain financial accommodation from the Commonwealth Bank. They had tried to obtain finance from the Commonwealth Bank some time before, but had been refused. The Commonwealth Bank rate was 44. per cent.; but, when it refused the accommodation asked for, the Bank of New South Wales, which had previously offered to finance the societies at 4£ per cent., increased its rate to 5 per cent. When I put tha matter before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> his only response was to ask me how the societies had been able to get past the Loan Council and raise £10,000,000. He was not concerned with whether the people of New South Wales had houses. Apparently, if he had had his way, nono of the 20,000 houses which had. been erected under the co-operative building schemes would have been provided. For the last twelve months, the Granville Municipal Council has been trying to obtain a Commonwealth grant of £6,000 towards the cost of constructing a road and small bridge on the route between Parramattaroad  and the site of an important munitions factory. The total cost is estimated at £12,000. The road has already been dedicated, but the council has not sufficient money to do the whole of the work, though it is prepared to defray half of the cost. I have made representations to successive Treasurers without success, and have been sent on a dizzy circle from the council to the Commonwealth, from the Commonwealth to the State government, and then from the State government back to the council, until I have despaired of ever getting anything done. While this vital work is being neglected, our enemies are finding sufficient finance to build thousands of miles of roads and. railways into the heart of Russia. The War Expenditure Committee- has reported that the proposed work in the Granville municipality is urgent; but some Treasury official behind the scenes in Canberra, who has probably never been on the ground, is able to veto the whole proposal. This is a further illustration of the harm that can result from centralized control. The governments of the various States no doubt have schemes for post-war development. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith had plans for developmental works in Queensland, and. similar schemes have been evolved by the Government of New South Wales. There should be no great financial difficulties in the way of carrying out such works, provided a guarantee could be given by the Commonwealth Government that the necessary credits would be made available. It would not :be necessary to adopt the orthodox methods of finance. Even the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> has admitted that national credit oau be utilized in- peace-time. </para>
                        <para>I have no doubt that the States would agree to transfer to the Commonwealth many of their powers including industrial arbitration. Disputes extending beyond the boundaries of a State are already dealt with by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and I contend that the industrial arbitration laws should be placed on a uniform basis. We have uniform bankruptcy law3 throughout the Commonwealth, but varying railway gauges. There is no good reason why we should not adopt uniform laws on many other matters, instead of having conflicting laws such as those operating with regard to marriage and divorce. It seems logical that the Commonwealth should exercise the residual powers and that subsidiary powers should be granted to the States. In matters of local government, the powers of the States should be increased. M\any local governing bodies pass conflicting by-laws and regulations. On one side of a street certain building regulations may operate, whilst, a land-owner on the opposite side of the same street may be called upon, under the building regulations passed by another local governing body, to pay £50 more than is paid by his neighbour. </para>
                        <para>In considering amendments of the Constitution, the Government should give consideration to the necessity for Commonwealth control of monopolies. On two previous occasions the people have refused to grant to this Parliament the right to control monopolies, but electors are now more enlightened than previously as to the insidious nature of the operations of many monopolies. I have previously pointed out how they have caused bottlenecks in industry, and ample proof has been provided in the past of their activities having caused wars. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> realizes that certain bauxite deposits in his electorate in Victoria are not being developed owing to the influence exercised by the aluminium cartel. Although aluminium is urgently needed for war purposes, 'action was taken by the aluminium combine to prevent the development of bauxite deposits in Australia. The overseas cartel decreed that the local deposits were not to be developed, but that aluminium ingots from overseas would be supplied to the Australian industry. Australia, therefore, has experienced a considerable shortage of raw material for the production of the aluminium required in various war industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Charles, a representative of the British aluminium combine, visited Australia last year. When he found that the Curtin Government was determined to go ahead with the development of the local bauxite deposits, he offered to provide the plant required and also to supply the finance necessary for the establishment of the industry, which would cost £2,500,000, on condition that after the war the plant should be dismantled. That shows clearly that the overseas interests desired Australians to be merely hewers of wood and drawers of water. A representative of the Indian aluminium trust stated some time ago that after the war a catastrophic drop would occur in the price of aluminium. He was more concerned about the price of the article than the desirability of providing cheap aluminium goods for the people. Disclosures in the United States of America recently showed that the Standard Oil Company had kept back from the Navy Department the secrets of certain processes and only under pressure by a Senate committee was it revealed that the company had agreements with Industrial Gesellschaft. in Germany, and with a Japanese company, for the postwar employment of the secret processes. The position of the overseas interests was, " Heads I win, tails you lose ". They come out on the right side whichever way the war goes. A monopoly can be justified only if it operates for the good of the community, and, in order to do that, it should be under government control. I hope that the Government will incorporate in its proposals for amendments of the Constitution one for the granting of power to this Parliament to control monopolies. </para>
                        <para>Since the Labour Government has come into office some honorable members opposite have displayed a co-operative attitude towards the Ministry, whilst others have not. Their attitude is very different from that of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> The Labour party gave a pledge to the people at the elections that it would cooperate in the prosecution of the war with whatever government was in power, and during the period when Labour was in opposition the present Prime Minister did not move a vote of censure against the Government. The defeat of the last Government was brought about by disruption in its own ranks. In my judgment the present Prime Minister was too tolerant and too generous, for he has not received the co-operation to which he is entitled. Despite the sniping tactics of some Opposition members, the Government has a record of which it may well be proud, a record with which that of no previous government can compare. Its merit is enhanced by the colossal nature of the task it had to undertake because of the defenceless state in which it found this country when it assumed office. Although we are still in danger of invasion, our position is much safer now than it was then. The Government's first consideration throughout has been the prosecution of the war. The appeal that it made to the United States of America resulted in a large number of men and considerable war equipment being sent to this country. Members of the Australian Imperial Force were brought back from overseas, the view of the Government being that their proper place was in their own country, fighting for their own kith and kin, when our own shores were in imminent danger. There has also been substantial improvement of the position in relation to production. Social reform measures, too, have been introduced. The people appreciate that during a period of war a Labour government is not able to give full effect to its platform. The Government has proved its sincerity by having given effect to such measures of social reform as circumstances have permitted it to implement. In fulfilment of promises made at. the last elections, it has increased the invalid and old-age pension rate, and has instituted a scheme of widows' pensions on an Australia-wide basis. Child endowment, too, was made Australia-wide as the result of the activities of the Labour party; because, when the previous Government realized that it was losing popularity in the electorates, it invoked the aid of the Labour Opposition in this Parliament in order to institute the scheme. The Government has encouraged the practice of having different matters inquired into and reported upon by parliamentary committees, and is ensuring that the recommendations of such committees shall be implemented, and not shelved - as they were under previous administrations. The scheme of widows' pensions was the direct result of a report and recommendations by the Social Security Committee. That committee further recommended provisions relating to the right to work, and made other recommendations covering not only the period of the war but also the post-war period. As the result of government action, persons who are temporarily out of employment, because of the change-over from non-essential to war industries, are to receive sustenance for a specified period. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> A committee was set up to overhaul the Repatriation Act, and to recommend means by which it might be brought up to date, with provisions covering conditions arising out of the present war. I understand that the main subject dealt with has been pension rates. [ should like the committee to inquire into the administration of the act, because I" am satisfied from my experience that it is completely out of sympathy with the needs of returned soldiers. Under the old appeals tribunal, 90 per cent, of the claims submitted were rejected. One would think that expert medical knowledge was not needed to prove that the condition of which complaint was made had been the result of war service or had been contributed to by it. To the credit of the present Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost),</inline> when the facts were brought to his notice and the appeals tribunal had to be reconstituted this year, an entirely new body was appointed. Knowing its personnel, I look forward to returned soldiers receiving from it a much better deal than was given by the previous tribunal. I have previously mentioned the case of a soldier who was an original Anzac. He was at the landing at Gallipoli, and served for four years in the last war. In the present war, he had sixteen months' service when he sustained injury. Upon being discharged, not even a civilian suit was available for him, and he could not obtain a sustenance allowance. He was told that there was not in stock a suit that would fit him, but that he would be measured for one, and it might be ready for him in three months. This illustrates the state of preparedness of the authorities to deal with men discharged from the services. I realize, of course, that the present Government cannot overhaul the administration overnight. When this man applied for a pension, his application was refused. The facts having been brought to the notice of the Minister for Repatriation, he immediately issued a national security regulation in order to remedy the defect by providing that members of the home forces disabled during service were to be entitled to a pension. That the administration is out of sympathy with the men is shown by the fact that, although the Government had accepted responsibility, this man received the paltry pension of 8s. 6d. a fortnight on his own behalf and 6s. 6d. a fortnight for his wife and two children. He was unable to carry on because his head and foot injuries caused him to swoon at times, even in the street. Eventually, for the third time he was taken into a fighting service; but according to the latest advice I have received, he cannot continue to discharge his military duties. Many men of the Australian Imperial Force who have returned from this war are receiving similar treatment. The Government should institute an inquiry with a view to the complete overhaul of the repatriation administration in order that those who are fighting on behalf of this country may be assured that the promises that were made to them when they enlisted will be fulfilled. </para>
                        <para>During the recent adjournment of the Parliament, members of the Opposition conducted a campaign in the press. Various bogys were raised. So soon as one was knocked over, another took its place. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> has furnished evidence of a deliberate plan of action. We know that challenge after challenge was issued from the other side during the last sessional period. Similar tactics are again being adopted. There would appear to be a preconceived plan, because the adjournment of the House has been moved for the purpose of disseminating data that has been collected, and this has been coupled with a press campaign and upheavals in industry. I am convinced that the trouble in the Goal-mining industry is due, not to the great body of coal-miners, but to certain people associated with the management who are endeavouring to create friction. It is true that there are a few Quislings among the workers, but "the proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof ", and the miners have shown that they are wholeheartedly behind the Government's war effort and intend to increase production more and more. As evidence of the attempt to undermine the Government by creating dissathi  action in various quarters, I instance the instruction to remove the colour patches from the uniforms of returned members of the Australian Imperial Force. The colour patches were not of great intrinsic value, but they were highly prized by the men concerned. The instruction to remove them was evidence of crass stupidity, if not something worse. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister can only deal with the situation that is presented to him; that is why I bring this matter forward now. Many persons holding administrative positions in this country were appointed by a previous government, and they are trying to undermine the present Government by fomenting trouble between members of the Australian Military Forces, and the Australian Imperial Force, as well as among munitions workers. Some honorable members opposite have raised the " red " bogy. The present is a most inappropriate time to criticize Soviet Russia whose people are shedding rivers of blood in a desperate attempt to stem the tide of Nazi aggression. The purpose of these catch cries is to cause disruption and to undermine the Government at a time when there should be a true spirit of harmony and co-operation among all sections of the community. Instead of rehashing their election speeches for the last ten years, or raising such, bogys as inflation and communism, honorable members opposite should co-operate with the Government in the interests of Australia. The Anglo-Soviet pact is the best guarantee that we have that there will be no political interference by either of the signatories with the other or any conflict of ideologies. The pact is an undertaking to bring about a permanent settlement of this war in order to end war, and thereby lay the foundations of an era of peace, harmony and goodwill. </para>

At the commencement of a long and, no doubt, interesting oration, the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> said that the one thing which did not matter at this stage was finance, but that man-power problems were this country's main concern. He also urged that more people should be put into production. Having delivered himself of those truths the honorable member occupied three-quarters of an hour in telling the Government how to finance the war. He said that the war could be financed without taxation, and he cited as his authority a well-known American who is a. pacifist, conscientious objector, and inflationist. </para>

                                <para>- I have done some strange things, but I am not prepared to do that. My complaint regarding the budget is that it exhibits too great a tendency on the part of the Government to use the present world situation to put its policy into effect, and too little intention to strengthen the defences of the country.  The budget speech is one of the most, conservative documents I have ever read. If .the laws in regard to pure foods and drugs applied to politics, I fear that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> would be brought before the court for having inaccurately and falsely described that which he placed before the people. </para>

                                <para>- I shall be here when- the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan)</inline> is no longer a member. However, that is not the subject before us now, although before I conclude I shall have something to say on the subject of a general election. I have no doubt that some honorable members opposite will be interested to hear my views. The subject which, above all others, we have to consider is whether, under the present Government, this country is being prepared for the challenge which, undoubtedly will be made in the near future. Towards the end of his speech when the honorable member for Reid was taking two or three hurdles at a time, and just as the Prime Minister came into the chamber, the honorable member said that the present Government has so strengthened the defences of Australia that our  fear3  of a few months ago had largely been removed. I know of nothing to justify that view. On the contrary, all that I know indicates that w&amp; shall have to meet a challenge on Australian soil. We are confronted by the most ruthless and powerful enemy that, the white race has ever faced. The sooner this country realizes that this is more than an ordinary war and is, in fact, a racial war, in which those opposed to us neither ask for, nor give, quarter, the better it will be. Let us for a moment consider the position in relation to man-power. Some honorable members appear to think that we in Australia control the Pacific, but the truth is that we do not. The enemy that we are fighting in the Pacific controls 375,000,000 people; our population numbers 7,000,000. The information is no secret. Any clerk in a government department could make that computation for an honorable member. The Japanese Army will marshal, organize, train, and direct the man-power available to it towards the overthrow of everything which the white races represent in the Pacific. With Japan, there are no half measures. But ever since the last election we have been cursed with the fact that the Government would not govern, and the Opposition would not oppose. </para>

                        <para>During the last week-end, some unfortunate statements were made on the subject of the war. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who is very privileged in having me  as  one of his followers, saw fit to make  a  couple of public utterances on the conduct of military operations in New Guinea. In my opinion, one of two courses is open to the right honorable gentleman. He should either resign from, the Advisory War Council before making statements, or if he remains  a  member of that body, he should not make public statements such as those which he made last week-end. The Government either governs, or it does not. The proper course .to adopt is to form  a  national government, in which all parties will be represented, to direct Australia's part in the conduct of the war. That is the ideal. I have not mentioned the subject for nearly eighteen months, but the utter impossibility and stupidity of the present position, which must produce certain disaster, will force upon the country the necessity for pooling, not only the best brains, but also the resources, courage and experience contained in this Parliament. I agree with the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> made in Perth recently that the Advisory War Council, as constituted to-day, cannot possibly give the best advice on the conduct of operations, because it does not contain the right men. In my opinion, the Advisory War Council should not  exist. Members of the Opposition should have left it on one or two occasions. A little while ago, in Brisbane, the Prime Minister gave them an excellent opportunity ,to resign. I regret that they did not take advantage of it. Ultimately, either by an act of the Opposition or by' an act of the government of the day, this unsatisfactory position will be remedied, and we shall then get a proper appreciation of our task. At present, there is too much backing and filling, too much covering up, and too much so-called co-operation, which only results in compromise. The Government should adopt a  hard-and-fast  policy, select its objectives, choose its methods, and assign the human instruments to give effect to them. But the present system must always result in compromise in order to oblige the other fellow. </para>

                                <para>- It is not a national government. The Advisory "War Council was deliberately conceived by the conference of the Australian Labour party as an alternative to, and a means of escaping from, a national government. Every day that the Advisory War Council remains in existence postpones the formation of a national government, The only possible way in which to get a national government in Australia is by the abolition of the Advisory War Council. A national government will never grow out of that body, and the people who fashioned this instrument are wielding it to-day in obedience to the conference of the Australian Labour party, whose will is law. If they are to remain in the Labour movement, they must see that no national government, however camouflaged, emerges from the Advisory War Council. All that we get out of the present set-up is downright deception. </para>

                        <para>Most honorable members opposite, and one or two on this side of the chamber, believed that I was wrong when I said repeatedly that total war faced Australia. I should like to address a few words to the Prime Minister on this subject. In a state of total war, a country cannot have a war policy and a domestic policy. Every activity, including every form of production and trans port, must be conditioned to the requirements of total war. For honorable members to contend that Australia can have a war policy and a domestic polley driving in double harness is utterly futile. A Shetland pony and a leopard running in double harness would give better results. </para>
                        <para>T.n approaching the subject of food supplies, we must examine the man-power situation. As I pointed out earlier, om small population has a continent at its disposal. Our men, materials and food must be transported over vast distances, and our sea coast has been subjected to the activities of enemy submarines for some little time. The breaks of gauge on the interstate railway systems, which we constructed, impede the mobility of our armies. With our small population, man-power is of primary importance. For that reason, I have always been an unblushing  conscriptionist.  The voluntary system cannot exist in total war. The only possible system is that of conscription, under which the Government takes what it requires in the way of men, guns, ammunition, transport,  timber  and foodstuffs. </para>

                                <para>- We are still a long way from the desired objective. If the honorable gentleman believes that the ideal has been achieved, he has a much keener political insight than 1 have. He may be on the private correspondence list of the leader of the party to which I belong, and he may even be able to read the right honorable gentleman's letters. Only by getting down to hard and fast, clear-cut methods, under which the men, women and resources in this country are allotted a task, and the Government sees that they do it, can we get anywhere. That applies also to the financial provisions of the budget. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> is pinning his faith to the voluntary system of raising loans. The voluntary system will not save him. Whether he likes it or not, he will, sooner or later, be forced to rely on compulsory savings, on which the Fadden Government was defeated. That was one of the wisest proposals ever submitted to this Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- I also say to the Prime Minister that, sooner or later, whether it be done by this Government, or by another government under his control, the problem of increasing the rates of taxes on lower incomes must be faced. The available spending power in the community to-day greatly exceeds the value of goods that can be purchased. So soon as you leave a surplus of purchasing power in the hands of the people, which, to-day, incidentally, is greater than they have been accustomed to, you establish the conditions under which black markets are set up and operated. It stands to reason that as a greater proportion of civil industry is turned over to war production, the disparity between the supply of goods and the supply of money will increase. Only by a system of compulsory loans can we establish a .proper balance. Be the Prime Minister ever so able, all his pleading and broadcasting will not induce the people to come up to scratch with voluntary loans. I assure him that the voluntary principle is dead in this country. He recognizes the principle of compulsion in other directions. The Government  is  attempting, by stealth, to introduce compulsory unionism. Perhaps the Prime Minister does not know much about it, 1 was left with that impression after his speech last Thursday. I also had the painful feeling that the right honorable gentleman and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> were not quite agreed on what  is  the state of affairs in this country to-day. It is not a good thing for a government when Ministers openly disagree in Parliament on such an important matter. The Government cannot expect to establish complete harmony while it  is  endeavouring to use the present crisis to introduce very questionable financial procedure in this country. This problem cannot be written off ; the people will not write it off. The cost of living, and the prices of all goods generally are increasing. Very shortly, people on fixed incomes will feel the pinch severely. Something will have to be done about that matter in the not far distant future. Personally, I believe that the Government will have cause to amend the present budget before very long. One of the worst things that can happen in any community is the introduction of financial proposals which undermine the confidence of the people and the stability of the currency. Those evils are inherent in this budget. The injection of what is failed national credit into the financial system is about to begin ; but our financial system will not be able to stand it. Let us remember that a country which is devoting more and more of its manpower, materials, industry and transport, to purely war measures cannot have that reserve in stock of marketable, desirable commodities on which any release of credit can be based. That is -the position. Production to-day is directed, not towards consumption by the -community, but towards production of articles which will be destroyed in war. Shells will be fired, aircraft lost, and food eaten by troops who will not add one iota to the wealth of this country. There is an overflow of wealth. It is all very well for the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> to talk about a capital levy, but the capital resources of this country are diminishing day by day, as they must diminish in all countries at war.  fer  war is a consumption of capital, on a very large scale at times. </para>

                                <para>- I am not to be put in the position of having to ask for an extension of time. I have no more desire for that than the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> will have on the 3rd October. The debate on the budget is not confined to a discussion of high principles of finance, government and that sort of thing. One may discuss a multitude of things. One thing to which I wish to refer is waste. Anything that can be done by any government department to ensure that the resources of this country shall not be wasted is a good act. Whether in respect of petrol,  rubber,  aluminium, wheat, copper, flour or anything else, whatever government is in charge, whether it be a Curtin government, a Fadden government, a Menzies government, or a Wilson government if we come to that, a certain amount of waste under conditions of war is inescapable. But it is very desirable that that waste be reduced  to  absolute minimum and that nothing be wasted which is capable of being saved, because we may nave -a surplus of a commodity today and none of it to-morrow. A few weeks of campaign by the Japanese in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies completely changed the balance of availability of certain commodities. Rubber, tin, quinine and tea are four commodities that one oan name offhand in respect of which the British Empire, the United States of America and the Dutch from being the " haves " became the " have nots " and the Japanese the " haves ". The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and other bodies are now going hammer and tongs to try to discover substitutes, and tin mines in this .country, condemned as unprofitable, are now being worked. So it does not pay in war-time to think that everything in the garden is lovely, and that we need not worry. </para>

                                <para>- I  would be in trouble with the Opposition Whip if I suggested that. On this question of an election, I do not know what is in the Prime Minister's mind, but I believe that I am a normally observant individual. Since the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith as Premier of Queensland, and since there have been rumours that another notorious supporter of Labour has designs on the Reid seat, that another ex-Premier of New South Wales is likely to enter the lists, and that the Premier of Victoria is another likely contestant of a federal seat, there has been a great -cooling of the inclinations of government members towards a general election. Certain honorable members were rather enthusiastic about it three or four weeks ago, but not now, when there is a possibility of the great Queenslander with a broad accent, and a man from Victoria, who might make an excellent member for Ballarat, being candidates, and a possibility of there being no <inline font-style="italic">morgen</inline> - I am using a foreign word, not the name of the honorable member for Reid. If the Prime Minister is toying with the idea of an election I remind him that an election is the <inline font-style="italic">sort</inline> of fire in which people's fingers are burned. I normally belong to the "no election party". I believe in carrying out the provisions of the Australian Constitution. I- believed that two years ago, and still believe it. I  believe that twelve months hence unless there should  be  very important internal reasons why this House should not go to the country, the people should pronounce judgment on this Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- No, 1 am not worrying about the Senate; That chamber can look after itself. This Parliament, in my opinion, is the most unsatisfactory that this country has ever had since federation. I think that it would not be a good thing to perpetuate this Parliament after twelve months hence, unless there be compelling reasons for taking that special action. Having said that, I leave the election matter for a little while longer to see just how it goes on. </para>

                                <para>- I am not prejudging. My normal attitude would be that we should have the election when it is due, unless there are important special reasons to the contrary. Oliver Cromwell did not believe in elections at all. He had one Parliament that lasted for 19 years, but during that time Parliament certainly governed England. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> said a great deal this afternoon about posterity. I say that this budget is austerity for posterity, but in Cromwell's time conditions were so austere that it was a criminal offence in England for a man to eat a mince pie. </para>

                        <para>As regards compulsory unionism, it is an indisputable fact that the Government, whether consciously or unconsciously, is engaged  in  an attempt to force into trade unions, people who have been called up for war service and for nothing else ; and who, but for the Japanese war, would not have been called upon by the Government to do anything. My mind goes back to a condition of affairs when trade unionism was in its infancy, and practically proscribed. Is was then a crime to belong to a trade union. At that time two fights were going on in Great Britain. One was to secure the right of free association for the workers, and the other was to bring about the disestablishment of the Church of England in England, Wales, and other parts. I have no objection to the right of free industrial association for the workers. </para>

                                <para>- No ; there is no room in this country for the Communist philosophy. The only possible outcome of the toleration of the Communist party here would be, sooner or later, civil strife. The Prime Minister recently spoke of civil war, and I suggest that civil strife and civil war are synonymous. If the right honorable gentleman is <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with what is being done by certain people - and I presume he was when he made that statement - he will sympathize with what I am saying now. The right of free association of the workers in industry for an industrial object can have no opponents in this chamber, but when to an industrial object there is added a political object, the clock is put back 100 years. </para>

                                <para>- 1 thought the Prime Minister was referring to my possible membership of the chamber. I am not in the inner councils of that body, and consequently would not like to be held responsible for what its members, do, nor could I give a fair description of their activities. As I said, at the time when men were being imprisoned in England for fighting for the right of free industrial association, a campaign was going on for the disestablishment of the Anglican Church. The basis of the latter agitation was that it was immoral, in the good English sense of the word, to compel a man to pay contributions to something in which he did not believe. I urge that, just as it is- immoral to compel a man to contribute to a  faith in which he does not believe, so also is it immoral to compel a man to pay contributions to a political party in which he does not believe. I put that point to the Government for consideration in a friendly way. It is one that will have to be considered. I recognize the right of men to band themselves together in a trade union, and I have a very high regard for what were known in the Middle Ages as guilds. The qualification that the guilds imposed was interesting. No man became a member of a guild until he had served an apprenticeship to his trade, and had become a qualified tradesman. That is something that the trade unions of this country do not insist on to-day. It is a great pity that they do not. </para>

                                <para>- I have attended more than one Farmers and Settlers Conference - hi fact, I have attended a great, number and variety of conferences in my time - and I know how things are fixed up. It is most amusing to see how they are done. I know something of the people in those conferences, and I should not be surprised at any resolutions that they passed. Knowing the honorable member, I should not be surprised if he approved of them; I should be rather surprised if he disapproved of them. I am sorry the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> is not in the chamber. I believe he was here to-day, and it is about time we had something to say regarding his position here. I am friendly disposed towards him. He came into the chamber as an Independent. I tell the Prime Minister that he will find out that independent and undependable are one and the same thing. </para>

                                <para>- There is no secret about that. I am a member of the United Australia party. The honorable member should know me well enough to know that I do not go back on my tracks. There is no quarrel between me and my friends in the Country party. Since I left the Country party, no one tas heard from me any criticism directed against it. I went into it freely, and freely went out of it, unlike some honorable members opposite, who may smart under the caucus whip, but are not game to walk out of the caucus room. So long as I remain in politics, it will not make very much difference to me or my outlook what party I may be associated with. I have not much feeling on these matters. If the members of the Country party were not prepared to follow my leadership, they were entitled to follow anybody else they liked. <inline font-style="italic">\ Extension of time granted.</inline> | I arrived in Melbourne on one occasion at the same time as the honorable member for Henty, who had just returned from London. I stood for two hours at a public meeting, one of the most crowded I ever saw, in the Melbourne Town Hall. The honorable member for Henty took over an hour and 35 minutes to speak on " things in general ". A book with that title was written by a great author. He had not anything particular to say, so he went ahead and wrote a book. Many authors do that- </para>

                                <para>- I shall have a word or two to say about the honorable member for Batman ' later. To return to my story, the honorable member for Henty having told of his experiences overseas, and reached conclusions on his 23 points, did everything except ask the public meeting to request him to become Prime Minister of this country. I am surprised that after having helped the lame dog over the stile, his merits have not been duly recognized and rewarded. I trust that when the Prime Minister is reconstructing his Cabinet one day he will suitably reward those who have made his Government possible. </para>

                                <para>- I noticed that. There was an occasion when the honorable member said quite a lot to me. I had always thought that he was one of those steel-like persons who could not be broken or even bent. However, on the occasion to which I refer he said, by way of interjection, " I say, loud enough for the honorable member for Barker to hear, that if it is the last thing I do in this life, I shall vote against Statutory Rule No. 77 ". But he did not do so. In my dreams one night I saw a vision of the honorable member for Batman standing at the gates of Heaven arguing the point with St. Peter, and poor St. Peter was in a quandary. In one hand he held a copy of the Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy containing the words, " I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith ", and in the other, page 397 of this year's <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline> Unfortunately, I did not find out what happened because I woke up, but I think that the honorable member would have had a little bit of explaining to do, as he was not present when the vote on regulation 77 was taken. </para>

When he goes before the electors of Melbourne at the next elections, he  will have to explain to them why he got up on two very good Australian legs in this chamber, and said that the second Chifley budget was a United Australia party budget. Whatever success he may have in that explanation, and whatever the future holds in store, for Heaven's sake let us realize that first things come first in this country. The time is coming when we shall have to pull away the veils which so far have been hiding things as they really are. Men have to carry their own responsibilities in this chamber, and if we cannot have a national government, 1 would far rather see the present Government, absolutely untrammelled, carrying out the policy which it believes to be right, just, and proper, for the Commonwealth of Australia, than the perpetuation of what I believe to be an inadequate and most unsatisfactory system. </para>

                            <para>.- At this stage of the debate, when many aspects of the budget have been thoroughly discussed, I approach the subject from a fresh and important stand-point, by considering whether or not the Government and its advisers are acting prudently in the light of overseas developments in war finance. In his speech on the budget, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> wisely stated that Australia was passing through the same financial war problems as overseas countries, and then, perhaps equally wisely, he threw his papers on the table. If the statistics in those papers were international comparisons properly presented they showed that this budget lies between the very satisfactory budget which was passed in Great Britain in April and the very unsatisfactory and dangerous budget which is causing much anxiety and worry in the United States of America. In the light of overseas finance, there are four main faults in this budget. They are, first, insufficient taxation, and a total neglect of post-war credits to reduce consumption at a time when civilian production is decreasing; secondly, a wholly disproportionate reliance on voluntary loans, the probable success of which the Prime Minister himself admitted in this chamber to be doubtful: thirdly, the extension of rationing under confused ideas, in which rationing due to shortages of goods is muddled up with monetary rationing to reduce consuming power; and, fourthly, an almost certain extension of credit to augment the increase in 1941-42, which was very much higher proportionately than the British rate. Fifty-five per cent, of this budget consists, perhaps appropriately to Australia, of great open spaces to be filled by voluntary loans, or, as has been hinted, by compulsory loans or a release of credit. The Prime Minister made the dangerous admission that he laughs at threats of ruin from credit release. The millions of Austrians and Germans who suffered disaster and starvation in the great credit release that followed the war of 1914-18 learned not to laugh at ruin by credit release. The world can indeed be thankful that the United States of America has a  President  who has not such a perverted sense of humour as to laugh at ruin by credit release. Even the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> admitted, from that Tower of Babel where he now sits, the advantages of taxation as a means of war finance, and the Prime Minister himself conceded that the budget does not cover the whole field of taxation. Therefore, I was horrified to see in the budget three great faults as regards taxation. The first is  a  wholly insufficient proportion of taxation as compared withother revenue, the second is an insufficient amount of new taxation, and the third is the failure of the Government to use taxation in order to reduce the consuming power of the lower incomes, which control 70 per cent, of our national income. This budget proposes to secure only 45 per cent, of our expenditure from taxation and from departmental receipts, and, if war expenditure increases, as seems probable, that proportion may very easily fall to 40 per cent. Canada, including its purchases for Great Britain, is financing over 50 per cent,of its war expenditure by taxation, and one report states that, if purchases for Great Britain are excluded, that dominion is financing 78 per cent, of its war expanditure by taxation. According to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Great Britain is financing 53 per cent, of its war expenditure by taxation and by post-war credits, which are classed as taxation. The United States of America is aiming at securing only 40 per cent, of its war needs by taxation. That is regarded as insufficient and likely to cause a very dangerous inflationary trend. As regards new taxation, Great Britain is imposing taxes at double the rate of Australia. It is levying £186,000,000 of new taxation, which is equivalent to £4 <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> as against £14,000,000, or £2 <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> in Australia, according to the Treasurer's budget statement. I realize that the problem of taxing the lower incomes, which control 70 per cent, of the national income, is extraordinarily difficult, but I believe that many honorable members on the Government side of the chamber really see, like the British and the Americans, that we cannot avoid taxing those incomes because, in war-time, we must reduce their consuming power. In Great Britain prior to the war, fewer than 1,000,000 workers were taxed  an  amount of £2,500,000. The 1941-42 British budget provided for taxing 5,500,000 workers an amount of £125,000,000, including £60,000,000 of post-war credits. In addition, these people have been taxed an enormous amount by means of increased indirect taxation. The British recognize, like wise people, that if they do not do that, the lower incomes will suffer much more through a process of inflation. The Americans also realize that they must follow this same sad course. President Roosevelt is loudly demanding increased taxation. The <inline font-style="italic">Yale Review,</inline> which is one of the most reliable newspapers in America, had this to say on the subject - </para>

                            <para class="block">It will be necessary  to  tap  the  great increase in spending power of the lower income groups much more severely than either the present tax programme plans to do, or the war saving bond campaign can hope  to  do on a voluntary lending basis. </para>
                            <para class="block">Those words apply with equal force to the financial policy of Australia. Unfortunately, neither this country nor Great Britain can obtain any appreciable extra amount from the higher and middle income groups. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in Great Britain, the higher and middle incomes could do no more, and he pointed out that 85 per cent, of the British national income was  in  the hands of the people earning less than £500  a  year. I believe that in Australia the upper and middle income groups must still contribute more towards the nation's finances. In fact, it has been said very unkindly, that Commonwealth Ministers, high government officials, members of the Common-  wealth Parliament, and even some of our economists, might carry a considerably heavier burden of taxation. The fact remains that, even if we confiscated all personal income in excess of £400 a year, we should still have to exact a very heavy tribute from the lower incomes in order to bridge this tremendous gap of £300,000,000. Nevertheless, in the face of a position like that, this Government has just been bowing for political applause on the ground that it has reduced the burden of taxation imposed on over 70 per cent, of Australian taxpayers. I ask the country whether this is austerity, sincerity, what the Prime Minister designates " stripping ourselves ", or what he terms " getting ourselves down to bare subsistence level " ? I leave it to the people of Australia to judge the difference between the deeds and the words. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. This country would be much better off, particularly after the war, if it faced up bravely to the necessity for increasing taxes. According to expert evidence heard by the Joint Committee on Profits, the total of incomes of from £250 a year to £400 a year has increased more than any other income group. <inline font-style="italic">For</inline> instance, the committee was given statistics of the earnings in a representative selection of Victorian and New South Wales factories. The number of employees had increased by 20 per cent., earnings <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> had increased by 25 per cent., and total wages had increased by 53 per cent. The Prime Minister spoke about the lag experienced in the collection of taxes. The British and the Americans realize that in war-time they must have quick-operating taxes, such as pay-roll taxes, sales taxes and special taxes on consumption goods, which bring money in quickly. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spooner)</inline> assured this House that the Government could secure an additional £100,000,000 by means of post-war credits. I say emphatically that the Government is running a grave risk in refusing to introduce a system that has been extremely successful in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>I have dealt with taxation, so I now turn my attention to Labour's pathway through the great open spaces - the policy of voluntary Joans. On the eve of the Japanese attack last year, I criticized the Chifley budget on the ground that it was primarily a voluntary budget. It proposed to raise £138,000,000 of new money by voluntary means, and only £22,000,000 by compulsion. I forecast that the success of that budget would depend on whether or not Japan attacked us. I said that, if war came in the Pacific, and that if our coastal cities were bombed, half of the people who were asleep would be ready not only to lend but even to give their shirts to the Government. This Government knows only too well that my forecast was over-optimistic as regards finance. Japan did attack, only five weeks after I spoke; but, in spite of the appalling danger and in spite of the infinitely greater need, this Government did not make the voluntary system a success. Although it made frequent appeals for loans and subscriptions to war savings certificates, it secured only £130,000,000 of the £138,000,000 demanded by the first Chifley budget, and, in spite of two or three very big increases of taxes, the Government had to release credit to an amount of £70,000,000 or £80,000,000. When we remember the desperate battle for the second Liberty Loan, the eloquent appeals of the Prime Minister, and the reduced sales of war savings certificates, we must confess that, even with Japan at our doors, the voluntary system of finance has not been successful. It is very difficult to compare the  contribu-tions  of the British people with the contributions of Australians, but the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said that, if we multiplied, sales of war savings certificates six or seven times, we should then equal the British rate of contribution. Last year in this chamber I drew attention to gambling, liquor, and other abuses which are interfering with our war savings, hut the Government has not yat faced up to this problem. For instance, it has not supported the very fine efforts that have been made by the Premier of South Australia in this connexion. The Prime Minister's decision, which  he announced last week, to continue to make  available postal and telephonic facilities for gambling, is another example of what the Americans aptly call " egg walking " - a practice indulged in when an election may be near and there maybe a danger of losing votes. </para>
                        <para>In spite of the pressing dangers of the present-day situation, and in spite of the Prime Minister's eloquent warning, we find that this budget relies mainly upon voluntary effort for an increasingly difficult task. The budget provides for the raising of the huge sum of £549,000,000 - more than half of our national income, or £78 for every man, woman andchild in Australia. Of that £78 the Government proposes to raise £42 by voluntary loans, which means that every man, woman and child, including members of our fighting forces, will be called upon this year to lend £42, or £168 for an average family of four persons. Speaking of war savings certificates, the Prime Minister said that every person must contribute at least 3s. a week; but to that 3s. must be added 13s. for voluntary loans, making 16s. for every individual, or 64s a week for a family of four persons. In spite of the many appeals made for subscriptions to the second Liberty Loan, only 191,000 people out of 3,100,000 income-earners in this country contributed, and as they contributed an average of £220 each, it is quite obvious, as has been pointed out in financial circles, that the success of the Government's loan policy still depends upon the large financial institutions, and a comparatively small number of patriotic citizens. The same criticism may be offered in respect of war savings certificates, the sales of which fell from £13,000,000 last year to £9,000,000 during the year that this Government has been in office, yet the Treasurer says cheerfully that he proposes to raise sales of war savings certificates to the British level. One must admit quite frankly and fairly that the Government's handling of the voluntary system, and its loan programme, has been a record of bad psychology and bad management. Whilst the Government has relied largely upon the voluntary system, it has done its utmost to ruin what- ever chance that system had of succeeding, by its absurd actions in freezing capital, and proposing to limit profits to 4 per cent. - a proposal which the Prime Minister, himself, admitted was unworkable and unjust. The Government has frightened the thrifty sections of the community more than they have been frightened by any government since the regime of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> T. Lang, an ex-Premier of New South Wales, and it is not obtaining the support of its own political adherents who are reaping the financial benefit. The failure of the voluntary principle in this country is very closely akin to a similar process which is going on in the United States of America.

                        <para>Whilst I make these criticisms of the voluntary system,I assure the Government that if this budget be passed, I shall do all I can as a private member, both on the platform and over the air, to help to make a " silk purse from a sow's ear ", that is, to get all the finance we possibly can under this budget. Press reports indicate that it is the opinion of American experts that Japan is preparing for a direct attack upon Australia. That opinion was also expressed by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> this afternoon, and his warning, blunt as it was, was not couched in terms that were too strong. Therefore, I believe that if Parliament does pass this budget - even with only a bare majority - we must all do our best to make the voluntary system as big a success as possible. </para>
                        <para>I turn now to my third criticism of the Government which relates to the question of rationing. With insufficient taxation and with what the Government admits may be an optimistic loan programme, the Government is placing its faith in a system of rationing as a means of reducing consumption. Here, unfortunately, the Government is mixing up the British system of rationing to save shipping and to increase the output of munitions, with a very cumbersome monetary policy aimed at reducing consumption, which could be accomplished  much more effectively, simply, and rapidly, by direct methods. Owing to the shortage of certain commodities rationing is necessary, and it should be fairly simple to cover essential goods,  Rationing  to reduce consuming-power litis certain advantages of social justice, it is true, but the same result could be achieved with equal justice by a properly graded system of income tax and post-war credits. Professor Giblin summed up the matter when he made the following statement in the course of evidence given before the Joint Committee on Profits: - </para>

                        <para class="block">Honorable members will admit that' that was a good prophecy of the Mother's Day muddle. Professor Isles, of the University of Adelaide, exposes the fallacies of rationing from another viewpoint. He is a very practical man who was brought back to Australia hy the University of Adelaide because of the services which he had been rendering to the British Government in relation to the re-establishment of depressed industry. I am afraid that when the Minister for War  Organizaton  of Industry has completed his work in this country, an expert on the restoration of depressed industry will be a very valuable asset. Recently Professor Isles published a study of rationing in South Australia which shows the weaknesses of the system. He writes as follows : - </para>

                            <para>The efforts of the Government to secure the release of the man-power necessary for the execution of the defence programme - especially the efforts of the Department of War Organization of Industry as the coordinating body - seem to be hampered by a failure to conceive the problem and the various methods by which the release of man-power from civil employments can be. effected - in their proper perspective. Rationing of consumers would be an ineffective way of dislodging the man-power required from civil occupations, and if the execution of the  programme  in South Australia, and later in other States, is riot to be seriously held up. both civil and defence industries must be deliberately rationalized and rationalized at once. </para>

                        <para>Even in its existing scope, the rationing policy of the Government - particularly in relation to the wholesale rationingis already threatening grave hardships and injustices, especially in -respect of small businesses. In that regard I speak with knowledge of South Australia, but from what I have read, it seems clear that the policy threatens to drive a great many small businesses in Victoria into a morass. </para>
                        <para>I turn now to the last and probably the strongest of my four criticisms of the budget. It is on the question of credit release. With inadequate taxation, no provision for post-war credits, and admitting also the improbability of securing the full amount sought by way of voluntary loans, the Government must fall back upon credit release at a time when that policy is apt to be particularly dangerous because the unemployed have been absorbed into industry, and civil production is on the decrease. Moreover, the Government admits tha.t it has already released £70,000,000 or £80,000,000 in the form of treasury-bills. In addition, the note issue has been increased by £32,000,000 since this Government assumed office. Already there is great discontent and alarm at the rising prices in this country. Our prices have now risen 18 per cent, since the outbreak of war, and it is interesting to note that in the United States of America prices have risen 17 per cent, a fact which is causing considerable anxiety. Americans estimate that their price rise, which is about equal to ours, constitutes a tax of approximately 9 per cent, to 15 per cent, on lower incomes. Another effect ha3 been a considerable depreciation of the capital that people on smaller incomes have invested in life assurance policies and deposits in savings banks. In the words of the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> of 29th July last - ls this the kind of taxation we want now? If we do not, then we had better settle down seriously to a taxation programme designed to remove excess purchasing-power in an equitable manner, before inflation devours that excess purchasing-power in a manner without any fairness and beyond any one's control. </para>
                        <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Yale Review</inline> which, as I have said, is one of the most reliable papers in the United States of America, makes this statement in its last summer number - </para>

                            <para>The factors operating in the present situation, which threatens serious inflation, are much more clearly visible than is usually the case. At the present time, mainly because of the growth of war expenditure by borrowing, the money incomes of the civilian population are increasing while the production of civilian goods on which those incomes can be spent, is decreasing. This excess of civilian spendingpower must in one way or another be tapped by direct controls; otherwise the possibilities of inflation will be unlimited. </para>

                        <para>The comparison with Australia is excellent. So far both countries -have been able to release credit to enable idle factories and unemployed persons to undertake war work, but clearly the situation is changing dangerously. Unfortunately, our leader laughs at inflation whereas the  President  of the United States of America has found that the inflationary measures which were adopted, in that country after the great depression ten years ago brought the United States of America out of its difficulties far more slowly than was the case with our system of combining deflation and inflation by what was known as the Premiers plan. To quote the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times,</inline> the  President lias taken "  command  of the fight against inflation " and is battling against a politically-minded Congress  to  save the country from the dangers into which this country is rushing. I do not condemn a policy of credit release in all circumstances, for there may be circumstances in which that policy would be valuable and safe;  but J  believe that in both the United States of America and Australia at present government policy may be creating grave difficulties both for the war period and  the  subsequent reconstruction period. The following observations of the <inline font-style="italic">American Economic lie-view</inline> of last June apply to both countries: - </para>

                            <para>The tax revenue contemplated in the January budget message should be increased significantly if inflation is to be avoided. Price control and rationing are inadequate substitutes for anti-inflationary fiscal policies. Direct controls can be expected to forestall inflation only if the pressure against which they have to operate is held within rather narrow limits, and, only  in  this event, can we hope that the task of post-war construction will not be seriously aggravated by the aftermath of war finance. </para>

                        <para class="block">As honorable gentlemen opposite do not appear to be happy in listening to these remarks, I shall not speak at much greater length. I recognize the difficulties of the Government. I also recognize that, in relation to such contentious subjects as credit release, there is room for a variety of opinions, and for considerable doubts, concerning ultimate results; but weighing the matter in the light of the overseas evidence and experience, I consider that this second Chifley budget is unworthy of our danger, unworthy of the austerity campaign, unworthy of the exhortations of the Prime Minister that we should strip ourselves to the stark level of subsistence, and certainly unworthy of the financial sacrifices which our British cousins are making, not only for themselves, but also for us. I wonder what the historian will say of this budget when the war clouds roll away, when the tumult and shouting dies, and when the reek of party politics subsides. I think that he may say that in the supreme crisis of our history, the Curtin Government ran true to Australian traditions and tried to get easy money by an immense gamble - by staking the financial stability of the  country on a voluntary effort. If that gamble succeeds the historian will no doubt pen glowing sentences to the effect that the people of Australia rose to the occasion and justified democracy by their patriotism and unselfishness. I hope it may be so. But if the gamble fails, I fear that that historian may pen a sad condemnation of the weakness and lack of financial leadership of the Curtin Government. He may well write an epitaph in the glorious words of Milton - </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Price)</inline> observed towards the close of his speech that the Opposition did not appear to be happy listening to him. I ask who could be happy listening to such doleful prognostications? Against the honorable member Hanrahan was a mere circumstance. The honorable gentleman reminds me of that notable character, Peter Doody, in the <inline font-style="italic">Arcadians,</inline> who tells a story of going to see a friend who was desperately ill. He stood by his friend's bedside and remarked, "Well, Bill, they tells me you're not long for this world. I have come round to cheer you up, hut I was  thinkin'  as I was a' com iii' up them stairs what an  awk'ard  place it would bo to get a  corfin  out ". I have never heard the honorable, member say anything good about any budget. He could not even say anything good about the budget introduced by the government he supported. The one saving grace about the honorable gentleman's speech was that after he had prophesied that the budget would be a dismal failure in achieving its declared intention of providing funds for carrying the war to a successful issue, he undertook to do everything possible on the public platform in order to make the Government's proposals a success. In that respect, the honorable gentleman tried to redeem himself, but if he had had a genuine desire to promote the success of the budget, he would have expressed some faith in the people of Australia to do the things that the Government desired them to do. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>It is true that, as a nation, we are passing into more difficult times. Our war expenditure last year was £319,000,000, which was £98,000,000 more than the estimate. It is possible that the estimated expenditure on the war this year will be exceeded, as it was exceeded last year, but no member of the Government or of the Opposition can say from day to day just what we shall have to meet. Certainly, we cannot look forward twelve months with any degree of assurance. The Government proposes this year to raise £205,000,000 in taxation from all sources as against £179,000,000 last year. The estimated expenditure for 1941-42 was £421,000,000, of which £320,000,000 was required for . war purposes, and £101,000,000 for other purposes. The estimated expenditure for this year is £549,000,000, although, as I say, no one can predict with any degree of accuracy what amount is likely to be required. The estimate provides for an increase of £12S,000,000 over the expenditure of last year. A deficiency of £211,000,000 between the estimated revenue and expenditure had to be financed last year from loan, and the Government succeeded in achieving that task. As even honorable gentlemen opposite have admitted that this year the people possess a greatly increased spending power, and are making greater savings than last year, it should not be beyond the bounds of reason to expect that the gap of £300,000,000 in the budget may be met from the sources suggested by the Treasurer, seeing that £211,000,000 was obtained from those sources last year. A good deal has been said about this gap of £300,000,000 between the estimated revenue from taxation and the estimated expenditure. All manner of ways of bridging the gap have been suggested. The right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> took the Treasurer to task because he said that as £120,000,000 had been raised from loan last year, we could, by doubling our effort, raise £240,000,000 this year from that source. The right honorable gentleman commended the Treasurer on his impeccable arithmetic, but observed that even the £240,000,000 would be £60,000,000 short of the requirements. </para>
                        <para>But I ask honorable members to consider what would have happened if the financial advice given by the Opposition last year had been accepted. Honorable gentlemen opposite proposed a plan that is referred to as post-war credits or compulsory loans for bridging the gap. It was suggested  that  £20,000.000 could be obtained from individuals and £5,000,000 from companies by compulsory loans, which would have given us a total of £25,000,000. But how far would that have gone to meet the need ? As a matter of fact, this new panacea for our financial ills would have got us only a very little distance towards our goal. How then, could the Fadden plan assist, to any great degree, to bridge the gap of £300,000,000 that has to be bridged this year? It has been the practice of Opposition members, from time to time, to make invidious comparisons between the tax burdens of the people of Great Britain and those of Australia. Honorable members opposite say that by putting the uniform tax scheme and the post-war credits scheme into operation simultaneously, the deficit could be immediately eliminated. What are the facts? I propose to place before honorable members some figures showing the taxes paid by citizens of Great Britain under a combined tax and post-war credits plan and the taxes paid by the people of Australia under the uniform tax plan <inline font-style="italic">oi.</inline> this Government. If honorable gentlemen study these figures, Chey will at once realize why the Opposition is anxious for the British scheme to be applied to Australia. The reason is, of course, that the British scheme would swat the poorer man in Australia just as it has done in Great Britain - </para>

                        <para class="block">Under the conservative Government of Great Britain, the whole scheme of taxation differs from that of the Labour Government of Australia in that the imposition on the lower ranges of income is less in Australia than in Great Britain, but on the higher ranges it is infinitely greater. Honorable members opposite overlook that if post-Avar credits were superimposed on the existing uniform taxation of Australia to equalize the taxes paid in Britain in the various ranges of income, the additional amount raised would be not more than £45,000,000. How much farther would that take us towards the bridging of the gap of £300,000,000? </para>
                        <para>It ha3 been said that the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spooner)</inline> has in mind another scheme under which he could raise £100,000,000. It is a wonder to me that he did not place it before the Fadden Government. Although he was a Minister in that Government, he allowed that government to submit to Parliament a plan for the raising of £25.000,000, upon which it was defeated, while having in his mind a plan under which he estimates that. £10,000,000 could be raised without batting an eyelid. </para>
                        <para>If we were to equalize our taxation with that of Great Britain, an additional £45,000,000 would be raised. If we were to apply the British rating principle of adding post-war credits to the taxation imposed, we would raise only an additional £30,000,000. Under the Fadden plan, £25,000,000 would have been raised. Under a scheme providing for taxation equal to that of Great Britain, the gap would still be £255,000,000. The adoption of the British rate of post-war credit would leave the gap at £270,000,000; and the adoption of the Fadden plan of last year would leave it at £275,000,000. Therefore, all these proposals merely amount to utterly futile criticism of a Government that is doing a better job for Australia than the sponsors of such proposals were capable of doing. </para>
                        <para>There is another scheme which has always been a pet subject of honorable members opposite. By some means, they have discovered that a section of the Australian community is untaxed. The aggregate annual income of that group is, they say, £550,000,000. They do not say how many millions of persons exist on that sum. They do not bother to let it be known that, the average income of that group is less than £3 a week. Yet they are continually hammering the Government because it will not seek to bridge the gap by imposing taxation on those people! </para>
                        <para>We have been told that post-war credits would provide a very useful nest-egg that could be redeemed after the war. The view that I offer is that the people would discover it to be an addled egg. Let us picture the post-war position. I wonder whether honorable members opposite try to look so far forward! In my opinion, they are so short-sighted that they take the toes of their shoes for the horizon. </para>

                                <para>- I am facing up to the fact that at present we have 500,000 persons in the munitions industry, and that it is proposed to transfer to that industry an additional 300,000 persons, which 'will make a total of 800,000 persons who will be engaged in that occupation until the war ' finishes, if the number be not increased. There are approximately 500,000 men and women in our defence forces. Therefore, on the day on which war finishes there will be a total of 1,300,000 persons out of work. War production is maintained at the highest peak attainable in order to meet the demands of the times; it does not taper off towards the requirements of peace-time. By that, I mean that the day on which peace is signed production will be at -its maximum, and there will be no tapering off before peace arrives. Consequently, when peace has been declared, the whole of those people will be engaged exclusively on the production of munitions, and in the fighting services. If honorable members can tell me what munitions will be required on the day after peace has been declared, I shall agree that there is some prospect of a continuance of employment for them. It is true that for a period of twelve months after the termination of the war we shall be engaged on the repatriation of the men and women now in the fighting services. There will be some easement in that direction; but I submit that it will be more imaginary than real. On the day on which war terminates, civil production will be at its lowest ebb; because day after day avenues of civil production are being converted into avenues of war production. Therefore, planning for the post-war period ought to be undertaken now. I disagreed with the last Government, and I disagree with the present Government, in this respect, that instead of completely eliminating civil industries at least, a skeleton staff ought to be left to maintain them as going concerns. All of those industries that are closed owing to war necessities will not spring up like a mushroom so soon as peace has been declared. That position has to be faced. There will be what is known as a transition period, in which there will be a great deal of suffering in this country. The Opposition has said that in that period when unemployment will be at its maximum, post-war credits would be a useful nest-egg. How, exactly, would they be paid? In the year prior to the termination of the war, the people will be making large incomes. The cry at present is that many people are making much more than they ever made previously. But in the first year of the peace, hundreds of thousands of them will be without employment. How could they meet their taxation assessments on the incomes they had earned in the previous year ? Unless they could meet them in the first post-war year, where would the money be obtained with which to repay the post-war credits? </para>

                                <para>- Where would the people get the money with which to pa the instalments? I am pointing out that in that post-war year hundreds of thousands of persons will be without income, and will consequently be unable to discharge their taxation assessments either in a lump sum or by instalments. The financial system as a whole may be likened to a dog chasing its tail. The more the people are taxed, obviously the less they have to lend. When the last budget was presented, I predicted that the raising of loans in future years would become more difficult. I believe that to be correct. The more people you drive out of tax-paying private industry into public institutions that are not taxpaying, the heavier will be the burden of any Treasurer to make ends meet. I believe that that was one of the thoughts that prompted the Government to stabilize taxation this year at last year's figure, and to rely on the success of borrowing. If loans fail, it will be impossible to raise by taxation the whole of the amount that is needed, and the Government will have to resort to an increase of bank credit or " tax and bust " in the process of trying to make ends meet. Professors and their followers consider that the time is never opportune to do anything. To-day, when wealth is flowing freely throughout the land, and every body is making big wages or profits, the honorable member for Boothby says that this is not the time for inflation, because the people who were unemployed are working. I recall that in 1930, when one-half of the population was starving on the dole and the remainder was hanging to their jobs "  by  the skin of their teeth ", the professors told us that the time was not opportune for inflation ; that what was wanted was " reflation ". We heard a most remarkable analysis of the position to-night by the honorable member for Boothby. He referred to a period of " reflation ", which I understood to mean something between deflation and inflation. He told us that it was a combination of inflation and deflation once know as the "Premiers plan". What is the appropriate time for an increased amount of bank credit to be made available to the community? This, we are told, should not be done during a depression, because then there are too many unemployed. Nor should it be done during times like the present, because now there are not sufficient unemployed ! I believe that the Government will be forced, and, if honorable members opposite were on this side, they too would be forced, to use an increased amount of bank credit as the  solu-  tion of the financial problems of the country. We are looking hopefully to the people to subscribe to the war loans, in order to bridge the financial gap, and we have adopted the slogan "austerity". I have not much faith in slogans. Ten years or more' ago, a similar slogan was adopted during the depression then experienced, when half of the population was on the dole and the other half was hanging on " by the skin of their teeth " to whatever jobs they had. A different kind of austerity was preached to us then by the professors. They then said that the workers were spending too much, although half of them had nothing to spend. It was said that it would be necessary to adopt the hybrid scheme about which the honorable member for Boothby talks, and it was decided to adopt the " Premiers plan ". As the workers were thought to be spending too much, it was decided to reduce their wages by 20 per cent., and to reduce invalid and old-age pensions by 12-J- per cent. The policy in the last depression was to preach austerity to people who were already compelled by circumstances to be austere. As the workers are now earning good wages, they are now told that they are getting too much, and ni,us therefore practice austerity. I desire to know when the workers will receive a fair deal. </para>

                        <para>For twelve months I was a member of the Man Power and. Resources Survey Committee, in which capacity I travelled throughout Australia. I obtained a wealth of knowledge for myself and tried to impart it to others, but the reports of the committee have been pigeon-holed. If austerity were practised in the expenditure of government funds on the war effort, if there were less expenditure on elaborate establishments for people engaged in the war effort, and for which the Government will never be paid, if less elaborate furnishings were provided for the departments set up from time to time, and if exploitation of the Government under the cost-plus system were prevented, austerity would be practised in the proper way. If we had austerity in the expenditure of government funds austerity would not be necessary at the other end of the scale. The only alternative left to the Government is to resort to the use of bank credit. The Government hopes to raise £300,000,000 by means of loans. I wish the Government well, but I shall not preach austerity to the workers in my electorate, half of whom were starving during the last depression. In one part of my electorate I saw a factory being built of elaborate brickwork which, when equipped, will cost £250,000, whilst on the opposite side of the street were the slums. How can I tell the people who have been compelled to live in those slums to be austere, when elaborate buildings for which the Government will never be paid are being erected? I should prefer to go out of public life rather than tell those people to be austere. The bogy of inflation has been raised. The workers may have more money at present, but there are fewer goods on which they can spend it. It is also true that when the supply of goods is short and money is plentiful, prices rise, but that could be prevented by government action. The right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> warned me that my electors would be looking for me later, when the effects of inflation were being felt and they were crying out f ot food. The right honorable gentleman may talk about ray electors crying out for food, but Australia is crying out for scrap iron to-day, although when he was in power a great deal of it was sent out of the country. If the people were asked to choose between .those who would provide them with food and those who supplied war material to the enemy, I know. whom they would prefer. </para>
                        <para>I have spoken on the man-power problem until I am sick and tired of it, yet the fact remains that there is too much divided authority in Australia to-day with regard to this matter. There is no central guidance or direction. Take first the Army. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> recently stated that extra men are being called up daily, until the number of men considered necessary by the military advisers has beeen  secured. So far as the Minister is concerned, we have not a central authority giving instructions as to how many men shall be called up, but as many men a3 the military authorities require, irrespective of the needs of other sections of the community, are to be provided. In the Navy and the Air Force we have voluntary enlistment, but a demand is still being made on the man-power resources without regard to the needs of the other services and industry. The Prime Minister stated recently that if it came to a choice between well-trained soldiers and " tucker ", we should have to go without " tucker ". Of course, the Prime Minister is entitled to express that view. </para>

                                <para>- I accept that correction, but I think that the implication, remains. If it comes to a choice between a shortage of men or a shortage of " tucker ", the Prime Minister  would  leave the people short of " tucker".. The first question is whether the men being called up are being, or can be, properly equipped, and whether they are being properly trained. I seriously question whether they are. If we have not thu things with which to equip them properly, they would be better engaged in the manufacture of munitions, or in providing foodstuffs for the people. Are we to allow the Army to call the tune and say how many men are to be called up, without regard to the requirements of the community? If so, the time will come when both soldiers and civilians will be without " tucker ". Therefore, I do not consider that the choice is between soldier* and " tucker ". The choice is between a properly-controlled system for the utilization of man-power and the present haphazard method under which various authorities that have been set up grab men right and left, without regard to the requirements of other sections of the community. </para>

                        <para>I have already said that- austerity should be practised in government departments. I have attacked the Allied Works Council, and I have been castigated for it, but every opinion that I have expressed can be substantiated. I said that men were being taken off the graving dock in hundreds, and that the dock was an essential piece of work. Nobody will deny that, with the prospect of increased  naval warfare in the south-west Pacific, the clocking facilities in Australia are inadequate, and that the work of erecting the graving dock should be regarded as one of first priority. The ministerial reply is that the dock is now under the control of the Allied Works Council. lc has been under the control of that body for a very short period, but that does not alter the fact that men are being taken from that, work, which ought to have first priority. I criticized the methods of book-keeping, and the distribution of vouchers, and I have proof in my pocket that vouchers were given to the wives of men who were not even entitled to be called up by the Allied Works Council. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> replied to my criticism as follows :  - i </para>
                        <para>In the House of Representatives recently, the honorable member for Dalley declared that the Allied Works Council was interfering with the work of important government  undertakings  in New South Wales, that it had taken mcn off work at the graving dock, and had seriously upset the staffing position there. In making this charge, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rosevear</inline> was obviously unaware of the facts. First, the graving dock is a job which comes entirely under the control of the Allied Works Council. Therefore, the council can scarcely be accused of  interfering with its own job ". Secondly, the decision to take certain men away was made by the service chiefs, who instructed the Allied Works Council that a number of men were required for certain works which were regarded as of even higher priority than the graving dock. The service chiefs indicated that, if necessary, to secure the numbers required, men should be taken off the graving dock. Naturally, some interference with the work of the dock occurred as a result. Work was  not, however, stopped in any section, and  action  to restore the former position us promptly as possible was taken immediately. </para>
                        <para class="block">Of course, when from 200 to 300 .men were taken off the job, there was interfer  ence  with the work. </para>

                            <para>The honorable member for Dalley also stated that a lax book-keeping system was endangering government funds. He alleged that vouchers entitling wives of members of the Civil Construction Corps to £6 <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> fortnight were being distributed ti&gt; dependants of persons who were not members nf the Civil Construction Corps. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That  is not  correct. I have before me a \oncher which  was  sent  to  a woman whose husband  was  not a member of the' Civil Constructional Corps, was not associated with the Allied Works Council, and was not even eligible to be called up for work under that body. As to the wastage of manpower, I cite the case of a man who was instructed by the Allied Works Director to remain in Sydney on his present job.  His  wife was given one of those vouchers which in certain circumstances would entitle her to £6 a fortnight. That man has part of his wages paid by the Maritime Services Board, while £6 a fortnight is paid by the Allied Works Council, and. I understand that this applies to thousands of other men working in and around Sydney. I can understand the payment of an allowance to a man's wife if he is with the fighting forces, or if he is sent to work in another part of the country, but I cannot see why a man who has been told to stay in his job in Sydney should have part of his wages paid by the Maritime Services Board, and the rest paid by the Allied Works Council. Why should the men working for the Allied Works Council be paid by two separate authorities in this way ? If that is not a shameful waste of man-power I do not know what is. I said, further, that men had been called up and sent to distant places where they were engaged upon work for which they were unfitted, and that they were not in physical condition to stand the rigours of the climate. The Minister replied to this charge as follows : - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The honorable member for Dalley .further complained that men called up would not be capable of standing up to hard work under the conditions of a summer in north Australia. In this connexion, I know that particular care has been taken, in sending men to Queensland, to send only those men who have regularly been engaged on work of a nature similar to that on which they will be employed when they go north. We have not sent any men who have been called up from other occupations, and it is a fair assumption that nien who, over a long period, have been engaged either as plant operators or labourers, without physical ill effects becoming apparent, should be considered at such a critical time as the present, to be capable of continuing to perform this work, even in the north, for a period of three months. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>There is no mistaking what the Minister meant. He meant that the men who are sent to the north are always put on work similar to that on which they had been previously engaged. As a matter of fact. I have made representations on behalf of three men who, up to the time of their  being called up, had been commercial travellers, and 1 should be very surprise.! if the Minister could prove to me thai they are now being employed upon work similar to their ordinary occupation. Here is a letter which I received to-day from one of my constituents -  1 appeal to you to continue your justified attack on the Allied Works Council as I have just had the experience of being humiliated at their Pitt-street office. 1 have been in business in one of Sydney's suburbs for the past seventeen years, and am now 53 years of agc and in response to a notice from the Civil Constructional office in Pitt-street called the other day at 9.30 a.m., and after being handed on from one official to another, and finally to a doctor, who by the way, took my blood pressure only, was directed to report at 8 a.m. the next day to the graving dock (very aptly named), and on reporting was handed a pick and shovel to do my war effort. I will not bore you with the details of my effort, suffice to say that I hardly did any work, and am lead to believe that  1  am to bc paid at the rate of £1 a day for such work, which I can assure you, was 19s. (id. wasted by some one. My main reason for writing is not to complain of such generosity, lint to give you a list of names of men I saw in the Pitt-street office, and leave it to you to confirm same. After what I saw, is it any wonder the office cannot run any industrial undertaking? </para>
                        <para class="block">That letter provides further evidence that men are not properly examined before being sent away to jobs, and that they are being put on work to which they have not been accustomed. The Minister confirms my accusation that men are torn away from their families after beinggiven only 48 hours' notice to report at Central Railway- Station. Indeed, I understand that in Victoria, they are sometimes given only 24 hours' notice. The Minister stated that special magistrates had been appointed, and that apparently I knew nothing of it. As a matter of fact, I did know about it, though the fact is that they have been appointed only recently. When one of my clients was presenting his case, the appeals officer was none other than the famous Peter Cruise. Referring to my charges, the Minister said that their gravity lay in their utter irresponsibility, and not in their substance. Two nights after I made my speech on the subject of the Allied Works Council, the Sydney Trades and Labour Council passed a resolution demanding an investigation into the operations of the council. Are we to understand from the Minister's statement that all the members of the Trades and Labour Council have gone berserk, and are to be regarded as irresponsible ( Are we to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> blakeley went berserk and was irresponsible when he found it impossible to work with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> and Lieutenant Packer i Does the Minister wish us to believe that- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reginald</inline> Windsor, a man well known and respected in the Public Service, was irresponsible because he could no longer continue to work in the Sydney office?

                            <para>Another form of criticism is directed against camp conditions of members of the Civil Constructional Corps. In recent weeks, severe criticism of so-called " Stone Age " condition.at Koto Camp received much publicity. I have investigated this case very thoroughly. The outcry undoubtedly originated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> F. Thomas, general secretary, Australian Builders Labourers Federation, who declared that most meat was inadequate, frequently fly-blown, vegetables scarce, bread mouldy, cookhouse insanitary, sleeping quarters most unsatisfactory, sanitary arrangements disgraceful, recreation-room unsuitable, washing facilities inadequate, first-aid supplies unsatisfactory. Notice that all the facilities exist - the criticism generally being that they are not good enough. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> is paid for  that  sort of thing. Naturally, he will discover and magnify any flaws which he can. I know thai the camps are not perfect, but I also know that they  aTe  as good as they can be made under the circumstances. Much of the work  to be done by the Civil Constructional Corps is of a very urgent nature.There is no time to build elaborate permanent camps, but the camps which are built compare veryfavorably indeed with the type of construction camp accepted in pre-war days. The men themselves appreciate the difficulties, and accept them cheerfully and patriotically. The men on the job rarely complain. It is only the outsider who comes looking for trouble who makes a fuss. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> made a violent outburst against conditions atRoto Camp on the 27th August. On the 31st August a mass meeting of the men expressed resentment of the recent press criticism, and resolved unanimously to write to the Allied Works Council expressing complete satisfaction at the council's efforts to adjust difficulties and provide comforts for the men. The men themselves went so far as to repudiate certain of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas's</inline> demands, stating that they preferred the arrangements previously existing. The tactics employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> can do little good, but they are capable of doing a very great deal of damage by destroying harmonious relations between the men and those officers responsible for their welfare. </para>

At the meeting he contented himself with repudiating the statements which he had previously made, and which have been recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I have a copy here, and I propose to see that there is no sub-editing of them - </para>

If the Minister wants the names of these persons associated with the council, and something of their reputations, my correspondent can supply the information. In his letter he states that one of them was a startingprice bookmaker, who called himself a turf commissioner. He now holds a responsible position. Another was a friend of the one to whom I have just referred. He is an ex-bookmaker, and is now a professional punter. Another is a notorious North Sydney startingprice bookmaker, who still operates the largest starting-price office on the North Shore. Another is a bookmaker who operates at dog meetings because he lost his licence to bet at horse races for failing to meet his liabilities. There is also another bookmaker who operates at dog races who has not been allowed on any race course for fifteen years. He is a noted " urger " who is well known to the police and racecourse detectives. Those are a few who have sheltered there, and are bringing the name of the Government and of the Labour party into disrepute. The sooner these people are dealt with the better it will be for the country. I can substantiate all the statements that I have made, with the exception of the contents of that letter. I have not mentioned names for two reasons : first, I have no desire to give to these people an advertisement, and, secondly, I have no desire to use names improperly. I shall, however, give the information to the Minister, and shall demand that the whole position be cleared up. </para>

                            <para>.- I listened with interest to the speech of the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> who correctly described himself as a candid critic, for he spent half his time criticizing the Opposition and the other half criticizing the Government. He had " a bit both ways ". Although he dealt with certain financial aspects of the budget and criticized both the Opposition and the Government in this connexion, he did not make any suggestion as to how the money required could be raised otherwise, except by some fantastic means. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>My main concern in considering the budget is whether it represents the maximum war effort of which this country is capable. The position confronting Australia bo-day is so desperate that the only limitation of our war effort should be the physical capacity of the nation. !No objection is likely to be taken by this Parliament, or by the people, to the war expenditure provided for in the budget, the only question being what is the best and most equitable means of raising the colossal sum required. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> spoke truly when he said that the budget is too much of a gamble, because it leaves so much to chance. The budget reveals a gap of £300,000,000 which has to be bridged. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> says - and last year's experience supports his prediction - (that the amount may be increased before the end of the year. "We may find ourselves called upon to raise even £400,000,000. The Government proposes to raise that huge sum on a voluntary basis! I submit that that is an unsound financial policy, as it leans too much on central bank credit. It is interesting to note the degree to which we have relied on this method of finance since the outbreak of war. In June, 1939, the total treasury bills issued were valued at £60,000,000; at the end of June, 1942, their value was £138,000,000. That increase of £78,000,000 took place last year, and it is clear that, unless some definite arrangement is made, the experience of last year will be repeated this year, only to a greater degree. As I have said, the gap of £300,000,000 indicated by the Treasurer is likely to be as much as £400,000,000 before the end of the financial year. In his speech the Treasurer drew attention to the danger of inflation through too great use of central bank credit, but some honorable members opposite believe that only by the use of such credit will it be 'possible to finance the war and conduct the affairs of the country. Some time ago the Premier of one of the Canadian Provinces asked his treasury officials to investigate a certain system of social credit. After a thorough examination they reported that if the scheme worked, no one else would work. I liken central bank credit to fire and water, which, while being good servants, are hard masters. </para>

                                <para>- At the moment, 1 am dealing with the Australian budget. It must be obvious to any person who takes more than a passing interest in our financial affairs that undue reliance on new credit at a time like this, when the goods and services available are  conisderably  reduced, constitutes a grave danger and must result in inflation. Those are my words, but the Treasurer says the same thing in different language in his budget speech. </para>

                        <para>In addition to the £7S,000,000 of central bank credit last year, the note issue during the same period increased by £30,000,000. As I believe that this method of finance will play an important part in connexion with the war, I am of the opinion that the note issue should come more directly under the control of the Parliament. The Commonwealth Bank Act, which provides for the note issue, requires the Commonwealth Bank Board to submit a report on the note issue to the Treasurer from time to time. I suggest that the board should be required to submit a report to the Parliament also at least once a quarter. I hope that the Treasurer will take that suggestion into consideration. </para>
                        <para>If borrowing is to bc a major factor in financing the war, it should be done on a compulsory basis. There are ample funds available to meet the demands of the Government, but those funds need proper mobilizing. A compulsory system would distribute the burden more equitably. Some persons in the community contribute to war loans to the point of sacrifice, even going- so far as to borrow money for <inline font-style="italic">&lt;the</inline> purpose, whilst others make no response at all. Persons on the lower ranges of salaries should contribute something, but under present conditions  many who are in a position to contribute fail to do so. The Government should require all sections of the community to contribute according to their ability. If we are to rely on loans to any considerable degree for the financing of the war, we should resort to compulsion. </para>
                        <para>One pleasing feature of this year's war expenditure is that, for the most part, the money will be expended in Australia. The problem of financing the war would certainly have been more difficult had we not organized our industries so that it is now possible to manufacture in Australia many things which before the war were imported. The war will make the people of this country more self-reliant. f shall not deal at length with the financial position of this country, as the ground has already been well covered by other speakers. I shall merely say that, in my opinion, the Government is relying too much on voluntary contributions by the people. If we are to keep our finances in a sound position, a system of compulsory loans must be introduced immediately. </para>
                        <para>There is urgent need for a thorough overhaul of our taxation laws. It is true that in future there is to be uniformity throughout the Commonwealth in relation to income tax, but that fact makes an overhaul of the whole system of taxation the more necessary, because many of the provisions now in force were framed to meet a position when both the Commonwealth and the States imposed income tax. It is not enough bo have uniformity as between States; there must be equity as between individuals. Under existing conditions, some taxpayers are called upon to bear a heavy burden, whilst others escape lightly. Moreover, there are instances of double taxation. 1 draw attention to the heavy taxes levied on private companies which, for the most part, are owned and controlled by two or three persons engaged in a business undertaking. The application of the undistributed profits tax operates harshly against private companies, as the tax may absorb the whole of the profits and cause financial embarrassment to the company because of its inability to create reserves. I have previously cited instances of private companies which have paid in taxes more than their net profit for a year. The object of taxing the whole of the undistributed profits of a private company is that, should the company not declare a dividend and distribute money to shareholders, it would be placed on the same footing as a partnership; but I point out that a private company has to pay a flat rate of 6s. in the £1 whilst profits in the hands of shareholders are taxed at the property rate. For taxation purposes, private companies should be placed on exactly- the same basis as partnerships. I trust that the Government will be able to see its way clear, at an early date, to make a thorough overhaul of our present taxation laws, because many of the existing provisions were framed to meet the dual position of Commonwealth and State government acts. </para>
                        <para>I now direct attention to an absurdity which strains unduly our already overtaxed transport system. In Brisbane, goods from New South Wales .and Victoria have been unloaded from a ship, which then proceeds to load exactly the same class of goods for consignees in the southern States. This ridiculous condition of affairs imposes an unjustified strain upon shipping space, and causes an unnecessary employment of labour. The Minister should discuss with the Central Cargo Control Committee the problem of this wasteful interstate traffic. </para>
                        <para>As Queensland had been regarded as vulnerable to enemy attack, and therefore unsuitable for the establishment of munitions plants, I have urged that the factories in that State should concentrate on the manufacture of essential goods. Unfortunately, no organized action was taken, with the result that many essential commodities, which could be made in Queensland, are being imported from the southern States. If factories in Queensland were given this work, it would relieve the strain upon the transport system. </para>
                        <para>I shall now briefly discuss several items in the Estimates, because I know from experience that, when the general debate has concluded, the Estimates will be passed quickly, and honorable members will have little opportunity to discuss them. The vote in respect of national fitness has been increased from  £18,000 last year to £72,000 for the current financial year. Although I do not object to this expenditure, I suggest that Parliament should obtain a report of the activities of this organization, so that honorable members will have an opportunity of assessing its worth. I should also like some information about the Commonwealth Grants Commission, the annual vote for which has been increased from £5,000 to £7,000. I cannot understand why, at this stage, expenditure upon the commission should be increased by nearly 50 per cent., and I am wondering whether its functions have been extended. </para>
                        <para>I take this opportunity to urge the necessity for greater co-ordination between Commonwealth and State departments regarding certain activities. For example, each State publishes a <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Booh,</inline> and a good deal of the information contained in the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is to be found in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book.</inline> The Government should consider the advisability of abolishing this duplication by  co-ordinating  this statistical data. Instead of publishing seven <inline font-style="italic">Year-Books</inline> annually, the Commonwealth and States should arrange for the Commonwealth Government to undertake the work. That would save man-power, and reduce the cost of printing. </para>

                                <para>- I am pleased to hear it. Economies could be effected in many other directions. For example, the Government should overhaul the various departments which, in many instances, are performing unnecessary work. Many of the reports which are being published could be suspended for the duration of the war. The British Government has already taken this action, and the Commonwealth Government could, with advantage, follow its example. The compilation and printing of such reports require man-.power, and the cost is considerable. Business people consider that, while the Commonwealth Government enforces the man-power regulations rigidly against their undertakings, it neglects to apply them to its departments. If a careful examination were made of the Commonwealth and State public services, man-power could be released for useful war-work. </para>

                        <para>This year, Australia will contribute £34,000 to the League of Nations. This sum is practically the same as that which the Commonwealth paid to the League of Nations before the outbreak of war. I should like to know whether the Government is. definitely committed to this payment. </para>

                                <para>- I assume that some of the work previously undertaken by the Department of Information has been transferred to the censorship section. The cost of the taxation offices has risen from £382,000, in 1941, to £1,174,000 this year. This increase is due to the introduction of the uniform income tax scheme. I should like the Treasurer to inform me the exact saving that will be made as between the Commonwealth and State governments, as the result of the Commonwealth becoming the sole income taxing authority. </para>

                                <para>- No, the Government should take over the control of liquor as a war measure. Uniform conditions throughout the Commonwealth are essential if we are to deal with the problem effectively. Under the present system of divided control, wherein State laws show a marked variation, that is not possible. The need also exists for close cooperation between the military authorities and the police. The most urgent reform is not for more legislation, but a more strict and fearless enforcement of the law. In no other walk of life would the same laxity be tolerated. The butcher, baker and grocer, who sell the necessaries of life, would bc immediately prosecuted if they traded after hours. What would be the state of our society if all our laws were broken in the manner in which the liquor laws are flouted ? </para>

                                <para>- I am urging the Commonwealth Government to take control of the liquor trade as a war measure. The present vicious system places a premium on lawlessness, because the hotelkeeper who defies the law has a distinct advantage over his competitor who is prepared to play the game. The majority of hotelkeepers prefer to have the law strictly enforced. The reduction of the quantity of liquor available will only encourage the manufacture of substitutes, which will be more dangerous than the liquor itself; and strong action must be taken to prevent the growth of this menace. However, it is necessary to do something more than place restrictions on liquor if we are to improve the morale of the troops, and I urge that a more serious effort should be made to organize a more practical scheme to interest and entertain them. The atmosphere of camp life and dark cities has a depressing effect upon young men who have been suddenly transferred into a new and strange environment. The tragedy of the present conditions is that so many of our virile young men are at a loose end, and it is imperative for us to find some way by which they will be able to utilize their leisure time to better advantage. Many parents are more concerned about these influences on their sons than they are about the dangers and perils of war. Although the problem is a most difficult one we must find some alternative, which will not only provide healthy recreation and entertainment, but also inspire a saner outlook on life. I pay a tribute to the splendid work that has been done by the YoungMen's Christian Association, the Salvation Army and various church organizations. But that is not enough. Of course, those organizations experience great difficulty in raising the funds they require for their work. Parliament should take a greater interest in this matter than it has done in the past. We cannot be content with a negative attitude on the matter. It is futile to say to these young men: "You shall not go to hotels to have a drink ". We must provide means not only to interest and entertain these men, but also to inspire them with a saner outlook on life. </para>

                                <para>- The budget makes considerable provision for a physical fitness campaign. The time has arrived when we should give serious consideration to the moral fitness of the community. This Parliament should sound a high, note on this question. No nation can be greater than the character of its men and women. I make no apology for raising this matter. I am vitally interested in it, and I know something about it from first-hand experience. I make no reflection upon the members of our armed forces. Parliament should take some responsibility in the matter. The overwhelming majority of the people agree that the liquor laws should bc strictly enforced. However, it appears that these laws have been drafted in a way that will suit another section, of the community, but are enforced in a way that will suit another section Of course, many publicans .play the game. It is only right that we should take some stand in the matter. Nobody can say that the State governments are faithfully discharging their duty in the control of the liquor traffic. At the same time, the liquor trade is legitimate. We must respect the rights of those engaged in it. I urge Parliament and the nation to face this problem squarely. If we fail to do so, we shall not deserve to exist as a nation. </para>

                            <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> early in his speech in this debate made the following statements: - </para>

                            <para>The Opposition stands for the fullest cooperation with Government in every measure which we consider will further the effective prosecution of the war. </para>
                            <para class="block">The Opposition's main objection to the budget is that it fails to recognize, and neglects to face courageously, the realities of Australia's present dire emergency. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>At that stage in the right honorable gentleman's speech, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> would have been justified in telling the right honorable member that it is hardly likely, whatever shortcomings the Opposition might claim to see in the budget, that the people of Australia will reject the Government in order to make way for a second government under the right honorable member. The Prime Minister might have told the story of Charles II. and his brother James, Duke of York. When the latter told  His  Majesty that the people were murmuring against him, Charles replied, " The people of England will never depose me to make you King ". I admit that there are imperfections in the budget; but whatever those imperfections may be, the people are not likely to accept the solution of our present problems which has been offered by the Opposition. The burden of tie Opposition's case is that the Government will not adopt the Keynes plan for compulsory loans and post-war credits. Honorable members opposite have convinced themselves, apparently with no great deal of argument, that this country is in danger of inflation, and that that will spell disaster for the community. I cannot see how there could possibly be inflation in Australia in the present circumstances, when prices are fixed, goods are rationed, capital expenditure is forbidden and wages are pegged. All that i3 necessary is that we keep the pegs down. If that be done, we cannot possibly incur inflation. For the benefit of neophytes like the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> it is not necessarily the amount of money in circulation but the velocity of that circulation that determines inflation. </para>

                                <para>- The vast majority of the people of Australia are receiving no more than the basic wage. Of course, some people may be receiving wages which seem to be extraordinarily high; but it i3 equally true that, until quite recently, many people were making extraordinarily high profits. During the regime of the Menzies and Fadden Governments, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and other big concerns were paying dividends at a rate considerably in excess of 4 per cent. As a matter of fact, the rate of dividend of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited on its paid-up capital amounted to about 20 per cent. Did not Australian Consolidated Industries Limited state in its balance-sheet a few years ago that its profits were in double figures and still increasing ? </para>

                                <para>- Yes. As the result of the investigations of the Joint 'Committee on War Expenditure, that company has been obliged to return a certain amount to the Government. That money was handed back as conscience money. Not one argument has been propounded in this debate to prove that inflation is taking place. Honorable members opposite are pandering to fear. The employment of similar tactics enabled them to snatch an electoral victory in 1931-32. The tricks now being perpetrated in this chamber by honorable members opposite were perpetrated by their party at that election. They scared the people with wild talk about the worthlessness of the German mark. Apparently, they believe that they can try the same trickery again. [ remind them, as Lincoln said : " You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time ". The majority of Australians are not likely to be fooled by this talk of inflation, which has been indulged in not only . by honorable members opposite, but also by quite a lot of people outside. These persons are warning the country against the danger of inflation; and leading articles in the same strain are being published in the capitalist press. We find that the Governor of New South Wales has also been telling the people of the danger of inflation. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline><inline font-style="italic">Morning</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 13th September reported that, when speaking at the opening of a Returned Soldiers League congress, the Governor emphasized the need for austerity, and spoke of the disastrous inflation that followed the last war. It is a gratuitous interference in politics on the part of the Governor of a State to talk of austerity and inflation in that manner. If this Government is  sincere  in all its talk about austerity, it might make a start by letting the country do without its six State Governors for the duration of the war. It could let Lord Wakehurst go back to England to do a job there instead of drawing a salary of £5,000 a year in New South Wales interfering in politics and trying to stir up opposition to the Labour party in this country. The Labour party's proposals for financing the war need no gubernatorial approval or disapproval. State governors have long since passed their period of usefulness in Australia. Forty years after federation they are a decided  anachron-  ism. The Governor of New South Wales is not helping the community, or its war effort, by making speeches of that kind. It ill behoves him and a lot of other people to talk about austerity to the working people of this country. Later, I shall have something more to say on the subject of austerity. The German mark and the Russian rouble trick has been, played too often. It is historically correct to say that both the German mark and the Russian rouble were deliberately destroyed by the then governments of Germany and Russia to suit the interests of the governments of those countries. The Russian rouble was destroyed, according to Trotsky, during a period, of war, because the Communists wanted to destroy the value of holdings of roubles outside their own country. The German Government destroyed the German mark to defeat the Versailles Treaty. At any rate, there is no analogy between the conditions that operated in those countries after their defeat in war and the condition of controlled inflation which operates in this country to-day. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. If the southern States did not repay what they had been lent by the governments of Great Britain and other countries it shows that those countries had no right to interfere in the struggle. It was unfortunate for the British Government and the British bondholders that the southern .States could not be made to pay after their defeat. I am not worried about inflation and I do not intend to worry about it, because it is merely another bogy, like the Tantanoola tiger, raised by the Opposition. The history of anti-Labour parties has been marked with these bogies. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher introduced legislation providing for the payment of a maternity allowance, members of - the old Liberal party described it as a sop to profligacy and a premium on prostitution. Everything that could be said in derogation of every social measure that this party advocated or introduced was said. </para>

                        <para>M,r. CALWELL.- They called our note issue " Fisher's flimsiest ". Yet it was that note issue which helped us to finance the last war and paid for the building of the east-west railway. It will help us to finance this war without paying interest to bondholders if we are courageous enough to use it. </para>
                        <para>Other people beside the Governor of New South Wales are telling the common people what they ought to do. A former Governor of Victoria, Lord Somers, formed Somers camp, to which he invited each year a certain number of public school boys and a certain number of youths from factories. The scheme was an imitation of one initiated by the then Duke of York - the present King. It worked all right for a number of years, but there was a plot behind it on the part of a number of people in this community who saw in it an opportunity to capture the minds of working class youths. As time passed, this organization became a little more rabid, and on the 1st June last <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. C.</inline> Gordon McAdam, described as Camp Chief, in a circular, <inline font-style="italic">Power Home,</inline> expressed the following views : - </para>

                            <para>At the moment Australia would seem to bc lacking in three great essentials - leadership, spiritual inspiration and discipline. By its own choosing our Government is not an allAustralian government but a Labour Government. It is not representative of all the people but. of a section only and that section, on the showing of the last election, a minority. Moreover, the Government cannot or will not forget that it is a Labour Government with plunks in its platform close to the heart of the Labour movement but in many cases having little or no relation to the one great question of tile hour - the winning of the war. Surely the present calls for a united effort on the part of every one! Surely contentious matters should be left to more peaceful and reasonable times. . . . Bleatings for help go forth to the United States of America, and when this help is forthcoming it is made perfectly clear that no universal trainee will bc sent out of Australia at any time to the assistance of this one of our allies or any oilier.  If  you care to volunteer to do your duty to your God and your country, that's your affair, but no one is compelled to do his duty. And many of the youth of to-day, mean, selfish and cowardly, fail to see their duty. </para>

                        <para>There is a lot of truth in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson's</inline> dictum, " Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel ". A lot of people waving the flag to-day are persons for whom the general community should have no regard at all. This man, who tries to ingratiate himself by a free use of the name of the Deity and attempts to make himself the only custodian of loyalty in this country, is beneath contempt. I instanced that as further evidence that there is a fairly widespread conspiracy against the Labour movement and the control that this Government, for good or ill, is exercising. I have said that the Government is not doing all that I should like it to do, but the people who want a change want it not so that the masses shall have better social laws, but so that the control shall revert to the people who have dominated this country for years. One would imagine that there is an inherent evil in credit expansion; that it is something that decent people speak about with bated breath and something with which no self-respecting politician would associate his name.

I shall quote what the budget papers show in regard to loan expenditure and interest. The table on page 123 shows that we borrowed £327,113,364 during the last war, have repaid £159,893,750, and on the 30th June last still owed £167,219613 in respect of that war debt. During the period in which we repaid £159,893,750  we paid  in interest at least £255,000,000. We still owe one-third of the money that we borrowed during the last war. </para>

According to the table mentioned, Commonwealth and State governmental debts, apart from municipal and semi-governmental debts, amount to the colossal sum of £1,628,S28,760. We are to borrow or obtain by release of credit an extra £300,000,000 this year. That means that at the end of this financial year we shall owe about <inline font-style="italic">£2,000,000,000.</inline> Should the war last another five years and we obtain £300,000,000 a year by credit expansion, compulsory loans or voluntary loans, on all of which interest is paid, we shall have the colossal debt of £3,500,000,000, on which we shall have to pay £100,000,000 a year in interest. At present, according to the figures shown on page 12S, we are paying £53,000,000 a year in interest. We are expending on the war £1,250,000 a day, and interest on debts incurred during the last war and this war and debts incurred for the development of this country amount to £1,000,000 a week. Where will it all end ? Five years hence, at the present rate of borrowing, our interest bill will be £2,000,000 a week. We simply shall not be able to meet it. It can end only in repudiation. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> advocates post-war credits .and likens them to deferred pay for soldiers. I believe in deferred pay for soldiers, but it is practically impossible for the community to impose compulsory loans that will have to be repaid to the community in the form of deferred Pay- </para>

                                <para>- I have already said that interest has to be paid on both. The sooner we get interest out of our minds the better it will be for every one. Credit expansion is only a system of deferred taxation. We have credit expansion. We could, if we wanted to do so, reduce our credit in the same way as we reduce our indebtedness at the rate of 10 per cent, by means of a sinking fund which is supposed to liquidate our capital liability within 70 or SO years. If the sinking fund be used for purposes other than repayment of loans, we shall never be out of difficulty. We must establish a system under which, first, we can cut out borrowing and the consequent payment of interest and, secondly, make provision for the reduction or cancellation of our credit. The honorable member for Parramatta said that we would have deferred pay. That is so much nonsense. It is plain that under the plan of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> which is that of Baron Keynes, a director of the Bank of England, we shall borrow money from ourselves, tax ourselves to pay interest on the money we have borrowed from ourselves, and then, when the money falls due a few years later, float a loan from ourselves to pay ourselves back the original loan that we borrowed from ourselves, and so reach the very happy position which can be quite simply described as taking in each other's washing and pretending that we are very busy. We simply cannot pay the interest on our total loan expenditure, and the problem will not be solved by introducing a system of compulsory, instead of voluntary, loans. </para>

                                <para>- I have never supported loan bills. I am making the best of the circumstances as I find them, and work upon the principle that the worst Labour government is better than the best United Australia party government. I am not suggesting that this is the worst of Labour governments, by any means. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Price)</inline> quoted certain figures in relation to taxation in Great Britain and this country. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> quoted what was being done in Great Britain and Australia in the matter of taxation, all to the advantage of GreatBritain. I propose to quote from a paper which is not a. Labour party paper. It has never been associated with the Labour party, nor do I suppose that it ever will be. It is called <inline font-style="italic">Jobson's Investment Digest.</inline> In an excellent series of tables, set forth in such a way that even the almost uninitiated can read quite clearly, it is shown that Australia has clone better than the United States of America, Great Britain or Canada in the matter of taxation for war expenditure. The percentage of taxation to total expen diture in the United States of America for the year 1942-43 is estimated at 39.8, in Great Britain 37.9, Canada 52.5 and Australia 53.9. It cannot be said, therefore, that we are  undertaxing  in comparison with Great Britain; as a matter of fact we are taxing at least one and a half times as much proportionately as is Great Britain, whilst we are relying less on borrowings and credit expansion than it is. An ideal system of war taxation would be, " Pay as you go, make this generation pay for its wars, because this generation helped to make the mistakes that, created them ". </para>

                        <para class="block">State a windfall, as the result of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Macpherson was able to show a surplus. He promptly did so, but instead of acknowledging that it was due to an act of God, he took all the credit to himself, claiming that the wise statesmanship of the Nationalist party had produced the credit balance, whereas it was one of those fortuitous circumstances that sometimes come the way of impecunious Treasurers. </para>
                        <para>I have some other views to offer in answer to the criticism of Australia's war effort which honorable members opposite have uttered. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> was quite laudatory concerning what he thought of the splendid effort being made by Great Britain, and condemnatory of the comparative failure of Australia's war effort. I have some interesting quotations to present to the committee concerning those matters. The honorable member told us that the war effort and the sacrifices of the British people were remarkable. I do not deny that great and heroic sacrifices have been made by the British people, but I am equally conscious of the fact that great sacrifices have been made in this country also, and that our war effort, too, is splendid. It is not complete. We cannot have a 100 per cent, war effort, an unlimited war effort, or a total war effort in this country whilst we allow production to be regulated by the profit motive. If we permit those who own the means of production, distribution and exchange to regulate production in order to make more and more profit, our war effort is damaged accordingly. But things are not altogether all right in Great Britain. I read in the press, two days after the honorable member for Indi spoke, that the Aga Khan, a very wealthy Moslem leader, had paid £8,000 for a race-horse at a horse sale in Britain, which continued for a couple of days, when many thousands of pounds changed hands in exchange for horse-flesh. That does not seem to bespeak a very strenuous war effort on the part of the people in Britain who are in. possession of a great deal of wealth ; but there is other evidence in that regard also. </para>

Many electors in my division and divisions represented by other Labour members in this Parliament have already taken part in one austerity campaign, which lasted from 1930 to 1939.

                        <para class="block">There were mem hers in this Parliament who supported the deflationary policies of the Lyons Government, which accentuated the sufferings of the Australian people. As a result of that austerity campaign which was forced on the people, borrow, suffering and semi-starvation stalked every street in the industrial portions of every city and town in Australia, and haunted every country road. That period of suffering continued right up to the outbreak of war. There was no money for developmental works, and it was only when war broke out that the then Treasurer of the Commonwealth, the Right Honorable R. G. Casey, said, " So far as war expenditure is concerned, the sky is the limit ". The policy was changed overnight, and many married and single men, who had never had a regular job for years - some of the single men had never had a regular job in their life - joined the Australian Imperial Force to get the first regular pay they had ever earned. They became economic conscripts, joining the fighting force? ro defend a grateful country that, promised never to forget them, after starving them and their children all through the depression years.

What money are they getting? "What is the soldier receiving that could justify the Government in asking his wife and children to practise austerity? Only since the war broke out have these people had a chance to live as human beings. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> said that many of his constituents will resent any suggestion that they should make more sacrifices in this period of difficulty. Many of my constituents will also resent such a proposal. Let the people at the top make the sacrifices. </para>

The debts of the wheat-growers of Australia far exceed, their assets. The farmers will never be out of debt while they have to pay interest. I am waiting with a good deal of curiosity and some anxiety to read the provisions of the Mortgage Bank Bill which the Government proposes to introduce. They will have to be very much more liberal than rumour says they will be for the bill to be acceptable to the people generally and the primary producers in particular. </para>

                        <para>Members of the Cabinet have had a good deal to say about austerity. I suggest that an example of austerity should be set by people in high places. The Government was unwise to give the wives of Ministers first priority in travelling at a time when many other people in the community were forbidden to travel interstate except under severely restrictive conditions. It also did wrong in giving members' wives priority No. 2 in interstate travel. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to be corrected by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McLeod).</inline> Those who preach austerity should practise it. .Some members of the Advisory War Council are claiming the right to the sole occupancy of sleeping compartments on interstate trains. I understand that Ministers and members of the Advisory War Council were afforded that right recently by order of the Prime Minister. Honorable gentlemen who see fit to attack coalminers in this House for not producing more coal should do their utmost to see that the coal that is produced is used properly. In my view coal is wrongfully used for the purpose of pulling an extra number of 45-ton railway carriages simply because certain individuals demand the right to the sole use of a sleeping compartment. I say to these honorable gentlemen that an ounce of practice is better than a ton of precept. Many people are only too anxious to attack our democratic institutions, including the Parliament itself, and we should not provide them with ready-made arguments. </para>

                                <para>- I would not demean myself by employing such tactics. The honorable gentleman waved the Union Jack and the Australian flag and then draped both flags around his shoulders. He also claimed for himself one of the King's titles, the Defender of the Faith. Then he proceeded to attack communism and in the course of doing so alleged certain excesses against the Russian people. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> The honorable gentleman posed as the sole champion of loyalty in this chamber.  His  cockatoos down at Lambing Flat could hardly have screeched more bathos and bunkum in a half an hour than did the honorable member while delivering his memorized speech. It was a nauseating outburst. No one owns the flag. It does not belong to any party or to any section of the people. It is something to be honoured by every member of the community and any man who will not honour it is not a good Australian. Therefore, its use for party political purposes tends to destroy the unity of the nation and to promote dissent: If we have a case on any subject let <inline font-style="italic">v</inline> advance it on reasonable grounds. Let us not descend to the trickery indulged in by the honorable member for Hume. The honorable gentleman's effort disgusted me.

                        <para>The honorable gentleman talked about a ban on communism. There is no ban on communism in this country and never has been one. The Menzies Government imposed a ban on the Communist party. If that Government considered that the Communist party was a menace to the war effort it should have been suppressed and the leaders' interned. If it was not prepared to take such drastic action it should have let the party alone. It chose, however, to adopt a middle course. It simply said : " The Communist party no longer exists; therefore it does not exist.  The  Communist party must no longer function; therefore it cannot function." But the communists continued to organize and propagate their views in their own way. They formed political rights associations. </para>

                                <para>- Many United- Australia party supporters are simpleminded people. Let me tell honorable gentlemen what happened in this case. This candidate joined the Army a few days before the poll and was discharged from it a few days afterwards; but he was proclaimed as a digger candidate. Canvassers for the United Australia party went to people whom, perhaps for some physical reason, they took to be United Australia party supporters and said : " Do not forget to vote for the digger candidate". The alleged digger candidate polled about '7,000 votes in a working-class electorate, and the Labour candidate polled only about 10,000 votes. The circumstances of that occasion are not likely to be repeated. </para>

                        <para>My point is that communism continues to be propagated. The honorable member for Hume had a good deal to say about what he called the evils of communism, but he stood behind the previous Government in the depression years and helped it to create conditions which make communists. Lenin said on one occasion that it was not possible to have a revolution without having a revolutionary situation, and it was not possible to have a revolutionary situation unless the people were made into revolutionaries by the treatment they received. Everything that the United Australia party Government d-id during the depression years was calculated to create a revolutionary spirit and therefore to propagate communism in this country. The United Australia party Government in the depression years  denied people the basie wage. That was true in every State except Queensland. In some States the workers who worked only one week in three were paid the basic wage. During the weeks when they did not receive the wage they were expected to exist, with their wives and children, in a state of semi-starvation. The wonder is not that there are so many Communists in Australia to-day, but that there are so few. Communism is not an absolutely evil thing. There are- some great truths enshrined in its doctrines. If there were not some truths in communism it would not make any appeal to the people. It is impossible to propagate a political philosophy unless there is some truth in it. If it were otherwise  Amee  Semple McPhersonism and- other crank religions which seem to flourish in America would sweep across the world. Communism makes converts because its adherents preach the doctrine that the great mass of the people are being exploited by that section of the community which owns and controls the means of production, distribution and exchange. Speeches such as that delivered by the honorable member for Hume do nothing to solve the problems of this country; they merely encourage all kinds of " isms " without making any contribution towards the solution of current social problems. If we desire to introduce a new order we must take note of what is being said by people who are studying the problems of post-war reconstruction. At the synod of the Anglican Diocese of Grafton, held on the 16th September, 1942, one of the speakers had some telling words to say on this subject. These were reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 17th September as follows: - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>People asked whether a new order was necessary. The answer was in the slums of great cities and the sub-standard houses, and the spectacle of people starving in the midst of plenty. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">Those words are undeniably true. If we want a new order we must get rid of the slums in our cities, and inaugurate an era of social justice. If we do that we need have no fear of communism or any other " ism ". I bring to the notice of honorable members, also, a letter by the Bishop of Goulburn," <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. E.</inline> H. </para>

                            <para>This emphasis on the strikes and the neglect of Labour's positive achievement creates the worst possible atmosphere in which to get this nation working. It is a bad heritage from a bad past, and we should change our whole attitude to the worker and his work. Unless we do there is little hope of getting the best out of our nation, and surely these times need the best. We all want to eliminate strikes, but to do so effectively we must see all the facts clearly. </para>
                            <para>First of all, it is clear that the workers must win this war or it will not be won at all. People who write letters about strikes make very few guns or bombs. We can at least give our gratitude to those who do. Further, the bulk of the Army is recruited from the ranks of the workers. The workers provide the main body of the munition makers. Other classes give important and indispensable help, and we have no intention of being unfair to them while trying to get a sense of justice towards the workers. But primarily this is a workers' war. It is being waged for the freedom of the workers of the world. Now if these facts were stressed in our propaganda we would begin to build up a mighty sentiment of loyalty and enthusiasm in the hearts of our workers, which would in time alter the whole feeling of the country. The only people who can effectively discipline the workers are the workers themselves. This is true in wai or in peace. The history of compulsion in this country is most significant on this point. Unless the workers as a whole feel that justice demands it compulsion will fail. </para>

                            <para class="block">I commend those observations to honorable gentlemen apposite who are so prone to indulge in fatuous and unfair criticism of the workers of Australia. I often wonder how many honorable gentlemen opposite have worked in a mine. I have not done so, nor have I any desire to do it. From what I have been told by the honorable members for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> and Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> honorable members opposite would do well to try to trudge their way along a narrow passage, with an arched back, carrying their tools of trade, their food, and other impedimenta, for up to 5 miles in a coal-mine, in order to reach the face at which they had to dig the coal that this nation needs to-day. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> recently told a meeting at the Paddington Town Hall that he had recommended to Cabinet that the coal-mines of Australia be nationalized, but that Cabinet had refused to accept his recommendation. I hope that Cabinet will reconsider its decision, and accept the recommendation; because, when the profit motive has been taken out of the mining industry, when miners have been given work above the surface and the mines have been mechanized in an up-to-date manner, a good deal of the existing human suffering and misery will be eliminated. </para>
                            <para>There are deficiencies in this budget in addition to the several with which I have already dealt. It does not propose to institute a scheme of marriage loans. If young people are to be encouraged to marry early in life and to rear large families, we must have a system of marriage loans. One factor that has impressed upon us the need for a large population is the imminent danger we are in of attack by the Japanese. I stated on a previous occasion that Australia will not continue to be a white man's country even if we win this war, unless it has a population of approximately 40,000,000. </para>
                            <para>There is no provision in the budget for the scrapping of the cost-plus system. So long as there is the profit motive in industry there will be grounds for complaints such as those to which utterance has been given in this Parliament from time to time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> D.

                            <para>For do not forget that throughout the inter-war period the first thought of nearly all the great capitalist combines had been to prevent, and not to stimulate, production. The aim of almost every combine had been, not merely to prevent fresh competitors from entering the trade, but to drive out of it as many as possible of those who were in it already. It had been discovered that the safest- many said the only - way of maintaining profits was to keep goods scarce and prices high. In the sacred name of " rationalization ", works regarded as " redundant " had been bought up and razed to the ground, or otherwise effectually put out of business. Shipbuilders' Security, the Iron and Steel Federation, the cement combine, and a host of others had been highly successful at the monopolist game; and the business quality highest in estimation had come to be that of making one blade of grass grow where two or three could have been grown without any technical difficulty. Was it likely that financial directors trained in this restrictive school would be good at organizing production when the sky became the limit? They were not good at it: they were very bad. </para>

                            <para>. - After a discussion that has lasted several days, it is rather difficult for late-coming speakers to say anything that is particularly novel or original in regard to the financial statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> although one must confess that the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr.Calwell) introduced into his enthusiastic effort a great deal more novelty than realism. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>One would like to believe that the story of departmental administration related by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> was novel, and not typical of governmental administration in. time of war. Whilst one has a healthy distaste for repetition, of which there is far too much in this chamber, there are occasions on which the circumstances justify its indulgence. This is one of those occasions. I believe that the perils inherent in the budget proposals of the Government are capable of doing so serious an injury to  the economic structure and the domestic life of the people of Australia that the warnings already uttered by previous speakers cannot be too frequently repeated. What provokes that statement? Generally, a budget contains a statement of anticipated expenditure and anticipated income. Almost invariably, those two estimates are specifically divided and totalled. Either they agree, or they show a deficit or a surplus. But the present budget has departed from that tradition. It is true that the Treasurer estimated an expenditure during the current year of £549,000,000. But the honorable gentleman took pains to tell us that that is by no means a definite figure. He reminded us that during the last financial year the estimates - which, we presume, were as faithfully and honestly prepared as those for this year have been - fell short of the actual expenditure by approximately £98,000,000, and involved the use of bank credit to an amount of £80,000,000. Even though it be true that £549,000,000 by no means represents the potential financial obligations of the country, one has not heard a word of criticism either from this side or the other side of the chamber regarding that aspect of the budget. I venture to suggest that if £549,000,000, £649,000,000 or even £749,000,000 were needed in order to ensure the safety and security of Australia, there would be no demur, either politically or from the Australian taxpayers. But the criticism advanced during this debate has been associated entirely with the provision that the Government has made or proposes to make in order to meet its obligations. The Treasurer informed us that, again departing from tradition, he proposes to raise £219,000,000 by taxation and £30,000,000 from other sources. He then naively said that the remaining £300,000,000 would be found by loans, &amp;c. " Etcetera " is to play a large part in the financial affairs of the Government during the ensuing twelve months. The Treasurer stated that during the last financial year £120,000,000 was raised by loans and that, if the amount were doubled this year, £240,000,000 would be raised. That is perfectly correct. If the £240,000,000 be doubled next year, the amount raised will be £480,000,000; and if the same process be followed in the succeeding year, the amount raised will be £960,000,000. We need only continue that process for five or six years, and the spectre of the national debt to which the honorable member for Melbourne directed our attention will have been completely eliminated. But is it practicable? Was the Treasurer serious when he mentioned the possibility of raising £240,000,000 from loans and £60,000,000 from war savings certificates? If so, I should like to know what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> meant when, answering a retort from this side of the chamber during his speech, he stated definitely that in his opinion the maximum amount that could be raised in Australia, even if compulsory loans were resorted to, would be £200,000,000. I believe that the right honorable gentleman will admit that, unless compulsory loans be resorted to, the amount raised will not reach even £200,000,000. Which of those two statements is Parliament and the country to accept? Are we to believe that the Treasury anticipates raising £300,000,000 from voluntary loans and war savings certificates, or that the ceiling estimated by the Prime Minister as being possible for the raising of loans in Australia during the next twelve months must be set at £200,000,000? If the Prime Minister be correct, the Government has definitely budgeted for the use of at least £100,000,000 of bank credit this year, even on the assumption that the expenditure be of the amount estimated to-day. I have always adopted a rather liberal attitude towards the use of the credit resources of Australia. I was shockingly disappointed, and have not yet recovered, three or four years ago, when we were told by the government of the day that the monumental piece of social legislation that was then so greatly acclaimed in this chamber had to be placed in the political ice-box because the economic structure of Australia was said to be not capable of producing £2,000,000 a year in order to implement it. That was not the only occasion on which I had felt disposed to adopt an attitude of liberal finance. But surely there is some difference between controllable and uncontrollable use of credit ! The Prime Minister stated in this chamber recently that any resort to bank credit would be an inflationary measure. Again I point to a disagreement between him and his Treasurer in this regard; because the latter, in one paragraph of his printed budget speech, drew attention to the fact that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> financing of the whole of the war by means of bank credit, as some people - including a number of his own supporters - desired, would be fraught with very grave danger to Australia. Apparently, the honorable gentleman considered that in the very serious resort to the use of bank credit that he contemplates he is perfectly safe, but that he must not go any farther. Yet the Prime Minister told us that any resort - and I believe that he mentioned an amount of £20,000^000- would be inflationary! I repeat that, whilst most of the business community owes its success to ability to use personal credit to a reasonable degree, the realm of commerce and industry is strewn with the debris of enterprises and men who resorted to an uncontrolled use of credit. </para>
                        <para>Let us examine the actual proposals of the Treasurer. The honorable gentleman stated that, if the returns from war loans last year were doubled, we should raise this year £240,000,000. Does that mean that during last year, when £120,000,000 was raised, only half pressure was applied to the accelerator? On the contrary, we can recall very dramatic last-minute appeals by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and other Ministers, when it seemed that the last war loan was likely to fall far short of requirements. We recall the ballet demonstrations and boxing exhibitions given in Martin-place, Sydney, in order to intensify the interest of the community in the war loans. We are now told that the people contributed last year only one-half of the sum they were capable of providing, and that whilst we raised £120,000,000 last year we are likely to get £240,000,000 this year. Then the Treasurer said that the balance of £60,000,000 might be raised by the war savings certificates campaign. He remarked that if £60,000,000 were obtained, it would be a comparatively small achievement compared with that accomplished in Great Britain. The Treasurer told us that the returns from war savings certificates last year showed a falling off compared with the previous year, and that last year the face value of the war savings certificates issued was £13,500,000. That represents, of course, only a cash value of a little over £10,000,000. Does anybody suggest, that Australia, under a voluntary system, is capable of increasing last year's returns from these certificates sixfold? Unless the Government is prepared to scrap its present proposals, and adopt some of those suggested to it, this country is likely to suffer severely from the inflation that must inevitably follow. </para>
                        <para>In refusing to increase the income tax of persons on the lower ranges of income, or to introduce a system of compulsory loans, the Government is appealing to the goodwill of a large body of income-earners who are escaping their appropriate share of the war costs. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> referred to the fact that a considerable amount of income is earned by the group in receipt of less than £400 a year. He estimated the amount at £550,000,000, but I think that £700,000,000 would be nearer the mark. He said that it would be wrong to consider that sum without regard to the number of contributors. I admit that. It would be a sound argument on his part if it were suggested that the persons earning that £700,000,000 should pay tax comparable with that of persons in the higher income groups who earn that amount of income. Nobody, of course, asks that, but the Opposition contends that, whilst it is true that the attitude of the Government will probably appeal to many of those people who unthinkingly believe that they are escaping their share of national responsibility, I warn them that after all the relief they are getting is merely temporary. The deflation of the currency that must follow the tremendous use of bank credit contemplated in the budget is only an alternative method of taxing, which is more ruthless in its incidence than any considered system of income taxation that could be applied to that group. What would be the effect of a deflation of the currency? Its influence would extend, not only to those to whom the Government is appealing for their goodwill, hut it would also apply even more ruthlessly to those taxpayers who have limited and fixed incomes, such as pensioners of all classes, including the miners in receipt of pensions, who have recently come into that field. </para>
                        <para>The prudent people who have put their comparatively small savings into war loans and other investments will not participate in any of the advantages of inflation, hut will certainly share all of its disabilities. Even the people who respond to the appeal of the Government, and of the rest of us who plead with them, to invest in war loans will find their returns from that investment seriously affected. They will get £3 5s. or £3 2s. 6d. per cent., but the purchasing power of the money will have declined. I repeat the prophecy of the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that, before the end of the financial year, the Government will be compelled to retrace its steps, and discard what it now considers to be a commendable proposal. This will not be the first time that the Government has had this experience. Not many weeks have elapsed since we heard of the Government's brave proposal to impose a ceiling limit of 4 per cent, on the profits earned by various companies. This proposal was much acclaimed throughout the community by those who were not shareholders in companies. The Treasurer himself, speaking at Lithgow recently, said to his constituents that, whilst the proposal to limit profits to 4 per cent, was attractive, it had been found to be totally unworkable. 1 prophesy that a similar experience will befall the Treasurer and the Government iti its concentration on voluntary effort in order to finance the war loans. </para>
                        <para>Whilst it is true that the Government is resorting to three methods of revenue raising - and most of us" are prone to believe that taxation, borrowing, and resort to bank credit are the only methods - T direct attention to a fourth method by which some advance could be made towards the balancing of the budget. T refer to watchfulness and economy in expenditure. I know, of course, that in war-time it is most difficult to prevent wasteful expenditure. As General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline></para>
                        <para class="block">Thomas Blarney recently remarked, war itself is a waste ; it is difficult, therefore, to remove from those administering easy money a spendthrift complex. I was glad to hear the remarks of some members on the Government side of the chamber about the possibility of effecting economies by relinquishing some of the lavish expenditure which is characteristic of governments, particularly in war-time. But I remind honorable members of a further direction in which substantial economies could be effected. I refer to the over-generous treatment of the States in the payments made to them from the Commonwealth Treasury. Last week this Parliament considered the annual distribution to the three States which for years have received disability grants. In days gone by, when the budgets of those States really suggested that disabilities were being suffered by them under federation, one could not raise serious objection to the grants. I agree that the financial disabilities of the claimant States should be recognized, but we now find that all State treasuries are in credit. Therefore, the time has arrived when, in the interests of the solvency of the Commonwealth, the whole position should be reviewed. I direct this argument particularly to the compensation which the State governments are to receive under the uniform taxation proposals. I have no doubt at all that the committee which made the recommendations was anxious to do its utmost to break down the opposition which was inevitable from at least some of the State treasurers. Therefore it seems to me that the grants were much more generous than the circumstances warranted. </para>
                        <para>Honorable members will recall that the basis of that compensation was. the income tax collected by the various State governments during the years 1940 and 1941. If the liabilities of the States had remained static until to-day, there could be no objection to that basis, but even State governments should participate in the austerity campaign and reduce their expenditure. I shall refer to figures that apply to New South Wales, and I have no doubt that the argument will apply perhaps in a smaller degree to the other States. In 1941, the Government of New South Wales had a liability in respect of  unem-  ployment of £5,809,000. Its disbursements under this heading included £2,250,000 on grants, loans and advances for the relief of unemployment; £1,333,000 on food relief for the unemployed ; £91,000 on clothing for unemployed ; £603,000 on grants to the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board in order to give employment and £100,000 in providing housing for the unemployed. Would anybody suggest that the Government of New South Wales is now expending even a fraction of the odd £809,000 in relieving unemployment or in similar activities? In 1941 that Government paid £1,333,000 for child endowment, of which it has now been entirely relieved by reason of the Commonwealth child endowment scheme. Those two figures alone show a total of over £7,000,000 of obligations which the Government of New South Wales had in 1941, but practically none of which it has to-day. No wonder that that government has shown a budget surplus for the year just closed of approximately £1,000,000. One asks what that surplus would have amounted to. if all of the income tax due for last year had beencollected before the end of the year, or even if, for those payments made on the 30th June, receipts dated the 30th June had been given, instead of being dated forward into this financial year; and if all the capital expenditure from revenue on the New South Wales railways had been so indicated, instead of being offset as capital expenditure. These are the methods by which State budgets are manipulated - I use the term in its better sense. Therefore, on the grounds I have stated. I believe that the compensation which the Commonwealth Government is bound to pay to the States under the uniform taxation legislation is far too generous. </para>
                        <para>The Treasurer told us in his budget speech of the achievement of the Government in improving social services. He referred to the increases of invalid and old-age pensions, and he reminded us that the Government had instituted a Commonwealthwide system of widows' pensions. I maintain, however, that it is of little use to increase pensions by 6d. a week if, at the same time, the Government's budgetary proposals have the effect of greatly reducing the purchasing power of money. Moreover, while I commend and support the Government's social service improvements, I feel that it would have performed a still greater service to the country if it could have overcome its aversion to placing social services on a contributory basis. Widows' pensions are a great boon to thousands of widows in Australia, but the scheme is of no use to at least one widow in my electorate. In a letter to me she explains that the Valuer-General has placed a value of £425 on a house which she owns, and assesses the rental value at £45 a year, or 16s. a week. The property was acquired out of the savings of this woman and her late husband, but because she owns it she is denied a pension of 25s. a week, although its rental value is no more than 16s. a week, out of which she must pay rates and taxes, and provide for depreciation, repairs, renovations, loss of rent, &amp;c. In ray opinion, the time is overdue when the Government should revive the national health and pensions insurance scheme, to which should be added an unemployment insurance scheme. Within' the last week, I have received documents from Great Britain which show that the contributory insurance scheme in that country is providing a surplus of income over expenditure of £74,000,000 a year. What a boon it would be to our Treasury if we had in Australia a similar scheme, which might be expected to yield a surplus of between £10,000,000 and £15,000,000 a year. </para>
                        <para>I take this opportunity to express my opinion of the Government's attempt to impose compulsory unionism on the country. During the debate on this subject last week, the suggestion was freely made by Government supporters that those who were opposed to this form of industrial fascism were making a frontal attack upon the principle of unionism. Of course, they were doing nothing of the kind. To object to the Government's proposal to compel men to join labour unions is not the same thing as to object to unionism as such, or even to preference to unionists. If the purpose of the Government were merely to ensure that all workers were paid award rates, I should have no objection to its proposal, but that is not the real issue. Reference was made in the course of the debate to the action of the Government in imposing a condition in contracts for the manufacture of clothing that all employees engaged on the work should be members of the union. Not even the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> would argue that the action of the Government in calling upon contractors to sign an agreement with the secretary of the union was to ensure that all the employees should, receive award rates of wages. As a matter of fact, it, is compulsory under the terms of the award for all employers to pay award rates. Judge Drake-Brockman, in award No. 484 of 1940, provided as follows: - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>This award shall he binding upon the employers named in the schedule of the respondents attached hereto in respect of each and very person employed by them in the industry whether members of the Amalgamated  Clothing  and Allied Trades Union of Australia or not, and upon the said union and members thereof. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">If compulsory unionism is the policy of the Government, it would have been more honest and dignified for the Minister for Supply and Development to impose that condition in the contract itself, instead of requiring contractors to sign an agreement with nonGovernment officials. The policy of the Government is clear enough from the action of the Director of Allied Works in insisting that all men serving in the Civil Constructional Corps shall present their union tickets. Apparently, there is a difference of opinion between the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> on this subject. Recently the Attorney-General gave the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> a definite undertaking that men conscripted for work under the Allied Works Council would not be compelled to join a union, but the next day the Prime Minister controverted that statement, and now we do not know what the position is. It would appear, however, that the men are to have no choice. They have been taken from their businesses and jobs, and are being sent hundreds of miles a way from their homes, often to perform work to which they are unaccustomed, and now they are to be compelled to join labour unions. </para>

Of course, we know that the reason for the Government's action is to ensure the continuity of contributions to its funds for party purposes.

I welcome the suggestion. In this respect I am out of step with some of my colleagues, who have criticized the proposal on the ground that it' is inopportune. I do not share that view. For many years I have believed that there is no need for seven separate governments in. Australia. That was my opinion as a private citizen. It was confirmed when 1 became a member of this Parliament, and was further strengthened as the result of my experience as a Minister of the Crown. However, I hope that the Government will lift the issue above party politics. I know that the fears expressed by some honorable mem-' bers on this side of the House rested on the feeling that the Government's proposals savoured of party politics. For my part, I believe that the issue is too great to be the plaything of party politics, ft, is nearly half a century since thefederal convention framed the Constitution. Important scientific and economic developments have occurred since then, and it is time that the whole basis of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States was reviewed. In order that the* matter may lie placed above party, the Prime Minister should call together a convention similar to that which was responsible for the framing of the Constitution. If that be impracticable, at least let the proposals which are to be submitted to the people be formulated by an all-party committee. I shall support any government which attempts to obtain wider powers for the Commonwealth. The more power which the Commonwealth is able to assume, the better pleased I shall be. </para></speech>

                            <para>.- The budget before us provides for an expenditure equal to about one-half of the national income. It is of such dimensions that had the raising of such a sum been suggested three years ago the suggestion would have been ridiculed and regarded as an impossibility. It can1 truthfully be said that the budget is of astronomical proportions. The speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> reveals a remarkable achievement by slightly over 7,000,000 people in three years. The people of Australia are asked to contribute an average of, approximately, £80 a. head in order to finance the Government's war effort and provide for the other activities of the Government. Since the war broke out and the country has changed from a peace economy to a war economy governmental expenditure has become progressively greater each year. Not long ago consumer goods were available in abundance, but to-day many of them are either unprocurable, or, as the position in respect of tobacco and beer, in short supply. Although here and there a grumble has been heard there has been no general outcry from the great masses of the people. They take the restrictions more or less philosophically, although sectional interests whose incomes are affected have protested. A war economy has altered our way of living, and governmental control has been so expanded that the lives of the people have been regimented to limits undreamt of a few years ago. However, such control is vital to a people who are engaged in a struggle for their very existence. The people of this country are of one mind that the war must be won ; they realize what is involved in this great conflict and are determined to do everything in their power to overcome the totalitarian oppressors. They know that from the hordes who comprise the Axis powers no quarter can be expected, but only slavery for the people generally, and a return to peasantry, or worse, by those engaged in primary production. Unless we win the war, the economic clock will be turned back. I was astonished to hear " Dismal Daniel '* - I refer to the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> - predict this afternoon that before long this country would re sound to the tramp of hostile feet. The honorable member was a Minister in a previous government which, in 1936, introduced a trade diversion policy which caused Japanese wool-buyers to boycott the Australian market, and resulted in a loss of £5,000,000 to the wool-growers of this country. The honorable member also supported the Menzies Government which, contrary to the expressed wishes of the men employed on the waterfront and other organized workers, continued to export pig iron, scrap iron, and zinc concentrates to Japan. The honorable member for Barker is most inconsistent, because if the trade diversion policy was put into operation in 1936 because Japan's tentacles were reaching southward, the Government of the day ought not to have permitted the export of those vital commodities to a country with designs on Australia. Notwithstanding that Japan had strengthened its position in the Marshall and Caroline groups of islands over which it held a mandate and, by occupying Honan and Spratley Islands, had threatened Australia and the Netherlands East Indies, nothing was done by the anti-Labour governments to put our northern defences in order. I realize that this is not the time for recrimination, but I point out that although warnings were sounded five years ago successive governments did not heed them. The honorable member for Barker and those associated with him left the north of Australia more or less, to the mercy of the Japanese. The result is that to-day the present Government is asking the people of this country to subscribe for war purposes an amount equal to one-half of the national income. The Government is forced to spend urgently millions of pounds which should have been spread over the last six years. In 1937, when the then Prime Minister was in Great Britain, he advocated a Pacific pact, thereby suggesting that he had some indication of the intention of the Japanese. Nevertheless the north of Australia was left in a more or less undefended state. Not until the present Government occupied the treasury bench was any serious attempt made to strengthen our defences in the north. Since then millions of. pounds have been expended on defence works there, and  many more millions will yet be expended. The honorable member for Barker also said that he intended to visit the north of Australia. It is a pity he did not do so many years ago. Complacency, lack of imagination, and failure on the part of earlier governments to realize what was happening in the international arena has forced the present Government to incur enormous expenditure in providing for the defence of this country. Yet " Dismal Daniels " on the other side of the chamber rise one after the other to speak of inflation, and to advocate compulsory loans. </para>

Realizing  that  this country was inadequately protected, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> when he assumed office, appealed successfully to Great Britain and the 1'nited States of America for help, with the result that to-day Australia is in a much stronger position than when the present Government came into power. It is a pity that the honorable member for Barker did not visit the north of Australia many years ago, because I am confident that when he returns from his visit to the north he will have a proper conception of the position there. In that respect he will differ from the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> who failed to grasp the true state of affairs at Singapore and elsewhere. One reason why previous governments failed to provide adequately for the defence of Australia is that they represented vested interests which had to be placated by keeping taxation as low as possible. Necessary defence works were not undertaken because that would have involved the imposition of heavier taxes. The neglect of previous governments has made it necessary for the present Government to call on the people to make heavy sacrifice?. They are asked to forgo all unnecessary expenditure and to support to the full the loans which are being raised. I have sufficient faith in the people of Australia to believe that they will heed the Prime Minister's appeal, and will give to th. </para>

                                <para>- The Treasurer has asked for .universal sacrifice from the people. He has appealed to them to support war loans, and to live austerely. I am confident that they will heed his appeal, because they realize that manpower must be released for the manufacture of munitions, the strengthening of our defences, and for war work generally. If previous anti-Labour governments had not evaded their responsibilities, much of the urgent work that must now be undertaken would not be necessary. For example, during the financial year 1939-40 the Menzies Government did not expend £28.000,000 which had been collected for defence purposes. In the following year a further sum of £16.000,000 was unexpended. Those figures indicate that the government which was responsible for gearing the nation for war, fell down on the job. Obviously, the Menzies Government was unfit to occupy the treasury bench. Honorable members opposite have repeatedly mouthed platitudes about the whole-hearted manner in which they support the war effort of the Curtin Government, but the timely exposure by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> last Friday afternoon revealed to the country that they are concerned only with attaining the plums of office. They wish to transfer to this side of the chamber for the purpose of reaping credit for the good work that has been carried out by the Curtin Administration. The letter which the honorable member for Ballarat read was marked "Strictly confidential " because the Opposition did not desire the public to know its real motives. To use the phrase of a member of the Opposition, they are playing the "diabolical game of party politics " at its worst. They talk about how they support the Government, but if the opportunity were to present itself, they would pull the Government down. Actuated by selfish motives, they desire to obtain concessions for the great institutions which have for so long exploited the people of this country. If the United Australia party were returned to office, the new government would impose compulsory loans and higher taxes in the lower range of incomes. It would expect the workers, not only to fight, but also to pay for this war. </para>

                        <para>The administration of a country may be financed, first, by taxation; secondly, by loan; and, thirdly, by the use of bank credit. Prom the beginning of this debate, honorable members opposite have advocated the introduction of a system of compulsory loans. They have embraced whole-heartedly the Keynes plan as the basis of their policy. When this scheme was incorporated in the Fadden budget, the government was defeated. The Fadden Government expected to secure from compulsory loans £25,000,000 a year. Now honorable members opposite claim that the gap of £240,000,000 between expenditure and revenue may be bridged by compulsory loans and increasing the rates of .tax in the lower ranges of income. T shall briefly examine the Keynes plan. The author is a director of the Bank of England, and his scheme has been referred to as the " infamous Keynes plan ". This plan was devised purely for the purpose of compelling those in the lower ranges of income to bear a greater percentage of the cost of the war, obviously for the benefit of those in receipt of large incomes. For two years, the plan has received prominence. Although the British Government has adopted it, the Government of the United States of America has rejected it. Whenever a budget is in the offing the antiLabour press of Australia demands the imposition of compulsory loans.  The  Leader of the Opposition made no constructive suggestions for bridging the gap in the budget between expenditure and revenue. The mere fact that Baron Keynes is a director of the Bank of England satisfied the right honorable gentleman that the scheme should be adopted. In my opinion, Baron Keynes's association with the bank is an indication of his political outlook. With such a background as that, it is only to be expected that his plan will be inimical to the interests of the workers. Put bluntly, the plan was merely a ruse to raid  their  pay envelopes. Like honorable gentlemen opposite, he believes that the workers should fight the war, and .pay for it. His plan contains no guarantee that the compulsory contributions will be returned to the contributors after the war, because they will be in a different category from the bondholders, who have voluntarily subscribed to loans. But the fact that the repayment of the money is not guaranteed does not seem to concern honorable members opposite. The purpose of the Keynes plan is to utilize the opportunities afforded by the war to smash the living standards of the workers and to deprive them of any advantages that they might derive from the increased amount of money in circulation in wartime. Money must be found to finance the budget. If it comes from the pockets of the workers, the wealthy section need not be taxed so heavily. The recent outcry against the proposal of the Government to limit the profits of companies to 4 per cent, was almost deafening; and is indicative of the outlook of the wealthy sections of the community in regard to financing the war effort. Carreras Limited, manufacturers of tobacco, showed a profit of 45 per cent. In Great Britain, taxation is higher in the lower ranges of income and lower in the higher ranges of income than is the case in Australia.  Those  who advocate the Keynes plan of compulsory loans desire to reduce the burden of those with substantial incomes. No one can foretell the nature of the financial system that will be in operation at the conclusion of the war, but I prophesy that the capitalistic economic order will be relegated to the limbo of forgotten things. It is utterly stupid to advocate a. system of war finance that envisages a return to contributors of even a portion of the compulsory loans. If a United Australia party government should be in office, there is no doubt as to what its attitude will be towards repayment of the money. </para>

                                <para>- The United Australia party government will find another name for it. The supporters of that government will describe the money as a " just contribution by the workers of Australia at a time of great national crisis ". I marvel at the facility with which honorable members opposite find all manner of excuses for their inconsistencies. The right honorable member for Cowper, who attended meetings of the British War Cabinet, expects the war to last for ten years. Hitler's satellite, Rosenberg, has told the German people to prepare for a 30-year war. If we are to place any reliance on those estimates, many people will die before their compulsory loans are repaid, whilst many more will be so old that they will be incapable of deriving any benefit from the amounts deducted from their incomes. Honorable members opposite argue that a system of compulsory loans will enable the burden of the war to be spread equitably over all sections of the community. Their cry is for universal sacrifice. For the same reason they also advocate taxation of the lower ranges of income. The workers are already making a fair sacrifice. They are paying their share of the cost of the war " through 'the nose " in indirect taxes. Essential commodities have been taxed to such a degree that the cost of living ha increased by 20 per cent. That is evidence that our so-called price-fixing regulations have failed. "We could achieve real price control if we adopted the price fixation scheme which operated in Queensland for the twenty years prior to the outbreak of war. That scheme would provide a complete safeguard against inflation. The prices of beer and cigarettes have risen to an outrageous degree. We behold tobacco manufacturers making profits up to 45 per cent., robbing both the growers and the consumers. Honorable members opposite might endeavour to sell to the workers and householders the idea that the existing price fixing methods have not failed. The restriction of spending imposed by the rationing of commodities, and the total banning of the luxury goods, have afforded to a few workers the first opportunity in their lives to open a savings bank account. In the great majority of cases, however, the rising cast of living and his direct taxation contributions leave the worker without a surplus. How can honorable members opposite seriously contend that this section of the community is not bearing a fair share of the burden of war expenditure.

                        <para class="block">Menzies) spoke truly when he declared that wages chase prices, but never overtake them. Honorable members opposite wish to prevent any further increase of wages, whilst taking, by way of compulsory loans, a considerable proportion of the workers' earnings, and, at the same time, to allow prices to continue to rise. The  right  honorable member for Kooyong also declared that the Government wa taking advantage of the present prices to foist compulsory unionism upon the people. Honorable members opposite arc looking for a chance to utilize the present emergency for the purpose of smashing the standards of living which the workers of this country have taken years to build up, and which are second to none in any other country. The proposals in respect of compulsory loans, and taxation of the lower ranges of income are evidence of what honorable members opposite would do if, by some means, they managed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> regain the government bench. The Government declares that the wealthy sections of the community should make greater contributions to the war effort. Our object is to ensure that the people who. took every opportunity in the past to exploit the general public for the purpose of amassing wealth, shall not now be allowed merely to sit back and enjoy their ill-gotten gains. The guiding principle in national finance, and taxation is ability to pay. Apparently, honorable members opposite have discarded that principle. The interests which they represent in this Parliament fully support their argument that the cost of the war must be placed on shoulders other than their own. They do not care who pays for the war. They know that it must be paid for; but they prefer to see the washerwoman, the office boy, and the worker on the small wages make the greatest contribution. Any one who advocates a scheme of compulsory loans will, of course, receive the plaudits of the capitalist press. The wealthy section is the only section which will benefit from compulsory loans. </para>
                        <para>Honorable members opposite contend that compulsory loans will bridge the gap in the budget. It was estimated that the scheme propounded by the Fadden Government would yield £25,000,000, but honorable members opposite give no estimate of the revenue likely to he derived from the scheme which they now advocate should the Government he silly enough to adopt the proposition. .Such a scheme would bring economic misery and distress to the workers, and create conditions akin to those existing in the last depression. No room exists in our democratic life, either in peace or war, for such a scheme. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Price)</inline> emphasized what Great Britain was doing in the prosecution of the war. However, neither he, nor any other honorable member opposite, pointed out that on the basis of an estimated expenditure of £5,286,000,000 Great Britain's budget leaves a gap of £2,100,000,000- still to be bridged. These details were set out in a speech delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kingsley</inline> Wood, in the House of Commons, on the 14th April last. How is Great Britain going to bridge that gap? According to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kingsley</inline> Wood, it will be bridged in the same way as the Treasurer proposes to bridge the gap remaining in this budget. Consequently, honorable members opposite are utterly stupid when they speak of what Great Britain is doing, and, at the same time, criticize the Treasurer for acting likewise. If the -methods adopted in Great Britain be correct they must also be correct when adopted in Australia. Obviously, honorable members opposite criticize the budget simply for the sake of criticizing it. Should the proposition they advance be adopted, it would mean that one-quarter of the national income would be absorbed in compulsory loans. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted."]</inline> If the Opposition's plan for bridging the gap between revenue and expenditure were adopted, the Government would have to take as a compulsory loan 5s. in every £1 of income earned in Australia; but already certain people are paying income tax of 18s. in the £1, and the utmost that could be taken from them would be their remaining 2s. in the £1, and the other 3s. in the £1 would have to be contributed by the remainder of the earners of income. The proposal is too silly for words. It would mean that finally the contribution would be nearer 10s. in the £1 of the gross earnings, leaving to the income-earner half his earnings out of which to pay his income tax and maintain himself and his family. </para>
                        <para>The budget has been described by honorable members opposite as being so inflationary in its character that its adoption must lead to financial chaos. If this budget be condemned as inflationary, the Leader of the Opposition himself stands condemned of having introduced inflationary budgets as Treasurer in the Menzies Cabinet and as Prime Minister and Treasurer last year. Honorable members opposite have attempted to draw a parallel between this budget and the calamitous inflation which occurred in Germany after the last war, but there is no parallel to be drawn between the two periods or the two countries. Germany had been defeated in the war, but the Government, deciding to play a last trump, chose to smash the German currency in order to prevent the victorious nations from exploiting the German people. The history of the world since then has been marked by economic progress, and to-day, owing to the exigencies of the time, central bank credit is being used by every warring nation. Whether we like it or not, we must follow the lead given to us and use the national credit for the national benefit, but, certainly, not for the purpose of enabling private gain, which would be the case under a government formed from the ranks of the parties now in opposition. The right honorable member for Kooyong spoke on this budget in terms which vividly reminded me of the speeches made in this chamber on the eve of the 1931 general elections, when the. fiduciary notes proposal, made on behalf of the Scullin Government by the then Treasurer! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> was rejected because it was regarded as inflationary. Yet, immediately after the accession of the Lyons Government, our gold reserve was shipped overseas, and our currency was left without backing and made completely fiduciary. The people to-day are not so gullible as they were in 1931, but, apparently, honorable members opposite have not awakened to that fact. They remind me of a horse-trainer who unwisely decides that a horse, which has been resting in the paddock for ten years, is frisky enough to win another race. </para>
                        <para>Amongst the splendid schemes instituted by the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> is the rationalization of banking, under -which centres previously served by four or five branches of banks are now served by only one. Thereby the Government has established the machinery which will enable it at the first clear opportunity to apply the Labour party's policy of nationalization of banking. That day ought, to be hastened by the early lifting of the restrictions on the operations of the Commonwealth Bank which have prevented it from functioning in the manner originally intended, namely, as a people's bank, instead of, as at present, a bankers' bank. The nationalization of the Australian banking system is essential to the realization of a full war effort. </para>
                        <para>Official figures indicate that the average income earned by payers of income tax whose wages are less than £400 per annum is £210. The direct taxation paid by these wage-earners and the increase of the cost of living by 20 per cent, are an indication of the tremendous contributions that they make by way of indirect taxation to the Commonwealth Treasury. Excise from beer and tobacco nowadays exceeds the revenue derived from the income tax in 1938-39. That is conclusive proof that wage-earners in the lower ranges of incomes - and they comprise more than half of the taxpayers - are contributing more than a fair share towards meeting the cost of the war. The Opposition is demanding that further inroads be made on their resources for the sole purpose of smashing living standards. </para>
                        <para>It matters little to me whether I have beer or not, but the leaders of the armed services have frequently said that the men in the forces must have their beer and cigarettes if they are to be ' contented. The British Government has not found it necessary to limit the brewing of beer, and it is interesting to note that Lord Arnold, speaking in the House of Lords on the 12th May last, said that beer was bringing to the Treasury tremendous revenues, which were sorely needed. The Cairns brewery, which has been called upon to supply, not only the armed services, but also the civil population in a vast area, will cease operations next Thursday because of malt shortage. I should like to know what effect that will have on the troops in the northern regions. The closing down of the brewery will be owing not to the lack of water, hops or man-power, but to the unavailability of malt. </para>

                                <para>- No, not in Cairns. I specifically inquired about that in Melbourne when I came back from North Queensland. No malt means no beer. I am alarmed at the prospect that men who have been sent to the north, not only to fight, hut also to do defence work on behalf of the Allied Works Council, will not be able to get their daily glass of beer. <inline font-style="italic">[Further extension of time granted.]</inline> I discovered in Melbourne that, owing to man-power not being available, malt was definitely in short supply, and that consequently beer will be severely rationed towards the end of the year. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> by reason of the fact that he once lived in the tropics, knows what the conditions are there, and what complaints, outbursts and- outcries will come from the localities where all this defence work is being done, if no beer is available for the men. The matter is now before the Minister for Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> and is serious, because the heads of all the services agree that the troops must have beer and cigarettes to keep them contented. I hope that the Government will take whatever action is necessary to see that, so far as is possible, those living and working in the tropics shall have their supplies of beer assured to them. </para>

He forgets that while we waited for tanks and planes to be built and guns to be forged, our country would be taken, our women ravished, and our men murdered. In due course, if some other country produced the necessary number of tanks to bring us to parity with our enemy, I suppose the honorable member would expect Australia, which by then would be producing a race of half-castes, to decide to fight. </para>

                        <para>We are to-day faced with the heaviest budget in the history of Australia. The Government is asking the people to produce approximately £550,000,000, £440,000,000 of which is 'to be expended on the war. Although we may not approve of every project that the Government puts, forward, every one in Australia who is entitled to call  himself  a man is, I am sure, prepared to say tha t the money must be produced, even if it cannot be produced voluntarily, as the Government hopes it will be. When I think of the gap of £300,000,000 between estimated receipts and total estimated expenditure, I wonder whether it is possible to get that amount voluntarily from the people of Australia. We must remember that a great many people here are apparently still not aware that there is a war on, and do not realize that they and their country are in deadly danger. The time is very close at hand when this Government, or whatever other government may be in power, will have to obtain the money, no matter  what means it employs. 1 believe the correct plan was put forward by the former Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> We should have compulsory loans and post-war credits, and all that great section of the community which to-day is escaping direct taxation should be compelled to pay its share. </para>

                                <para>- I am quite prepared to face what a great number of Government supporters advocate and would like to see introduced : that is, that, every man who has property should give a section of it, a quarter or a half if necessary, in order that he should retain the other half and that this country should be free. I am not afraid to face it, but I doubt whether some honorable members on the other side are ready to do so. I would agree to giving half of our salaries, as is suggested by an interjector, because the money must <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> raised. One of the worst things the Government does to-day is to retain 2s. a day as deferred pay from the members of the armed forces until the end of the war, saying to them, in so many words: "We are taking £8,000,000 from you because you are in the Army, the Air Force, or the Navy, and are not in a position to object ". On the other hand, the man in the munitions factory is in. a position to object strongly. He is very vocal, through his union secretary, who is often an imported Communist, like the secretary of the Ironworkers' organization in Sydney, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> of the Builders and Carpenters Union - fellows who should be behind bars, if they are allowed to. live at all. I question very much whether they have any right to live in this country, which they are trying to tear down. </para>

                        <para class="block">Australia, or in the British Empire, until the Russians came into the war. Magnificent job though the Russians have done and are doing, it. would come very much better from the Prime Minister, as representing Australia, if, instead of appealing to the people to get the outlook of the inhabitants of Stalingrad, he remembered that after all we have a very wonderful history of our own. It is not necessary to go very far back. He could urge Australians to get the same outlook as the men at. Lone Pine had, or the men at Passchendaele. who stood for weeks on end up to their knees in mud and slush, during the bitterest winter that Prance had known for 40 years; or the men at Menin Gate, who went down that road duy after day, and night after night, knowing that they had to supply the men in the front line with food and munitions, and that they would be extremely lucky if 75 per cent, of them returned; or the men of Tobruk, who stuck it for seven months, or the men of Milne Bay, or the men who to-day are fighting for the safety of Port Moresby and at the same time for the safety of Australia, because, if the enemy takes that very valuable base, the whole of Australia will be in grave danger. Why not ask the people of Australia to get the same outlook as the people of our own Empire and our own motherland ? Why appeal in an indirect way for the support and vote of men like Thornton and Thompson and those other Communist gentlemen who come out here not in the interests of the Empire, .but if possible to upset the Empire? It would be much more appropriate for the right honorable member, a? Prime Minister of a  British dominion,  to appeal to the people to remember their own country and its glorious past. My mind goes back to the last war, when my comrades were looking for assistance from Australia, and the representatives of the party opposite went to their famous triennial conference at Perth. I am reminded very seriously of the resolutions that they passed there, including one demanding the return of the Australian Imperial' Force to Australia, and another that Great Britain should make the best, peace terms it could. They might as well have suggested putting a man into a cage with a well-fed tiger and saying to him, " Make the best terms you can with the tiger; possibly he will allow you to live till the morning if you pet him and scratch his ears. If you do not, it is just too bad, but anyway he is bound to eat you in the morning". That was the suggestion, and the men who were then struggling on the slopes of the Galilean Range, or trying to stem the tide at. Amiens, or facing the German hordes which were marching into France, find it hard to forget such things. </para>

                                <para>- I agree with the honorable gentleman. The men who return from this war, and also the people in munitions factories, will also want work when the war is over, though, in ni,y opinion, the munitions workers are entitled to only half the consideration that men who return from active service should receive. I do nor believe that the people of Australia, in general, and the returned men, in particular, will accept conditions similar to those offered after the last war. Our people will not be prepared to go back on the dole, and I would not expect them to do so. Men who return from the war and have a business, or a farm, or a job, to go to should be allowed to go to it promptly. Men who have no job to go to should be retained in the Army, not. on </para>

This Parliament should say to such men, " You have risked your health and your very lives for this country, and have done a magnificent job on the field of battle. We now want you to do a good job on big national works such as* water conservation enterprises and the like that are waiting to be undertaken." It will not do to say to these men, " We thank you very much for your magnificent effort, and we regret that we have no job for you ". We must undertake water conservation on a large scale in this country. We shall not be able to hold Australia with a population of 7,000,000, or even 15,000,000, people. We shall need at least 30,000,000 people to hold the country. We shall forfeit all moral right to this island continent if we do not increase our population to something like that number. It has been the common experience for some people in Australia to laugh and sneer at big undertakings such as the one proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bradfield,</inline> an engineer with an Empire-wide reputation and great vision. This great engineer has recommended that the waters of rivers on the Atherton Tableland be diverted through Queensland into the Darling River. </para>

As a Victorian, I say to the Government, " Forget about the standardization of the Victorian railways if you wish ; but, for God's sake, get to work at once on the standardization of the railway from Port Pirie to Broken Hill and across New South Wales. At least lei us have a standardized railway from east to west so that we may transport our iron and coal, as well as our troops, expeditiously. Let us get on with this job to-morrow." Honorable gentlemen opposite must, forget their narrow-minded ideas about man-power. If there are insufficient men available in this country to do the work, let us get Chinese or Pacific Islands labour for the purpose. When the job is done, the men who are brought here to do it may be sent back to their own country. </para>

The Chinese, he should remember, are our gallant allies in this war. He and some of his colleagues would rather lose their country than allow men to work for less than the basic wage of £4 18s. 4d. although big national works of the kind to which I have referred are urgently necessary. They would rather have men withdrawn from the Army for public works than bring in workers from other countries, such as China and the islands of the Pacific. The honorable member for Griffith has appealed to the Minister for the Army to release soldiers for civil work. </para>

Ever since the last war I have fought to get the very best of conditions for returned soldiers, and I shall continue to do so, whether I remain a member of this Parliament or not. </para>

                        <para>I am dissatisfied with the administration of the Repatriation Department. It is time that we implemented the decision that the Parliament made two and a half years ago to remove from the returned soldier the onus of proof that, a disability was the result of war service, and to place the onus on the Repatriation Department. The amendment of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act that was subsequently agreed to has not been effective. In 99 cases out of 100, the men who apply for war pensions have little legal knowledge and many of them do not think that they get a fair deal from the department. I regret that I feel obliged to say that I consider the doctors and officers generally of the Repatriation Department seem to regard it as their job to prevent as many returned men as possible from getting a pension. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman may state his case if he so desires, but he would need to be a greater orator than Alfred Deakin to convince a greatnumber of returned soldiers that they have had a fair deal from the department. Even men who have returned from this war have been treated shabbily by the department. I have in mind a young married man who had his shoulder blade broken by a bomb explosion. After his return home he was an inmate of the Caulfield Military Hospital for two or three weeks, but he received no treatment. I took up his case and subsequently he wa3 given some treatment, but was finally discharged on an unsatisfactory basis. He is a farmer's son, but he is physically incapable of working on a farm. He has been granted the magnificent pension of 10s. 4d. a week, and his wife has been allowed 4s. a week. I do not blame the Government, because it was a matter of administration. That is only one of a dozen almost similar cases that I could cite. I believe that the act does not operate justly. Over a period of years it has been amended with a view to making its operation .more equitable. Not long ago, members of this Parliament believed that it had been so amended that the unfortunate soldiers would receive a better deal than they had previously been given; but a legal trick was worked. That has to be altered. The men who suffer disability in this war will demand that it be altered. </para>

I have not made any bones about where I stand in regard to conscription. I am opposed to conscription for home service as well as for service overseas. I am opposed to it on religious grounds, because I do not believe that any man or any government ought to force any individual to take up the art of killing his fellow mcn. </para>

                        <para class="block">Why has the honorable gentleman changed so remarkably? To-day, he is a member of a government that is in favour of conscription for home service and for the defence of New Guinea. Surely the extra. £1.000 a year has not so gilded the pill that he is prepared -to swallow it and to renounce his religious convictions ! He must realize that a great deal of war organization had been effected before he assumed control. He is merely building on the foundation provided by a previous government. A man with such strong and deep-seated religious convictions surely could not change his opinions overnight ! He may be likened to the man who betrayed his master for 30 pieces of silver.

As far as I am concerned, all I can judge about the necessity for retaining New Guinea is that a handful of exploiters have got hold of the country, some interested in aerial transport, some in gold-mining, and some in the search for oil. These people want to retain New Guinea in order to preserve their own commercial interests. </para>

If we fail to do that, we shall not be able to hold the north of Australia. I doubt whether even he would be prepared, as was the Army at one stage, to say to the people of Queensland, "If we are attacked, we shall walk out of Queensland and defend New South Wales ". </para>

When a Government begins to expend on defence money which should be used for the internal development of the country, then, in my opinion, it is doing wrong. The Government is expending much too rapidly on defence - it is making plans for more than the adequate defence of Australia. I make no excuse for saying that. When the Government suggests that more millions should be expended on ' defence, should be provided out of the funds which ordinarily the States would devote to their economic developments, then it is time to call a halt, and that is where we are now and where we should stop. </para>

                                <para>- A long time has passed since the honorable member sweated very much. A large number of those who are engaged in primary industries, believing the story they were told, voted for members of the present ministerial party. To-day they are like a rabbit in the cage of a boa-constrictor, waiting to be devoured. The Government is chiefly interested in seeing that the people who, it believes, will vote for it get cheap meat, wool, wheat, butter, potatoes, eggs, and other commodities, irrespective of the cost of production. We were told by the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> on various occasions, before he became a Minister, that the members of the Australian Wheat Board should be elected by the wheat-growers themselves. He also made that statement after he became a Minister, but before the " acid " was put on him, and certain persons had to be pacified. They had satellites who wanted jobs. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> To-day the Minister is not prepared to allow the great wheat organizations throughout, the Commonwealth to have any voice in the election of the members of the Wheat Board. I have a good deal of sympathy with the Minister, because I realize that certain things have to be taken into consideration in a chamber constituted as this is. First of all, the Government's majority has to be taken into account. Like a snake in the autumn, the Minister has changed his skin. He is no longer the champion of the primary producers. The standard of the wheat-growers of Australia has been furled. The Minister now declares, " We shall have a. committee to control this great national industry. We shall elect it ourselves. Today I am Minister for Commerce. I shall see that this committee is appointed." Then somebody remarks to the Minister. " After all, there is the man who took a rather prominent part in a case in Western Australia with regard to some wheat that walked ". There is also a great exponent of the Douglas Credit system in Victoria, and that has something to do with the Government's majority. The Minister now says, "We shall drop the standard of the wheat-growers for a time, and appoint a committee which will he satisfactory to the man responsible foi  our majority. Then we shall tell the wheat-growers that we have appointed a wonderful committee, and shall give to the farmer 4s. a bushel for his first 3,000 bushels of wheat, as 70 per cent, of the growers in Australia will benefit from that." There may be some advantage, from an electioneering point of view, in a scheme such as that, but the Minister does not say that four-fifths of the wheat is grown by men who produce over 3,000 bushels a year. He does not point out that the scheme would ruin the real wheat-growers, who depend upon wheat-growing for their livelihood. He takes sides with the small man who may be a wool-grower, a dairyman or an egg producer, and grows a small quantity of wheat as a side-line. The true wheatgrowers of the Wimmera, South Australia and Western Australia, who can grow nothing but wheat, will be tied down to a gross return of about £600 a year, or they must grow wheat at a loss to enable the present Government to maintain its parliamentary majority. </para>

                        <para>The members of the Australian Military Forces who are in the field to-day are entitled to the same consideration and pay as is received by members of the Australian Imperial Force. Whilst the pay of the married man with a wife and two or three children has been considerably increased, the single man, who is fighting and risking his life - and there are more single than married men in the forces - is expected to make an interest-free loan to the Government for the duration of the war. He is the worst-paid man in Australia. I do not ask that the Government should undertake any increased financial burden in that regard for the time being. I believe that 2s. a day is sufficient for a man in the field; but, when he returns to his own State and to his own people, he will need money to enable him to re-establish himself in civil life. </para>

                                <para>- That statement is incorrect. A visit to the homes of people in country districts throughout Australia shows that in families where there were five or six sons only one now remains on the land, the others having enlisted in the fighting services. The men whom the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> represents are mostly employed in comparatively safe jobs - in the munitions factories or in the coal-mines. I had the honour to command a regiment of the Australian Imperial Force in the last war, and I know where the majority of those men came from. Those who- say that most of the members of the Australian Imperial Force are members of the trade unions know that that is a deliberate untruth. </para>

                                <para>- The Government has adopted the policy of placing young men in command of units throughout the defence forces. I do not entirely oppose  that policy, but I believe that the Government has carried it out to an unreasonable degree. An officer who has returned from the Middle East, and who commands a division in Australia to-day, states that a lieutenant aged 25 years is  too old for an armoured unit. I say without hesitation that an officer who makes that statement is unfit to command a division, and does not know what he is talking about. He declares that a captain is too old at the age of 30 years, and a major too old at the age of 35 years, for an armoured division. In one regiment ten lieutenants between the ages of 25 and 28 years were displaced on the ground that they were too old for an armoured division. I am referring to a country regiment composed largely of farmers and graziers. Men who created militia units the members of which have since joined the Australian Imperial Force are to-day in the position that they cannot be promoted beyond the rank of sergeant. I know many of them well, and they are excellent men of no more than 26 and 27 years of age, yet they are supposed to be too old. Some one ought to examine that commander in order to see what is wrong with him. </para>

                                <para>- J. do not think that the honorable member for Warringah is much of a judge of the capacity of officers. He was known throughout the Army as the Minister against the Army - not the Minister for the Army. There are scores of officers in the Army to-day who, before joining up, were oil travellers, or insolvent garage men, or lawyers who could not make a living. The day after they joined they were lieutenants, a week later they were captains, and a little while after that some of them were lieutenant-colonels. Such men bring the Army into disrepute. They are laughed at because they know nothing of soldiering, yet they strut around Victoria Barracks as if they were fieldmarshals. All they know of soldiering is to go down to Snows and buy a uniform. They are nothing more than glorified clerks. There are plenty of returned soldiers, too old to take an active part in the war, who could very well do their jobs. I know two men who last January were oil travellers, and who are now lieutenant-colonels in the intelligence branch. A great deal has been said about the Allied Works Council. The man in charge of it undoubtedly has ability. We know that he has a great record also. He has taken over club premises in Melbourne which were very well furnished, but not well enough furnished for him. Everything was cleared out of the building, and new furniture installed. He appointed a man of 25 years of age to be  Deputy  Director of the Works Council, a man who is a very close relation of a Minister. Twelve months ago, he was office boy in the employ of a mining company. There is another man named McNamara, an exsuperintendent of police who, after he retired on a pension of £S a week, started an inquiry agency. With him he had two men, one named Coffee and the other named Lacey, who were kicked out of the Victorian detective force because they were running a dope ring. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> who, as Lieutenant Packer, was stationed at Seymour for a while. He engaged all the available accommodation in an hotel in a nearby town, and was seen very often in Menzies Hotel at night when other officers could not get leave. He returned at any hour of the night that suited bini, and when the armoured division, of which he was a not very distinguished member, was likely to be sent north, he transferred to the Allied Works Council. These things should be looked into. Men of this kind are in charge of better men than themselves. They are able to order returned soldiers getting on in years to Darwin or Moresby or North Queensland. Why should these fellows of 25 be suddenly jumped up into positions of authority? Why should they not be on active service? Gordon Webber, ex-member of the Legislative Assembly, was a tanner who, after going out of business, was appointed to the Milk Board, although the only milk he knew anything about was his mother's milk, and I suppose he has forgotten about that long ago. Later, the Minister for War Organization of Industry appointed him to the Bread Rationing Commission. Then we have Comrade Considine, an ex-member of the House of Representatives, who called the King an illegitimate, and was sentenced to three months in prison for it. He is now an employment officer in the man-power branch. There is also Douglas Maloney, son of an ex-Member of the House of Representatives, who never worked in his life, and who is young enough to go to the war. He, too, is an employment officer. Half of the former inmates of Selbourne Chambers are in the legal branch doing so-called work for the Army. Those who cannot be found jobs in the legal branch are given some other office job - anything but the job they ought to be doing. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Major Greville,</inline> a man with no army experience, who has been put in charge of the rationing of troops. He spends his time arguing about whether potatoes and carrots should be peeled or scraped.  His  experience of catering before the war was to sell sandwiches, oysters and saveloys at Caulfield. Squadron Leader Wagstaff had an hotel at St. Kilda, and went broke. He has had no flying experience, and is young enough to be at the war. It is a revelation to see these men streaming out of Victoria Barracks into St. Kilda-road at the end of the day, or out of the barracks in Sydney. Their places should be taken by returned soldiers or by women, and they should take their part in the defence of the country, instead of hiding in the barracks. </para>

                                <para>- When I was put out I was told that the Government had decided, as a matter of policy, to bring in young men who had seen service in the East. The Minister will agree that I made no complaint. Unlike the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan),</inline> who squeals whenever things do not go his way, I did not squeal. On the contrary, I did my utmost to see that the man who took my place was given all the advice and assistance I could provide. I did not think that either he or I mattered at all, but I did believe that the men under our direction mattered. That division was one of the best disciplined' divisions in Australia, not excluding the Australian Imperial Force. When the Government gave instructions that there was to be no leave last Christmas, only eleven men out of 9,000 men were missing from that division. The armoured division, from which the man who took my place came, had as many as 400 men absent from one regiment. That was a fairly general record in the various camps. I went out without squealing, and I returned to uniform, not at my own request, but. at the request of the Minister for Defence. I admit that I was somewhat disgruntled because of the treatment that I had received, but I came back, not because I wanted a job, or even, because I was asked to do so, but because 1 believed that any man who had any knowledge of soldiering and was capable of doing a job would be a cur if he did not take a job when he was asked to do so under present conditions. In my opinion, the only thing that matters to-day is that we get the money, arms, and troops that are necessary, and, in addition, the right men to lead them to victory. As the Right Honorable R. G. Casey said before he left Australia, " If I get out of this with what I am standing up in I believe that I shall be extremely lucky ", so I believe tha t if we get out of this struggle with our lives and our freedom, and with our women and children untouched, we shall be fortunate. It will then be our duty to build this country up again and populate and develop it, otherwise it will be taken from us eventually. </para>

                            or if not to him personally, to the Government of which he is a Minister. The fact that the honorable gentleman had to go back to .1918 for an argument with which to try to bring discredit upon the Government demonstrates that Ministers are doing a good job. The honorable gentleman also referred to the treatment of returned soldiers when they returned from the war of 1914-18. I remind him that those men depended largely upon Labour organizations in order to get some measure of justice.

                            <para>- Enlistments from the Australian Workers Union totalled 45,000, and every one of those men was kept financial with his union during his absence. The speech of the honorable member for Bendigo was characteristic of the speeches from the Opposition benches. After doing their utmost to discredit the Labour Government by throwing mud, honorable members opposite made an appeal for unity. The only subject on which Opposition speakers have been unanimous is that the basic wage-earner is not taxed -sufficiently. They have referred to the colossal increase of wages paid in 194.1-42 compared with other years. I remind them that, prior to the speeding up of Australia's war effort, 33 per cent, of the population of Australia was unemployed as the result of maladministration by previous non-Labour governments which have held office in Australia for 25 years. When discussing the previous Government's budget proposals last year, I said that the worker on the basic wage was already taxed to the utmost of his ability to pay. </para>

                        <para>When matters affecting the defence  of  Australia have been raised I have generally remained silent because I have been reluctant to mention publicly the true state of Australia's defence. To-night I am impelled by the arguments of the Opposition to say that until a Labour government came into office there was no defence of Western Australia. Before leaving 'Canberra in July last for Western Australia, I asked the permission of my party to be absent from the next sittings so that I could visit the north-western portion of that State, which had already been attacked by the enemy. When I told the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> of my intention he said that hi3 party would grant me a pair during my absence. However, when I reached Western Australia and discussed my proposed trip to the northwest with Major-General Plant, who was in charge of the defences of that State, I was astonished to hear him say that it was no use for me to go there, as instructions had been received to abandon all the north-west of the continent. </para>

                                <para>- In July last. From my discussion with Major-General Plant I learned that the whole of the northwest was to be abandoned. When I inquired what area was included in the territory to be abandoned the General said that the most northern defence line would be More River, which is 65 miles north of Perth as the crow flies. When I asked whether that meant the whole of the north-west of the State, which includes Geraldton, with its valuable harbour, and Mullewa, with its important railway station, as well as all the rich midlands, he replied, " That is the position. With the forces and equipment at my command there is no alternative." It was then that I advised the Government of the position in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>Although the budget may appear to be harsh in some respects, it is only what can be expected in existing circumstances. I am confident that it will be accepted by the people of Australia generally. As so many financial experts have dealt with its financial aspects, I shall take this opportunity to refer to some matters of paramount importance to Western Australia. The less populous States, particularly Western Australia, were justified in being dissatisfied with their shabby treatment by previous governments in connexion with the establishment of war industries. Therefore I am pleased that much of that leeway has been made up since the present administration took charge. My experience is that that is also the view of the majority of the people of Western Australia. However, much still remains to be done to remedy the disabilities from which Western Australia is suffering. Last year, the then Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> appointed the Western Australian War Industries Committee to survey the economic position of that State " as affected by and in relation to Australian war problems and the war effort ". The present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> was a member of that body, which made many important recommendations. I direct attention to paragraphs 147-9 of its report - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>Western Australia possesses several proved deposits of high grade ore, the two most important being Yampi and Koolyanobbing. Deposits of lime and lime sands are available in the south-west. Absence of a coking coal is the main reason for failure to treat the iron ore commercially in Western Australia. Since, however, both the Yampi and the Koolyanobbing iron ore are particularly rich, and extensive hardwood forests suitable for the large scale production of charcoal and by-product wood distillation exist in close proximity to ports in the south-west, it has been advanced strongly by several expert engineering witnesses that there are good prospects for iron ore smelting in Western Australia as a thoroughly sound economic undertaking. Expert engineering witnesses maintained that the use in the blast furnace process of charcoal from Western Australian hardwoods would yield very pure iron suitable for the production of tin pl ate and special alloy steels. Alternatively, either charcoal from hardwood, or Collie coal (after grinding and the removal of impurities by flotation), would be suitable for ore smelting by the new Duffield process which involves the smelting, in a specially constructed cupola, or briquettes of iron ore mixed with finely ground charcoal or coal bonded with hydrated lime. The production of charcoal iron in blast furnaces is uneconomic only when the charcoal is weak, costly to produce, and available in such small quantities as to make large scale production difficult. In general, the production in Sweden, Russia and other countries of fine charcoal iron, which commands a considerable premium in the world's markets, is not in substantial quantity because of the relative sparseness of softwood forests and of the incapacity of softwood charcoal to bear a sufficient burden to permit very large blast furnaces. No country has been able to try smelting iron with hardwood charcoal for lack of the appropriate timber supplies. There is no lack of supply in Western Australia, and crushing tests show that the hardwood charcoal produced in the State is strong enough to be satisfactory in the largest blast furnace. </para>
                            <para>Charcoal iron is at a premium because it is free from sulphur and phosphorus, and is consequently an excellent material for further manufacture. The economics of its production hinge on the cost of the fuel. Production of charcoal for blast furnaces must be on a large scale. It is futile to attempt to make it with small burnings in forest kilns. Its production must be undertaken as an engineering process. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> Mills, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Western Australian Railways, expressed his conviction that if the reduction of hardwoods to charcoal in Western Australia were done, as a large scale engineering undertaking, the charcoal could be made available for " what seems to be an absurdly low price ". </para>
                            <para>Ores at Yampi are very rich and easily mined, but the need for sea transport makes some ship-building programme an essential accompaniment of their exploitation during the war. Good ore is also available in large quantities at Koolyanobbing near Southern Cross, and requires only rail transport. It was urged by witnesses that the availability of the Koolyanobbing deposits justifies the immediate first steps in the development of the iron industry in Western Australia. </para>

Sawyer, the representative of the Chamber of Manufactures, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ellis,</inline> the Commissioner of Railways, emphasized two important matters: First, that competition in the local market by eastern States manufacturers was largely responsible for the failures of "Western Australian secondary industries generally to progress; and, secondly, the difficulty of obtaining supplies of raw materials required by local industries. According to my information, the position has not improved. Whilst Western Australian factories are not working at full capacity, completed articles are arriving from the eastern States. This position should be remedied immediately. If transport can be provided for the finished article, it should be available for the raw material.

                        <para class="block">I urge the Government to give effect to that recommendation. I also direct attention to the necessity for developing the Irwin coal seam. The State government, has attempted to exploit it, without assistance from the Commonwealth Government. The coal deposits are situated between  Mingene  and Mullewa, and are adjacent to the port of Geraldton. At the present time, these centres draw their coal from Collie, which is approximately 500 miles distant. Some quarters suggest that Irwin coal is inferior to the Collie coal, because of its high ash content and low fixed carbon; but such meagre attention has been devoted to the development of this highly promising field, that many people are suspicious that influences are at work to prevent a thorough investigation of its potentialities. In view of the shortage of coal supplies in Western Australia, the Commonwealth Government should co-operate with the State Government for the purpose of testing the Irwin coal seam. </para>
                        <para>Whilst I fully appreciate the difficulties confronting the Government in overcoming the problem of transport, I doubt whether the best use is being made of existing facilities. For example, the port of Esperance, which is the natural outlet for the Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie gold-fields, now lies idle and deserted. All goods consigned to the gold-fields are either sent by rail from Fremantle, a distance of 400 miles, or are hauled from the eastern States by the East- West railway. At present the port of Fremantle is congested, and unloading operations are unavoidably delayed. Unloading costs are doubled because of the lack of facilities to cope with the quantity of shipping in the harbour. Esperance is provided with suitable facilities, including rail transport, and goods consigned to the gold-fields should be despatched through this centre in order to relieve the congestion at Fremantle, and on the East-West railway. I realize that the extensive use of Esperance would involve the re-direction of convoys arriving in Australia, but the geographical position of the port would minimize the problem. </para>
                        <para>The strain that is now imposed upon the East-West railway could be relieved substantially by the extension of the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge from Port Pirie to Broken Hill. This work has been advocated for years. I have personally made repeated representations to various governments to undertake it. If the line were built, New South Wales rollingstock could travel to Kalgoorlie and the cost of the work, compared with the expenditure on the war, would not be very great </para>

In particular, two possible sources of supply are being investigated, namely, the Iron King Mine at Norseman, and the Great Victorian Mine at Burbidge. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">The manager of the Great Victorian mine deserves to be complimented for his efforts to develop this supply. Investigations that have already been completed by the chief metallurgist of the mining laboratory at Kalgoorlie disclosed that the Burbidge proposition fulfils all the requirements for the manufacturers of fertilizers, "whilst the development of this ore body would provide supplies of sulphur for the State, and might develop one of the biggest low-grade gold shows in "Western Australia. "For many years, this State has depended entirely upon imported sulphur for the manufacture pf sulphuric acid. However, the State contains several massive deposits of sulphide ore which may prove to be suitable for roasting for the production of sulphuric acid. It is gratifying to leant from the Minister that efforts are already being made to develop the deposits at Burbidge, and the Iron King mine at Norseman. </para>
                        <para>I note with satisfaction that the gold-  mining industry has been given some consideration in the budget. Following the introduction of the uniform income tax legislation, mining profits and dividends from income will be exempt. This concession will be appreciated by the industry. The abolition of the State tax will relieve the industry of the obligation to pay £400,000 annually. The gold mining industry has earned this consideration because for years it has borne a heavy burden of taxation and has made substantial contributions to the war effort. To-day, every gold-mine operating in Western Australia is working on a nonprofit basis, because of lack of manpower. Many mines have already closed down. In addition, all other businesses in the mining districts have been affected. The Government agreed to appoint a committee representative of the Chamber of Mines, the State government and the unions concerned to deal with this problem in conjunction with the man-power authorities. Its main object was to regulate the withdrawal of men from the gold-mining industry in an endeavour to conserve the interest of each mine. On a recent visit to Kalgoorlie I called upon the secretaries of the Chamber of Mines and the Australian Workers Union who assured me that both the Army and the man-power authorities were co-operating with them in regulating the call-up of men from the industry. However, I am not completely satisfied with the way in which the man-power problem is  being  handled. The mining, pastoral and agricultural districts in Western Australia have been drained practically to the last man. I have yet to be convinced that this policy is being applied so severely in the big cities. I admit that a visitor to a city can very easily misjudge the position in this respect. As our war factories are working on a basis of three shifts a day, possibly many of the young men one sees in the cities are engaged in these factories. I suggest that men employed in war industries should be supplied with a special badge to indicate that they are £0 employed. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> The man-power problem is most important. I urge the Government to appoint a parliamentary committee immediately to examine the national register with a view to regulating the military call-ups with more equity to the various primary industries. A very unfavorable reaction would be caused among the people should the idea get abroad that men of military age are being employed in non-essential industries, whilst vital industries are short of man-power. </para>
                        <para>Whilst beer production has been reduced by 33 per cent, no provision has been made to compensate tenant publicans for the loss thereby caused to them. Their earning capacity has been reduced by one-third practically overnight. Most of the hotels in Western Australia, as is the case, I understand, in most of the States, are owned by the breweries, which leases them to tenant publicans. The latter pay a weekly rent, but on taking over hotels they are obliged to pay substantial deposits. As the profits of these publicans have been reduced by 33 per cent., it is only reasonable to ask that they be protected in respect of their expenditure such as rent. It is all very well to say that they can obtain redress under the existing regulations. The fact remains that any individual who bumps up against the brewery monopoly will not remain in the trade for very long. I urge the Treasurer to give consideration to this aspect of beer rationing. </para>
                        <para>All honorable members will be pleased to know that arrangements are being made for the establishment of a mortgage bank. I ask the Government to ensure that this bank shall provide long-term loans at low rates of interest to primary producers, and give sympathetic treatment to the just claims of clients. I do not suggest that the bank be run on the lines of a benevolent institution. However, the primary producer often finds himself in financial straits owing to causes over which he has no control. For instance, the pastoral industry in Western Australia has had a six years drought, which reduced the number of sheep in the State by over 50 per cent., and left nothing but " scorched earth " in many areas. That drought ruined many pastoralists, who were not in a strong position financially, and were unable to obtain help from any institution to tide them over the crisis. If a disaster of similar magnitude, such as a flood or fire, occurred overnight, the industry would receive sympathetic consideration from this Parliament. When primary producers suffer severely as the result of conditions over which they have no control, the mortgage bank should extend sympathetic consideration to all reasonable applications. </para>
                        <para>I have no doubt that the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> will give favorable consideration to my request that a wool appraisement centre be established at Geraldton. Geraldton is the port for a district which produces 90,000 bales of wool annually.

                        <para>I have already made representations to the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to guarantee compensation to members of the Volunteer Defence Corps in country districts in Western Australia in respect of accidents occurring on their way to and from their training areas, and while they are engaged in training operations. These bodies function in many farming communities. They are thoroughly organized. In order to keep expenses to a minimum, and to conserve petrol and reduce wear and tear on vehicles, the men have been drafted into parties of from 20 to 25. Each farmer takes his turn to pick up the whole company on his truck and drive the men to the training area. These farmers have told me that unless the Government guaran-  tees compensation in case of accident while they are engaged in training, or on their way to or from the training area, they will disband. A public meeting of members of the Volunteer Defence Corps held in my electorate a few weeks ago unanimously resolved to request the Government for the protection I have mentioned. These men travel considerable distances to and from the training areas, and most of the journeys are made in vehicles nearly twenty years old. Each man can ill-afford the time he now devotes to military training. </para>
                        <para>I make no apology for having spoken at this late hour, because the Opposition delayed the proceedings by twice moving the adjournment of the House for the purpose of futile propaganda discussions.

                            <para>, - The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart),</inline> in his opening remarks, said that so many speeches had been delivered on the budget that it was difficult for honorable members at this late stage to say anything really new. I do not condemn honorable members who have talked about things that really have nothing to do with the budget, because it has been very well discussed, but points made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and other honorable members on this side of the committee might be emphasized, and I shall refer to a few of them. I also hope to refer to a few things that have not been mentioned. In the first place, I am bound to say that a grave defect in the budget is that it does not balance income and expenditure. Any company or individual that budgeted on those lines would face imminent bankruptcy, but, of course, public finance is conducted by the Treasurers of this country on lines different altogether from those on which private individuals operate. The budget anticipates an expenditure of £449,000,000. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> however, told us that it was likely that that amount would be exceeded, and some honorable members have expressed the belief that it will reach the huge amount of £600,000,000. It is estimated that revenue from taxation and all other sources will amount to £140,000,000. That will leave a gap, as it has been described by a number of honorable members, of £300,000,000. The Treasurer has estimated that he can raise £240,000,000 by loan.  His  reason for that estimate, which I regard as most extraordinary, is that because about £120,000,000 was raised from loans last year, the Government is justified in estimating that it can double that amount this year. In addition to straight-out loans, the Treasurer expects to raise about £60,000,000 from the sale of savings certificates and savings bonds. I do not think that there is any possibility of the Government borrowing so much as that, either by loan or from the sale of savings certificates. Sales of war savings certificates last year amounted to less than £9,000,000, and since the beginning of the war, sales of savings certificates and savings bonds would not amount to anything like £60,000,000. How, therefore, can the Treasurer expect the people of this country to provide that amount? I am certainly of the opinion, too, that straight-out voluntary loans cannot reach £200,000,000. The fact must be remembered by those who have these expectations that the money so far subscribed to loans has been largely from capital. It cannot be expected that capital will be capable of further heavy contributions. We must rely largely this year and in the years to come on the income of the people for subscriptions to loans.. Therefore, it is perfectly obvious that, if the Government excludes £700,000,000 of the income of the people from participation in either taxation or loans, it is hardly possible to raise the amount estimated. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I shall give further reasons why I think this amount of money cannot be borrowed. As I go about my own State I hear people talking. I do not know what their political views are. I do not ask them. I am not interested - between elections, at any rate - but I hear many people say, " I am not going to subscribe to these loans to find money, not for war, but for Ministers, departmental officials, commissions and committees, and other people to wander around the country in style as if they were wealthy people " - as many of them are. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has appealed over and over again to the people to subscribe to loans. He is now appealing to them, in this austerity campaign, as it has been termed, to reduce expenditure. I say deliberately that mere talk on that subject is not of. much use. What is required from this Government and Parliament is an example in that direction, and we are not giving it. The amount of money that the Government is expending to-day was never exceeded in the history of Australia. It is appealing to the States to reduce their expenditure, but we find that the ordinary expenditure of the Commonwealth will this year be £26,000,000 more than it was in the last year before the war. If it be right to tell the States, and the people that they must reduce their expenditure, surely we can expect them to say, " What about the money that the Commonwealth is spending, not on the war, but on many things to make its friends more comfortable? " I have heard that said among the people. Consider this Parliament. What do we do? We sit here for a few hours on three days a week. This is the first week of this sessional period in which we have started with the intention of meeting on four days. </para>
                        <para>Transport is one of the great problems of this country. What is the cost of conveying honorable members and secretaries and all other people who travel with them every week to and from Melbourne and Sydney? One has only to go to Canberra railway station to make a good guess at the tremendous cost involved in such travel. We from the distant States always regard it as a little unfair that honorable members from the nearer States can go home for the week-end. We, too, like to go home. I have not been home for a month and I want to go. I have things to do there. Some honorable members are not drones when Parliament is not meeting. They always want to be doing something useful and we need to go back home to attend to our private and public affairs. We have no opportunity to do so, having to remain in </para>
                        <para class="block">Canberra or to travel to Sydney or Melbourne for the mere sake of filling in time. It was wrong before the war and it Ls unpardonable to-day that we should sit for only a few hours on a few days each week, and put the country to such great costs for transporting us. We should do our job here without a break if we considered the transport difficulties, and we should not put such big burdens on the railways, not to mention the  num-ber  of motor cars used. </para>
                        <para>With regard to the raising of the money necessary to meet the deficiency between revenue and expenditure, I support those who say that the only possibility of raising it is by compulsory loans, or, as they have been called, post-war credits. Some people have gone so far as to say that post-war credits will never bc repaid. It is extraordinary for an honorable member of this committee to stand up and say that the money cannot be repaid, when at the same time the Government is appealing to the people to lend voluntarily. Honorable members should realize that to-day it costs £5 to buy what £4 would have bought in prewar days. That is a. direct effect of the inflation that is operating to-day. If we have to get bank credit to the amount of another £100,000,000, as we shall have to do, even if the Treasurer's estimates are approximate, what will be the effect next year or the year after? Is it not far better for the individual wage-earner, for the men with incomes from any direction, to subscribe £1 in £5 towards post-war credits than to pay it away for goods because of enhanced prices brought about by the use of bank credit. That is actually the position. It is wrong to say that post-war credits could not be paid back, because it will be very much easier to square the ledger after the war by the repayment of post-war credits than it will be if bank credits be employed. The depression after the last war resulted from the inflation practised during that war, and, if we go on as we are going, we shall have the worst depression that this country has ever experienced, and all the prices commissioners in the world will not be able to prevent it. Even if our own sense did not guide us in this direction, we have the example of other countries that have tried inflation. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> said that Germany had deliberately inflated its currency in order to destroy the wealth of Jews and other people and that the same was true of Austria. That may be true, but, whether it is done for 'purposes of that kind or as the result of ignorance, the result will be the same. John Buskin said that the evil that is done wilfully is at least limited to the will of the wicked person, but he asked where was the limit to the wrong a person might do in ignorance. I am afraid there is a graver danger of evil effects from inflation brought about by those who in their hearts believe it is a good thing, because there is no limit to the wrong they may do, or is likely to be caused by those who do it deliberately, in ignorance. Inflation .is, of course, the shortest cut to confiscation, but we are not going to resort to it in this country for that purpose. It is to be done because it is expected to ease the burden on those who would otherwise have to pay taxes, but I warn the Government that, whatever tricks it may play with the financial system for that purpose, they will not succeed, and certainly they will not pay. </para>
                        <para>If inflation is a bogy, it was raised by the Treasurer and not by honorable members on this side. In his budget speech the Treasurer said - </para>

                            <para>There are some people who think the war should be financed entirely by central bank credit. The Government is convinced that in that way lies grave danger . . . Expansion of bank credit, therefore, wi.th a corresponding capacity to expand production would increase purchasing power without increasing the supply of goods and services. </para>

                        <para class="block">Those words might well have been used by the most conservative member on this side of the chamber. I quote them only to emphasize the fact that they express the opinion of the Treasurer. If it is a bogy he raised it, but it is certainly no bogy, and I houe that those who advocate expansion of bank credit will realize the danger, although it is late, indeed. </para>
                        <para>Some honorable members have referred to the fact that extravagance and waste are occurring, but the evil has not been emphasized enough. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eadden)</inline> said that the country did not object to expenditure for war purposes, so long as there was no extravagance, but frightful extravagance is occurring. An example in careful and frugal living should be set by this Parliament and the Government. If not, words are waste of power and breath. As I said a little while ago, the people of this country, although their protests are not very loud, see what is going on and certainly are not going to subscribe to this thing that we call a loan. </para>

                                <para>- I am perfectly sure that they will not. The fault lies with the Government, because of the way it is spending the money. Another reason for the tremendous extravagance that is going on is the number of boards and committees that have been created. One of which I know a good deal and which, I am afraid, is typical of what exists throughout Australia, is the Potato Committee. It has a controller, who has a great many officers under him, it is tremendously costly, and what it is doing is only hindering, hampering and annoying the producer without achieving any good at all. It is quite a useless body. If it allowed the trade to operate through the usual channels everything would be done more efficiently and satisfactorily. Why not allow the merchants to control the forwarding of the goods as they are required ? As a matter of fact they have been doing it all along in Tasmania, where a quota is allowed to each merchant in the town who does the business. He tells the farmer to bring in one or two loads of potatoes this week or next, and so on. If the committee wanted to cut out the expense of the commission one could understand it, whether one agreed with it or not, but as a matter of fact commission is paid to the merchants at both ends, in Tasmania and at Sydney and Melbourne, so that there is no advantage whatever in .the system. Some most extraordinary things are being done. The Minister has, as a matter of fact, made an appeal to the people to produce more potatoes and other vegetables, but the controller tells me that I must not grow potatoes unless I sign a contract. The Minister advises me that he has given no such direction, and I am quite sure that he tells me the truth, but I am afraid that he does not know what this committee is doing. It is certainly giving that direction to its subordinates, and publishing it in the press. It was also given to the agricultural officer to whom I appealed for fertilizer. I have been growing potatoes for 50 years, but, although the Minister thinks that potatoes are badly wanted, I am not now allowed to produce them. Section 44 of the Constitution forbids me to make a contract with the Government, but the committee says that 1 cannot grow them unless I do. Therefore, I cannot grow potatoes, however much they are needed. A greater absurdity could not be imagined. These people, " dressed in a little brief authority", go about telling people in a domineering way how they are to do their jobs, but they succeed only in causing annoyance. I am afraid there are a number of committees of that kind. They do not know anything about the industries they control, and are very costly. Quite a number of their members are receiving £1,500 a year each, and some are paid very much more. Although the Government objects very strongly to what it calls capitalists, and to taxing the wage-earner, it has no objection to paying £1,500 a year to some of these people who never before in their lives earned £400. That is where the money is going, in the guise of war expenditure. </para>

                        <para>While dealing with primary production, I wish to refer also to the meat industry and the suggestion to fix the price of beef. It is quite impracticable to fix the price of beef on the hoof. It may be possible to fix the margin of profit that the butcher shall get in his shop - even that will give the Minister some difficulty - but fixing the price of beef on the hoof will not bring one more beast to market, or increase production. Any one who understands stock sales knows that not only does the market fluctuate, but also the price of beef on the hoof varies tremendously in every market. It will vary by £1 a hundredweight for good meat, and by very much more for second class. How is it practicable to fix the price? If that be attempted, what will happen is what has happened already in respect of potatoes. The price of potatoes  is fixed for the best quality, but thirdgrade potatoes, or potatoes no bigger than the top of my thumb, are bringing the same price as the best. That will aways be the case, because the price is fixed only when there is a shortage. When the good quality is sold and off the market, the law of supply and demand determines the price of the rest. It seems to the ordinary producer very unfair that he can sell third-grade cracked potatoes at the same price as the best quality brings. So with beef, if the price is fixed for best quality, and a shortage occurs, such as exists now, second and third grades will bring as much as the best. </para>

                                <para>- It could be done with potatoes, but what has always happened, and always will happen, is that, when there is a shortage and the best quality has been sold, the other grades come on to the market. There has never been any attempt, in the three years during which the Commission had been fixing the price of potatoes, to fix the prices of different grades. I am not going to say that the Commissioner is doing the job as well as it can be done. It has been done very unfairly in cases, not because he wishes to be unfair, but because he has no knowledge of the industry. If he is fixing the price of bread or softgoods, or any other manufactured commodity, the representatives of the makers come before him and argue their case, but the poor old primary producer does not get much of a hearing. I have attended meetings at which the Commissioner has addressed them, but if any farmer has risen to put his case he has been told that it is Professor Copland's meeting and nobody else must talk. I am not exaggerating the position at all. I am sure the job is not being done as well as it could be done. The prices of primary products cannot be fixed satis factorily, even if it is done to the best of the ability of any man the Government may appoint. My advice, therefore, is to leave the business alone. The law of supply and demand is looked on as a very cruel one, but it is not nearly so bad as the laws we attempt to apply. The merchants who have been in the trade for many years could do the job very much better than any committee could, because they have a complete knowledge of the business and know how to talk to the farmers. Under the present arrangement one of the officers of the committee goes to a centre and advertises that he will address the farmers, but the farmers come away disgruntled after listening to him, saying, " Fancy a man like that coming to tell us how to do our job ! " He is perfectly ignorant of the subject he is discussing, whereas the merchants are not ignorant, because they have been in the business for many years. </para>

                        <para>The Treasurer, in his budget speech, announced that the Commonwealth Government proposes to ask the people to give to the Parliament greater powers. That is unnecessary at this time, because the Government has all the powers it requires. The people of Australia do not wish to be embroiled in a referendum campaign at a time when they desire to devote their whole attention to the war effort. Such a campaign must divide the people when they should be united. It is of no use to ask the State governments to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in this matter, for, obviously, if additional powers be given to the Commonwealth, reduced powers would be left to the States. I do not say- that some extension of Commonwealth powers is not desirable, but during the war period the Commonwealth has ample power to do all that needs to be done in connexion with the war effort. Some honorable gentlemen seem to be under the impression that almost immediately after the war we shall be able to step out into a new world. Such an idea is foolish. How can any one who realizes what war does to a country imagine that we can win our way to  a  better state of affairs after a war that is devastating in its effects? There is  a prescribed way in which to alter the Com- . monwealth Constitution and I presume that the Government must abide by the terms of the Constitution in this matter; but I warn it that any proposal for a referendum at this time will be deeply resented by a large section of the community. If any proposal for an  enlargement  of Commonwealth powers has associated with it a proposal to increase the number of members of this Parliament it will be doubly doomed to failure. Obviously, any increase of the powers of this Parliament must involve an increase of the cost of government- </para>

                                <para>- We have had some experience of the increase of the cost of government. I can remember leading advocates of federation arguing in pre-federation days that the establishment of a Commonwealth Parliament, would reduce the cost of government. Of course the reverse has been the case. The cost of government has increased enormously since the consummation of federation. I can see no justification for an increase of the membership of this Parliament. At present this House consists of 75 members but except at question time only relatively few honorable members are present at the sittings. It often seems to me that the work of the legislature would be done more efficiently if its membership were reduced by one-half. </para>

                                <para>- The number of electoral divisions in Tasmania is fixed by the Constitution. Unless the population of Tasmania increases substantially the humber of members for that State will remain at five. I do not suppose that the honorable member for Griffith would suggest that an honorable member representing a suburban electorate in Melbourne or Sydney has a more difficult task than an honorable member representing a country constituency such as Kalgoorlie. </para>

                        <para>A proposal is made in the budget for the establishment of a mortgage, branch of the Commonwealth Bank. I advocated the establishment of a mortgage bank in Australia long before some honorable gentlemen who are enthusiastic about this proposal were members of the Parliament; but I have never suggested that the main business of such a bank should be to lend money at very low rates of interest. I do not believe that the overdraft system is suitable for primary producers. I favour long-term loans with substantial sinking funds The interest rate must be the current rate for general purposes. If the proposed mortgage bank be established on the basis suggested by some honorable gentlemen opposite it will simply lend money to people who, in many cases, are already bankrupt, so that they may get a fresh start in life. I do not regard that as the main purpose to be served by a mortgage bank. Some honorable gentlemen opposite would willingly alter the charter of the Commonwealth Bank in a way that would surely destroy the value of the bank. Unless they are careful they may bring about the ruin of the Commonwealth Bank as many of the financial institutions of Germany were ruined. It has been said by some honorable gentlemen that the people desire only one bank. If that is so, and they wish that bank to be the Commonwealth Bank, they have the remedy in their own hands. The fact is that, generally speaking, people prefer to do their banking business with the private banks. </para>
                        <para>It is pointed out in the budget that the Government has reduced interest rates on mortgages and savings bank deposits. By this arbitrary action the Government has done a great wrong to many thrifty people in the community without obtaining any corresponding advantage for the community at large. The interest rate on deposits with the Commonwealth Savings Bank is now only13/4 per cent. The two savings banks operating in Tasmania pay 21/4 per cent. Prior to the action of the Government in reducing interest rates, those banks were paying 31/4 per cent, interest on fixed deposits. I regret to say that, to-day, those institutions are not permitted to accept money on fixed deposit. This has had a most unfair reaction on thrifty people. I pointed out when the last amendments of our pensions legislation were under consideration in Parliament that, under existing conditions, a person who had saved £2,000 obtained from it less income in interest than the amount of pension now payable to invalid and old-age pensioners who had no property. That, in my view, is cruel and unfair. Apparently the people prefer to lodge their surplus money with the savings banks than to buy war savings certificates. Apparently they consider savings hank deposits to be safer; though I do not say that they are right, it is of no use to argue with them. In effect, the savings banks are collecting money for the Government for they are large investors in Government loans. They must invest their money somewhere in order to be able to pay interest on deposits. The arbitrary method of reducing interest rates adopted by the Government has had a most unfair result. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> made some references to-night to liquor control. Every thoughtful person in the community who has seen what is going on in the States to-day realizes that tremendous abuses are occurring in connexion with the liquor trade, especially in capital cities. The attempt to lay the blame for excessive drinking on the members of the forces is, in my view, grossly unfair. Of course soldiers on leave drink some beer, but soldiers in camp have not much money to spend on beer or anything else. A private receives 3s. a day for current spending and, if he spent the whole of it on liquor, the results would not be serious. I was a member of the military forces for 40 years. I have spent a considerable time in camps in Australia and abroad, and I have been in command of men on a troopship. I have never seen excessive drinking in camps and I regard it as a most unjust reflection on our soldiers to hold them responsible for the abuses that are occurring. Something has been done to correct these abuses, but I said a long while ago that the Commonwealth Government should insist upon the State governments enforcing their own licensing laws. If they did so there would not be much room for complaint. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                            <para>.I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words in referencee to the budget. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> deserves the compliments and congratulations of the Labour party and the people of Australia. It is a budget that is of outstanding importance to the economic life of the nation. It proposes that certain conditions shall operate during the war period, and also makes adequate provision for the defence of this country. During its twelve months of office, the Labour Government has proved that it is capable of conducting Australia's war effort for as long as the war may last. When its first budget was brought down last year, the bogy of inflation was raised. Overseas financial journals made statements, of which the following is typical :  - </para>

                            <para>Inflation looms if sound finance is sacrificed for vote catching. The budget certainly tends to increase Labour's following, but it will be regrettable if the price for greater political stability has to be disastrous financial instability. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">We have lived under that budget during the last twelve months, yet there has been  few signs of inflation. Prices have been kept well under control. The present scare that Labour's programme for the next twelve months will cause inflation is merely an attempt to bring the party into ridicule and disrepute. I was surprised at the statement of the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir George Bell)</inline> that it would be ridiculous to suppose that better conditions would be obtained as the result of the war and that there would not be financial depressions. If beneficial social and economic results are not  to  accrue from the war, the existing capitalist  system will be doomed to extinction. All thinking people declare that every effort should be made while the war is in progress to plan for the peace that will follow it. The following paragraph appeared in a British newspaper concerning the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> in a broadcast from a national station on his return from London : - </para>

                            contention was, that the representatives of the various Allied nations should advance proposals, not only in furtherance of the war effort, but also for peace-time planning. Last May,

                            <para>After this war, there must be none of those gross inequalities that were the aftermath of the first world war, none of that disgraceful contrast between great poverty and great wealth, and no vast bands of heroic defenders of our country walking the streets in vain in search of a livelihood. </para>

                        <para>If there are to be no beneficial results as the aftermath of the war, the freedom for which we are supposed to be fighting will be lost. All the statesmen in the Allied countries have been telling us what we are fighting for. We are fighting for freedom. We are fighting for democracy. We are fighting for the right to live our life in our own way. We are fighting to put an end to aggression forever, to inaugurate the reign of triumphant peace over all the earth. We are also 'fighting for something that is vaguely described as a new order, in which there will be no unemployment, and no poverty, but prosperity for every one, and more happiness for the whole of the human race than ever poets and seers dreamt of. It is nice to be told those things. Amidst the horrors and agonies of this worst of all wars, we must surely be entranced when we hear high authorities assure us that when Nazi-ism and Fascism have been laid low, those who have survived the slaughter and the anguish will have freedom and comfort. Yet honorable members opposite say that the aftermath of the war will be another depression. If that be the outlook of the honorable member for Darwin, I can understand his statement that there should be no enlargement of this Parliament and that he does not believe that such a democratic institution can function smoothly and successfully. The civilized world is passing through a period of very severe trials and struggles. It is fighting for its very existence against the forces of tyranny and oppression. If the democratic nations fail to achieve victory, and are denied the opportunity to plan for the peace, sadness and misery will be the lot of all. The Government has put in operation a plan in preparation for the peace that will follow the war. The budget states that a referendum of the people will be taken in an endeavour to secure for the Commonwealth the additional powers recommended by a committee of Ministers, consisting of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> and the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> The Commonwealth must be vested with the powers that it needs to enable it to institute what it regards as necessary reforms. </para>
                        <para>The agitation for the inauguration of a system of compulsory loans is deliberately designed to place on the worker the burden of paying for the war. When the war shall have terminated, and as predicted by the honorable member for </para>
                        <para class="block">Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir George Bell)</inline> unemployment will follow, and the workers again line up in dole queues, they will probably be told that they have post-war credits and are not entitled to government relief because those credits will enable them to live for twelve months or two years. I favour the formation of groups for the purchase of war savings certificates. For thrifty people who desire to lend money to the Government voluntarily, those certificates are an excellent investment. Immediately the war is over, purchasers should be allowed to use them at their face value as a deposit on a home under a Commonwealth housing scheme. If the Government makes a public statement to that effect, I believe that a large number of people will seize the opportunity thus to contribute to the cost of the war, secure in the knowledge that immediately the war is over and building restrictions have been eased they will be able to utilize this form of credit. </para>
                        <para>At Mascot there is an aerodrome, the importance and value of which the Government, apparently, fails to realize. It is building aerodromes for defence purposes all over Australia. Because of the inadequacy of the  runways  at Mascot, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Kingsford Smith could not leave it with his aircraft loaded, but had to load at another aerodrome. Many vacant blocks of land in the vicinity of the aerodrome that were formerly used by golf, cricket and shooting clubs, could be utilized, and by a diversion of Cook's River the aerodrome could be converted into one of the largest civil and military flying fields in the world. Mascot would then be able to cope with all the demands likely to be made upon it in the post-war period, and even the 70-ton international transport planes which are expected to be in use after the war could land there. The Allied Works Council should immediately proceed to carry out this scheme. It may be said that a military aerodrome should not be built near a capital city or in a vulnerable locality, but that argument carries little weight in view of the Tact that a graving dock is being built at Rose Bay. </para>
                        <para>Although the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> states that a food shortage in Australia need not be feared during the next twelve months, and that he is planning to provide against such a contingency, I consider that a special ministry of food and a director-general of agriculture should be appointed. The food supply of Australia is of sufficient importance to occupy the whole of the time of a Minister. At present there is co-operation between the various States authorities, but nobody has executive power to compel the States to fall into line behind the Commonwealth Government, and during the war period supply the foodstuffs that are vitally necessary. I understand that in the near future the quantity of vegetables required by the fighting services will be so great that civilians will receive only a very small quantity. The Government has advised people to supply themselves as far as possible with vegetables from their own small .plots, but the water restrictions already operating in Sydney make it next to impossible for citizens to grow the vegetables they need. If executive powers were vested in a central authority such as I have suggested, there would be some certainty that regular supplies of vegetables would be available. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to hear that. Despite gloomy forecasts of the Jeremiahs who predicted that the rationing scheme introduced by the Government would prove a failure, it is operating smoothly throughout Australia, and I congratulate the Government on the success of the scheme generally; but I draw attention to its adverse effect on hotelkeepers who have been victimized by a 33 per cent, reduction of their supplies, without an examination of their overhead charges. Each week they lose so much in carrying on business that it is impossible for them to remain in the trade much longer. Most of them are walking out of their hotels and leaving the breweries to employ managers on the premises. Many hotelkeepers who have been paying heavy licence-fees find that the rationing of beer and spirits has deprived them of so much business that their establishments cannot be carried on at a profit. </para>

I hope that the Government will give early consideration to the appointment of a house-planning committee, as recommended by the Joint Committee on Social Security. A national housing scheme such as has been proposed by the committee is long overdue, and should be introduced immediately. Many thousands of houses in New South Wales should be condemned as unfit for human habitation. A scheme should be inaugurated to enable industries to be transferred to the outer suburbs in order that slum conditions could be eliminated. </para>

I .should like the new Parliament House to be erected as a memorial to the peace that I hope will soon come with victory. The present building is only of a temporary nature, and could easily be converted into public offices. I congratulate the Government on the work that it has accomplished in the last twelve months. Its scheme for uniform income taxation throughout the Commonwealth is of considerable value. The Government will have my whole-hearted support. </para>

                            <para>.This has been described as an austerity budget, but I contend that that term Ls a misnomer because from some aspects it implies the antithesis of austerity. Action taken bv some members of the Ministry has shown an unpardonable waste in propelling government motor cars by means of petrol over long journeys which could have been undertaken by rail. A waste of rubber also occurs. Such a practice may be said to indicate the opposite to austerity. The budget should be called a make-believe rather than an austerity instrument. The Government is playing the game of party politics, for it has failed to stand up to its financial responsibilities, and is prepared to follow an easy way out of its financial troubles, which in this case is the dangerous way. Party and political considerations are being placed before the interests of the nation. Are we to believe that the Government is afraid to do what it must know is right, because that would be unpopular? A government must risk momentary unpopularity in order to serve the country's needs. </para>

                        <para>The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> in his budget, adopts the worn-out party tactics of using a few high-sounding and popular phrases in order to divert attention from the disastrous effect that the budget will have on the community. He plays with the words "freedom from fear " and " freedom from want ". I claim that this is the most alarming budget ever presented to this country, and, if the Government insists on adopting the inflationary methods outlined by the Treasurer, many people in Australia will be in want in the not too distant future. Undoubtedly, the budget contemplates a great measure of inflation, because, as it has already been said, a gap of £300,000,000 is to be bridged. The Government has no proposals for bridging it other than the proposal of the Treasurer, who airily says that the gap is to be bridged by loans, &amp;c. I imagine that " &amp;c." covers a mitititude of sins. The budget presented by the Fadden Government last year provided for borrowing £122,000,000. The members of the then Opposition, who now support the Government, stood aghast and shouted in horror. Yet some  honorable members to-day are endeavouring to take the borrowing of £300,000,000 in their stride, and they are doing it unashamedly. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> in discussing the Fadden budget last year, remarked - </para>

                            <para>A crushing burden of debt, which would be too great for Australia to bear, is threatened. I am not so optimistic as to think that a satisfactory economic structure can be erected on a foundation of public debt and interest. In making our financial proposals to the country we shall take care not to create a burden of debt which would crush our children and our children's children, but we shall do something to make Australia a great and prosperous nation. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">Yet to-day the Government of which the Attorney-General is a member is increasing the burden threefold, and is providing from revenue only 46 per cent, of the money required for contemplated expenditure. This is most unsound, and it will produce all the dire effects of which the Attorney-General claimed twelve months ago to be afraid. Taking last year's financial activities as a guide, there is no foundation whatever for the optimistic forecast in the budget for raising £300,000,000. Instead of raising £300,000,000. we shall be very lucky if we raise one half of that amount, leaving a gap of £150,000,000 which, added to last year's shortage, will make £225,000,000 which must be found by inflationary methods within a period of two years. Inflation is a great menace to this or any other country. Indeed, our £1 note has already depreciated very considerably. It is impossible to purchase with £1 anything like as much to-day as one could even a few months ago. The Attorney-General condemned the piling up of national indebtedness, yet to-day the Commonwealth and State debts are growing enormously. Last year, they increased by over £200,000,000, and the deficit this year, added to the existing debt, will bring the total debt of Australia to something approaching £2,000,000,000. Of a total war expenditure of £440,000,000, the Government proposes to find only £140,000,000 by taxation. I protest against this unsound financial policy, which will leave a gap of £300,000,000, for which practically no provision is made. The Government is endeavouring,to get a quart out of a pint pot. There is a great field of taxation practically untouched. This field, in. which the greater part of the national income is now distributed, and where most of the nation's spending power resides, the Treasurer is, however, afraid to touch. Every person in the community should contribute to the war effort to the limit of his capacity, and if this were done, the gap of £300,000,000 would be greatly reduced. If this is intended to be an austerity budget, it should provide for a full measure of austerity. The income group to which I have referred provides less than <inline font-style="italic">4</inline> per cent, of the direct taxation, although it receives 70 per cent, of the national income, or £590,000,000 out of a total of £850,000,000 ; yet the Government, rather than do the right thing, is apparently embarking on a policy of inflation. Inflation has been tried as an easy way out in many countries with disastrous results. Lofty sentiments on the subject of inflation were expressed by the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> when he was Prime Minister. While he was in England, he objected strenuously when some of his colleagues in Australia proposed to inflate the currency and to repudiate certain debts. This is what he said - </para>

                        <para class="block">Nevertheless, many more book entries by the Commonwealth Bank are to be made this year. In racing parlance, the Treasurer has shown a serious reversal of form. A meeting of the stewards should be called to compare the lofty sentiments expressed in last year's budget with the fantastic and  farcial  financial proposals contained in the present budget. I am inclined to think that the unanimous decision of the stewards would be disqualification for life. What is the remedy ? The Government appears to be politically afraid to do the right thing. The remedy is an all-party government. If ever there was a time in the history of Australia when the people should be united it is now. There is a definite call for a united effort by an all-party government. The present emergency demands that all sections of the community, and all parties in Parliament, should think nationally and act nationally. Honorable members who support the Government resolutely refused to be associated with an all-party or national government, and have failed to co-operate with the Opposition in the vital work that has to be done. At the last elections, the electors failed to give a mandate to either party to exclude the other from a share in the Government of the country, though it cannot be denied that an overwhelming majority expressed the desire for a Parliament pledged to the vigorous prosecution of the war. We cannot prosecute the war vigorously, and give our undivided attention to what should be a common cause, until we achieve some measure of unity among political parties. </para>
                        <para>I desire now to refer to the Department of War Organization of Industry, which most people describe as the " Department for War Disorganization of Industry". I recognize that many restrictions are essential, and we have no desire to escape them. On the other hand, some restrictions have been imposed which are not in any way necessary. In fact, if the department had set out to cause as much inconvenience as possible, it could not have been more successful in that direction than it is now. Notwithstanding the remarks of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehan),</inline> I maintain that the department was guilty of unpardonable bungling in connexion with clothes rationing. The Government appealed to the people not to engage in panic buying, stating that, when the coupon system was introduced, there would be plenty for everybody. Nevertheless, those who .did indulge in panic buying secured large stocks of goods. They got what they wanted, while those who were patriotic and did as the Government requested are denied many of their urgent needs. Moreover, no consideration has been given to varying climatic conditions and their effect upon the clothing needs of the people. There should be some differentiation between the warm and cold parts of Australia. For instance, a person living in Tasmania needs many more coupons than one living in Queensland. Probably, the Queenslander needs to wear his overcoat for only a few weeks in the year, while the Tasmanian needs his overcoat throughout the year. </para>
                        <para>I cannot understand why the Government imposed a ban on the delivery of meat, when the delivery  of  other commodities was not banned. Deliveries of bread and milk have been zoned, and there is no reason why meat deliveries should not also have been zoned. Whatever may be the position in the large centres, I suggest that there was no nee for this restriction in the smaller towns. The department could have attained its objective by issuing a regulation that petrol was not to be used in the delivery of meat, and that no one who was military fit should be employed on such work. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> heavy fine could have been provided foi breaches of the regulation. In most of the smaller centres, no one of  military  age or, at any rate, no one who is fit foi military service, is engaged in the delivery of meat. The work is generally done by boys, or by those over military age. Moreover, petrol vehicles are very seldom used. </para>
                        <para>It is stated in the budget that it is necessary to devote attention  to  the development of primary industries, and with this I agree. A national plan  foi  the co-ordination of agricultural activities is needed. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Rural Industries, after having considered the matter of the organization of primary industries, reported as follows on the 28th May last : - </para>

                            <para>Fully recognizing the urgency of the need for planned primary production, the Joint Committee on Rural Industries is unanimously of opinion that it is a war-time necessity foi the Commonwealth to have a definite directing and guiding hand in agricultural and pastoral policy. </para>
                            <para>For this purpose it is urged that a small but efficient federal secretariat should bs created under the strong leadership of a Commonwealth director of primary production to formulate and direct policy on a national basis. Such a director should be a forceful mau, of organizing ability and with a sound knowledge of Australian agricultural practice. He should be supported by a staff of practical technical and scientific men, including one well versed in agricultural economics. In consultation with federal departments and the Australian Food Council - of which he might well be a member - he should decide upon the requirements in the Commonwealth of the various primary products; he should devise and direct the policy that would lead to an adequate supply of such products, involving decisions as to expansion and restriction of crops and the guaranteeing of adequate prices. the director's functions should include consultation and co-operation with the State agricultural departments, and, through the State experts, to bring the policy to the farmer. State committees presided over by the Ministers of Agriculture should be established to implement the policy, and local committees should be formed to contact and direct the farmer, and, if necessary, help him to obtain essential plant, supplies and assistance. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">I agree entirely with that recommendation. It is time that something was done to assist the primary industries of this country along the lines suggested by the committee. Nevertheless, I understand that the Commerce Department has entirely ignored the recommendation. That brings me to the subject of man-power tor rural industries. A recent survey showed that the number of men working on the farms of Tasmania was 2,500 below normal requirements, which are 8,000 regular workers and 15,000 casual workers at various periods of the year, ff the drain on the primary industries is allowed to continue, production must decline substantially. I appreciate the seriousness of the situation confronting us and it is for that reason that I am apprehensive, because, if an ill-balanced scheme is allowed to continue, I am afraid that we shall have a shortage of food. I agree that we must maintain our fighting forces, hut it is also true that food is essential to the successful prosecution of the war. Not only our fighting forces, but also our civilian population must be fed. If I were to make a rough guess, I should say that there are 1,000,000 more people in Australia to-day than there were a few  years  ago. The American troops, evacuees and refugees from other countries, as well as prisoners of war, must be fed. At a time when our population is greater than ever, our production of food is below the normal output. We hear from time to time  statements  that labour will be supplied for primary production, but it is not supplied. Great difficulty is experienced in securing the release of men from the Army to carry out farming operations. There does not appear to be that degree of co-ordination between the Army and the man-power authorities which is so essential to success. I know of many instances of sole workers on farms, including owners of farms, having been called up.  Many  dairymen also have been called into camp, notwithstanding that they are engaged in the production of essential foods. It is true that in some cases men for whose release I have approached the man-power authorities have been released for rural work for short periods, but there are many such workers still in camp. As an instance of what is occurring, I shall read an extract from a letter which I received recently from a farmer - </para>

                        <para>Many dairymen have been compelled to dispose of their milking cows because of lack of man-power on their farms. Others have left the calves with the cows. I know of instances in which potatoes have been left to rot in the ground because the Army would not release men from camp to harvest them. Many primary producers have been forced to delay the sowing of potatoes, peas, and other foodstuffs through lack of men to do the work. Another instance of lack of co-ordination between the various authorities was shown recently when the Army required a large number of bricks for some essential job. The employees of the brick kiln from which the bricks were ordered were in camp, but the Army authorities would not release them to burn bricks. Such examples of lack of co-ordination prove that the scheme now in operation is ill-balanced. Unless these defects are remedied the results will be disastrous.

I agree with the ex-Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, that sweeping proposals, such as are indicated in the budget speech, require the cool, calm and peacetime consideration of the people and should not be decided in a period of emotional thinking.

Many of them have raised the old bogy of inflation, but their arguments have been answered satisfactorily by honorable members on this side. The degree to which the Government may tax the incomes of the people has rightly been referred to in the budget. The Government proposes to place the burden on those best able to bear it, but the right honorable member forKooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said recently that he was in favour of taxing incomes as low as 30s. a week. If a Government composed of members now in Opposition were in power, I have no doubt that it would act on his suggestion. The references to inflation would almost make one think that we were back in the days following the war of 1914-18, when ordinary safety precautions in financial matters were not taken. With proper safeguards, such as the present Government has established, the people need have little fear of prices getting out of control, or of money losing itsvalue. </para>

                        <para class="block">During the depression some honorable members declared that if the note issue  were  expanded by £20,000,000 for the purpose of financing public works, essential services and the wheat industry, the notes would not be worth the paper used in their production. The explanation which was tendered by those opponents of the use of bank credit was that a mote issue must have a substantial backing of gold. To-day no honorable member would support the contentions advanced during the depression. As those arguments were fallacious then, so the arguments to-day against the extensive use of bank credit are equally fallacious. Ample controls have been provided against inflation, which can occur only when there is fierce competition between private enterprise and the Government for materials and labour. When that competition hinders the Government in obtaining its requirements, prices must rise. Fortunately, the Government has provided sufficient controls to combat that tendency. For example, the prices of all basie materials have been fixed. A person is not permitted to build a home without first obtaining the permission of the Government. The supply of various materials and commodities to civilians has been strictly controlled. The demands of the Government for foodstuffs take precedence over those of the public. Ample protection is also provided against private enterprise competing with the Government for its labour requirements, as that can be another cause of inflation. Under the National Security Regulations, all labour, as required, is made available to the Government. Various industries have been rationalized and men have been transferred from non-essential to essential industries. In addition, proposals have been made to transfer 200,000 men and women from their present occupations in civil spheres to essential governmental works. In that way, the Government exercises adequate control over the labour market. Wages have also been pegged. ' Workers are not permitted to transfer from one employer to another, bargaining for higher wages, without the approval of the Department of Labour and National Service. The Prices Commissioner has fixed the prices of various basic commodities such as food and clothing. With all those checks on obtain ing materials and labour, together with the fixation of prices, ample safeguards are provided against the possibility of inflation, and people will not suffer as the result of the Government's financial proposals. For those reasons, we can discard the bogy of inflation that honorable members opposite have raised in an endeavour to condemn the budget. In my opinion the Government is to be complimented on its budget, though honorable members opposite have condemned the Ministry as if it was a greater enemy than the Japanese. The principal purpose of the Government has been to obtain a maximum war effort. We must hold Australia for our people. This country is one of the great democracies in the world. Australians enjoy the privilege of adult franchise, and if the system is not what they desire, they have only themselves to blame. If, at the conclusion of the war, the people still have the privilege of exercising a free vote as they do to-day, they will be at liberty to introduce any policy or " ism " that they wish. The matter lies in their own hands. </para>
                        <para>When the present Government took office less than twelve months ago, Australia's lack of defences was cause for alarm. Japan had entered the war, and our position was extremely grave. There was not one fighter plane in Australia. Without delay, the Government set about obtaining adequate air protection. In addition, the Government discovered that the Army had decided that the northwest of Western Australia, northern Queensland and portions of the Northern Territory were not to be defended against the Japanese. The Government was most dissatisfied with that strategy. It did not wish to allow the Japanese to gain in the north bases from which they could gradually extend their operations until they had complete command of the south. Accordingly, troops were sent to New Guinea, where to-day they are defending our frontiers against the Japanese menace. Our northern bases are amply defended against the aggressor. In order to carry out this work, the Government required substantial man-power to construct roads and aerodromes at the most vulnerable points, and to provide for defence in an emergency. For all those preparations, extensive works had to be undertaken immediately. Honorable members will recall that last Christmas the Prime Minister stated that the Commonwealth looked to the United States of America for greater aid. Prom that source, greater aid came to Australia. Considerable criticism was levelled against the Prime Minister at the time because he sought aid from the United States of America, but the right honorable gentleman knew that we could receive assistance more readily from that source than from any other. Fortunately, our hopes have been substantially realized, and hundreds of planes of various types now defend this country. But without aerodrome facilities, those planes would have been immobilized. The construction of the aerodromes constituted a major problem, because of our lack of suitable manpower. Accordingly, a vast army of men was called up to build aerodromes and strategic roads. Naturally, the Government was not happy at being compelled to take this course, but Ministers had to face realities. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> informed honorable members earlier of what took place in his constituency. Thousands of miners were transferred to defence works which were of far greater service to the nation than gold-mining. At present, gold is of no value to us. After it has been dug from the earth, it is simply buried in the vaults of the Commonwealth Bank. The Labour party is to be congratulated in its courage in transferring those miners to more useful occupations. </para>
                        <para>Large numbers of men have also been transferred from non-essential industries to the Civil Constructional Corps to build hundreds of aerodromes and strategic roads and railways. The men who were called up to do these jobs worked willingly, because the Government requested them to give of their best in the national interest. The conditions under which they are employed are a credit to the Government. Their remuneration is satisfactory, but honorable members should not overlook the fact that they are making great sacrifices, and are living in trying climates. The Government is grateful to them for their efforts, which will be one of the major contributions to the safety of the country. </para>
                        <para>The major problems of waging this var are those of labour and materials. Finance is quite a secondary consideration. The comments which honorable members hear when they visit their constituencies show that the public appreciate what the Government has achieved. In addition to defence works, adequate supplies of food must be provided for the armies in the field and the civilian population. An army will consume more food than a corresponding number of civilians, because the immediate requirements of the troops have to be met and ample reserves of stores have to be provided. In order to feed 100,000 men three, or even more, depots to provide against every eventuality might have to be established. For that reason very much more food is required to feed an army than an equal number of the civilian population. The Government has done a commendable job in that direction. </para>
                        <para>Our war-time problems are no greater than those which will confront us in the immediate post-war period. All the democratic nations are in difficulties to-day because in' time of peace they did not prepare for war. We must ensure that we shall not find ourselves in difficulties when the war is over by failing to prepare for peace before the war ends. I am particularly pleased to note that the Government intends to submit to the people by way of referendum proposals for an alteration of the Constitution in order to give to the Commonwealth wider powers than it possesses in peacetime. To-day, of course, in the exercise of various forms of war-time control, the Commonwealth has almost unlimited power. In order to defend the nation it can override the State governments. However, when that power lapses twelve months after the war terminates, the Commonwealth will find itself hopelessly handicapped if its powers under the Constitution are not widened. It shall not be able to provide effectively for the rehabilitation of the hundreds of thousands of people now employed on special war works and in munitions factories, as well as the members of the armed forces. We must make preparations now for the transfer of those people to civil life when the war is over. If this be not done, conditions prevailing after the war will be infinitely more difficult than was the case in the last depression. The Government is making arrangements along those lines. Certain officers have been appointed to carry out research work with a view to facilitating the transfer of so many thousands to civilian life. For instance, works of national importance which will require urgent attention after the war are now being tabulated. The Government has also appointed a sub-committee of the Cabinet to deal with this special problem. In addition, I believe that it intends to appoint a special Minister to handle this matter. It is much easier to organize a nation into an army, and to feed and clothe people in the mass, than it is to transfer the members of that army in batches of threes and fours to civilian life, paying special attention to the circumstances of each individual. </para>
                        <para>Bearing in mind the problems which will confront us in the immediate postwar period, I urge the Government to secure ownership of all of the vessels we are now constructing in order to ensure that we shall have sufficient shipping to transport our primary products to overseas markets. It is probable that there will be a scarcity of shipping when the war concludes; and, naturally, there will be keen competition for the shipping that remains available. Owing to Australia's distance from overseas markets, we shall have difficulty in obtaining sufficient ships to carry our cargoes overseas. We must now make provision in that direction. Overseas ship-owners will find it more practicable and profitable to concentrate in South America, because that country is so much nearer than Australia. For every cargo that can be taken from Australia to Europe, two can be brought from South American countries. </para>
                        <para>A report appeared in last Sunday's Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> dealing with the education of university students. It was suggested that, in order to enable brilliant students from secondary schools, whose parents lack the necessary financial resources, to proceed to the university, under-graduates should be paid a private soldier's rate of pay for the first two years, a corporal's rate for the third year, and a sergeant's rate for the fourth and subsequent years. The report stated that if a plan to bring brilliant students, rich or poor, to the university survived preliminary discussion, the nation's brilliant students will be enabled to proceed to the university, where they will be maintained by the State. I wholeheartedly support such a proposal. It will prove of great benefit to the nation. Today, unfortunately, too few of the brilliant students at high schools are able, owing to the limited financial resources of their parents, to proceed to the university. I recommend that proposal to the Government. I have advocated such a scheme for a considerable time. </para>
                        <para>I also draw the attention of the Government to the present rate of exchange, which is 25 per cent, on the Australian £1 . This was fixed during the depression. To-day, we sell all our exports at a discount, whilst we buy all imports at a premium. We are obliged to pay a premium of £25 per cent, on all imported material we require for our troops. Our imports index is rising much faster than our exports index. I have not the most recent figures; but a few mouths ago, when we were preparing a case for submission to the British Government for an increase of the price of wool, £160 was required to buy what could be bought for £100 at the beginning of the war, whilst we received only £127 for every £100 we received at the beginning of the war for our exports. Thus, at present, we pay substantially war-time prices for all imports whilst for our exports we receive only peace-time prices. I have seen contracts for the sale of supplies to our allies which show a loss to the Government. At the same time, when we buy goods from abroad such as cotton yarn, or tea, no loss is incurred by those who sell those goods to us. We merely make representations that we need certain commodities, and automatically we accept the prices quoted. However, when Australia sells goods abroad the purchaser generally quotes what price he is prepared to pay, and, unfortunately, it has been our practice in the past to accept those prices. The disparity between the prices we pay for imported goods and the prices we receive for exports should be considerably reduced. </para>
                        <para>On previous occasions I have advocated the imposition of a tax on capital. I prefer to call the charge a defence insurance premium. The Government has initiated a war damage scheme under which the premium is at the rate of 4s. per cent. That insurance scheme entitles people whose property is destroyed _ by enemy action to generous compensation. The principle of that scheme should be extended. A small premium, to be known as a defence premium, should be levied on all assets in the country. Income tax is levied according to capacity to pay. However, many people possess substantial assets, whilst others own only comparatively small assets. The war is being fought largely to preserve the assets in this country, and their owners should be prepared to pay a premium for the insurance of those assets through the effective defence of the country. The revenue derived under such a scheme could be used as a set-off against the loans which the Government is obliged to raise to-day. A property-owner who is able to pay the premium in cash should be required to do so; but a person who does not possess sufficient ready cash should be enabled to do so by mortgaging his assets through the Commonwealth Bank. This insurance would apply to assets of all descriptions. Where an owner is obliged to take out a mortgage, the mortgage should remain a debt on the estate, and transfer of the estate should be prohibited until the payment of the defence insurance premium is discharged. A similar principle is applied to-day in  respect of the imposition of rates by municipal authorities. Municipal rates are a charge on the property, not on the individual, and, if the property is sold, the rates have to be either paid or transferred with the asset. I suggest that the rate of interest on mortgages taken out by people unable to pay cash ought to be the same as is paid by the Government on loans, namely. 34 per cent. A person whose assets were worth, say, £30,000 ought to be very willing to contribute £2,000 or £3,000 as an insurance premium. People would count themselves lucky if they came out of the war with a substantial proportion of the assets which they possessed formerly. By the means I have suggested the Government could obtain substantial funds and I commend the scheme in the hope that budgetary provision will be made for it at an early date. </para>

                            (Denison) [5.47 a.m.J. - I have been sitting in this chamber throughout the night awaiting an opportunity to make a short contribution to the debate. I know that there are other names on the list before mine, but their bearers have spent the night comfortably in bed, asleep on the benches,  or  waiting outside until what they call " a press " arrives. The budget debate, of course, provides a field for unlimited discussion of any imaginable subject, and I suppose that it has its uses, but at a time like this the budget itself should be the only topic discussed- and all extraneous matters should be omitted. It is a foregone conclusion that the budget will be agreed to. The Opposition has not the numbers to prevent its passage, although it knows that by it the country is being ruthlessly exposed to an enemy within almost as bad as is the enemy without.

                        <para>The budget speech delivered by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> is a moat extraordinary document for a nation at war. It merely says in effect, " We shall raise a certain amount of money, and the balance of £300,000,000 or more we shall obtain elsewhere ". The Treasurer does not budget for it, he merely hopes to pet it.

In  3hort,  the </para>
                        <para class="block">Treasurer will be acting like a farmer who opens the floodgates and allows the water on his clover paddocks and, makes no attempt to drain it off thus exposing the clover to dire consequences. The Prime Minister is asking for austerity at the same time as the Treasurer is pouring money out in such a lavish fashion that austerity is impossible. Austerity is foreign to our nature and much more drastic measures will need to be taken before this absolute paradox can be corrected. I frankly consider that the people are steps ahead of the Government. They realize more than the Prime Minister does that austere living is necessary, but austerity will have to be forced on them before they will submit to it. They are, however, ready to be forced to submit to it. The Government is trying to administer this country on the departmental store principle that the customer is always right and must never be offended. But the Prime Minister forgets that the departmental store makes full provisions for this contingency in its calculations of profit. The Government, however, is afraid to impose severe taxation and raise compulsory loans because its policy is not to offend a section of the public. This budget, if it can be so described, is merely a time-winning effort on the part of the Treasurer, who knows quite well that, if the people do not accept austerity willingly, he will be obliged before many months to enforce it. He is evidently toying with the idea of compulsory loans. I should like to know of a better method of raising money. As a returned soldier of the last war I know the advantages of deferred pay, which I accepted in cash and found, very useful. </para>

                                <para>- All deferred pay was paid in cash. Bonds were given only in respect of gratuities. When compulsory loans were first advocated by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> some honorable members, who are now Ministers, objected on the ground that repayment could never be made. That is an amazing statement for present soldiers to consider. It is just as well that the Prime Minister has laid that bogy to rest. The danger, of course, is that he may not remain Prime Minister. I do not mind how much money is raised by bank credit provided proper safeguards exist to prevent its remaining in the hands of the people, because, if it be allowed to remain in the hands of the people indefinitely, we shall certainly have inflation, and the first to feel it will be those least able to stand it. </para>

                        <para>We have been informed by the Prime Minister that the cost of living has already risen by 18 per cent. Most of that increase has taken place since the present Government took office. It is still increasing and the rise will become more pronounced. I agree with the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> that a percentage tax .should be imposed after ordinary income tax has been paid. The honorable gentleman cited figures which, even if they are optimistic, provide for a direct method of bridging the dangerous gap. between revenue and expenditure. I cannot imagine a fairer or more equitable method. All the Prime Minister's fine language about austerity will be laughable if he is afraid to enforce it. The Government is playing a dangerous game. While the  Government  asserts that it is leaving nothing to chance in active defence measures, it is making no definite provision for the raising of the wherewithal with which to defend the country. The blood shall be on their own heads if Ministers fail  to  heed the warnings expressed by members of the Opposition. I do not intend to prolong this debate. There are numerous matters concerning the welfare of Tasmania which need urgent attention, but at this early hour in the morning and as others wish to speak I shall have to deal with them later. The next six months of this war will be so critical that I implore honorable members to stick to the point and let the Government do its job if it can. </para>

                            <para>.The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beck)</inline> criticized the austerity campaign and implied that it was designed for only one section of the people. I assure honorable members that members of the  working class Have been practising austerity day in and day out for many years. Few men on the basic wage rearing families can afford to buy more than one suit in every five years. That is the average, and that was about all I could afford when rearing a family. Remarks have been levelled against the Government by the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Guy),</inline> who came into this chamber in 1931 pledged to support the Labour party and its programme, but went back upon his pledges to the people of Tasmania. He voted against the then Labour Government and its financial policy, which was the same as that of the present Government, namely, that bank credit should be utilized to provide employment for the people in peace-time in the same manner us it has frequently been used in war-time to finance the manufacture of hellish instruments of death. That was the war policy to implement, in respect of which the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> admits that his Government used approximately £27,000,000. If it was good enough to use money in that way, it can be used equally well in peace-time, to feed people and give them useful reproductive employment. The attitude of the right honorable member and others towards the Government's policy is one of definite sabotage. They tell the people, with tongue in cheek, that they desire a united national government which will devote the whole of its energies to war purposes. How could we work with such a mutinous crew? I ask the people to analyse what this Government has done in comparison with its predecessor. I am quite sure that, if it does nothing more, it will go down in history as the saviour of Australia, particularly in view of the fact that, when Japan entered the war in December last, the Prime Minister, on the instruction  of his Government, appealed to the Prime Minister of Great Britain to send not only the Australian troops back here to defend this country, but. also to give us assistance, although we had never previously appealed to the Mother Country, but had in every war in which it was involved given our best. We always gave the Mother Land the flower of our manhood for overseas service, in wars about which we were never consulted. It was sufficient for us to know that the Mother Country was in trouble, and we sent not only our money and equipment, but our manhood to help it. On this occasion, the Government was told, to a degree, that we could not expect assistance, and that no transports were available to bring the Australian Imperial Force hack to Australia. lt stands to the credit of the Prime Minister that he said he would appeal elsewhere for assistance. He did so, and the  President  of the United States of America answered his appeal, but the Opposition criticized <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> for this action. Were it not for the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt,</inline> and the attitude taken by this Government, we should have been in a very serious position had the attack which was stopped as the result of the Coral Sea battle been made on this country. Every body knows that the enemy was then only 300 miles from Townsville, with a very large force threatening to invade Australia. We must pay tribute not only to this Government, but also to the  President  of the United States of America for answering our call, because I say quite definitely that we owe to the United States of America the fact that this country has not been invaded. Compare that with the attitude of the previous Government, which would never have asked for the return of our troops. It was prepared to conscript and send every body out of this country and leave it undefended although it was known that Japan would enter the war sooner or later. A protest was made by the working classes against shipments of iron ore and scrap iron, wool, wheat and other commodities to Japan. No notice, however, was taken of their appeal. Sydney Harbour was attacked by midget submarines, one of which I had the privilege of seeing three days after it was raised from the bottom of Sydney Harbour. It occurred to me that in ail probability those submarines were made from iron that had been obtained from Yampi Sound in Western Australia. In 1936, I pro- tested against Japan Laving a lease of a certain area at Yampi Sound, -which was handed over by the then Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> to Braeserts  a British company, which was allowed to deliver the consignments to Japan. It was a bogus company which acted in the interests. of that nation. One thing that stands out clearly is the attitude of the waterside workers of Port Kembla, when the right honorable member for Kooyong, as Prime Minister, " put it over" them that they must ship that iron ore to Japan. The Labour party, which was then in opposition, was sincere in its objections, but it was common talk among supporters of the Labour movement that the then Prime Minister had the Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister, in his pocket. The Prime Minister's memorable reply, which is a tribute to his loyalty to the people of this country, was this: " Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> nor anybody else has ever had me in his pocket. If anybody more than another has me in his pocket, it is this country of Australia that I love." Those were good words, and I pay that personal tribute to the right honorable member. Many men considered that the Prime Minister was, to a certain degree, weak, but he has displayed his strength through this Government in his attitude to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> when he said that he would seek assistance elsewhere. I repeat that, if the Government does not do anything else, it will go on record, when the history of this war is written, that this Government saved Australia from invasion. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> made some remarks concerning my constituents in particular, which comments I very much resent, because a more loyal body of citizens never existed. Statistics disclose that in the last war the mining community enlisted in greater numbers than those in any other. In and around the district from. Newcastle to Tamworth, comprising coal-mining centres and a good deal of dairy-farming land, actually three battalions were raised and maintained. A doubt has always been raised concerning the Australian coal-miners' loyalty owing to strikes, but twice the number of strikes has taken place in British and American coal-mines since the war began. The loyalty of our coal-miners therefore cannot be challenged successfully. </para>
                        <para>As regards the proposal of the Government to submit a referendum to the people, the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir George Bell)</inline> stated that he did not think that the people of Australia would do anything but reject the suggested increase of membership of this Parliament. In making that prediction, the honorable member is holding a losing ticket. When he was speaking, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> -asked him by interjection how many electors he represented, and he replied : " Approximately 30,000." That is about one-half the size of the ordinary constituency in New South Wales or Victoria. Federation would never have been achieved unless the people had believed that it implied the discontinuance of State Governors and ultimate abolition of the State Parliaments. That statement is true of every part of Australia except, possibly, Western Australia. I lived in that State for a number of years and am. aware of the arguments that were used there against the proposal to federate. One of these was that Western Australia had no land transport facilities linking it with the eastern States. Since then the transAustralian railway has been built, and, in more recent times, aeroplanes have provided an auxiliary service. As a matter of fact, Western Australia is not distant, in flying time, from Canberra. In any case, unification sentiment is growing in Western Australia month by month. I believe that an increase of the membership of this Parliament is absolutely essential to enable it to do its work effectively. If various State instrumentalities should come under Commonwealth control, the appointment of extra representatives of the people to the Commonwealth Parliament would be inevitable. There are approximately four to five State members for each member of the Commonwealth Parliament The present Commonwealth electoral basis does not give adequate representation to the people. Many services now provided by State instrumentalities could be provided by local-governing authorities constituted on a wider basis than those at present operating. I believe that, with unification, we could co-ordinate many governmental activities with distinct advantage to the people. In any case, post-war reconstruction makes unification, or at any rate a substantial enlargement of Commonwealth power, unavoidable unless we are to face a repetition of the chaotic conditions that followed the termination of the last war. </para>
                        <para>It is particularly necessary that the Commonwealth shall be granted additional power in relation to arbitration and marketing. The <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> appeal case showed the deficiency of Commonwealth powers in relation to marketing. The Commonwealth, as honorable members will recollect, desired to stabilize and organize the marketing of certain primary products, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> - he is no relation of mine, let me say - desired freedom to trade within the State. He won his appeal and the Commonwealth was rendered practically helpless to achieve its objective of orderly marketing. In relation to arbitration, we had a Premier in New South Wales - and a good man too - who endeavoured' to maintain the then State basic wage of £4 2s. 6d. </para>

Victoria and Queensland were both operating under a low basic wage and certain manufactures of those States were offered for sale in New South Wales under conditions which caused great hardship to the local manufacturers. If we could have a common rule in relation to arbitration awards, with a common basic wage for all States, a much more satisfactory industrial situation would develop.

                        <para>An attack has been made on the Government in the last few days on its compulsory trade unionism policy. Honorable members of the Opposition  must  realize that compulsion is inevitable in relation to the law. Every law passed by the Parliament involves the compulsion of some of our citizens. Honorable gentlemen opposite are concerned to retain the present capitalist system, whereas we on this side of the chamber wish to see it abolished. We also wish to see the workers consolidate their position. The slogan "United we stand, divided we fall ", carries with it a great truth. We speak frequently in this chamber about freedom and liberty. Where is our liberty under the law? It is true that we enjoy a greater degree of freedom than do people in totalitarian countries, but nevertheless, the law implies compulsion. Honorable members enjoy greater liberty, in some respects, than do other citizens of the country, but some of us have been suspended more than once from the service of this House because we have transgressed the Standing Orders which are the laws governing our proceedings. I believe that I have the highest record of any honorable member in this respect, though the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> probably runs me a close second. Government sunporters hold the view that whether a man belongs to the pick and shovel or the black-coated brigade, he is still a worker and needs the support of the trade union movement. The Labour party developed from the trade union movement. In the eighties and 'nineties of the last century the Labour movement was weak, and in days when members of Parliament did not receive an allowance for their services, the trade unions drew generously upon their own funds to provide sustenance for Labour members of Parliament. The Labour party was able, even in those times, to secure the enactment of major reforms, because it held the balance of power. In the early days of the movement, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, invalid and old-age pensions schemes were provided because theLabour party forced the issue; and in 1908, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom introduced a bill in this Parliament to provide Commonwealth invalid and old-age pensions, but he- was forced to do it by the pressure of Labour politicians. I make no secret of tb e fact that the Labour movement, as I. understand it, advocates the establishment of a socialist state, wherein production shall be for use and not for profit. When that day comes, international strife and bloody wars such as we are now passing through will be much less likely to occur. Many of the wars of years gone by were caused by trade differences and the attempt of particular nations to obtain profitable markets. A good deal has been said in this debate about the depression of a few years ago. That depression need not have occurred. Although many of our people went hungry in those dark days, there was an abundance of food in the country. Our granaries were full, and our bulk stores were bursting with surplus stocks. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer told our people that they must tighten their belts. The Labour Government that was then in office, but not in power, was forced to consent to a programme that was abhorrent to it for it was unable to obtain money to carry out projects that appeared on its programme. After the last war, every effort was made to meet interest obligations while people were allowed to starve. I say definitely and clearly that that kind of thing must not happen again. If  it is good enough for our sons to shed their blood, and even to give their lives, for their country, it should be good enough for the wealthy classes of the community to forego interest on money they lend to the nation to prosecute the war. When we are able to eliminate the profit motive from trade and commerce, we shall be a good distance on the road towards the realization of the brotherhood of man., goodwill among nations, and peace on earth. These ideals will be achieved through the unity of the workers of the world and they will be expressed through the Parliaments of this and other countries which will initiate reforms in order that the masses of society may live decent lives in reasonable comfort, and enjoy the products of their labour. Surely that is not too much to ask in a land in which there is more than enough to go round ! Yet, under the present economic system we have passed through periods of crisis, which have been accompanied by unemployment and starvation, while the stores have been bursting with the commodities that have been needed to sustain human life; but because they could not be disposed of profitably, they were destroyed. Will the soldier who returns from the present war consent to be subjected to the conditions that operated after the last war, when many men had to take up a swag and search for an elusive job? The Government has been criticized because it has commenced to plan for the peace. The Opposition has said that the present is not an opportune time for the institution of social reforms. I acknowledge that every energy must be strained in order to achieve the end that we all desire. At the same time, however, I want to inspire the manhood of this country with the knowledge that, by means of social reforms, they will at least be assured that their aged parents shall be catered for as the Government has already catered for widows under its widow's pensions legislation, and for families under the child endowment scheme. The people have confidence in the Government because it has shown its bona fides not only in prosecuting the war, but also in giving effect to its social reform policy. We are now budgeting for an expenditure of £549,000,000. What a tragedy it is that such a huge sum should be expended on the destruction of mankind; necessarily, otherwise we might ourselves be destroyed. ' The people will recall that during the Scullin regime a sum of £18,000,000 was sought to be raised in order that employment might be provided in reproductive undertakings that would have developed this country. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> hue and cry went up. A run on the banks was caused, and the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was compelled to close. Had certain interests succeeded in their aim, the Commonwealth Bank also would have been closed on the plea that inflation was likely to result. In war-time, action on similar lines is described as the utilization of the credit resources of the nation. Whenever there has been a shortage of subscriptions to loans, previous governments have allowed the Commonwealth -Bank to underwrite them. It' it be good enough to utilize the credit system of the nation in war-time in order to manufacture hellish instruments for the destruction qf mankind, the same system of finance should be used in order to provide the employment that the people require to enable them to purchase foodstuffs. We are well aware that after the war unemployment will prevail unless something definite be done to prevent its occurrence. Everybody knows that the advent of mechanization in not only the coalmining industry, but also every other industry, has eliminated man-power. The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> questioned the loyalty of the coal-miners, thousands of whom in the Newcastle area are shedding their blood and giving their lives for this country, which in peace-time could not provide them with a job. In order to escape from economic pressure, and to remove from their parents the burden of maintaining them, many young men left home, because while so housed they could not obtain the dole or relief work, the official view of the State Government being that they were adequately maintained on the income of £2 10s. a week earned by the father as a coal-miner. Those who, as in the last war, seek to profiteer in war industries and to draw increment from investments, must realize that the money they receive is stained with the blood of the flower of the manhood of this country, many of whom had never been given the right to work before they left Australia to fight. Their bones are bleaching on the battlefields of the world. I plead with this Government and Parliament to avoid discontent among the men who return. We must plan for greater reforms in order that those who have wealth shall be exalted by christian ethics into a desire to help the poor. He who gives to the poor, gives to the Lord. The existing system cannot continue, and we must plan for a more equitable one. </para>
                        <para>I direct attention to the 22nd annual report of the 'Commissioner of Taxation, in regard to fines imposed upon people who have lodged questionable returns. I refer first to the amount owing by way of fines, not only by living persons, but also by the estates of deceased persons. There is no hope of recovering that amount and the Government, instead of following the policy laid down by its predecessors, should endeavour to negotiate with these debtors with a view to arriving at a compromise. I should feel it very much were my father indebted to this country by way of tax, because of neglect, fraud or otherwise. I should regard it as my duty to try to liquidate the debt, if for no other reason than to prevent annual publication of it in the report of the Commissioner. I have gone to the trouble of consulting the Taxation Department, and have been furnished by it with the following figures: - </para>

                                <para>- I am pleased to be corrected on that matter, in which I had relied on a newspaper report. His understatement of income is set down at £36,000, and the fine amounts to no less than £60,000. or nearly 200 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">[Further extension of time granted.]</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> C. Trautwein was a member of the New South Wales Parliament, and he is 74 years of age. He was asked to account for certain transactions extending as far back as 1911, when he transferred a property in trust to a child three years of age. He also had to give particulars of transactions relating to transfers to his wife in 1916. I put it to honorable members that any man who does not try to make provision for his family has very little regard for those for whom he is responsible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trautwein</inline> admits that he transferred certain property, including some bonds, to members of his family. After having been in and out of gaol over a period of two years, he was released for a month in order to give him an oppor tunity to trace these bonds. He had accounted for all but £12,000 worth when the time expired, and though the Official Receiver appealed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lukin for an extension, this was refused, notwithstanding the fact that he had been released on the bond of £50,000, and had to report twice daily including Sundays. This is not prosecution, but persecution. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lukin, who refused the application, retired from the Queensland Supreme Court bench in 1926 on a pension of £1,000 a year. In the same year, he was appointed by the Bruce-Page Government to the bench of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration at a salary of £2,500 a year, making his income £3,500 a year from salary and pension. During the depression in 1931, he refused to accept a reduction of salary under the Premiers plan, although reductions were accepted by other judges and by the then Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lukin is in his dotage; he will be 75 years of age on the 4th January next. The Scullin Government recognized the viciousness of this modern Judge Jeffries, and removed him from the Arbitration Court bench to the Bankruptcy Court, where it believed he could do no harm. Even there he has earned an unenviable record by keeping women in gaol, and now by refusing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trautwein</inline> an opportunity to clear up his affairs. The Government should not hesitate to remove him from his present position, which should be encumbered with rejects from other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trautwein</inline> is an old man himself now, being 74 years of age. He is prepared to pay the amount for which he was assessed, hut the fines imposed by the State and Federal taxation authorities amount to over £300,000 so that if the property of the whole family were sold up - which this judge is prepared to do - it would not yield enough to pay what is demanded. The Government is in urgent need of revenue, particularly h view of the evident determination of the Opposition to sabotage the £100,000,000 loan. Therefore, the Treasurer should come to terms with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trautwein,</inline> and accept a reasonable payment. I exhort the Treasurer to require the Commission ex of Taxation to remit the fines and the Treasurer should also inquire why the Commissioner, in the exercise of his discretionary powers, treats some taxpayers so leniently, while persecuting others. The Government should give some measure of justice to members of Parliament, whether of State legislatures or of the Commonwealth Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trautwein</inline> was a member of the Legislative Council in New South "Wales, where ite had a record of which any man might be proud. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnson,</inline> though he was opposed to me politically, was a man who always stood up for what he believed to be right. He was a great Australian who, as a member of the State Parliament in "Western Australia and of the Senate here, took a prominent part in the development of Western Australia. Why, therefore, should his name and other names be recorded in an official publication among the list of debtors when they are prepared to pay their original assessments? He married late in life, and left a wife and young family. There was no time to prevent the inclusion of his name in the current report of the Commissioner of Taxation, but unless some action be taken it will undoubtedly appear in the next report. I ask the Treasurer to look through the report, and there he will see the names of many men, some of them, perhaps, friends of his own, recorded for all the world to see as debtors of the Commonwealth when, by compromise, we could eliminate the whole lot. </para>

                                have shown that we have already drawn on practically all our reserves of labour and equipment, and that the recent expansion of the war effort has been achieved by subtraction from peace-time production. I have made it clear that the further expansion of war activity means further reductions of the things that will remain for civil use. Expansion of bank credit, therefore, without a corresponding capacity to expand production, would increase purchasing power without increasing .the supply of goods and services. Increasing the volume of money without increasing the supply of goods for civil consumption not only creates the danger of inflation, but also sets up serious competition between demands for civil goods and demands for war requirements. Clearly, then, as further physical resources are provided by the nation for war, so must further financial resources be similarly provided from the savings of the people. This can be done only if every individual saved and contributes to the utmost of his capacity.

For the most part Government supporters who have spoken have condemned the Opposition for expressing views similar to those of the Treasurer in his budget speech. We on this side have said that no person in the community should be better off financially because of the war, and that those who gain some benefit because of war conditions should make substantial contributions towards the safety of the country which has given them so many privileges. The Labour party claims that trade unionism has conferred great benefits on the workers of this country. Surely honorable members opposite know that if the Japanese defeat us those privileges will be lost, and trade unionists made slaves by the Japanese. It is clear from the Treasurer's speech that the Government is of the opinion that the whole strength of the Australian people should be thrown into the fight against the enemy and that no person should escape making the contribution of which he is capable. In his concluding remarks the Treasurer said - </para>

However, the exigencies of the war situation will compel the Government to take steps which, so far, it has declined to take. I have promised to help the Government to the best of my ability, and have forgotten party considerations. I consider that the freedom of this country and of its citizens is far above party considerations. . The electors have returned the opposing sections in this House in almost equal numbers, thereby indicating, in my view, that they desire that the best intellects in the Parliament shall unite to resist the enemy and save this country. I regret, therefore, that the Government refuses to  co-operate  with the Opposition in forming a national government, but is utilizing the war situation to put into operation its own party political platform. In an " all-in " struggle everything possible should be done to avoid friction between different sections of the community. I agree with the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> that to ask the sons of farmers, who do not believe in the policy of the Labour party, to subscribe to that policy is equivalent to compelling a person to subscribe to a religious organization whose tenets he does not believe.

                                <para>- I am not afraid to say now what I said then. There arc many things worthy of serious consideration such as the unification of railway gauges, but I do not believe that the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth by means of a referendum on the Constitution is a matter for discussion at this stage. Any attempt in that direction will tend to destroy the unity which is so' essential at this time. </para>

In this connexion I warn the Government against causing further injury to the primary industries of this country.

                        <para class="block">At the present moment we have in this country a surplus of wheat, meat, and some other primary products, but that position could easily be reversed. We cannot continue to feed the fighting forces, the workers in our factories and the civil population generally, without adequate supplies of man-power. We cannot consume what is not produced. Thu Government should realize that the feeding of the people is as essential as the production of munitions. There is in this country a source of man-power which has not yet been tapped. It could be drawn upon to produce food. Throughout Australia there are numbers of aliens who have acquired land. I admit that some of them are naturalized British subjects; but most of them became naturalized, not because they loved the British way of life, but because it paid them better to become British citizens.  Under  present conditions they are able to say, " heads I win, tails you lose ". They are doing well because of the higher prices being paid for potatoes, flax, dairy produce, and other commodities which they produce. Australian producers of these products are not so favorably situated because in many instances their sons and their employees have been called up for military service. Consequently they cannot enter into contracts with the Government to supply primary products at high prices. But the aliens in our midst can do so. They refuse to work as employees on dairy farms because they can do better on their own account. In several parts of Western Australia, they have congregated in large numbers. They teach the Italian language to their children. They are together sufficiently long to constitute dangerous knots in the community. </para>

If the Government considered that the aliens should receive more than our soldiers, the difference between the two rates could be placed into a fund. I have no objection to that course. I emphasize, however, that this labour should be more fully organized. These Italians are cheeky, if I may be permitted to use such an expression.

                        <para class="block">This is proving to be a marathon debate upon a colossal budget. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and the Government have a tremendous task ahead of them, but when I consider their achievements during the last twelve months, I look forward with great confidence to what they will achieve during the current financial year. The Fadden budget of 1941-42 provided for an expenditure of £319,000,000, of which £217,000,000 was for war purposes. A few weeks later, the new Labour Government increased the total budget to £444,000,000, of which £320,000,000 represented war expenditure. The Fadden budget included a provision for the imposition  of  compulsory loans. Explaining that it would not be difficult to obtain compulsory loans, the Treasurer of the day stated that 2,780,000 persons earned salaries and wages under £400 a year. But he did not tell Parliament that he included in his calculations females, juveniles and members of the fighting forces. There are 450,000 persons in receipt of an income of less than £100 a year, totalling £30,000,000. Approximately 400,000 persons earn incomes between £100 and £150 per annum, totalling £50,000,000. Persons earning between £150 and £200 per annum number 450,000, and their incomes aggregate £80,000,000. In other words, 1,300,000 persons are included in the group receiving less than £200 a year, less the basic wage. They already experience considerable difficulty in making ends meet, without contributing to compulsory loans. In 1939-40 the income of 2,652,000 people receiving £400 and under per annum totalled £520,000,000. In 1940-41, there were 2,709,000 persons in this group, and they earned £560,000,000. The income derived in 1941-42 by 2,780,000 persons aggregated £590,000,000. Bearing in mind the colossal sum involved in the budget, I consider that it would be- impossible to obtain from these incomeearning groups, an amount adequate to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue. The Treasurer has budgeted for the enormous amount of £549,000,000, of which £440,000,000 will be for war purposes. But the national income has increased during the last twelve months by only £55,000,000. The Treasurer proposes to obtain £249,000,000 from taxation and other sources, and the balance of £300,000,000 from loans and bank credit. I shall examine the loan flotations undertaken by the three governments that have been in office since theoutbreak of war. The Menzies Government and the Fadden Government floated five loans. The first, which was placed on the market in December, 1939, was for £12,000,000, and was subscribed with the assistance of the Commonwealth Bank. Three months later, the Government floated a loan of £18,000,000, which was over-subscribed by £165,000. In. May, 1940, a further loan of £20,000,000 was placed on the market and was oversubscribed by £583,000. In November of that year, the Government floated a loan of £28,000,000 which was oversubscribed by £499,000. The next loan of £35,000,000 was floated in April, 1941r and was over-subscribed by £872,000. In  other words, those governments floated loans for £113,000,000 which were oversubscribed by £2,119,000. They had the assistance, not only of the Commonwealth Bank, but also of the private banking institutions. </para>
                        <para>Shortly after the present Government took office, it floated a loan of £30,000,000 which was over-subscribed by £4,159,000. In February, 1942, the Government floated a loan of £35,000,000. It was over-subscribed by £13,332,000. Last June, another loan of £35,000,000 was over-subscribed by £2,382,000. An analysis of those figures reveals that, although the Government asked the people to subscribe £100,000,000, it obtained £119,870,000. Does not that prove that a realistic Prime Minister and Treasurer of a Labour Government are able to inspire the people to support Commonwealth loans? I am confident that they will reach the souls of the nation on this occasion, and have nothing to fear regarding the success of their loan policy. </para>
                        <para>The Treasurer stated that he will ask the people to subscribelarge sums of money for the purpose of assisting to bridge the gap of £300,000,000, and the balance will be made up by national bank credit. This is only the beginning of the fight of the new method of finance against the old orthodox system. When the Scullin Government was in office in 1931, the Treasurer of the day desired to raise a loan of £18,000,000 from the Commonwealth Bank, £6,000,000 of which was designed for the relief of distressed farmers to prevent them from going bankrupt, whilst the other £12,000,000 was for the purpose of placing people in employment over a period of twelve months. The bank credit was termed a " fiduciary note issue ". When opponents of the plan raised the bogy of inflation, the Scullin Government announced its willingness to peg the basic wage at the rates ruling in 1929, so that neither inflation nor deflation could occur. The Senate took every possible step to defeat the object of the Government. It even summoned the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, to the bar of the Senate to tell honorable senators that the money could not be raised. The mat ter was then referred to a parliamentary committee for the purpose of defeating the will of this chamber. At that time, the Bank of England floated a fiduciary issue of £38,000,000. The notes for that amount were of a different colour from that of the ordinary paper currency. The Commonwealth Labour Government of the day offered to redeem the loan of £18,000,000 in a certain period. It was then that the bogy of inflation was first raised. It would mean the ruination of the country. Ever since that period, anti-Labour parties in Australia have persistently raised this bogy. However, when the Fadden Government proposed to employ £78,000,000 of bank credit, no honorable member opposite said anything about inflation. Yet, when this Government in its last budget proceeded to give effect to its predecessor's plan in that respect, they again raised the old bogy and prophesied the country's ruin. If we, as a nation, are unable to face up to this problem, what hope have we of defeating the totalitarian countries who do not worry about bank credit. The people of Australia who have been educated in monetary reform now realize what all this kind of talk means. They are not afraid of the bogy of inflation, and when the Government approaches them in the near future, they will not display any such fear. Honorable members opposite are always anxious to quote what Great Britain is doing in the prosecution of the war. For the current financial year, Great Britain has budgeted for an expenditure of £5,286,000,000, but has made provision to raise only £2,400,000,000 from revenue. That leaves a gap nine and a half times greater than the gap in this budget. At the same time, Great Britain's population is only six times greater than Australia's population. If it be possible for the people of the United Kingdom to bridge a gap of £2,884,000,000, it is not. asking too much of the people of this country to bridge a gap of £300,000,000. I repeat that the Government will again stir the souls of the people, who will respond very generously to ensure the survival of the nation in its present dire emergency. When honorable members opposite were speaking so much about inflation, I interjected on several occasions that the Government would control the monetary system. Instead of the- country being the servant of the money power, the Government would make money the servant of the nation. For too long, Australia, has been the. servant of interests and international banks. It is time that we realized that we must stand on our own feet and help the nation to achieve its great destiny under the leadership of wise governments. The right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> emphasized the decline in the sales of war savings certificates. I interjected that the reason for the decrease was that, as the lower paid workers now have complete confidence in the Government, they are investing in loans, whereas previously they subscribed to war savings certificates. I, myself, for instance, invested £100 in the last loan, whereas previously it was my custom to buy war savings certificates. Many of the lower- paid workers are following that course to-day, because they have complete confidence in the present Government. Honorable members opposite also had much to say about compulsory loans, They implied that workers in war industries are. now- receiving excessive incomes. In the man-made depression of 1931, hundreds- of thousands of our workers could not obtain a decent meal. To-day, most of those people are in employment. They are now able to buy the necessaries of life of which they were deprived for so many years. Surely, it is not too much to allow those people who have pioneered this country, and raised large families, and, in most cases, have sons and relatives fighting in the armed forces, to have a few of the little things that were denied- to them in their years of unemployment. In the existing circumstances, it is impossible for them to squander what little money they might be able to save. I have no doubt that they will readily place at the service, of the country any small savings they may be able to. muster. </para>
                        <para>The aggregate debt of the Commonwealth and the States at the 30th June last amounted to the colossal total of £1,629,000,000, or an increase of £203,000,000 during that year. That sum was made up of £718,000,000 Commonwealth debt and £911,000,000 State debts. That increase was due entirely to war expenditure. To-day, Australia is paying £1,000,000 a week interest on that debt. A few years ago, this Parliament could not find a few million pounds in order to place the workless in employment. It could not find £2,000,000 in order to implement the national insurance schema legislation which it had passed. Opponents of that scheme claimed that it would cause inflation. </para>
                        <para>Honorable members opposite also criticize our refusal to form a national government. It would be just as easy to mix oil and water as to attempt to amalgamate the Government and Opposition parties in this Parliament. The Menzies Government- held office for nearly two years. The right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> when he was Prime Minister, was absent overseas for four months, and the government of the country was carried on far more effectively during his absence. As soon as he returned to this country, intra-party strife developed in a fight for the leadership of the opposition parties. In one camp, the main contenders were the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> and the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen).</inline> At the lastmoment, the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> came up under their necks and defeated them for the leadership of the Country party. Later, he succeeded the right honorable member for Kooyong as Prime Minister. The disintegration of the Opposition parties was brought about, not by the Labour party, but by honorable members opposite themselves. When the right honorable member for Darling Downs assumed the Prime Ministership, he did not control a majority in this chamber. He had no guarantee of the support of the independent members. I deplore the sniping of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> which has been indulged in by honorable members opposite. That honorable gentleman entered this Parliament as an independent. The right honorable member for Kooyong declared that he had the solid backing of the United Australia party at the election at which he succeeded. The real reason for that was that the United Australia party believed that the honorable member for </para>
                        <para class="block">Henty would give it his unqualified support. He did so for one year, until he learned the actual state of affairs existing in this country. Possessed of a high sense of duty, he decided, in the interests of the nation, to vote against the Fadden Government. I believe that he is quite satisfied with the achievements of the present Government, and that he will support it so long as it remains in office. What would have been the position had a national government been formed ? Opposition members of the Advisory War Council could not agree among themselves as to whether the Australian Imperial Force should be brought back from the Middle East. Had there been a national government at that time, endless controversy would have been caused over their proposal that members of the Australian Imperial Force should bo left to fight a rear-guard action in Malaya and Burma. Of course, the Government acted on its own initiative, and brought back our men from the Middle East in order to defend their own country. Had a national government existed at that time, endless controversy would also have arisen over such an issue as conscription. The present Government will not approve conscription for overseas military service. It has approved the conscription of young men for service in the defence of this country. The patriotism of those men is undoubted. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has told us that an average of 6,500 members of the Australian Military Forces are voluntarily transferring weekly to the Australian Imperial Force. </para>
                        <para>I now propose to deal with the  vene- mous  allegation which has been made by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> against the Government that it is introducing compulsory unionism. Compulsory unionism has been in force in Queensland for a very long time. Incidentally, that State has had- for many years the highest basic wage and the lowest cost of living of the Australian States. If men from other States are required to work in Queensland, surely it is not unreasonable to ask them to accept the industrial conditions laid down in that State. I recall that before the Government assumed office, the honorable member for Indi received a letter from one of his constituents. The honorable gentleman saved that letter until this party took office and then brought it to light in an attempt to discredit the new Ministry, but the Prime Minister gave him a good dressing down. But the honorable member resurrected the matter again during this debate. He admits that young men have left the land to go into munitions factories where their pay is very much higher. The same thing has happened in South Australia. That is one cause of the sad depletion of man-power in primary industries. The conditions in industry that preceded the introduction of conciliation and arbitration, which came as the result of the united efforts of men who were prepared to make weekly contributions from their wages in order to improve their lot, were deplorable, and it is only right that those who derive benefit from the better conditions gained for the workers by the unions should be ready to make the trifling payments which membership of these unions entails. Honorable members opposite have referred frequently to compulsory contributions by unionists through unions to political parties. In Queensland, which is the only State, except Western Australia, where compulsory unionism applies, few trade unions are affiliated with the political Labour party and they contribute only ls. a member per annum to party funds in respect of their affiliation. </para>
                        <para>The Government has been attacked for its handling of the coal-mining industry and other industries in which strikes have taken place, but I point out that similar strikes have taken place in every other country. In New Zealand, Canada, the United States of America and the United Kingdom strikes occur every week. </para>

Surveying the political situation and the  prospects  of an early general election, the correspondent says, "Nobody disputes the Opposition's duty to direct attention to defects in the war effort.

                            <para>. - The criticism of the budget has been mostly on the question of inflation or the methods employed' to' raise the necessary moneys to carry on the domestic policy of the country and finance the colossal war expenditure. We have had much advice from honorable members opposite about compulsory loans. I regard loans, whether compulsory or voluntary, as an evil. I have never thought that either an individual or a nation can borrow its way to prosperity or even to victory, because the aftermath of borrowing is such that, not only those who carried arms on the field of battle, but also those  who  have borne the burden at home on the production side are held in perpetual bondage as a result of those loans. To my knowledge no government loan has ever been redeemed. Loans become to all intents and purposes a perpetual debt on the nation, for ever bearing interest. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>We have been told that the Government has introduced many reforms in the control of banking and methods of finance, but I find it difficult to discern where we have any greater control than we had in the past. I am one of those who subscribe to the view that finance is so vital to the nation and to the people that it should not be permitted to be controlled by private profit-making in- stitutions. I hope that the day is not far distant when the full realization of this truth will be forced home upon this Government or other governments, and that the necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the Government shall not be a power secondary to finance. I believe that that is still the position to-day. The method that is being used in issuing bank credits to-day is one with which I cannot agree. The issue of treasury-bills, which on presentation can be converted into currency, is substantially wrong. This money should be issued straight out without any process of this character. Not even the comparatively small rate of interest which is now being paid should be paid. I said that the loans were never redeemed. I say, therefore, that any undertaking that compulsory loans will be repaid after the war must be dismissed as not factual, because, .in effect, the paper which represents these loans is to all intents and purposes a new issue of currency, as the bonds are negotiable always. In addition to being currency, it is  curency  upon which the community has to pay interest for ever and ever. I could go into these matters in great detail, but I have no doubt they have been traversed by other honorable members. I do hope that the Government will have the courage to apply the financial policy, which I for one believe is necessary to save the nation from perpetual debt. I hope that the day is not far distant when those reforms which are urgently necessary will be adopted and that the present fraudulent system of finance - I cannot call it anything else - will bc abolished for ever. </para>
                        <para>With regard to fear of inflation, that can be very effectively controlled by rationing and price control. To the credit of the Government that control is proceeding through government instrumentalities, and I hope that it will be carried further and further. Rationing and price control are, I believe, as necessary in peace-time as in war-time. As far as taxation is concerned, we could go a great deal further and bring home to the people some real austerity. We could level down and bring about a state oi affairs where the people would bo approaching the economic level of those who are bearing arms in the defence of this country. If we had the courage to do that, we could bring about some real democracy by enforcing equality of sacrifice in the war effort. </para>
                        <para>I understand that a new commission is to be appointed to deal with post-war reconstruction. I hope that the Government will proceed with the appointment of that commission as quickly as possible and that it will soon get to work. Only in this way can we properly repatriate our fighting men when the war is over. I hope a better job will be done this time than was done after the war of 1914-18. The Commonwealth should assume the full responsibility for carrying out its own scheme, and make early appointments of those who are to carry out this great work, instead of turning the job over to the States. The Repatriation Act bristles with anomalies, a fact  of which every honorable member of the House is conscious. We all have been repeatedly approached by old soldiers whose bodies were broken or severely injured as the result of the last war, but who, because of the harshness and rigidity of the act, can obtain no relief. Too many of these cases have come before us. Whilst we are overflowing with sympathy with them, and the Minister for Repatriation also has often expressed his sympathy, he has referred us to the act saying, " There it is, we cannot do anything about it; the tribunal has said so-and-so ". Consequently, there is no relief for the poor old soldier and his dependants; once he has played his part, and the war has been won, we are very apt to forget what we owe these men and their dependants. </para>
                        <para>On the credit side there is also something to be said for the Government regarding the increase that has been made in the pay of members of the forces and their dependants. I commend the Government in that regard, and trust that it will see that, as time goes on and the men return, the fullest justice shall be meted out to them, so far as it is humanly possible. </para>
                        <para>On the credit side also is the action of the Government in increasing invalid and old-age pensions. I commend Ministers for that also, and although it has imposed an extra cost of  approximately  £1,000,000 on the Consolidated Revenue, in the terms of present-day finance that is merely a drop in the bucket. There is in Australia to-day one dangerous trend that we have to face, that is, the increasing number of our people who are going on to the pension list. It reveals the fact that our rate of increase of population has reached a dangerous stage, and that we are rapidly approaching a period when we shall have an undue proportion of our people qualifying for the receipt of pensions. With the continuation of the fall in the birth rate, that is something about which we have reason to be apprehensive. In this regard the child endowment system, which has been introduced, will be very beneficial, and I give full marks to the previous Government which had the foresight to introduce it. I hope that it will be amended and improved by the present-day administration. There is also something to be said to the credit of the Government in regard to widows' pensions. I commend it also for this reform, which I trust will be administered compassionately; if necessary, its provisions should be extended. The same remarks apply also to the maternity allowance. All these reforms represent progressive social benefits which must, in the long run, be of advantage to the community. </para>
                        <para>The development of the paper pulp industry in Australia is another matter of which it would be well to remind the Parliament and the Government. Here is an industry which has been set up, encouraged and nurtured by the Government and which, as I notice by recent press reports, has made a profit of something like £250,000. There is nothing wrong with that from the point of view of the company, but there are certain other implications in regard to the enterprise. Amongst these, I see a great denudation of our forest areas, with accompanying erosion, which, from a national point of view, must have a serious effect on our pastoral lands. There is no doubt that erosion has been accentuated, and my information is that it is increasing on a vast scale as the result of the operations of this industry. </para>

                                <para>- I thank the honorable member for Ballarat for that reminder. There is another factor which I consider dangerous in this connexion, and that is that this monopoly, which controls the industry of manufacturing paper and paper-pulp, is slowly hut surely securing a grip on the production of newsprint and other forms of paper, in the Commonwealth. The result in time will be to place it in a position to say what newspapers shall receive supplies of newsprint. The implication there is very clear, namely, that the power of this strong press group will enable it to impose upon people a further monopoly which will be used for propagating what it thinks good for the people, and nothing else. I mention that fact to the Government and sound that note of warning. </para>

                        <para>I refer now to man-power, and the lack of balance between what is required for the armed forces, for food producing, and for other primary industries. Those of us who represent country constituencies have had this matter brought particularly home to us. We have had hundreds of letters from farmer constituents who are placed in a most serious position in regard to the operation of their farms and the shearing of their sheep. Their young men have been taken, or have volunteered, for the Army or other branches of the fighting forces, with the result that sheep cannot be shorn or crops harvested. The old men and the womenfolk are left behind to do the best they can. .No one realizes more than I do that the defence needs of this country must come first, but hand in hand with that must go full provision to maintain the food supplies of the nation, not only to meet our domestic obligations and the requirements of our armed forces, but also to fulfil our obligations to Great Britain and our allies. I am surprised indeed that at the present time we are unable to make some gesture to our heroic ally Russia in the way of sending food supplies. </para>

                                <para>- I shall consider that suggestion later. There are also at present hundreds of thousands of new season's lambs ready for marketing, or coming onto the market. My information is that labour is not available to enable their slaughtering to proceed. The result will be a glut in the market, and producers will be mulcted of large sums of money by the depressed prices that will be offered for these lambs. In fact, in some cases there may be no sale at all. If they should be held back on the farms until such time as they can be marketed, they will have to be shorn. Here again, we are short of shearers, and are hedged about with regulations which I believe were drafted by persons who are not really cognisant of the needs of the industry. However, I am glad that the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> in response to a question which I put to him, announced that he was prepared to consider convening a conference representative of the interested bodies. From the Government's point of view these would be the Departments of Commerce and the Army and the man-power authority. I hope that if such a conference be convened, and those discussions t-'1-! place, some more scientific manner 0- allocating and distributing our man-power, so as to create a balance between the needs of the armed forces and those of the food-producing industries, without detriment to our war and defence effort, will be devised. </para>

                        <para>The effect of the war on the dairying industry, which is suffering a reduced output, is a matter of grave concern. The dairy farmers find themselves severely handicapped, and their financial position has greatly deteriorated. In addition, the Government proposal for daylight saving has imposed upon them an additional burden, and caused them great inconvenience. I have received many letters from dairy farmers on this subject. One writer says - </para>

                            <para>I am a dairyman with two herds on shares, and, as I see it, the objections to daylight saving are as follows: - We have to commence milking all through the season when daylight savings are in force, at least one hour before daylight, thus using extra electricity for lighting, and are at it again soon after 2 o'clock, which means that cows are shut up in the yard during the peak heat of the day, which makes them fidgety and they do not give their milk freely. All animals take their direction from the sun and resent unnatural interference. No amount of juggling with the clock will save daylight, or alter the courses of the sun, which is at its height at 12 o'clock. </para>
                            <para>I have heard numerous dairymen say they would not recognize it, but are forced to do so because factories, trains, &amp;c, do so, and children have to be got ready and sent off to school by mothers who have been previously in the cow yard, so that there is nothing else for it. </para>

                        <para>I could not conclude this speech without making a few observations on the wheat industry. Successive governments have tried, over a period of ten or twelve years, to help the wheat-growers out of the difficult position in which they have found themselves. I have frequently pointed out the seriousness of their position to honorable members, hut so far all the efforts to stabilize the industry have either failed or only afforded temporary relief. None of the palliatives applied have had lasting benefit. The new scheme propounded recently by the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> is already being undermined by the activities of certain banks and financial institutions which are seeking to increase rent3 and charges associated with wheatlands which they own. It would therefore he advisable for the Government to peg rents and values of wheat-lands without delay. Unless some such step be taken these institutions will undoubtedly rob the new scheme of a great part of its value. </para>
                        <para>I was glad to receive an assurance from the Treasurer a few days ago that the bill to provide for the establishment of a mortgage bank will be introduced almost at once. Perhaps the provisions of that bill may benefit the farmers in a greater degree than any other factor. Like other honorable members, I am curious to hear the details of the Government's proposals in relation to capital, eligibility for benefits, the period of the long term loans, and so forth. I trust that the new bank will prove to be of substantial benefit to the farmers. </para>
                        <para>Once again I emphasize the need to decentralize the secondary industries of this country. Unless some such action be taken, we shall never develop a strong and virile industrial community in our hinterland. </para>

                                <para>- If that statement be true then, by all means, let us then have a measure of socialization, for, to develop this country and to achieve economic security, industry must be decentralized. I ask the Government to take all necessary steps to give the rural areas a larger share of the industrial life of the country. The rewards of people engaged in secondary industry are much greater than the comparatively low returns of the men and women engaged in rural industries. It is high time for us to spread our industries over the whole country. Unless the Government is prepared to apply a policy of industrial decentralization, Australia will never become the country that it is capable of becoming. Even with the benefits promised under the new wheat scheme, a. farmer who grows 1,000 bags of wheat this season will receive only £600 for his year's work less expenses; yet many people engaged in the manufacture of munitions are receiving more than that amount annually in wages without risking one penny on capital or plant. Certain misinformed persons seem to think that the farmers are in a good position, but that is far from being the case. </para>

                                <para>- I trust that the Government will take the advice of certain honorable members on this side of the chamber and review our methods of finance. It should take its courage in both hands and introduce sound financial procedure. If it does so. it will win for itself a measure of immortality in the minds of the people, for it will have done something to restore financial freedom to people who have long been overburdened by the present financial system in operation to-day. It will also release forces which will enable us, by a united effort, to bring to a successful conclusion the tremendous struggle in which we with our Allies are engaged. </para>

                            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - Although I shall not attempt to traverse all the arguments advanced by honorable members in their discussion of the budget, I arn obliged to observe that a remarkable feature of the debate has been that, although the Opposition has spoken at great length about the practicability of the post-war credits or compulsory loan method of bridging the gap in the budget between estimated expenditure and estimated revenue, not one of them has indicated in any concrete fashion the degree to which the parties opposite would apply that policy. It is, therefore, just sheer financial nonsense for them to discuss the subject. In 1930, this chamber echoed with statements about the danger of inflation under very different circumstances from those which apply to-day. At that time, hundreds of thousands of men were without work in Australia and we had an abundance of goods, yet we were told that no money was available for public works and that any effort to provide it would lead to inflation. To-day our people are fully employed and practically the whole of our resources are harnessed to war production; yet still we are told that if credit be provided through the  central bank inflation  will follow,  I  have come to the conclusion that honorable gentlemen opposite are like greyhound dogs, which will chase anything that happens to look like a hare. Not one statement has been made of the amount that honorable members opposite would be prepared to raise by compulsory loans if they came into office. Wc are faced with a gap of £300,000,000 in the budget this year. Last year, when the gap was considerably smaller, the Fadden Government proposed to raise a totally inadequate sum by means of compulsory loans. Honorable gentlemen opposite have had a. good deal to say about what is happening in Great Britain under the post-war credits and taxation policy of the British Government, but only between £40,000,000 and £45,000,000 would be raised by post-war credits if a similar scale were applied in Australia. Those figures are quite reliable. In Great Britain, only 45 per cent, of the total war and civil expenditure is being raised from revenue. The honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> was quite correct when he said that the gap between estimated revenue and expenditure in Great Britain this year would be £2,SS4,000,000. Even allowing for the fact that the British Government has the benefit of certain foreign securities, Canadian assistance and foreign balances held in London, the gap will still be £2,100,000,000. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>A good deal has been said during the debate about the note issue. We have been told that it has increased by 96 per cent. Honorable members may be surprised to learn that the note issue of Canada has increased by 11'7 per cent. Much has been said, too, about the increase of the cost of living. From November, 1941, until May of this year, which is the last date for which figures are available, the increase has been just under 6 per cent. In the United States of America during the same period the increase has been just under 5 per cent., although America has not been at war during the whole of that time. </para>
                        <para>Honorable gentlemen opposite have  spoken  rather glibly about ways and means of bridging the gap. They should bear in mind that every country is faced with the problem which is at present  confronting us. I regret to say that I can regard as only pure political cant a. good deal of the talk that we have heard. The Opposition could have said, " If we formed a government <inline font-style="italic">to-morrow</inline> we would be prepared to raise £200,000,000 or £300,000,000 by compulsory loans". No such statement has been made. Its proposal last year was to raise £32,000,000 by additional taxation and compulsory loans. This Government since it caine into office has imposed additional taxation of an annual value of about £75,000,000. The previous wonderful administration proposed to 'bridge a gap with £32,000,000. From the bringing down of the budget last year by the present Leader of the Opposition, to the end of the financial year, the war expenditure of this country increased by £100,000,000. Despite that great increase, the treasury bills - or bank credit - issued to assist in the financing of the war totalled £7S,000,000. As a matter- of fact, as the right honorable gentleman himself knows, taking into account all the factors, the actual expansion of credit last year totalled only £55,000,000. It is desirable that these plain facts should be placed before the committee. It is of no use to generalize. The Government does not need to be told that if money is flowing out to the public at .a fast rate and there is a large amount in circulation for the purchase of a steadily, decreasing volume of goods, there is bound to be danger of competition for the goods that are available. That is evident to the merest tyro in economic .and financial affairs. What concrete proposal has been advanced by which the Opposition would meet such a position? There has not been one, but merely a generalization concerning loans. The Government is fully alive to the position. It has adopted consumer and supply rationing, to which the previous Government did not give a thought. The list of restrictions on supply, total prohibitions, sales by licence or permit, and restriction of imports, covers 183 pages of foolscap. It is perfectly true that some of the goods so controlled are still on the market. In a limited period the most drastic system of rationing supplies has been put into operation that perhaps either this or any other country has known. The Government is fully alive to all the so-called dangers of which men- tion has been made, and has taken definite and drastic steps to rectify the position in the manner I have mentioned. It will go as far as is necessary in order to give full effect to that policy. </para>
                        <para>I am sorry to have to say that I am satisfied that some members of the Opposition, perhaps subconsciously or unconsciously, have made statements that may directly mitigate against the success of the loan that the Government is placing before the public, and thus justify their advocacy of compulsory loans. </para>

                                <para>- The Leader of the Opposition has always been strictly fair. What will be the effect of the statements of honorable members in regard to inflation, if the public should take notice of them? Will the statements be of benefit to this country, or be likely to improve the position ? I heard one honorable member say that, the grass will be growing in the streets if the policy of the Government be continued. What is such a statement calculated to do? I cannot believe other than that it is the desire of some honorable members to- prove that compulsory loans are the only solution. The Government and <inline font-style="italic">the Opposition agree</inline> that a proportion of the money in circulation should return to the Treasury. The only, difference between us- is in regard to the method by which that result is to be achieved. I repeat, that the Government is fully alive to the necessities of the country and its citizens, and will take whatever steps may be necessary to keep the financial position solvent. </para>

It is absolutely essential that in committee the Treasurer  shall have the right to intervene at any time. That has been the practice in this Parliament ever since I have been a member of it. I believe, also, that the Standing Orders make that provision. </para>

                                <para>- I had not intended to participate in this debate, but I have been impelled to do so by the provocative speech of the Treasurer to which we have just listened. The honorable gentleman said that not one substantial recommendation had; been made from this side of the chamber, and that Opposition members had raised the old bogy of inflation. The first mention of inflation was made by the honorable gentleman himself, in his budget speech. In that, he referred to the dangers of inflation. Although he addressed his criticism to this side of the chamber, the most severe critics of the budget were members of his own party. By the sentiments that they expressed - several of them were given an extension of time - they showed that in many respects they entirely disagree with the financial policy of the Administration that they are supporting. Because of that, I take strong exception to the statement that no constructive remarks have been made by honorable members on thisside. I did. not absent myself from the chamber in order to have a sleep, but remained, in my place until 6.30 a.m. when [ left it in order to have a bath and a meal. So that the honorable gentleman may not be able to assert that no constructive remarks have been made from this side, I point out to him that the men of the fighting services of Australia are making a very substantial contribution to the finances of this country, in the form of deferred pay. In the Royal Australian Air Force, the Army and the Naval Service, this amounts to approximately £20,000,000 per annum. A single man in the Army who draws only £155 a year, including deferred pay, makes a contribution of £36 10s. in the form of deferred pay. If the Treasurer invites a constructive suggestion, I put it to him that he apply the principle of deferment to the payments made to members of Parliament and wage-earners, and to all other incomes. I submit that that is a fair proposition. If the Government says to men who are undergoing every imaginable hardship, " "We propose to keep back 2s. a day of your pay", it would be fair to say also to wage-earners and members of Parliament, " "We are going to defer the payment of 2s. a. day in respect of you ". Those who are living in comparative comfort and security are not asked to make any contribution in the form of a compulsory loan, whilst the men who are taking all the risks and are doing all the fighting are compelled to forgo 2s. a day as deferred pay. If the Treasurer sees any semblance of justice in that, I am astonished. </para>

I did no such thing. I merely picked out the assistant cook as the lowest-paid man in the crew. As a matter of fact, the average amount paid to the members of the crew was £96 for a fortnight, not £65 10s. - the amount that the assistant cook received. I am indebted to the honorable member for having given the reason for the very considerable increase of wages that was granted to the members of that crew. No Minister volunteered the information. The honorable member eloquently and spiritedly stated that it was because of the extreme danger of the trip, and the fact that the employment of these men was intermittent. I admit quite frankly that he went on to say that the Government had made an additional payment of ls. 6d. a day to the fighting services. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- In discussing the last budget, many honorable members expressed the opinion that the system of raising revenue by voluntary loans had been weighed in the balance and found wanting. When the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> gave notice to the public that the clothes rationing scheme, was to be put into operation, and asked the public to refrain from indulging in panic buying, sorry spectacles were witnessed during the three or four weeks prior to the date on which the scheme came into force. </para>

                                <para>- Scenes unparalleled in the history of this country were witnessed prior to the introduction of the clothes rationing scheme. According to newspaper reports, there was such a rush of buyers in one establishment that a shop-walker who attempted to stem the tide was bitten on one of his hands. Many scenes of that kind were witnessed, despite the appeal to the people by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Minister for "War Organization of Industry that they should refrain from panic buying. Obviously, it is useless to appeal to the people to lend their money to the Government voluntarily. Those who have sacrificed in the past will continue to be austere and to make sacrifices, whilst those who have been extravagant will continue to be so. "We cannot have an all-in war effort if we allow one section of the community to evade its obligations, whilst another section with a greater sense of responsibility and patriotism is prepared to make sacrifices in order to help the Government. The voluntary system of raising loans, to which the Government pins its faith, has proved to be a failure. </para>

                                <para>- I have attempted to make every war loan that has. been raised a success, and I am prepared to continue to do so. I did my best to build up the defences of this country when others were not enthusiastic about that ma tter. This Government has a gigantic task before it and I realize that it needs all the co-operation and help that it can get. Strangely enough, the most scathing criticism of its administration has come, not from honorable members on this side of the chamber, but from the Government's own supporters. If the Treasurer wishes to take any of us to task, he should at least pay attention to those on his own side who are objecting to his budget proposals. The duty of the Opposition is to give criticism that is constructive and helpful. Many members on the Opposition side of the chamber have put forward recommendations which could well be adopted by the Government. </para>

                        </continue><para>I draw the attention of the Minister for "War Organization of Industry to the great difficulty which will be experienced by graziers in disposing of their fa t stock unless the Government can ensure that sufficient man-power will be made available to handle it at the time when it is ready to be marketed. The number of sheep that are grazed on the pastures can well be left to the graziers themselves, but the Government will find it necessary to improve the organization for the handling and transport of the stock, if a great waste is to be prevented this season. I have been impelled to make these few observations, because I think that the Treasurer did less than justice to members of the Opposition in his reply to the budget debate. No member has spoken less or done less to hinder the Government than I have, but I do not like to be accused of raising bogeys that were not mentioned at all until the Treasurer pointed to the danger of inflation. </para></speech>

                                <para>- I have been a member of this House for as long a period as the right honorable member for Cowper, and I have had the privilege of occupying a position - that of Speaker - which gives me some justification for offering an observation on this point. It has been the constant practice to regard a debate on the first item of the Estimates in the same way as a second-reading debate. The position of the Treasurer is that he moves a motion, speaks to it, and at the conclusion of the debate has the right to reply. The point of order taken by the Prime Minister has been logically argued by him, and is supported by the practice of this Parliament ever since I have been a member of it. It would be contrary to practice to allow the debate to continue after the Treasurer has replied. </para>

                                <para>- The Chair was under the impression that as Ministers have the privilege at all times to rise, the principle would apply to the Treasurer during the debate on the first item of the Estimates. The Treasurer and the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald)</inline> rose simultaneously. The ruling of the Chair was not opposed to the Standing Orders, but it was evidently opposed to the practice of the House, and I believe that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> have stated the position correctly. Had I realized that the Treasurer would close the debate, I should have called on the honorable member for Corangamite when he rose. I have been advised- that the debate had been closed, but I allowed the honorable member for Corangamite to speak because he had been shut out owing to a misunderstanding. I now rule that the debate has been closed. </para>

                        <para>.- As the decision given earlier to-day upon a point of order was one of great public importance, I suggest to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that the matter be submitted to the Standing Orders Committee for review during the approaching recess. I have always considered that during the long debate on the financial statement, opportunity should be given to the Treasurer to clarify points that are raised. Very often new issues arise, and sometimes interpretations are placed upon the statement by outside organizations. The Treasurer is the only person who is thoroughly cognizant of all the details, and a further explanation by him is imperative. If my memory be correct, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce was Treasurer he dealt very fully with the financial proposals in a second speech which he delivered in the course of the budget debate. I am not in a position to say what is actually meant by the existing Standing Orders dealing with this point - I know only what has been done in the past - but I suggest that if they were examined by the Standing Orders Committee, which is an impartial body with a great deal of experience, this matter could be seen in its proper perspective. I point out that if it were desired that the Treasurer's second speech should not close the debate, it would be necessary only for some member to move an amendment, to which the Treasurer would have the right to speak. That, of course, would be simply inviting members to move amendments. I consider that it, would be in the interests of the Government, the public generally, and members themselves, and would improve the standard of debates, if reform along the lines that I have suggested were done. The Standing Orders provide several methods by which debates can be terminated should the Government so desire. Those methods are explicit and direct, and it would be far better to employ one of them than to use a cumbersome and indirect method. My views on all-night sittings have been welT known for many years. I am in favour of the use of the guillotine, provided a reasonable time is allocated to each subject, and I should be prepared to support its use with a view to obviating all-night .sittings. That, however, is apart from the original question to which I addressed myself, namely, that the Treasurer should be permitted to intervene in the debate on the financial statement, in the same way as a Minister may intervene when the estimates for his department are under discussion. </para>

                        <para>. - I was not present this morning when the point of order to which the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has referred was raised; therefore I may not be quite familiar with the exact point in dispute. However, my own view of the Standing Orders, as distinct from the general practice, is that the Treasurer has the right to speak a second time. That is exactly what the right honorable member for Cowper wishes. I understand that the question that arose this morning was whether in speaking a second time, the Treasurer would close the debate. That is another matter. My view is that he would not close the debate. </para>

                    <para>Sit GEORGE BELL. - I realize that. There, the question of practice has to be considered. In my opinion the Standing Orders, if interpreted strictly, give the Treasurer the right to speak a second time, but in speaking a second time he would close the debate. This question has arisen before in this chamber. In 1929 the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce, claimed the right to speak a second time in the course of a similar debate. My view was that he had the right to do so, but the question which then arose was whether in speaking a second time he did or did not close the debate. That is the only point at issue so far as I can understand the Standing Orders. The practice in this Parliament in discussing the 'first item of the Estimates has been to permit a general debate, as if on a substantive motion, and for the Treasurer to speak in reply, but the Standing Orders do not specify that. Therefore my view is that what has .been requested by the right honorable member for Cowper is strictly in accord with the Standing Orders. </para>

                        <para>. -  I shall be glad to submit this matter to the Standing Orders Committee for consideration during the recess, together with quite a number of other aspects of procedure, which I consider require restatement, and, in some instances, clarification. I think that certain rules may be required in order that practice may be made clear, and I shall be glad to request the Standing Orders Committee to consider this matter. With reference to the episode which occurred this morning, all that I have to say is that the practice as I understand it is that the first item on the Estimates is regarded as admitting of a discussion, analogous to that which would mark consideration of the second reading of a bill. Such a discussion may cover, not only the range of everything that is in the budget statement and the Estimates, but also matters that are beyond them, which means that it may be much wider than a second-reading debate. Also, the practice is that the Treasurer, who has introduced the Estimates, may speak in reply, and his reply closes the debate. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. That the detailed consideration of the Estimates is not involved is made clear by the fact that we are now dealing with the re- mainder of the first item. At this stage the Treasurer is free to speak any number  of times, as is any other Minister when the Estimates for his department are under discussion. That is to say, he can answer every critic immediately if he feels so disposed, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> will give him the call. If that practice were adopted in respect of the consideration of the first item as such, we should have the extraordinary procedure, as each honorable member who had criticized the Government sat down, of the Treasurer rising to reply to him. That would be rather ridiculous, and therefore practice has given to us a form of procedure which, until a standing order explicitly deals with the matter, ought to be observed in the interests of efficient and satisfactory parliamentary deliberation. </para>

For example, the cost per cabled word from Chungking to Australia is 7s. as compared with 71/2d. from Britain to Australia. The difficulty of maintaining ordinary communications has greatly increased since Japan entered the war, and there has been a large increase of the volume of cable communications between this Government and the Australian Minister at Chungking. That increase applies not only to this legation, but also to the Australian Legation in the United States of America. </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This regulation shall not come into operation until a date not earlier than the first day of July, 1042, fixed in that behalf by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament  or  by an Act of  the  Parliament. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is still the position. As these regulations stand, there is an intimation that a tax may come into operation as the result of a resolution or act of Parliament. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have made official statements to the effect that the Government will not proceed with this taxing proposal. In those circumstances, the regulations should be repealed. I take this view because the warning implicit in these regulations will stand until they are repealed. No official announcement, even by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer, can have any effect so far as the obligations and responsibilities of companies are concerned. I admit that the regulations and the plan that was contemplated can not operate unless there is a resolution or an act of Parliament. However, the warning effect of the regulations will be operative until they are withdrawn. If the Government changed its mind at any time and if a resolution of both Houses or an act of Parliament were passed for the purpose of introducing a tax upon profits in excess of 4 per cent., the effect would be that companies that had distributed more than 4 per cent, since the 1st July, 1942, would have done so wrongly, and with full knowledge of the warning contained in the regulations, which are still in operation. The companies would not be able to plead successfully that they had considered themselves to be liberated from their obligation by reason of announcements made by the head of the Government or by the Treasurer. The position should be clarified, because the existence of the regulations is a source of considerable worry to a number of companies. </para>

Against that saving, however, general expenses have been increased. Following the introduction of the war tax, approximately 1,000,000 new assessments were issued during the last financial year. The honorable member will note that increases of expenditure appear to be 'balanced by economies. </para>

                        <para>. - The vote for the payment of services rendered in connexion with the sale of tax instalments stamps amounts to £67,000, compared with an expenditure of £52,197 last year. I should like the Treasurer to explain that increase. I also direct attention to an anomaly in the administration of the sales tax law. For example, a well-known and reputable authority on gardening and farming recently published a number of text books which the Department of Agriculture in New South Wales accepted as most up-to-date literature on these subjects. Because the author advertised his seeds and plants in these text books, the Commissioner of Taxation ruled that proceeds from the sales of the literature shall be subject to sales tax. But the author was told that he would be at liberty to advertise, without the obligation to pay sales tax, the seeds and plants of other horticulturists. I ask the Treasurer to rectify that inequity. </para>

So far as I can discover, the Estimates contain no provision for expenditure by that committee. I emphasize the vital urgency for speed in this matter. In my opinion, the subject cannot be properly handled when four busy Ministers are expected to divide their time between winning the war and planning for the peace. This work should devolve upon a special Minister. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> suggested the appointment of a Minister for Post-War Reconstruction and Economic Re-organization, and I agree that one Minister should have the sole responsibility for organizing the resources of the country to re-absorb men and women into remunerative employment. Although that Minister would probably find that every member of this Parliament is far too busy with assisting to win the war to be able to devote any time to post-war reconstruction, there are members of the State parliaments and the various municipalities, as well as many men and women holding representative positions, who are most anxious to do everything within their power to prepare the way for the return of the country to peace-time conditions. Every person who has some contribution to offer should be able to place his views and services at the disposal of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. I cite the example of beleaguered England, where, in spite of anxiety about grave shipping losses, and the "blitz", the Government is still able to consider post-war planning. Various committees are engaged in . examining particular problems, and from time to time abridged reports of their activities are published in the Australian press. I am afraid that if this work is left to the scant consideration that four Ministers can devote to it and until the Commonwealth Parliament is clothed with wider powers, valuable time will be lost in tackling this all-important problem. </para>

                            <para>- I bow to your ruling. I do not desire to discuss the general subject of reconstruction. I merely seek to draw the attention of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to the fact that, whilst his budget speech referred to this subject, no provision is made for it in the Estimates. There is much to be said in favour of creating a special ministry to deal with post-war reconstruction. At any rate, the Government should appoint a body of experts who would devote their whole attention to it. The press reported last week that provision had been made in Great Britain for the erection of 4,000,000 homes for the people and that plans were now being drawn. Whatever be the ministerial direction of the .postwar reconstruction, two things stand out, first, the necessity for hard work, and, secondly, the necessity for the provision of funds. The social security of the people is one of the objectives for which we are fighting. I support what has been said on this subject by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell).</inline> The Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> should state the policy of the Government on this matter. </para>

The Commonwealth Government is taking over the functions of some of the State taxation departments, which have hitherto collected income tax on its behalf. I hope that this change-over will not result in a repetition in the taxation office of what happened in the Allied Works Council, and that there will not be expenditure on refurnishing and reequipping the taxation offices. What  wa3  good enough for the State taxation offices should be good enough for the Commonwealth. </para>

Had it not been for the substantial increase of £6,000 in reimbursements to this branch from war services the increase would have been £14,000. I was under the impression, as, I believe, were other honorable members, that a good deal of the work of this office had been set aside owing to war conditions. For example, preparatory work in connexion with the taking of the periodical census has been entirely discontinued. Another item in which additional expenditure has been incurred relates to salaries of temporary and casual employees, the increase being about £8,000. Is it not a fact that the Commonwealth Statistician has been seconded for war work and that the services of State officers are being used temporarily? There is also an inexplicable increase from £6,000 to £10,000 under the heading " Hire, service and maintenance of machines for tabulation of trade and other statistics ". I know that some wonderful machines are used in this branch, but a great many of them would be required, surely, to justify an expenditure of £10,000. </para>

                        <para>.- I deplore the fact that no provision has been made to organize work in connexion with post-war reconstruction. I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> and other speakers that it is unreasonable to expect Cabinet Ministers to undertake this urgent work in addition to other duties which inevitably fall upon them in times like these. I believe that a special Minister should be appointed to supervise and co-ordinate investigations of post-war reconstruction. That, of course, would involve provision for his remuneration. I also impress upon the Prime Minister the advisability of appointing a committee of experts to investigate and report upon this subject. The honorable member for Melbourne suggested that members of State parliaments and of municipal councils and other local governing bodies could be drawn upon to do this work. I cannot quite follow his contention in that respect; nevertheless, I am sure that many people in Australia who possess the requisite organizing ability would be glad to undertake duties of this description. </para>

                        <para>. - The greater part of the expenditure incurred in connexion with the matters mentioned by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard),</inline> and the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> is met from the administrative vote for the Prime Minister's Department. It is the regular practice for expenditure in connexion with royal commissions and committees of various kinds appointed to undertake investigational work to be met from the Prime Minister's vote, for the reason that usually matters of policy are involved in the inquiries that are ordered. Honorable gentlemen may rest assured that the post-war reconstruction work begun by the previous Government is being continued. It will be found, on examining the Estimates, that the proposed vote for the Department of Labour and National Service shows an increase of about £100,000 over the expenditure actually incurred last year. A good deal of this is required for salaries, though I do not suggest that it all has relation to social reconstruction activities. I remind honorable members also that the Tariff Board is making an investigation of secondary industries, which has some association with reconstruction. The vote to cover such expenditure is included in the amount allocated to the Department of Trade and Customs. The Joint Committee on Social Security also is inquiring into certain aspects of the subject and its expenses in that connexion are being met from the vote for the Prime Minister's Department. The absence of a special item for "social reconstruction " does not mean that the Government is inactive in relation to that subject. It is not intended, at this stage, to establish a Ministry of Social Reconstruction. Our first duty is to draw together the threads of the various inquiries that are being made into the issues involved, in order to ascertain exactly what needs to be done to achieve the best results. These general questions have been distributed by the Cabinet sub-committee among various Ministers for inquiry and report, but primarily I, as Prime Minister, am responsible for government policy on the subject. Until we obtain some better factual information it would be useless to develop a beautiful plan, for there would be little foundation for it. </para>

                        <para>.- I ask the Treasurer whether it would be possible to make arrangements for subscriptions to war loans to be applied, in certain cases when the necessity arises, for the payment of death duties? This subject has been brought to my notice by persons who have contributed to previous loans and are anxious to contribute towards the current one. An obligation rests upon property-owners and people who possess other wealth to make provision for the payment of death duties, and I am informed that it would contribute substantially to the ability of such people to subscribe to this war loan if a provision could be included in the conditions which would make it practicable for their subscriptions to be applied, if necessary, to the payment of death duties. The absence of such a provision is retarding contributions by persons who are anxious to contribute. </para>

He interviewed a roundsman of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sun,</inline> sent for certain papers, and discussed the matter with Lieutenant-Colonel Wake. He arrived at the following conclusion: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The papers show that the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> who was acting during my absence as Minister responsible for security matters, was not consulted and gave no instructions. On this particular occasion, therefore, the great powers vested insecurity officers were used unreasonably and capriciously. The article objected to contained onlya mild criticism. But the certificate that the production of the press telegram was required in the interests of justice was inaccurate because, so far as I can see, it was never suggested from the first to last that any criminal offence had been committed. </para>

                    <para class="block">Then the right honorable gentleman went on to say that in future steps would be taken to ensure that similar requests for information would be acceded to only when they affected matters of security. The background to this matter is that the Department of Public Relations, which was established within the Army, was not regarded in too friendly a light by the Department of Information. The Minister made an investigation which, he will agree, was <inline font-style="italic">ex parte.</inline> So far as I have been able to learn, he did not make any inquiries from the Secretary of the Army, or from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox.</inline> I now ask him whether it is not a fact that the real trouble was, not so much that a newspaper reporter, in the course of his duties obtained certain information, but that a document marked " Secret and confidential " found its way without authority to another department. He will agree, I am sure, that there is reason for concern that this should have happened. I am not questioning his finding regarding the issue between the newspaperman and the detectives - I agree with the Minister's view on that matter - but I ask him whether the facts are not as I have indicated. If so, it is a matter of prime concern, and I should want to know why no action has been  taken against the man who, without authority, saw the document and, without authority, revealed it to a person in another department for the purpose of supporting the Department of Information. </para>

                        <para>. - I am concerned with the fact that expenditure is increasing in several of the departments, other than war departments. The Estimates for four .of the five departments which have so far been considered show increased expenditure of more than £500,000 as compared with last year, and they are minor war departments. This has been called an austerity budget, and I suggest that a good deal of money could be saved by paring expenditure within the departments. Quite obviously, that lias not been done. In the Crown Solicitor's Office, for instance, there has been an increase of £18,000 over last year's expenditure. I do not think that increases of that kind can be justified at a time like this. </para>

                            <para>- I am not selecting the Attorney-General's Department in particular; there have been increases of expenditure in other departments, also. However, in the Attorney-General's Department there is an increase of about £6,000 for the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. It has been pointed out in the course of discussion in this chamber that the functions of the Arbitration Court are being assumed by Ministers of the Crown. They are making some of the decisions which the court should have made; they are putting aside the awards of the court in some instances, and in others are placing their own interpretation upon awards. They are ignoring the rulings of the court upon such matters as preference to unionists, and yet the vote for the court is £6,000 more than the expenditure last year. Is this to be regarded as an indication that Ministers have at last seen the error of their ways, and from now on are prepared to allow the court to do its own proper work? If so, I do not begrudge the expenditure of this additional £6,000. However, if Ministers propose to continue to usurp the powers of the court, I cannot see any reason for the increased expenditure. </para>

                        <para>.- The Estimates show substantial increases of the provision for salaries and allowances in almost every branch of the Attorney-General's Department. For the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration the increase is between £5,000 and £6,000, and for the bankruptcy branch the increase is £2,000. Seeing that there is such a shortage of man-power, I suggest that a close watch be kept upon the staffing of the various departments. I realize that, since his return from England, the right honorable gentleman has not had much time in which to deal with these matters, but I hope that he will give immediate attention to my remarks about the seriousness of the man-power position. </para>

I appreciate the honorable member's view, and I agree with some of his comments. The thing that struck me as being wrong was the attempt to use security officers to interrogate newspaper reporters over a matter that seemed at first glance to be trivial. Later, a new aspect was revealed, much along the lines stated by the honorable member, who has expressed the Army's view. I shall look into the matter again. </para>

I shall investigate the matter again and see what can be done. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> voiced a general criticism that there was an increase of estimated expenditure in the Attorney-General's Department. This department is concerned with law enforcement, and the whole field of Commonwealth law has extended enormously since the outbreak of war, and will continue to do so. The large numbers of regulations promulgated under the National Security Act have to be administered and enforced, and this work is the responsibility of the Attorney-General's Department. </para>

                            <para>- The Solicitor-General informs me that there have been probably between 4,000 and 5,000 national security prosecutions since the outbreak of war. The number is regularly increasing. The honorable members for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> and Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marwick)</inline> referred to the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the increase of its vote by about £5,000. A  deputy  industrial registrar has been  appointed at Adelaide at a salary of £755 per annum. Honorable members know of the great increase of war establishments in that city. This has necessitated the special appointment of an industrial registrar. The department also had to appoint five additional inspectors, at a total annual cost of £2,110. When the Commonwealth takes industrial matters generally within its jurisdiction, as it must do in time of war in order to assist war production, new inspectors must be appointed.

                    <para class="block">Adelaide, aud the engagement on loan of officers from other departments, will account for an additional £5,618 per annum. I appreciate the comments of the honorable member for Swan about  man-power.  In both of the departments Which I am administering, the departmental heads insist upon releasing every possible man who could be employed more profitably in war service. I assure the honorable member that that policy will continue. So far as bankruptcy administration is concerned, there has been a decrease of expenditure as compared with the previous year. </para>
                    <para>Until the establishment of branches of the Crown Solicitor's office in the various capital cities, the department engaged solicitors and briefed counsel if cases were taken to court. The fees were borne by the Commonwealth departments that were involved in the cases, and appeared under their votes. The Government considered that greater efficiency and expedition would be achieved, especially in war-time, if the work were controlled directly by the Crown Solicitor's office. Although that new practice has increased the vote in this division of the Estimates, there are consequential decreases in the votes of other departments. </para>

                        <para>.- The reply which the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> gave to the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> indicates a departure in procedure that involves an invasion of the rights of citizens. Certain members of the Security Service considered that they possessed the right to ascertain the identity of a person who sent a particular telegram, and to interrogate pressmen who were associated with its transmission. These disclosures indicate how close methods in Australia are getting to those of the Gestapo. Evidently, some official was annoyed by a leakage of information. A meeting was held in Melbourne, and certain persons who had not been invited to attend obtained information about it, and a newspaper published certain facts concerning it. Although the news was not likely to be of value to the enemy, or to endanger the country, some official in a moment of pique declared that the person responsible must be discovered, so that, if necessary, appropriate action could be taken against him. </para>

                    <para>I am not happy about the Security Service. The first director-general has resigned, and with all due respect to his qualifications as the Commissioner of Police in New South Wales, I consider that he was not a suitable person to be placed in charge of the Security Service. Nor am I very happy about the appointment of his successor, who is a brigadier in the Army. A rumour is circulating that the Department of the Army is determined to gain control of this organization. If the Army were to succeed in controlling a civil instrumentality such as the Security Service it would be a bad thing for the country. Whilst excellent reasons may exist why the Army should control a section of the work, I see no justification for placing a brigadier in charge of all the activities of this important organization. I ask the Attorney-General for an assurance that he will watch the actions of those who administer the wide and extraordinary powers that are vested in the Security Service. No specific provision is made in the Estimates for this organization. The information is concealed. Perhaps the Government considers that a disclosure of the vote would reveal to the enemy the number of officers engaged in tracking down spies in Australia. But if we can tell the nation how much is provided for the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, I fail to see why the expenditure on the Security Service cannot be disclosed. I ask the Attorney-General to ensure that when the Estimates for his department are being compiled in future, the expenditure upon the Security Service will be set out specifically. I am not convinced that it is necessary even to have the Security Service. In addition to it, there are the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, the Military Intelligence Branch, the Naval Intelligence Branch,, and the State police. The personnel of the Security Service includes a sufficient number of generals and colonels to win any war. One member of the staff is  Colonel Cohen,  a barrister, of Newcastle, who is associated with some of the big coal-mines in New South Wales. Another officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Tyrrell,</inline> is private secretary to the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Davidson. I am not confident that men like them, will not abuse  their powers in a crisis, particularly if working class interests are involved. Our civil liberties should not be endangered by entrusting extraordinary powers to this . organization, even in war-time. Under the National Security Regulations, a person may be held in custody for ten days before a charge is laid against him. Some persons have been so held on the most trivial charges. In peace-time, that could not occur, because the person detained would have access to the courts. The Attorney.General might well give consideration to the desirability of amending some of these regulations which give such great powers for detention without, right to obtain bail in order to prepare a defence. He should give urgent consideration to the eventual abolition of this body known as the Security Service. The trouble that occurred, in Melbourne over those telegrams, about some aspects of which the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> complained, and about some other aspects of which 1 have complained, would never have occurred if we had not had a few people anxious to use their newly granted powers in order that they might demonstrate what an influence they were in the life of the community. I hope that the Attorney-General will give to the committee the assurance, in regard to the rights of_the people, that one would expect from him a3 a Labour member of Parliament. I congratulate the Attorney-General on the manner in which he cleared up the trouble caused by the Public Relations branch of the Army that was the. subject of much press comment on his return from abroad. </para>

                        <para>.- During the general debate early this morning, when the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> was reclining on his virtuous couch while the rank and file of honorable members were holding forth in this chamber, I directed the attention of the committee to a matter df great concern. In the hope that the Attorney-General will now be able to provide the answer which he naturally could not provide earlier to-day, I take this opportunity to raise the matter again. I refer to the death by drowning of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> after the Commissioner of Taxation had exercised his wide powers to impose a penalty of twice the amount of tax which he claimed the deceased senator owed. A petition for the bankruptcy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> had been filed by the Commissioner of Taxation, and,, in the. course of time, had the late honorable gentleman lived, no doubt, he would have appeared before the Bankruptcy Court, and perhaps have been placed in durance vile for a considerable period in the same way as a former member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> C. Trautwein, has been gaoled in respect of bankruptcy and taxation matters. Whether the vindictive pursuit of the two gentlemen I have named by the Taxation Department is owing to their having been members of Parliament is a question that ought to be answered. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trautwein</inline> has been again committed to gaol by this imbecile from the Supreme Court of Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- I have mentioned no name. I ask whether it is fair for a man to be retired from the State judiciary on a pension of  £1,000  a year and then be appointed to a Commonwealth judicial position at  £2,500  a year at an age when he should have been content to go into honorable retirement. He was of no further use in Queensland because of his age. In fact, this man had to be removed by the Scullin Labour Government of  1.930  from the judicial position he then held in the service of the Commonwealth, and placed in his present position as judge in bankruptcy where his administration of the law has caused him to be likened' to Judge Jeffreys. </para>

I have already tabled a statement on security policy and honorable members will be able to debate the matter on a motion for the printing of the paper. I ask honorable members to give to the newly-appointed Director-General of Security all the support possible. He has a big job of work to do, and I believe that he will do it efficiently, paying due regard not only to the civil rights of the people, but also to the supreme necessity for protecting this country in time of war. I have indicated my views on security matters and explained the overriding principles. I deprecate interference with security matters. I want to see the department deal with the problem in the interests of the people of this country, free from political control. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> has criticized the Judge in Bankruptcy and. referred to matters affecting taxation. Taxation prosecutions are under the control of the Commissioner of Taxation. The judge to whom the honorable member referred is subject to control in that if he acts wrongly on law or fact, his decision is subject to appeal. That is the legal way in which his decisions should be questioned. Proposed vote agreed to. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> to explain several items in which increases of expenditure are proposed. We have been told again and again, in connexion with the austerity campaign, that petrol, rubber and man-power must be conserved in every possible way; yet, under the heading " Motor vehicles - purchase, upkeep and hire, including use of private vehicles for departmental purposes ", we find that the vote of  £18,500  last year was exceeded by more than  £6,000  and that the proposed vote for this year is about  £6,000  in excess of the actual expenditure last year. The estimate of last year is thus expected to be exceeded by over  £12,000  this yea.r. How can this be justified in the circumstances in which we find ourselves? No doubt we shall be told that producer-gas units are being used, hut that does not obviate the extra use of tyres. No amount was placed on last year's Estimates for " Minor transport services for other departments ", for which an amount of  £3,500  appears on this year's </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Estimates. This item also demands ex-  1  plana tion. </para>
                    <para>The proposed vote for the Electoral Branch is £138,000, which is more than £21,000 in excess of the actual expenditure incurred last year. What does this large increase imply? Does the Government contemplate reprinting the electoral rolls for the purpose of an election during the year? I admit that if, as the result of an election, the present Administration be superseded it would be a welljustified expenditure; but we have no information concerning the Government's intentions. Has this proposed vote anything to do with the Government's projected referendum on constitutional issues ? </para>
                    <para>Another item of increase which seems to be symptomatic of this budget relates to the employment of temporary and casual labour in all government departments; take, for example, the Commonwealth Solar Observatory. Is any war work being done at the observatory which would justify an increase of the vote under this item ? I can understand that increases might occur, in certain instances, in the expenditure on salaries and allowances for permanent officers, for statutory increments have to be paid ; but I cannot understand why there should be an increase of the vote for temporary and casual employees. Surely departments not engaged on war service must be reducing their administrative activities? </para>

                    <para class="block">Le operations of the council, as attacks upon it by members of the Government. I ask whether bodies such as the Allied Works Council are to be subjected to continual attacks by certain Ministers in this chamber without any defence being offered by responsible Ministers. I have ' in mind, in particular, the recent attack made on the Allied Works 'Council by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> The Allied Works Council is, in some respects, as important a part of our defence services as the Army itself, for it is charged with the construction of various strategic works, including aerodromes and roads. The number of persons employed by the Allied Works Council is equivalent to one or two army divisions, and it is essential that the morale of these employees be maintained. The men should be encouraged <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do their best for the Government. In view of the repeated attacks on the Allied Works Council by the Minister for Labour and National Service, I asked a question of the Prime Minister last week which led that right honorable gentleman to say that the Director-General of Allied Works, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> was doing an excellent job which was appreciated by the Government. Last night, a further attack was made upon this body by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear).</inline> I am not able to say whether certain of his charges are true or not ; but I know that one of them is not, because I have in my hand evidence to that effect. The honorable member said that the Allied Works Council had shown such poor business management in Sydney that it was issuing vouchers entitling the recipients of them to certain payments to which they were not really entitled. He alleged that these vouchers were being distributed to many women around Sydney, and entitled the allottee or the dependant of an employee of the council to a payment of £6. I have inspected these vouchers. The substance of the matter is that they are sent to dependants and allottees of employees of the council, who are required to fill in and sign them in order to indicate that they are the persons who are entitled to the allotment. If the remainder of the charges of the honorable member are as accurate as that one, they have no substance. The making of such a charge indicates that the person who made it has no knowledge of business routine. Yet he has been appointed by the Government as Controller of Leather and Footwear! Any schoolboy can see that these vouchers do not constitute entitlement to payment. The honorable member, therefore, has shown that he is devoid of business knowledge. Consequently, his qualifications for the position that he holds are questionable. I am interested in the matter since no member of the Government is defending its officers. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman eulogized the Director-General after I had brought him to his feet by means of questions. Not a word would have been said had I not raised the matter. I am concerned about the protection that is afforded by the Government to public men, who give their services to the 'Commonwealth, in the performance of their duties. Indiscriminate attacks upon them by Ministers of the Crown, and by other persons instigated by Ministers, should not be permitted, and charges made against them should not be left unanswered; otherwise, it is doubtful whether men of high qualifications will offer their services to the Commonwealth. I should like to know who is to speak for this body in this chamber in future. The honorable member for Dalley said last night that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> had been haled before the Trades Hall because of answers he had made in reply to attacks on the Allied Works Council, and had been required to take with him a report of his remarks. <inline font-style="italic">Ap</inline> that report was not regarded as satisfactory, he was required to make another trip, and take with him <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs of his speech. We are reaching a sorry pass if a Minister administering such an important department as the Department of the Interior is  obliged  to answer for his actions, not to the Parliament, but to an outside junta. I ask the Government to explain exactly where it stands. If it does not consider that this body is doing a good job, the Prime Minister should change it; but if the Government considers that it i3 discharging its duties well, that there is grave need for the very best service to be rendered in the development of our strategic works, and that this requires the very best directive powers available, it must alter its attitude of doing nothing and allowing attacks to be made on its officers with impunity. </para>

                        <para>- I rode in the seat that the honorable gentleman otherwise would have occupied. He did me a good turn. Some Ministers should practise what they preach in regard to austerity. Although some cars may be running on producer gas, they nevertheless are wearing out tyres. I have always agreed with the pronouncement of the Prime Minister, that the nation which has the last few gallons of petrol and the necessary supplies of rubber to run motor vehicles, will probably be successful in the war. I endorse the remarks of the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> on the subject of the criticism of the Allied Works Council. A fortnight ago, I read a published statement by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> that certain persons were deliberately holding up important works. They were, he said, sabotaging the war effort. If he believed that to be true he should have taken steps to have them placed behind bars. For my part,' if I were convinced of their guilt, I would be prepared to see them shot. There has been a great deal of discontent, particularly in Canberra, regarding the administration of the Department of the Interior, and the Government should look into the matter in order to discover the cause of the friction. </para>

                            <para>- The fact is that Ministers walk from the Hotel Kurrajong and the Hotel Canberra to their offices every day. They never take cars unless it is raining. On this particular morning rain was pouring. I did not know that other Ministers had ordered cars. When the car arrived the driver told me that it had been ordered for three Ministers. There were six ministerial typists waiting to go to their offices, and they would have been drenched if they had had to walk. Then they would have had to sit in their wet clothes all day. I told the driver that I would take them with me. The honorable member for Swan knew that, because he was in front of the Hotel Kurrajong, and saw everything, that happened. I ordered the car for the purpose of taking the six typists to Parliament House so that they would not be drenched, and run the risk of catching pneumonia; yet the honorable member tries to make political capital out of an incident of that kind. I have not used a car a dozen times, and my car expenditure would amount to only a few pounds a month. The expenditure incurred by other Ministers would not amount to much more. When I am in Sydney, I do exactly the same now a? when I was a private member. I walk from my home to where I catch the electric train by which I travel to the city, and I travel home the same way. So much for the use of cars. I take this opportunity to " nail " the mean charge so that my reply will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> together with the charge itself. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member referred to the increase of £53,000 in the vote for the Department of the Interior. In my opinion, it is an extraordinary tribute to the efficiency of the department that it has been able to do such a colossal job with such a small increase of general expenditure. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> spoke of the increased vote for the Solar Observatory at Canberra. As a matter of fact, the increase is only £250, and that is for the salary of two apprentices. Surely, the honorable member will concede that apprentices must be appointed from time to time, or there would be no staff to take the place of the older men when they retire. </para>
                    <para>Increased expenditure on motor vehicles is due to the greatly expanded programme of work upon which the Department of the Interior is engaged, most of them for other departments. </para>

The cost of conducting those booths was much the same as if a general election had been held. The department also handled the man-power registration. </para>

                        <para>. - When I heard so much criticism in relation to a trivial motor car ride from the Hotel Kurrajong to Parliament House I was reminded of the last general elections and the last Government. I recollect how a .member of the previous Government took a motor car from Melbourne in order to carry on his election eering campaign throughout Queensland. That happened at a time when stocks of motor fuel in Australia were so low that we had scarcely enough to carry us on for a month. Furthermore, there were very few gas-producers in the country at that time. I do not complain about Ministers travelling from their hotels to their offices in motor cars. Their time is too valuable to be wasted in slow travel, and therefore they should not waste even one minute in travelling by any slower means than a motor car or aeroplane. </para>

                    <para>I had occasion last night to visit the Canberra Community Hospital as the result of the tragic death of the child of an officer of a Commonwealth department. Local doctors who attended the child were assisted by some of the medical officers of the United States Army, which has taken over the new hospital building at Acton. In conversation with some of these doctors I was informed that the Government is about to expend £30^000 or £40,000 on improvements to the old hospital building. I was told also that that building was much more suited to the needs of the military forces than the new building. An American major said to me, " I do not know why they gave us the new hospital. That should be used for the people. We should have the use of the old building, which is more suited to our purposes than the new one ". I should like the Government to consider this matter with a view to effecting a change before it incurs this large expenditure on the old building. </para>

Parliament should have presented to it each year statements showing the financial results of the operation of these concerns. I have in mind particularly the city omnibus service, the Canberra abattoirs, and the hotels under the control of the department. The accounts which are presented to Parliament contain no information about the operations of these undertakings. Some time ago, in order to obtain certain information for the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I sought details of the accounts of the Canberra abattoirs. I was obliged to compile a profit and loss account for the undertaking. I also made inquiries about the omnibus service and was presented with a statement which indicated that the service had made a profit. However, an analysis showed that the apparent profit was due to the fact that proceeds of the operations of government motor cars, for which charges are made, had been credited to the omnibus service. If this had not been done, the statement would have shown a loss on the bus service. This is merely a matter -of administration, and I hope that annual statements setting out the results of the operations of these trading concerns will be submitted to Parliament. </para>

I recollect a case in which a country tinsmith had £680 owing to him by the Department of the Interior. Similar delays occur in the Department of the Army. In fact, the trouble seems to be prevalent in all Government departments.

                            <para>-  His  was a lone voice in a wilderness of silence. The Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> and the mortar-board Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> sat in profound silence. Perhaps the actions of the Allied Works Council call for some criticism. Any organization so hastily created as it was, and working at feverish pace, will undoubtedly make some mistakes. But no Minister saw fit to mention that, in a few months, the Allied Works Council has constructed in northern Queensland aerodromes which played no mean part in the defeat of the Japanese in the battle of the Coral Sea, and it has strengthened the two " Burma roads " of Australia, thus enabling our forces to exist in the Northern. Territory. I was shocked to hear the organization trounced while Ministers made no effort to defend it, and listened in humble silence to the atrocious statements directed against it. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the remarks of the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> regarding departmental delays in settling accounts with small business concerns. As the result of the rapid expansion of departments, a bottle-neck appears to have been created, and this is responsible for unfortunate delays. The fault is not confined to the Department of the Interior, and I hope that prompt action will be taken by the Government so that honorable members will have no cause for further complaint. </para>

                    <para>The increase of the vote for the Department of the Interior is not astonishing, as it undertakes a good deal of constructional work for the Government. In wartime, some waste is inevitable. Undoubtedly in the more leisurely days of peace, some of that waste would not occur. Another factor responsible for it is the constantly changing war situation. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> project started to-day may be altered two weeks hence, or it becomes obsolete. </para>
                    <para>I regret that some honorable members have indulged in cheap criticism of expenditure incurred by Ministers in and around Parliament House. That criticism may be levelled against any government at any time. Without referring to specific cases, I have noticed that the use of motor cars has been considerably restricted since the Labour Government took office.. Some time ago I complained privately to Ministers about, the excessive use of motor cars, and I am gratified to see that the position has improved. The action of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marwick)</inline> in repeating a private conversation with a Minister is simply not done between gentlemen. </para>
                    <para>In to-day's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> appears an excellent article upon the activities of the Allied Works Council. Honorable members opposite are not likely to disagree with this analysis by a journal that normally  doe3  not support the Labour party. </para>

                <para>We published yesterday the last of a series of articles on what the Allied Works Council has done and is doing to make Australia a base for war. A curtain of censorship, of which still only a corner oan be lifted, has hidden from public gaze the vast constructional operations which the council, under the dynamic leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> has been directing since its formation little more than six months ago. What has now been revealed must stimulate the imagination and stir the pride of Australians, and arouse in them, too, a lively sense of gratitude to the men whose brains and labour have wrought so much in so brief a space of time. There are blemishes on the picture, no doubt, but they are of small account compared with the immensity of the Works Council's achievement. Time has pressed, violently, from the start. A great organization has had to be brought into being at breakneck speed, and this in a country which is not accustomed to hustle. Orthodox methods have had to be discarded, and prejudices ignored. The marvel is not that mistakes have been made, or that individual hardships have occurred, but that so many difficulties, which in peace-time would have been deemed insuperable, have been overcome. </para>
                <para> Senator Collings last week gave an impressive list of the projects which the Works Council had undertaken, and. with a courage which did him credit as a Minister, defended it against the unfair criticism to which it has been subjected. It is  not right, as he said, that an organization whose work is so vital to the safety of Australia should be sniped at by interested parties. This is not to say, of course, tha,t attention should not be directed to remediable defects, especially on the man-power side. There would seem to have been undue emphasis upon quantity at the expense of quality in the supply of labour, and a failure to apply adequate medical tests to men called upon for arduous work under relatively primitive conditions in  the construction camps. Experience is curing these deficiencies, and they should not be allowed to detract from a "magnificent performance. Engineers, foremen, and an army of workmen have  toiled  ung.rudin.gly to provide the fighting services with the facilities urgently needed in the conduct of the war, and Australia owes much of its increased security to them. </para>

                        <para class="block">The first criticism of the Allied Works Council came from the Opposition when its members thought that they could hold the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> responsible for what the council was doing. Attacks were frequently made upon the council because honorable members opposite thought that they were indirectly attacking the Minister for Labour and National Service. It is quite clear, however, that that Minister has no responsibility in the matter at all. The Director-General of Allied Works is an exceptional official. Most, directors-general appointed by the Commonwealth Government have to administer the regulations, subject to ministerial direction, but the Director-General of Allied Works is entirely independent of ministerial control. He has such powers and functions as are specified in the regulations, and he is not bound to accept directions from the Minister, and is, therefore, not subject to ministerial control. If he were, he would be subject to the control of the Minister for the Interior. The only point at which he makes contact with the Minister for Labour and National Service is in the call-up of labour. He is not allowed to call up persons employed in protected industries or protected undertakings. Whether a person is or is not so employed is a question which can be answered only by the Director-General of Man Power, who, subject to the control of the Minister for Labour and National Service, administers the manpower regulations. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, but I am not particularly concerned about that aspect. Young men sit behind officecounters and desks and dispose of the fate of men sometimes old enough to betheir fathers. Men between 55 and 59 years of age are dealt with by comparatively young men who look them over, take a few records and say, "You start to-morrow ". Men have told me that after a short interview they have been directed to start on the next day digging roads at the Sale aerodrome. Any one who knows Gippsland in July would know what a trial that would be for elderly men. I have written to the department concerning several cases, but not concerning thespecific case to which I shall now refer.. An elderly man, 56 years of age, was told that he- had to begin work at Sale the day after his call-up and that his employment  would be on the roads of an. aerodrome. He said, "I am not going. The Allied Works Council m.a.y put me in gaol if you like.. That will probably be as cold as Gippsland, but it will undoubtedly be drier and healthier. I have never done hard- work of this description in my life. I have followed a sedentary occupation and have engaged only in technical work at my trade ". In conversation with me the man said, " I ask you : What worse could happen to a mau. like me if Hitler came to this country?". I had no answer to give him. I cannot conceive of anything worse for such a man than for him to be taken from his home at a moment's notice and from a comparatively quiet and sedentary life, and sent to Gippsland, in midwinter, to work on roads at an aerodrome. </para>

                        </continue>
                        <para>Other similar cases have been brought to my notice. When the department has been approached on the subject, officers have said : " We have persons of this class to deal with, and what are we to do with them ? Many men in the 45 to 59 age group have lived sedentary lives and have never done hard work; but we have this class of work to be done and under the regulations, the men are handed over to us ". Another person came to me with a complaint concerning his call-up. I heard his story, and then asked him to approach his own member on the subject. Eis story, which I believe to be true, was that he was 56 years of age and had spent his lifetime in developing a small business upon which the livelihood of himself and his family depended. When he expostulated, with the representative of the Allied Works Council about the work which he was directed to do he said that this man, a young man, came from behind a counter, seized him by the collar, and said : " What fellows like you have to remember is that you have nothing in the world except the clothes you stand up in ". I cannot conceive of anything so calculated to destroy the morale of the people as that kind of thing. Elderly people should not be conscripted in this manner. If they are to be conscripted at all. for industrial purposes their cases should be considered by men of mature age and experience. The Allied Works Council is probably an efficient- body, but its efficiency has been achieved at the expense of much human anxiety and suffering, and considerable demoralization of the civil population. </para>

                            <para>.  - I wish to make a few remarks about the Allied Works Council. Probably that body has done an excellent job. It is undeniable that throughout the Commonwealth, and particularly in our northern areas, essential public works of great value to the nation have been completed by the Allied Works Council. I refer to roads, aerodromes and the like. No doubt the Allied Works Council has made mistakes. A body that never makes a mistake never makes anything. I am prepared to concede that the council has done splendid work, but that shall not restrain me from offering some criticism of its practices. In doing se, I shall not be attempting to deny to the council the kudos which it deserves. When the members of the present Government were in Opposition they bitterly opposed all proposals for the conscription of man-power for war services. The Labour party, as such, is opposed to industrial conscription; yet the man-power call-up has resulted in the worst form of industrial conscription being applied to certain sections of our people, particularly in the Civil Constructional Corps. I have in mind the case of a man who was seen by a Man Power officer while he was building a rough shed in his orchard. The officer went to him and remarked : " You are a carpenter." The man said : " This is the first time I have ever been called a carpenter." The officer replied : " At any rate, you can drive nails. Therefore, you are called up for the Civil Constructional Corps and must report for duty next Tuesday morning." That man was 55 years of age and he had never done anything except orchard work. He was classified as a carpenter and told that he must leave at once for Queensland. The man said: " I am not going to Queensland." The officer replied : " If you do not go willingly, we shall put you into uniform and pay you 6s. a day and send you where we please." Industrial conscription of this nature is abhorrent to the people of Australia. Although we may shut our ears to complaints that are being made about the administration of these regulations, the fact remains that the worst form of conscription that has ever been applied to this country is at present in operation. </para>

                        <para>I listened with deep interest, as I always do, to the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn).</inline> As I understand the position, an attempt is being made to place on the shoulders of the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> the responsibility for the mistakes of the Allied Works Council. It seems to me that that honorable gentleman is jealous of the Allied Works Council and resents the fact that he cannot control its staff ; hut I cannot believe that, even in his worst moments, he would apply industrial conscription in the way that the Allied Works Council is applying it, for the practices of the council are repugnant to every fair-minded man in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Hundreds of young men in this department are ordering old men about. Yesterday, in Parliament House, I counted seventeen young men who should be in the services, and should not be allowed to dodge their responsibilities. Some departmental heads of the Public Service in Canberra are noted for the fact that they are opposed to the release of many young officers. I understand that the head of one department said to a medical officer who had to examine young men for military service : " You must not pass this boy for service, for he is indispensable to me. The work of my department cannot be done without him." One young man had been only about two months in the service. </para>

                                <para>- I shall produce the names, if necessary. There is too much dodging of responsibility. Today young lads are employed as messengers of Ministers when they ought to be performing a more important duty. During the regime of the last Government, I endeavoured to have appointed to the positions of messengers, disabled, returned soldiers who, having been discharged, were walking the streets looking for work, and could not obtain even their deferred pay. I make that suggestion to the present Government. I support the statement of the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> that all the departments have their finances tied up so that delays occur in the payment of accounts. One of my lads had been overseas for twelve months before he could obtain pay that was due to him prior to his embarkation. When, on the 26th May, I telephoned the service department concerned to ask why payment had not been made, I was informed that it had been made. I requested the production of the files, and these disclosed that payment had been made on the previous day; the approval had been antedated. </para>

                        <para>The Prime Minister has made some extraordinarily good speeches. The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> produced an article in which the Government had been eulogized on account of the achievements of the Allied Works Council. If we must criticize, let our criticism be at least constructive. I have heard in this chamber altogether too much destructive criticism of men who have not the right to reply to it. Never in my political life have I mentioned the name of an officer who had not the right to reply to my statements. All the amateur strategists, in Parliament and out of it, believe that they can teach the soldiers who are leading our armies today under trying conditions, how to win battles. I have heard criticism with which I have totally" disagreed, and it has been most destructive in relation to the men who are organizing and fighting the war for the protection of this country. That is the worst form of criticism, and it has the greatest effect in reducing the morale not only of the troops but also of the civilians. I am not singling out members of either side of the chamber. I denounce all destructive criticism, wherever it may originate. The Allied Works Council has done an amazing job. If in some particulars it does wrong any honorable member may criticize it in a decent fashion. It would seem that in our public life we look for bad points rather than good ones. <inline font-style="italic">Nobody</inline> can accuse me of being a political friend of the Director-General of Allied Works; yet I admit that he has done an extraordinarily good job and has established an organization which redounds to his credit. I say that, not in the hope of helping him politically, but because he is justly" entitled to praise by either his critics or those who are in authority over him. My experience has taught me that the most severe critics in regard to the use of official motor cars would make the most use of them had they the opportunity to do so. In other years, I have had occasion to find fault with the use of official cars. Not always are Ministers responsible. When I was a Minister for some years, on my visits to Melbourne I found that a oar in a government garage was not available to take a Minister to wherever he was staying; yet several cars could always be made available to meet officials of departments at the railway station. Consequently, I am not criticizing Ministers. I suggest that departmental expenditure on the use of cars ought to be watched, apart altogether from the use to which they are put by Ministers. If there be items in the Estimates that provoke discussion, let us seek information and have any wrong rectified, if possible. Querulous questioning merely for the purpose of smashing something will not help the war effort. I apply to members of Parliament the criticism I have offered in respect of certain departmental officers who have not accepted their responsibilities in connexion with war service. Neither State nor Federal members of Parliament have a greater right to exemption from war service than has the man in the street. All of us should accept our responsibilities, and use our abilities to the best advantage. Criticism of the Allied Works Council may be justified in many instances; even so, let us endeavour to help it, because it has been carrying out a great job of work. </para>

In response to questions, and to statements contained in questions, asked by the honorable member, the Minister prepared a statement which he read to this chamber. It was competent for the honorable member, had he so desired, to persuade his party to permit him to move the adjournment of the House on the following day in order to discuss the matter. </para>

It will probably be moved within a day or two, and there is no reason why this other subject should not also be discussed on a similar motion. It is clear that the Department of Labour and National Service has merely made available information to officers of the Allied Works Council, whose sole responsibility it is to decide what persons shall be called up. In Victoria, however, officers of the 'Department of Labour and National Service were exceeding their powers, and were themselves deciding who should serve.

                        <para>I desire to bring under the notice of the committee something in the nature of a racket. It affects the Department of the Interior, which uses considerable quantities of steel in connexion with war undertakings. The matter was brought under my notice by a constituent who has placed before me sufficient evidence to justify an investigation.  Isteg  steel is made by a patented process from Broken Hill mild steel rod. Without going into the details of the process, the result is a saving of 1 ton for every 3 tons of mild steel rod used in tension reinforcement, and a big saving of money, and of shipping space and handling charges. The proposition is amply demonstrated in the specific case of the predictor factory at Maribyrnong, which is a typical reinforced concrete building. I understand that this product has been used extensively throughout the world for its economical and superior qualities, not only by our allies, but also by our enemies. I am familiar with the attempts made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> J. Alison, of Melbourne, the holder of the Australian patent rights in respect of Isteg,  to secure recognition and the use by this country of  Isteg  steel, and the obstruction that he has encountered at the hands of the combine known' as the Reinforcing Bar Merchants Association, comprising reinforced bar merchants of Australia who are the selling merchants for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. Before a product of this type can be used extensively in this country, it is necessary that it should secure recognition by the Standards Association of Australia, a body set up and subsidized by this Parliament. This association is expected to give decisions based upon the evidence, and not be influenced in its decisions by commercial interests. </para>
                        <para>In November, 1938, application was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  on evidence and tests from other parts of the world, including the Building Research Station, of London, for recognition of  Isteg  steel to be used in Australia on the same basis as it is used in England, America, South Africa, New Zealand, and every other country - namely, tension stress 50 per cent, greater than that permitted for ordinary rod. In February, 1939, a committee set up by the Standards Association of Australia in Adelaide to investigate the claim recommended that  Isteg  be permitted at a stress of 25,000 lb. per square inch, which is slightly less than was claimed, but in August. 1939, without any justification, the same committee amended the recommendation in such a way that it destroyed the economic value of  Isteg  steel. It is claimed that the amended recommendation was the result of improper influences brought to bear on the members of the committee of the Standards Association of Australia by members of the Reinforcing Bar Merchants Association. In April, 1939, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Benjamin</inline> Cox, managing director of Australian Reinforced Concrete Engineering Proprietary Limited, which company is a prominent member of the Reinforcing Bar Merchants Association, informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson,  when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  sought to collaborate with the association in connexion with the marketing of  Isteg,  that unless he gave either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cox</inline> or one of the members of their association control of Isteg  steel, the Reinforcing Bar Merchants Association would make it their business to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  did not make a shilling out of  Isteg.  Letters -were written which speak for themselves, and clearly show that what I have stated did, in fact, take place. </para>
                        <para>In July, 1940, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  submitted a case in writing for the recognition of  Isteg  to the fight honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> when he was Prime Minister of this country. According to the correspondence, which can be produced, the right honorable gentleman on receipt of the case sought advice from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis, Director-General of Munitions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis replied that, as Director-General of Munitions, the matter did not come within his jurisdiction. It was purely a trade matter, or one for the Department of the Interior. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis made this reply to the then Prime Minister, notwithstanding the fact that not only he, but also Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, with which he was and is associated, was fully conversant with the use to which Isteg  steel had been put throughout the world, and knew the immense national value of this product in saving steel and money. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  offered in writing to the Government, of which the right honorable member for Kooyong was leader, to forgo for the duration of the war all royalties that were due to him. This offer was never accepted by that Government. I say that this offer should have been accepted, and further, that the Government should have insisted that this steel be used in all reinforced concrete jobs, thus saving thousands of tons of steel, and also a considerable sum of money. After much negotiation, the right honorable member did obtain recognition from the Department of the Interior for  Isteg  steel. The department agreed to accept the standard set by the New Zealand Standards Association, which is on the same basis as that used in all other countries of the world, and advised the Commonwealth works directors in each State accordingly, but took no action to ensure that the economic possibilities of this product were made use of. To tell the works directors that  Isteg  steel could be used was of no use if those interested, in  Isteg  steel did not know until it was too late that there was a job going on, and the works directors had not any authority to tell them. </para>
                        <para>When the present Government came into power, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  resubmitted the case to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> Subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  had an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings.</inline> The Minister made a thorough investigation of the whole position, and he is responsible for Isteg  steel being used in the predictor factory building at Maribyrnong. This factory, which is to be erected, will be a typical reinforced building. The job was actually designed for the Department of the Interior by Australian Reinforced Concrete Engineering Proprietary Limited, a member of the combine to which I referred previously. The combine's price for this job of its own design was £1,090, and it was to have used approximately 52 tons of ordinary bar steel. The  Isteg  people were able to quote £S50 for this job, saving 22 per cent, in money. They were able to carry out the work with only 40 tons of steel, thereby saving 21 per cent, of steel. . This is only one example of the many losses that the country has sustained since 193S, losses of steel - one of our most vital commodities - and losses of money and manpower, amounting to criminal waste. These are the facts, and I say that this Parliament must secure proper recognition for  Isteg  steel. The Minister for the Interior should direct its use in all buildings, government and private, for the duration of the war. The persons responsible for occasioning such losses should be dealt with in the same way as persons who impede the war effort. There was a further development which followed the interest taken in this product by the Minister for the Interior. The denouement occurred on Thursday, the 17th September, 1942, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison,</inline> of Messrs. J. McDonald Richardson Proprietary Limited, builders, the successful tenderers for the predictor factor at Maribyrnong, called on Edward Campbell and Son and informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Dugard,  the firm's consulting engineer, that he required another two copies of the steel design for the factory. During the conversation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Dugard  asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> when Campbell and Son would receive the order, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> said that he had come to place the order. There was then further discussion as to whether the material was to be cut, bent and delivered or simply cut to lengths and delivered. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> insisted that it be cut, bent and delivered, although, at a previous interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> Campbell and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Dugard,  he had said that he wanted the material cut to length only, as he was in a position to do all the bending on a cheaper and better basis than any ons else. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell</inline> wanted to insist on this arrangement, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> became very annoyed, and said that he would go to the Department of the Interior and notify it that Campbell and Son could not deliver the order. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Dugard  corrected <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> on this statement, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> maintained his attitude and left. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Dugard  brought the matter under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson's  notice. He suspected there was some ulterior motive behind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison's</inline> attitude, and insisted that Campbell should again communicate with Harrison and let him understand clearly that Campbell and Son could supply the steel cut, bent and delivered, or in lengths only, provided that the firm was given a reasonable time to do the work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Dugard  did this. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> inquired the exact time for delivery, and was told by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jack</inline> Campbell that Campbell and Son could have the material cut, bent and delivered for £850, the first delivery to be made in from ten days to two weeks and deliveries to be completed in another four weeks, which was the arrangement originally suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> himself, or in cut lengths only for £750, with much quicker delivery. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> said that that was no good to him, as he was ready for the steel, and claimed that the figure of £850 was wrong. He alleged that the price was to be £750, cut, bent and delivered, and that he would not buy from Campbell and Son and would notify the department accordingly. On Friday, the 18 th September, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollins,</inline> of the Department of the Interior, accompanied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson,</inline> of J. McDonald Richardson Proprietary Limited, called on Edward Campbell and Son, and Mir. Altson  was requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> Campbell to be present. On arrival at Edward Campbell and Son's premises, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  had a conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollins</inline> in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson</inline> intervened. He explained that the order for the steel had not been received, nor had any notification been received as to when it was to be delivered. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson</inline> said his firm never gave orders, and further, that Campbell and Son had been notified two weeks previously by the department that delivery would be wanted immediately. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  denied that Campbell and Son had received such notification, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> insisted that it had. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  then showed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollins</inline> the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> stating that the Department of the Interior had been instructed by him to use Isteg  in the factory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson,</inline> who inspected the letter, adopted a sceptical attitude and the conversation broke off, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> Campbell talking in one part of the building, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jack</inline> Campbell and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson</inline> in another, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollins</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Altson  in yet another. </para>

                            who said that he had been greatly misled by

                            then approached
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>
                            Altson  in the presence of

                            Campbell and

                            and said that he realized that Campbell and Son was very anxious to get its material into the job in order to show the Government and the works directors how good it was. He also said : " We are prepared to make you a sporting offer if you will get out of this job. We are prepared to give any sum of money you like to mention to any charity you like to nominate, even to the full amount of the profit that you would make if you got the job."
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>
                            Altson  told
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson</inline>
                            that, even if he had £5,000, he " would not listen to his rotten idea ", and would leave no stone unturned to see that the material was used in the factory in order that the Government and the public would have the benefit of the saving that could be effected by using Isteg.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson</inline>
                            certainly did not misunderstand what
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. All;son</inline>
                            had to say. He then very  quietly, and even to the amazement of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison,</inline>
                            informed
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>
                            Altson  that Campbell and Son had the job and could have whatever time it wanted for delivery, even up to six months. After making a great effort and getting the men to work through the whole of the week-end, Campbell and Son was able to make the first delivery on Monday, the 21st September. At the same discussion,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline>
                            told
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline>
                            Campbell that Ben Cox, of the Australian Reinforced Concrete Engineering 'Company, could deliver his material on the Monday, and that, as Ben Cox had designed the job at his own expense, the designs costing £30 to £40, he should gat the order instead of Campbell and Son.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>
                            Altson  claims that the Reinforcing Bar Merchants Association, or one of its members, had paid, or was prepared to pay, J. McDonald Richardson Proprietary Limited a very large sum of money to keep  Isteg  out of the predictor factory at Maribyrnong. When it is realized that the builders, McDonald Richardson Proprietary Limited, would save £240 for themselves by using  Isteg,  it is obvious that somebody else was providing the money to try to buy Campbell and Son off. If the Australian Reinforced Concrete Engineering Company had secured the job and supplied the material, the builders would have been £240 worse off, making it obvious that a sufficient sum of money was coming from the Reinforcing Bar Merchants Association or one of its members. Furthermore, the saying of £240 by the builders will be retained by them, and no benefit in respect of this will go to the Government. In principle, this is wrong and not in keeping with the austerity campaign. On Saturday, the 19th September, in view of what had happened,

                            Mehaffey  who is Works Director for the Department of the Interior. He was surprised to learn from

                            Mehaffey  that the department had received a letter from the Reinforcing Bar Merchants Association objecting to the use of  Isteg  in the predictor factory at Maribyrnong and concluding by asking whether it was worth while for the association to tender in future in respect of any jobs. That indicates that there are combines and monopolies in Australia which are determined that profit shall come before ser vice, even in war-time. Some people in the community are concerned more with the money that they are making out of the war effort than with the protection that they may afford to the soldiers, or the community, or to the added servicethat they may give to the nation. Although a pagan enemy is almost on ourdoorstep, some venal men seek to serve their own selfish ends by preventing the use of a commodity for which they do not possess the patent rights or on which they are not likely to receive royalties.

If his general allegation contains only a fraction of the truth, and if he can do nomore than prove that he was offered money in the form of a donation, to allow some one else to have the contract, there is a case for action by the Attorney-General against persons who are attempting to impede the war effort until they can arrange to loot the Treasury. </para>

                            <para>.- Honorable members must concede that theAllied Works Council, judged by results, has been effective. With considerableexpedition, it has completed important works and achieved valuable results. It is interesting to note that those results have been obtained by the ruthless use of the authority which reposes in theDi rector-General of Allied Works and his associates. Ruthlessness is a quality essential to the successful prosecution of the war. But the ruthlessexercise of this authority has been madepossible because the Government recognized the necessity to introduce industrial conscription. That was a most important and far-reaching decision for a Labour government to make. I offer no criticism: of it, and the Government deserves credit for adopting the policy so as to enable the works to be completed expeditiously. </para>

The interesting lesson to be learned from the adoption of this policy is that in planning for total war, the private rights, sectional interests, and all pre-conceived ideas about the liberty of the subject must be subordinated to the needs of the nation. </para>

                        <para>The fact that these valuable results have been achieved only by the ruthless introduction of industrial conscription shows that honorable members opposite have adjusted their beliefs to stern realities. That statement applies to other policies that the Government has adopted or inherited, such as the total registration of man-power. In due course, the Government may order the total registration of woman-power. No limits must be placed upon those in .authority for preparing the country for total war. </para>
                        <para>But conceding the necessity for this policy in broad terms, I consider that an effort should be made to minimize the hardship and suffering which are almost inevitably associated with the operation of such a policy. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> declared that the price which has been paid for the rapid completion of these great works is the infliction of hardship on individuals. I do not say that the test which should be applied to any war-time policy is whether it will bear onerously on, or cause injustice to, individuals. War is the greatest cause of injustice, and some individuals must experience minor injustices so that the war may be brought to a speedier conclusion. But there is greater scope for the exercise of ministerial authority. The honorable member for Bourke considered' that the' Minister has yielded all his authority. If that be correct, the Minister should take action to recover some of his authority and exercise ministerial direction and influence for the purpose of minimizing individual hardship. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister for the Interior, although I recognize that it is difficult to draw a clear line of demarcation, because the Allied Works Council must also invoke the records of the Department of Labour and National Service in the call-up of men. Most honorable members have had brought to- their notice cases of -great and aggravated hardship on account of the shortness of time between the date of call-up and the date on which work must be commenced with the Civil Constructional Corps. Urgent as the works are, I believe that there could be a longer interval between the two dates. Mistakes and muddling are inevitable in an organization of such magnitude as the Allied. Works Council, but there again scope exists for close ministerial scrutiny. The Government cannot escape responsibility on the plea that the regulations give all the authority to the Director-General of Allied Works. Australia is a democracy and no Minister should divest himself of his supervisory powers. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, and any shortcomings can be remedied by a stroke of the pen. Amongst, the many cases of muddling which I have had brought to my notice, the classic example is that of a clerk of works on a country sewerage scheme. Ever since his return from the last war this man has been employed by either large contracting companies or government instrumentalities on sewerage undertakings as a worker, ganger, foreman and, finally, supervisor. He became clerk of works on a new sewerage undertaking in a town of considerable size. Half the town had been sewered when the work was closed down by the Government in pursuance of it3 policy to divert men and materials to essential war requirements. This man found himself out of a job. Owing to government regulations he was not free to find another job for himself. He was compelled to present himself at the Department of Labour and National Service, which he did with his record and references. These I have seen.   His  ease was considered by the pundits of the department and then they said " Can you start on Monday or Tuesday morning?" He said that he could. They told him to present himself at a certain Melbourne cake shop and to start work there as a clerk. I do not point the finger at the Minister for Labour and National Service and say that he is responsible. 1 have had experience of administering big departments, and I realize that Ministers cannot be expected to carry the responsibility for every mistake made. I cited that instance, and I could quote other instances, in support of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> who has pointed out that the regulations deprive the Munster for the Interior of all authority over the activities of the Allied Works Council and repose absolute authority in the Director-General. That, carries the principle of delegating authority too far, and I urge the Government to reconsider the matter and to ensure that no Minister shall strip himself of all authority in respect of major governmental undertakings. </para>

                        <para>AVe have all from time to time criticized delayed decisions, but in recent months I have seen some examples of promptness in decisions being carried to extremes. I shall not mention individual works; Ministers know what they are. The Allied Works Council has been instructed at extremely short notice to embark on major undertakings, the costs of which range from hundreds of thousands of pounds to more than £1,000,000. Men have been conscripted from their civil employment and materials have been diverted from normal urgent civilian works, fabricated, and taken to the site. The work has proceeded almost to the point of completion when some military authority, not always an Australian, has said "I am sorry, we have changed our plans now and this work is no longer required". </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member's interjection gives point to my remarks. A site was selected for an aerodrome at Southern Cross. The estimated cost of the work was £250,000. It was discovered, when about £12,000 had been expended, that a mistake had been made, in the selection of the site and, without a moment's delay, the mistake was acknowledged and the work terminated. My criticism is not directed at mistakes being made or being acknowledged, but at the fact that major works are undertaken and carried almost to completion before it is decided to abandon or, at least, not to use them. I hope that these remarks will be brought to the personal notice of the. Minister for the Interior. </para>

                        <para>I have referred earlier in this session to positive information supplied ' to me from reliable sources that a practice has developed of compelling men called up for the 'Civil Constructional Corps and transferred to Queensland to become financial members of trade unions in that State. I am aware that compulsory trade unionism is the law of Queensland, and I say nothing about that, but national security regulations override State laws. Although this may not be an appropriate occasion to discuss the merits of compulsory trade unionism, it seems to me to be grossly unfair to compel men, willy-nilly, to join unions in which they are not interested. When the Prime Minister dealt with the point a few days ago he made a statement which, if not. crystal clear, at least left the impression that the Government was aware of what was happening. I now ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior to define clearly to the Parliament, before this discussion ends, the Government practice in this matter. Here is a plain question: Is a man called up compulsorily for work in the Civil Constructional Corps and transferred to Queensland compelled to become a financial member of a union in that State? I ask for a plain answer to it from the Government. </para>
                        <para>I support the request of the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> that delays in the making of settlements in respect of properties compulsorily acquired by the Government for national purposes should be eliminated as far as practicable. I am well aware that the Department of the Interior is not always to blame for such delays. In my experience the department is reasonably expeditious in dealing with those claims. What happens usually is that when a department decides that it requires a property for a camp, or an aerodrome, or any other national purpose, the Hirings Administration is informed, and it immediately begins calculations of rental values, probable compensation claims and the like, in order to ascertain whether the property should be purchased or leased. Sometimes it has taken the Hirings Administration six months, or more, to determine the issue. If a property is valued at a high figure this delay may involve the owner in substantial loss and great inconvenience. I request the Government to take steps to ensure that when it has decided that a property is necessary for national purposes, an early decision shall be reached as to whether it is to be leased or purchased. </para>

                            <para>.- Much criticism has been voiced in regard to the administration, of the Allied Works Council. On the other hand, many honorable members recognize the value of the work it is doing in the defence of Australia. The council had not been established in Western Australia for many weeks prior to my departure from that State. It is a new organization, and has undertaken a tremendous  task throughout the Commonwealth. Criticism is easy. Such a body must make mistakes in its initial operations. I was very much struck by the tone adopted by the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Charles Marr).</inline> He invited honorable members to recognize that in such gigantic undertakings mistakes must occur in the initial stages. The debate to-day was not at all inspiring, helpful, constructive, or in keeping with the tremendous task that confronts Australia. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> mentioned a number of errors which, he said, had been committed by the council. While he was speaking, I put to him a question in regard to a' certain matter that arose during his term as Minister for Air. </para>

                                <para>- En route from Adelaide to Port Pirie, when I asked the honorable member if he would meet a representative deputation of the' citizens of Southern Cross, who were hostile to his Government because £12,000 had been expended and- the work had then been abandoned, he evaded giving me an answer and said, "I shall let you know before we arrive at Port Pirie ". He did not let me know either before or after reaching Port Pirie. When the train arrived at that place I telegraphed to the representatives of the deputation at Southern Cross that the Minister was en route, and would arrive at Southern Cross at a certain time, and that he had consented to meet the deputation. I handed to the Minister's secretary a copy of that telegram. That is how the honorable gentleman came to meet the deputation. </para>

                                <para>- A good deal of criticism has been voiced in regard to the use of official motor cars. The matter is too petty to occupy the time of this chamber while Australia is in its present  position. I am acquainted with the programme of works that is to be carried out in Western Australia under the direction of the Allied Works Council, but it is yet too early for me to say whether that body is doing a good job or a bad job, because those works had not been commenced prior to my departure from the State. However, from speeches that have been made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and other members in this chamber, I believe that the council is doing a good job. It should have the utmost cooperation from this Parliament. I favour the giving of a fair trial to the Director General. Because of his experience and administrative capacity, I believe that he will discharge his functions satisfactorily. I understand that the work he has already accomplished has been well administered. </para>

                        <para>I have a complaint to make in regard to hirings in my electorate, particularly at Kalgoorlie, where a large number of workers' homes has been impressed in order to make room for certain works. For the last four months, the owners have not been able to obtain any satisfaction. The matter  has  been discussed before the War Expenditure Committee. It was informed that special tribunals had been appointed in each State to expedite decisions in connexion with the impressment of any land or home. I hope that the committee will function quickly, and will give greater satisfaction than has so far been given. Because of developments, decisions that are made to-day in connexion with our war effort may have to be altered to-morrow, and the reason for the alteration cannot always be explained to the satisfaction of the public. The War Expenditure Committee has had before it much evidence in regard to the huge expenditure incurred on different works, and has found that decisions had had to be altered because of certain developments a month or six weeks after they had been made. Errors will continue to be made until the defence preparations of Australia have been completed and are up to the standard required by the nation. I trust that honorable members will recognize the position in which we are placed, and in view of the unprecedented circumstances will offer constructive instead of destructive criticism. </para>

I also hope that I appreciate not less than others the colossal task involved in government, and realize that the Administration is entitled to expect co-operation, in addition to helpful advice and action, by ordinary citizens. </para>

                        <para>Having said so much, I feel bound to utter a word of criticism in regard to the methods employed by the Allied Works Council, in connexion with the ordinary citizen who comes under its command for employment wherever in Australia it considers his services can best be employed. In this matter of the impressment of labour, I regret very much to see employed the mode of approach and dictatorial methods of the Army. Unlike the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> I do not either welcome or approve of the principle of industrial conscription. I am, and always have been, opposed to it, but I agree that every body is expected to do what he reasonably can in this emergency. Several cases have come under my notice of men who have been required at short notice to proceed to points far distant from their homes in order that they may work in avocations in which they are entirely untrained, and for which they are completely unsuited. I have in mind one man who is the father of five children, all of them under sixteen years of age, and he has been required to proceed, not to a distant part of Victoria, the State in which he lives, but to Queensland, there to engage in manual labour. I know another man, 53 years of age, whose lot it has been not to engage in manual labour up to the present time. He has made his living by other means, perfectly honorable means, which would not shock even the most punctilious of us; yet, at his time of life, he has been required to engage in hard manual labour. It is not that I object to manual labour, but members may notice that they themselves rather get out of the way of doing hard manual work when they become members of this House. It may be the atmosphere; it may be the nature of the accommodation ; it may be the inspiring association with members of the Public Service who themselves do not engage in hard manual labour; or it may be that they are influenced by a benevolent press whose representatives manage to eke out an existence without engaging in hard manual labour. Whatever the reason, the fact is that there are many decent people in the world, and notably in Australia, who have not been trained in manual labour, and are unfitted for such work. Here was a man of that kind who was put to pick and shovel work. Well, of course, that would be all right for some of us. I can do it, because I was trained in it; it comes natural to me, but a good many people have not been so trained, and have not the physical constitutions to enable them to stand up to it. To require a man of 53 years of age, who has never done manual labour, to take off his coat and do pick-and-shovel work, is both unkind and uneconomic. He cannot be expected to do the work efficiently, or to earn the prescribed rate of pay. It is wrong to take such a man away from his family and put him into camp for such a purpose. I understand that men called up by the Allied Works Council are paid the award rate of wages prescribed for the class of work upon which they are engaged in the State and district to which they are sent. At first sight that seems to be reasonable, but actually it is not so-, because some of the men have been in receipt of higher incomes, and have established a mode of life, and entered into obligations, appropriate to their income. Then they suddenly find their incomes cut, it may be, in half. I can understand that workers may be needed in Queensland more than in the southern States for some classes of work. I can understand that Queensland might not have the population to satisfy the demand, but surely, if movements of population must take place - and it is reasonable that they should in certain circumstances - there is no justification for taking married men with young families from the southern </para>
                        <para class="block">States and sending them 1,000 miles or more into the north to engage in labour for which they are quite unsuited. Frankly, I do not agree for one moment that the emergency, pressing as it is, is such as to justify the breaking up of families in that way. It may be that there has been some excessive condemnation of the actions of the Allied Works Council in some particulars. It may be, also, that there has been some extravagance in the language of the responsible Minister in defending the council. I content myself with taking a middle course, and I ask the Minister for Home Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> who represents the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> whether he thinks that we have reached a state of such grave emergency as to justify the taking of the father of a family of five children below the age of sixteen, and putting him to hard physical labour in a northern State more than 1,000 miles from his usual place of abode. My opinion is that we have not reached such a stage, and I have told some of the men concerned that they can count on being well supported by public opinion, and by this House, also, in the last resort, if they resist orders to leave their homes in such circumstances. Neither should the orders be conveyed in a dictatorial, militarist style. If we have to ask the working class to defend our homes - and it is recognized that the duty devolves mostly upon the members of the working class - the request should be made in man-to-man fashion, and not in the form of an order by some jackinthebox in a comfortable job who misuses his authority by ordering his betters to attempt work for which they are quite unsuited. </para>

                                <para>- I have made notes of what honorable gentlemen have said in general criticism of the Allied Works Council, and I shall bring their comments to the notice of the Minister. Obviously, I cannot deal with specific cases offhand; I do not suppose that the Minister himself could do so. However, I say that the Government is grateful to the Di rectorGeneral of Allied Works for his services. It considers that the council has done a good job. I know that mistakes have been made, but it would be impossible to avoid mistakes when working at such high speed. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> asked whether I considered that a sufficient state of emergency existed to warrant certain things being done. I say to him that I cannot conceive of Australia being in a greater state of emergency than it is at the present time. Of all the allied nations I consider Australia is most directly threatened by the worst foe of all those alined against us. We are threatened by enemies who have nothing in common with us, but who are pagan and have all the attributes of barbarians. </para>

                            <para>.- Before the dinner adjournment I addressed a clear-cut question upon a very important matter of policy to the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior. I asked him to give a plain reply to a plain question. I am surprised that I am experiencing extraordinary difficulty in extracting from the Government any statement of its policy in respect of the imposition of compulsory unionism upon members of the Civil Constructional Corps employed in Queensland. </para>

When I was speaking on the general budget debate, I asked the Treasurer to make a statement setting out the policy and practice of the Government in respect of civilians compulsorily called up in the southern States, drafted into the Civil Constructional Corps, and sent to work in Queensland, where compulsory unionism is the law. </para>

I now ask the Government for the fourth time - and this question has also been asked by other honorable members on this side of the House: What has been the practice, and what is the practice now, in respect of civilians compulsorily called-up from other States and drafted to Queensland as members of the Civil Constructional Corps? Has the practice been, or is it now, to impose any pressure on such men to compel them to become members of a union ? </para>

                                <para>- I shall endeavour to report him fairly. He said that the practice of the Government was to see that men called up should work under the terms of the relevant award, of the State in which they were employed. That not being a clear-cut answer to my question, I have asked whether these men, who are in fact conscripted workers, were obliged to become financial members of a union in Queensland if they were drafted to that State. It is the law of that State that the ordinary worker must be. a unionist. I have no comment to make on that law, which is confirmed in court awards. However, it is the right of every Australian citizen to decide whether he shall live in a .State where such a law obtains. Honorable members have shown by their interjections that they do not wish to have the policy of the Government clarified. This is a matter of public interest, and the people of Australia are entitled to know the policy which the Government is pursuing. The Minister representing the Minister for the Interior now has an opportunity to rectify his omission to answer my question. I find it difficult to believe that he does not know what policy his Government has laid down. </para>

I am not engaging in criticism of compulsory unionism at the moment. I am merely asking for facts. It is a grave reflection upon a democratic government that a member of the Opposition in Parliament cannot secure  an answer te a question on government policy. I shall continue to raise my voice in this place until I obtain an answer to my question, but I shall cease speaking immediately if the Minister will indicate that he is prepared to answer my question. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> asked a most important question, and the Minister for Home Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> has not answered it satisfactorily. Last week the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Curtin)</inline> said that the Allied Works Council had compulsorily drafted men to Queensland from the States in which they are domiciled. The Queensland award provides that men who are doing the class of work undertaken by the Civil Constructional Corps must belong to a union. The right honorable gentleman indicated that the policy of the Government was to adhere to the awards operating in the States in which the men worked, and he added that, subject to the discretion of the Director-General of Allied Works to determine whether or not a man had sincere and conscientious objections to joining a union, all men drafted to the Civil Con.structional Corps in Queensland must join a union. Of course, the Commonwealth Government has plenary -powers to determine whether those men shall be compelled to abide by a ruling that is abhorrent or obnoxious to them. Consequently, the Government will not evade the issue by contending that the matter in dispute comes within' the purview of the Queensland award, because it has the power to overrule the award. I can only assume that while the Government permits the situation to continue, it endorses the view that these men shall be compelled, against their wishes, to join a union and subscribe to the political activities of the Labour party. </para>

If the Commonwealth Government were to interfere with wages boards or Arbitration Court awards in Victoria, where preference has not been granted to unionists, those honorable members would bitterly assail the Government for overriding the State law. For many years the Arbitration Count of Queensland has granted preference to unionists, and no difficulties have arisen. In the industrial organization which I represented before I entered this Parliament, many of the unionists were Victorians. </para>

                                <para>- That is rubbish! The award provides that men engaged upon the class of work undertaken by the Civil Constructional Corps shall be members of an industrial organization. Experience of men from all States has convinced me that only those who wish to dodge the issue all the time object to joining a union. Apparently some honorable members opposite will not be satisfied until the war reaches this part of the continent, and it will be no longer necessary to draft men to Queensland domiciled in Victoria and New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>.- To a very simple question, the Minister for Home Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> has given an equivocal answer. At this stage, members of the Opposition are not arguing the merits or demerits of compulsory trade unionism. Strong grounds may exist for a difference of opinion upon the subject; but the . honorable member for Indi asked in simple language whether men who are conscripted for service in the labour corps and are drafted to Queensland are compelled to join a union. That question calls for a straight answer. If the Minister continues to evade the issue, the only conclusion which the country may draw is that there is good reason for his equivocation. Is the Government ashamed of its policy? </para>

                                <para>- For the last month, members of the Opposition have been trying to work up a slogan to catch the ear of the people: To-night they thought that they had found this slogan, and they fairly raced one another to the table, in their haste to speak upon the subject. The Allied Works Council has operated so successfully because perfect harmony prevails on the job. This absence of discontent is due to the fact that 100 per cent, of the men from the trades, crafts and professions associated with the Allied Works Council are unionists. If they were not, they would not be able to carry on so. successfully as they are doing. They must receive award rates, and work under the conditions prescribed by the Arbitration Court. Even doctors are on the books of the Allied Works Council, and they do not complain. The Opposition is silent. Honorable members are waiting to catch me. </para>

                                <para>- I shall give it. This evening the Opposition thought that it had discovered a good catch-cry because Ministers did not repeatedly give exactly the same answer to a question. This organization is not the only Commonwealth enterprise which is doing successful work on a basis of 100 per cent, unionism. For the last ten years, in spite of the fact that governments drawn from  the ranks of honorable gentlemen opposite have been in office for most of the time, employees of all government munitions factories have had to belong to the appropriate union. Before a person can obtain employment in one of those factories he must produce a union membership ticket, or join the union covering the work he is to do. The honorable member for Indi, fully aware of that fact, particularized Queensland in his question and demanded an answer. I shall supply the answer, although I know I am well aware that the honorable member already knew it long before he and his colleagues raised this matter. The honorable member is fully aware of the weakness of this attack on the Government. He asked whether men sent to Queensland to work under the Allied "Works Council had to be members of a union. The law of Queensland says " Yes ". Honorable members opposite know as well as I do that it is the law of Queensland that awards of the court shall apply only to members of the union. </para>

The reason for the harmony in the Allied Works Council and in the munitions industry is that all employees are unionists. Honorable members opposite allege discrepancy between the answer given by the Attorney-General and the answer given by the Prime Minister. Prom long experience in trade union affairs and in the settlement of disputes, I know that it is the law of custom and practice, if not: of the land, that, if a person, such as a Plymouth brother, who is not allowed to join any sort of organization, has religious scruples against joining a union the union officials grant an exemption from membership. </para>

                                <para>- I was general secretary of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council and, for ten or twelve years, I represented the six Trades Hall Councils of Australia, because the Commonwealth Parliament was then sitting in Melbourne. I was also general secretary of the trade union movement, which consisted of 900,000 members throughout Australia. I was trying to make it 1,000,000. In all that time no man with conscientious objections was forced to join a union. The same condition applies to-day. The Attorney-General does not fix the policy for the trade union movement. The Prime Minister could not do so. It is too big for any member of Parliament to interfere with it. Trade union policies are determined by that movement, not by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>. - We have had a variety of answers from Ministers to our simple question: Are men conscripted by the Allied Works Council for work in Queensland compelled to join the Australian Workers Union? The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> was the first Minister to try to explain the matter. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> explained it in a different way. The Minister for Home Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> had yet another explanation. The last explanation that we have been vouchsafed was that of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway). His</inline> explanation made confusion worse confounded. The honorable gentleman tried to draw an analogy between workers who have to show their union membership ticket before they may take employment in a munitions factory, and men called up by the Allied Works Council. He knows that there is no parallel between munitions workers and the white-collar men who, having been forced out of business by the policies applied by the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> are grabbed for pick &lt;and shovel work by the Allied Works Council. The men engaged in munitions establishments are not conscripted, or compelled to go to Queensland to work. I am amazed that the honorable member, with his long trade union experience, should have made such a sorry attempt to justify the actions of the Government. All the different accounts that we have had have connrmed our suspicions that there is more behind this matter than meets the eye. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> asked the Minister for Social Security the simple question whether members of the Clothing Trades Union - or any other union for that matter - called into service by the Allied Works Council and sent to Queensland, would find that their membership of that union exempted them from having to join the Australian Workers Union. The Minister dodged answering the question by saying that no members of that union would be conscripted by the Allied Works Council, because all are engaged on the manufacture of uniforms for the armed forces, but several members of that union are not at present engaged in the clothing trade. The evasion of Ministers confirms our belief that the Government is trying to bring about compulsory unionism and to force people who, all their lives, have been opposed to the Labour party to contribute to that party's funds through the device of grabbing them for pick and shovel work in Queensland. I advise the Prime Minister to call a meeting of caucus so that </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Indi hopes that Heaven will be a place in which there is no such thing as unionism. Otherwise, he will not recognize paradise. I have never heard the honorable gentleman say one friendly word about unionism, but I have heard him say thousands of things intensely critical of unionism. The Allied Works Council calls its labour from lists supplied from the Department of Labour and National Service, and it has to take the labour available from, in many instances, industries that have been reduced in their scale by my colleague the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> who is finding from the resources of this country the labour forces indispensable to the carrying out of these major enterprises. I know how unpopular his work is and, when the story of survival is told, men who have earned unpopularity, but who have done the job, will be those whom history will extol. I say quite clearly that the whitecollar man, the tailor, for instance, is called up, but he is not given a pick or a shovel. There are jobs such as timekeeping and clerical work to be done, and those white-collar men are more or less equipped but not completely equipped for them. I concede that a great deal of hard labour  is  being done by men who, but  for  &lt;the requirements  of  the Army,  would be replaced by men with greater physical fitness for that class of labour; but the man-power problem of this country is such that we have to make do with the best we have. I acknowledge quite frankly, and make no apologies for it, that there is a good deal of what is called tyrannical recruitment, of labour for this purpose, a purpose which the tyranny of the aggressor has forced upon this country. </para>

The adjournment of the House was moved by the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> because our policy was compulsory unionism. It may surprise the committee, though of course it will be no revelation to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, when I say that I have received repeated communications and deputations from that body requesting the Government to enact compulsory trade unionism. </para>

                                <para>- There is a degree of courtesy in the relations between the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and governments, which enables the council to choose appropriate words in submitting representations or requests. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions has made no demand on the Government. It has submitted its proposals fairly and squarely. No charge can be sustained against this Government of having compelled non-unionists to become unionists. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions knows that the Government has not enacted compulsory unionism. It has been asked to do so but it has not done it. </para>

They would have us believe that they know nothing about their origin. I say to the committee, and to the country, that any man who has been a unionist in his civil life and is called up to work in accordance with awards made by the courts, which awards prescribe that trade unionism shall operate, is expected to continue to be a unionist and to pay his dues to the union. </para>

                                <para>- It is a point that could be decided easily by the management. I have been a trade union secretary - an office which is not novel to honorable gentlemen on this side of the chamber - and I have been in places where the workers on a job have desired that every body on it should join the union. I have at times encountered individuals who would not join a union. Some have given a miserable, sneaking excuse, but have desired to enjoy the conditions obtained by other unionists on the job. On other occasions I and other honorable gentlemen on this side of the committee have met men who had a genuine and bona fide objection to joining a union, and I have accepted their objection. In my experience, such objections have always been accepted by honorable gentlemen on this side of the committee, for they respect humanity and good conscience. </para>

The question that has been asked is: What takes place in respect of men hitherto non-unionists, who are sent to Queensland for employment on jobs of the Allied Works Council ? It took the Prime Minister twenty minutes to tell us precisely what happens in such circumstances.  His  reply reminded me of <inline font-style="italic">The meanderings of Monty.</inline> Yet the question was extremely simple. It has been decided that men called up for compulsory military service in this country shall be paid specific rates determined by the Government. But men called up in the Civil Constructional Corps and sent to Queensland are obliged to become unionists whether they wish to do so or not. </para>

                                <para>- The law of Queensland is subordinate to the law of this Parliament. We are now witnessing an attempt to impose upon persons who are called up for civil jobs an obligation to become trade unionists. I have a great respect for trade unionists and have many personal friends among them. Honorable gentlemen opposite may cast gibes at us on this issue, but we know and they know that some individuals have a conscientious objection to becoming trade unionists. The Prime Minister has said that persons who have a bona fide objection to becoming trade unionists need not join a union. But who is to decide the bona fides of the case ? No one seems to know. I cannot imagine that any honorable gentleman opposite really believes that there can be a bona fide objection on the part of workers to trade unionism. </para>

                                <para>- There is too much' imagination about the subject. Some time ago the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> drew attention to the fact that persons called up in the Civil Constructional Corps were being compelled to produce union tickets. A few days ago the right honorable gentleman moved the adjournment of the House to discuss the subject. Yet no honorable member opposite has so far been able to tell us who determines whether a man shall or shall not be compelled' to join a union. It took the Prime Minister twenty minutes to get to the point in the speech he has just delivered. With great respect to the right honorable gentleman, I say that men who object to trade unionism on conscientious and political grounds are being compelled to join trade unions. </para>

                            <para>.- This discussion is doubly regrettable in view of the fact that last week I exposed what was undoubtedly a deliberate plot by honorable members opposite to play a diabolical party political game while the nation is engaged in this dreadful war. I have never said that I do not believe in party politics. As a matter of fact, I am a fervent believer in the party system, for I realize that under that system a government's administration will be closely studied and, when necessary, vigorously criticized. Honorable gentlemen opposite, however, have asserted frequently that during the war party politics should be discontinued. Yet they have continued almost incessantly, since Parliament re-assembled on the 2nd September, to play a diabolical game of party politics. This was shown clearly in the letter to which I referred last Friday. Honorable gentlemen have used every petty excuse that they could find in the last three weeks to belittle and embarrass the Government. The subject of compulsory trade unionism was No. 1 on the list of items given in the letter circulated by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> in which he asked Opposition members to assist him to frame an attack on the Government. </para>

                                <para>- The letter was addressed to me. Because the words "Private and confidential" may be put on a document, sent to me by an honorable member opposite, I do not consider that I am under obligation to regard the document as private and confidential. Let us examine the character of these honorable gentlemen who have made the attack to-night. One is the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt).</inline> Does he believe in compulsory unionism? He is the respected and, doubtless, efficient secretary of the Film Exhibitors Association. That association practises the policy that unless a film exhibitor is a member of the association, fine care shall be taken to ensure that he shall not get any films to exhibit; if he remains obdurate he is forced out of business. Then there are the honorable members for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen).</inline> Throughout their political careers, they have been hostile to the organization of trade unions. Not once have I heard either of them say in this chamber a word in favour of the organization of rural workers in order that they might obtain an award and so become emancipated from the conditions under which they have laboured for years. It is not to be wondered at that the honorable member for Indi objects to pressure being used to induce men to join a union. He entered politics for a specific purpose as the political luminary of the Victorian Country party. He then ran out on the organization that  raised him to political eminence, and is now a member of the Country Liberal party of Victoria. </para>

                                <para>- It is fact, however hot under the collar the honorable member may be. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> slipped into this Parliament as an independent, and had no scruples about subsequently slipping into the United Australia party, because membership of it gave him an opportunity to get into the Cabinet. He is in the same category as the man who evades joining a union that covers his trade or calling notwithstanding that he believes in its principles. Then there is the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> who was a member of a fascist organization before the war. These are the honorable gentlemen who to-night delivered an attack on the Government, merely because they had failed to stampede the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> into answering " yes " or " no " to a question he had been asked. With equal justification, I could ask the honorable member for Indi the well-known question, " Have you ceased beating your wife <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> If the answer were "no ", he would be in bad repute, and if it were " yes " he would be in equally bad repute. Because an answer to another trick question could not be obtained from the Prime Minister, this party political fight has been staged tonight. I am confident that when the people throughout Australia read the report of the debate, and particularly the revelations that were made last week, in conjunction with reports of other attacks on the Government, they will be more disgusted than ever with those responsible for such a deplorable display. After all, the advent to this Parliament of every honorable member opposite was sponsored by organizations which in their own ranks enforce compulsory unionism of a kind. There is the manufacturing grocery organization. No grocer who is a member of it may sell a tin of Nugget boot polish, a packet of  McAlpine's  flour, or a packet of  Wheaties,  except at the price listed by it. This practice operates throughout the ramifications of big business, the object being to protect the interests of its members. Only when the Government says that the interests of the wage-earners shall be similarly protected, is there a howl of protests from honorable members opposite. Compulsory unionism is good for members of the Opposition, for the people who support them, and for every body associated with them, but quite wrong for the working man. </para>

                        <para>Rarely indeed do I find myself at variance with the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan).</inline> I differ from him, not in connexion with his protests against the brevity of the period that elapses before a man is called up to work for the Allied Works Council, but in regard to what I assume to be a protest by bini against men who have been in clerical and other sedentary occupations being put on labouring work. Unfortunately, we are at war. That we have to fight for our very existence, is accepted. What happens to the soldier who is conscripted ? He is young and virile. Irrespective of whether he has come from a clerical or a sedentary occupation, he has to do his share of trench digging and other manual labour. If the clerical workers of this country, be they accountants, lawyers, shop assistants, clerks, insurance agents or commercial travellers, think that there are enough clerical positions in the Allied Works Council for them to be employed in sedentary occupations, they have " another think " coining. A world of good would be done to a lot of people who have been in clerical positions m the past if they had to do some form of manual labour. 1 believe that, as the result of their experiences, a large number of people of that class will be more sympathetic to the manual worker than they have been in the past. For a number of years, I have had the privilege and pleasure of travelling first class on the railways, due to the good grace of the electors of Ballarat. On many occasions I have heard white-collar gentlemen, not unlike honorable members who occupy the front bench opposite, when they have seen a railway navvy resting as the train went by, pass such derogatory remarks as " The government stroke " and " The lazy working man ". If  the honorable members for Warringah, Indi, Deakin and Wentworth were enlisted in the Civil Constructional </para>
                        <para class="block">Corps, arid were put on the end of a pick and shovel for a while, they would have a lot more sympathy than they now have for the manual worker. The work would do them good, and be of great benefit to this country. I regret that this sort of party political propaganda has been persisted in by the Opposition against the Government, which is doing a good job in carrying the war effort to a successful conclusion in this country. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> has just informed the committee that this discussion is regrettable. I agree with him; but it is regrettable from the point of view of the Government, not that of the Opposition. It is all the more regrettable in that the honorable member has indulged in personalities that were uncalled for. A very simple question was put to the committee by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen).</inline> It had been put previously, and two different opinions had been given in respect of it, one by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the other by no less a person than the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> In such circumstances, quite apart from the importance of the subject, one can well understand why honorable members on this side of the chamber were anxious to have a clear and definite statement of policy from the Government. May I state a simple case? Smith,  shall we say, is a member of a builders' association or a grocers' association in Melbourne. He may be one of thousands of small shopkeepers whose businesses have been closed during the last few months on account of war conditions. Because his services are required by the Allied "Works Council, he is conscripted and is entrained for Brisbane to work for the council in Queensland. </para>

Members of the Government party, not of the Opposition, have objected to that. As a conscripted person, this gentleman is compelled to join a trade union when he gets to Queensland. The honorable member for Indi has asked whether it is the policy of the Government to compel such a conscript to join a union, even though his political beliefs may be entirely at variance with those of the union. We have had a series of speeches by Government members, but have not yet had a clear statement as to what rule the Government adopts. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to use the words " quite frankly " on at least two or three occasions while completely sidestepping the issue. The right honorable gentleman prevaricated, equivocated, and talked all round the subject; but we could not obtain from him on behalf of the Government a simple statement of policy. We do not want the grand poseur; we are becoming a bit tired of that, because we have had a little too much of it from the right honorable gentleman during the last few months. We want a dignified and straightforward statement of policy from the Leader of the Government; and that is what we have not been able to get. Surely it is possible for the right honorable gentleman to say whether it is the policy of the Government to compel a builder or other small business man, from Victoria or any other State, who goes to Queensland, to join a trade union ! The question i? a simple one; surely a simple answer can be given to it, one that may be understood not only by us, but. also by the great Australian public. Thousands of persons beyond the boundaries of the State of Queensland are wondering what is the policy of the Government. The Prime Minister ,said that from  past  experience of unionism he could say that in many instances in which conscience was involved men had not been required to join a union. In answer to an inquiry from this side of the chamber while the honorable member for Warringah was speaking, as to who would be the judge, the right honorable gentleman implied, by way of interjection, that he would be a union steward or another person holding office in the union. We are not. concerned with the attitude of any union officer, but we are concerned with the policy of the Government. Australia is engaged in a war. We heard to-night from the Minister for </para>

                        <para class="block">Home Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> how seriously he regards the position  of  this country at the moment. Because  of  the existence of a state of war, the Allied Works Council has been constituted. That body is subject to the control of this National Parliament and the Commonwealth Labour Government. Therefore, any policy enunciated by the Government necessarily becomes the rule that guides the actions of the council. Even though there may be a particular law in a State, it is transcended by the law of the Commonwealth. Therefore, we are justified in asking the Government to give a clear answer to our question. The Labour party is responsible for the continuance of party politics, not the parties that occupy the opposition benches. That has been the position almost since the outbreak of the war, and we have had no option but to accept it. On different occasions, we have attempted to obtain a national government. On the last occasion, we actually offered the prime ministership, if necessary, to the then Leader of the Opposition - who to-day is the Prime Minister - or any other member who was suitable and acceptable to the majority of members. That offer was turned down. We say  to-night  that we would have a national government to-morrow. </para>
                        <para>The members on this side of the House are nominally from two parties, but for all practical purposes we are one party. So far as is possible, we are completely united, because we are convinced that the interests of this country far transcend the interests of any political party. During the last day or two, we have been assured by honorable members of the Government that oil and water do not mix. <inline font-style="italic">L</inline> say that oil and water have mixed very well in the Services, and what can be done there can be done here. I agree with Churchill when he said, "Let us into the storm, and through the storm"; but we shall go through the storm much better if we go through it together. </para>

                            (Dalley) [9.47 j.This is the most remarkable debate to which I have listened for a long time. Nearly 90 minutes has been wasted in discussing a subject that is of no importance to any one except members of the
                        </para>
                        <para class="block">Opposition, who wish to hold up the business of the House. Since the war began, many men have been forced out of business, in some cases- because of a shortage of supplies, and in others so that plant may be converted to war purposes; but honorable members opposite do not object to a man being forced out of business and losing his life's savings. Now the Allied Works Council has power under regulations, to which honorable members have not objected, to take men out of their civil occupations and force them to do certain work. The council is compelling men to leave their homes and travel to distant parts of the Commonwealth. In some instances, that means the breaking up of homes; always it means a grave upsetting of domestic arrangements. To this, however, honorable members opposite do not object. The honorable member for Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> has no objection to it. When I asked him, he said that he did not object to conscripting men, taking them from their homes, and sending them to another part of the country. Up to that stage, he and other members of the Opposition are ardent advocates of compulsion. We force men to join the Army, and to risk their lives, even though they may not be willing to take that risk. Honorable members opposite are in favour of that. As a matter of fact, the Opposition proposed to attack the Government this session for not compelling men, who are conscripted under the Defence Act, to fight beyond the limits of Australia and its territories. Honorable members opposite are in favour of compelling people to invest in loans ; but, when it comes to compelling them to join a trade union, so that they may make a contribution towards the maintenance of the industrial conditions which they enjoy, honorable members opposite boil with indignation. We have been told a heart-rending story about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> who kept a store, and went " broke ". He was called up by the Allied Works Council and sent to northern Queensland to undertake work he had never done before. Has it occurred to the honorable member who told this pitiful tale that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> is going into an industry in which the workers, by their organization and contributions over a period of three-quarters of a century, have established favorable conditions which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> is going to enjoy? Let us have a thought for the great number of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smiths</inline> who, by their struggles and financial sacrifices, have established present-day conditions in industry. Now, when it is proposed to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> of the bankrupt store, to make a contribution of about 30s. a year towards the maintenance of those conditions, honorable members say it is an outrage on the conscience of the country, and that the great public will want to know why it is done. The people, who are eminently fair-minded, would want to know, if the matter were put to them, why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> should be allowed to enjoy the conditions which other workers have won for him unless he is prepared to contribute something towards the cost. I have been a unionist ever since I was capable of joining a union. I know the conditions that prevailed in the industry when I first entered it, and I know of the improvements that have been effected regarding hours of labour, wages, and general conditions. I also know that, but for the efforts of trade unionists, but for their sacrifices and' contributions, conditions would have remained very much as they were. Which is the more important to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> or to any one else - that he should be compelled to join a trade union, or that he should be compelled to leave his home and go to the other end of the Commonwealth? If the choice were given to -any honorable member of this House, can any one doubt which he would choose. There has been no industrial friction on these jobs over nien joining unions. The only people who have exercised their minds on the subject are honorable members opposite, and I believe that they are doing so to-night merely for the purpose of obstructing the business of Parliament, according to the decision which the Opposition executive made when it met in pre-sessional caucus and asked its members to bring forward complaints with the object of embarrassing the Government. The public will have a very poor opinion of honorable members opposite as the result of the fight they are making to-night, because their cause is not worth while. They want a question to be answered " Yes " or " No ". In my view, the answer should be " Yes ". I agree with the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. If that body has asked the Government to introduce compulsory unionism it should do so. The man who is not prepared to contribute £1 or £1 10s. a year in order to enjoy the conditions that have been established through the personal and financial sacrifices of others is not worth worrying about. </para>

They have accused us of being antagonistic to unionism and all the things for which it stands. No honorable member on the Government side of the chamber has a union ticket as old as mine.

                                <para>- I have no wealth to be conscripted. Long before this war began, I supported the contention of the present Minister for Social Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> that all munitions manufacturing industries should be under government control. I believe that, if the munitions industry throughout the world were nationalized in peace-time, there would be less likelihood of war occurring than when the industry is left in the hands of private enterprise. I have always been in favour of the conscription of men for military service, because I believe that every citizen of a democratic country should take a full share of responsibility for its welfare. </para>

It is far better to fight abroad and prevent devastation in our own country than to fight an enemy on our own shores. France's downfall was the result of the defensive spirit which had developed there after the war of 1914-18. The people of France believed that the Maginot line would never be crossed by an invader. </para>

                                <para>- .There might have been. The downfall of France, which was an extremely advanced democracy, was probably due in part to the fact that it had many parties fighting among themselves for political control and thus dividing the people. I agree that in this chamber we" sometimes hold discussions which are not conducive to public confidence in the National Parliament. There is too much of the party spirit in evidence here. At the last elections I was one of many honorable members who said that they would support a national government under any leader selected by the Parliament. One Labour supporter asked me during my campaign whether I would support a national government under the present Prime Minister, who was then the Leader of the Opposition. I said that if he was the choice of the Parliament he would have my support. I would answer that question in the same way to-night. I would support a leader from any party so long as he had the confidence of the Parliament. I give credit to the Government for its achievements. The Prime Minister has appealed for co-operation, co-ordination of our activities, and' conscription for army service and industrial service. My complaint about industrial conscription is that men have been called up to do work for which they are. not fitted. I do not know whether the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. "Ward)</inline> has any responsibility for this. I do not believe that he has, or he would not have clashed with the Allied "Works Council over the man-power problem. To illustrate my contention, I mention the position of eleven men whom I saw in Sydney last Monday. One of them had been a clerk for many years in a soft goods warehouse in York-street. He was sent to dig holes and lay bricks in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Domain. The other men, <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> also were employed, in a soft goods business, were sent to work on the construction of the new graving dock. This afternoon I mentioned an orchardist. The authorities decided that he was a carpenter merely because he had been erecting a few fowl houses and other buildings on his orchard. He said that he was not a carpenter, but he was told that he would be conscripted as such. When they told him that he would be called, up within a few days, he said that he would refuse to go to the place in the north which they mentioned. He was then told by a junior clerk, sitting on a safe office stool, that if he did not go he would be put. into uniform at 6s. a day and compelled to go to the north. I complain because some of these officials, who are eligible to fight for the country, are allowed to occupy " cushy, cold foot " jobs. They ought to be put in the Army instead of being allowed to send men 59 years of age into a climate which affects their health adversely, to do work for which they are not physically suited. A man who has been employed in a sedentary occupation up to his 59th year and is then sent to a climate to which he is unaccustomed in order to do hard labour is unable to work efficiently. I congratulate the Government on changing the views which it held last year and deciding to conscript industrial power. I agree with the Prime Minister that all of our efforts must be directed to the winning of the war. Unfortunately, men engaged in small businesses are falling by the wayside as the result of the Government's war-time policy. They have our sympathy, and if we can help them we shall do so, but there is plenty of munitions work for these men to do. I have visited most of the munitions factories in the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister never allowed previous governments to work through an all-night sitting without calling for quorums almost every fifteen minutes, thus delaying the business of the Parliament. We on this side of the chamber allowed the Government business to proceed unhindered last night. Do not say that we are stone-walling. Every body knows that the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> and others on this side of the chamber are seeking information. Honorable members opposite have said that the success of the Allied Works Council's activities was due to the fact that its employees were 100 per cent, unionists. That is entirely wrong. In order to illustrate my point, I refer to a letter which I have received from a man who was called up but refused to contribute to union funds. I mention the fact without supporting his refusal. He was told, " We take no notice of those- who refuse ". </para>

If the information had been supplied this afternoon, when the question was asked, the committee would have completed its consideration of the Estimates by now. I have no intention of delaying the passage of the Estimates. Ministers and supporters of the Government must concede that I have not impeded the business of this chamber. Ever since the war began, my desire has been to help governments in the war effort. Nothing that I have done has retarded the work of the present Government. We have had two government versions of the Government's policy in regard to compulsory unionism. One was given by the Prime </para>

                            <para>.- Seldom has a Government been obliged to call so many Ministers to the table in an attempt to evade answering a simple question. These tactics convince the Opposition that the Government is ashamed of what it is endeavouring to do. Two classes of males in Australia are liable to render compulsory service. The first group consists of young, physically fit men who are called u.d to defend the country. The other group consists of men who, being too old for military service, are drafted into the Civil Constructional Corps. The pay of members of the fighting forces is prescribed by the Government. The older men who are required to serve in the Civil Constructional Corps receive award rates, but the Government has endeavoured to extract from them a contribution to trade union- funds. That is most unjust, because trade union finances have nothing to do with winning the war. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> accused the Opposition of introducing party politics into the discussion, but the Government is obviously endeavouring to use its war-time powers to thrust trade union ideals on to an unwilling community. </para>

                                <para>- That is not the subject of discussion. I contend that men who are called up for service in the Civil Constructional Corps should not be required to contribute to trade union funds. When the people realize what the Government is doing, the repercussions will be tremendous. Wages, hours and conditions of employment for members of the Civil Constructional Corps should be fixed by the Government.  a3  the Government is compulsorily calling up the men and employing them, it is also responsible for their rates of pay and conditions. While Ministers deny to the Opposition an unequivocal answer, the action, of the Government will continue to be suspect. </para>

                            <para>.  -  The Opposition has accused the Government of endeavouring to introduce compulsory trade unionism. As Minister for Labour and National Service I have endeavoured at all times to get 100 per cent, unionism. Both in my department and in any other sphere where my influence can be used, I have endeavoured to achieve that object. No section of the community has made greater sacrifices in order to assist the Government to secure a 100 per cent, war effort than has the trades union movement. To this end, trade unionists have sacrificed rights which were not conceded to them by antiLabour governments, despite the fact that  it is difficult to-day to find any member of the Opposition who expresses open antagonism to trade unionism as such. Those rights were won by the unions after many years of struggle. Since the outbreak of hostilities the unions have voluntarily relinquished many of those rights for the duration of the war, because they desire to assist the nation in its hour of need. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> stated that repercussions will follow when the public learns that the Government is endeavouring to use its war-time powers to implement the policy of the Labour party. Why should not the Government take every opportunity to give effect to its policy? In my opinion, the only policy that is likely to assist the people of the country is the policy of the Labour party. My only complaint is that the Government hesitates too much in giving effect to certain phases of its policy. Honorable members opposite speak glibly of an all-in war effort, and support any form of conscription or compulsory service, always provided that the element of compulsion is applied only to the workers. But when the Government recently proposed to limit profits by a method of compulsion, the Opposition raised a score of objections. Honorable members opposite object to men being compelled to contribute to trade union funds, and contend that the Government should protect the conditions prescribed by awards. While private individuals control industry, it is necessary to employ an army of organizers and officials to compel unscrupulous employers to observe awards. Legislation and Arbitration Court awards do not ensure to the workers that to which they are entitled, 'because some employers are continually endeavouring to avoid their obligations under the law. If union officials are required to compel the observance of awards, why should not a small minority of workers fall into line with the vast majority and contribute to the maintenance of the unions? </para>

                                <para>- The Government is not the employer in all cases. A good deal of the work is carried out, not under the direct control of the Government, but by private enterprise. Trade unions are rendering invaluable 'assistance to the Government. Many of them have been weakened numerically because they released their members for other work. They have also supported the plans of the Government for the rationalization of various industries. Despite this service rendered by the unions, honorable members opposite contend that the Government is under no obligation to assist them to preserve their strength and virility. In the period of post-war reconstruction, the trade union movement must be strong, because it will be the basis of a progressive programme of rehabilitation. If the movement be seriously weakened during the war, all the talk about a " new order " will be as futile as it was during the last war. The " new order " which honorable members opposite envisage, and which they are endeavouring to establish, is the system of the Axis countries. Some people in Australia still believe in nazism and fascism, and honorable gentlemen opposite are not immune from the charge of endeavouring to break down working-class organizations. </para>

                                <para>- That is true. They do not object to employees' organizations in which the officials are provided by the bosses. They object only to organizations that are affiliated with the Labour party. If the bosses' unions were affiliated with the United Australia party, honorable members opposite would raise no objection. Recently, the insurance companies proposed to form a new organization, and intimated that those employees who did not join it would lose their jobs. Honorable members opposite did not object, and say that the new organization was unnecessary because a trade union already covered this class of employment. They have supported all sorts of " scab " organizations which, they believe, will weaken the trade union movement, and they have endeavoured to force men into these so-called trade unions to the detriment of the Labour movement generally. If the honorable member for Moreton desires an unequivocal answer to the question which has been directed to members on the Government side of the House, I say that the Labour Government is giving effect to the policy of the Labour party. It is the policy of the Labour party to assist the unions to make themselves strong and virile. If a minority of individuals wish to place their own interests before those of the nation and endeavour to delay important works because they want to be out of step with the majority, the Government will not assist them. Where we can use our influence and endeavours to secure the co-operation of trade unions we shall do so. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Charles Marr)</inline> declared that he had been a member of a trade union for 47 years. Generally, when men join the trade unions their political education progresses, and all I can say about the honorable member for Parkes is that his membership of a union for 47 years is probably the worst advertisement that trade unionism could ever receive. The Allied Works Council is obliging its employees to join bona fide unions. In the Department of Labour and National Service we have directed employees to become members of bona fide organizations. We make no apology for doing so. We think that the trade unions are doing a. wonderful job in the war. The war could not be won without the assistance of the trade unionists, and the Government will assist them to the maximum of its ability. </para>

                            <para>. - A week or so ago I asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> whether it was the intention of himself or some other Service Minister to visit Port Moresby because of the importance of New Guinea to the defence of Australia, and because of the events there. It is singularly strange that neither the Prime Minister nor any Service Minister has visited any of the battle stations in the north of Australia. Neither he, as Minister for Defence, nor any Minister of a Service department has visited Port Darwin since the Japanese raids on that town. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has been to Townsville; but, generally, all the activities of the Government have been concentrated in Canberra. This behaviour is in marked con trast to that of the British Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> who, before Dunkirk, visited the army in France, and who, since Dunkirk, has made several visits to America to see the  President  of the United States of America, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt.</inline> He has travelled by battleship and by aeroplane. He has visited Moscow and conferred with M Stalin and M. Molotoff. He has visited the forces in Egypt, and, generally, he has given proof that he is a dynamic personality, and that he wants to see things on the spot. I believe that it is vitally necessary for Australia, for the morale of the public, for the morale of the forces, and for the sake of this Parliament, that some senior Minister should visit Port Moresby immediately. There is so much being said about Port Moresby to-day, and there are so many fears in the public mind about what is happening there that I do not think that it should be left entirely to generals to report upon. I have no lack of confidence in our Army commanders; but, if it be wise for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> to visit vital points in the Empire's defence areas, it is equally necessary that senior Ministers should visit Port Moresby and Darwin. </para>

The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> has been to Port  Moresby, and has formed certain opinions about it, and I have no doubt that he has given to the Advisory War Council the benefit of his opinions as to the conditions prevailing there. The right honorable member for North Sydney has not been to Port Moresby, but he has made some challenging statements, which have appeared in the press in recent weeks.

                            <para>The Japanese have crossed the impassable Owen Stanley Range, and are now poised for an attack on Moresby, but the military commander still feels confident. </para>

His  statement should be replied to by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> or some other responsible Minister, because the public mind will not be helped if it is left unanswered. The best way to answer it is for a senior Minister to go to Port Moresby himself and see whether it is necessary to alter the uniforms or lighten the rations and improve the equipment of the troops. </para>

Before Parliament adjourns, or immediately after, a senior Minister should look into things in New Guinea, because it is possible that, the military command is in error in believing that Australian troops wearing khaki and heavy boots, and weighed down with all the equipment that might be suitable for desert or trench warfare, are suitably equipped for jungle warfare.

Parenthetically, I remark that, honorable members are at a disadvantage in discussing this proposed vote in the way it has been presented, in that, the Departments of Defence, Navy, Army, Air, Munitions, Aircraft Production, Supply and Development and Home Security are grouped. If the provision for each was shown individually, I and other honorable members would have been able individually to discuss matters affecting thevarious departments as they came up for discussion, instead of under the one heading. </para>

                            <para>Another matter I have studied somewhat closely, in wanderings through northern Queensland and some Pacific islands, is making itself felt - one aspect of it at least - in the demands by large concerns for "compensation " for the loss or damage to mining and commercial undertakings in New Guinea and elsewhere, due to war causes. One large company operating in New Guinea intends to get close on £2,000,000 from the Commonwealth, to enable it to resume, after the war, the socially useless gold-mining business it conducted, very profitably indeed, up to almost six months ago. Like others who have studied the workings of this and other corporations on the spot, I hope that yourself and other Labour men will insist that when talk of compensation begins in earnest, attention will be paid to the need of such compensation, however small, in view of the extraordinary profits made for many years by these people, whose sole function in social life was to secure gold from the soil of one country, by the soulless exploitation of white and native labour, and ship the gold to another country, where it was re-buried in the soil, for the protection of financial monopoly and the degradation of God's poor. In the paying of compensation preference could surely be given to those ordinary every-day people who have lost everything, before millionaire groups who have merely lost, temporarily, the use of one of several unbelievably rich undertakings. One or two of these .groups also deserve attention for their treatment of young Australian employees who, last year, were refused due rises in wages until they " voluntarily " joined the Militia in that area, and put in a lot of their spare time under military control; us soon as the Japanese invasion touched  New  Guinea these youths, some under eighteen years of age, were conscripted on the spot and sent out into the jungle (and no one knows what that means who has not been there), while the " staff " were flown to safety in Australia. After the war these young mon - those of them still alive - whom I know personally, will no doubt be permitted to work again for their at present absentee masters, whose sole activity while in safety in Australia is to agitate for the payment of " compensation " by the million, in order that a few bombed dredges and workshops shall be re-built at the public expense, rather than by drawing on the capital owned by these companies. </para>

                            <para>Wc arrived at Fremantle on Tuesday, the 2Sth July. As soon as they started to coal the  ship  the air vents were turned off, leaving us gasping to get our breath. We asked the military police who were our guards if we could go up on deck for a while. He told us that his orders from the Officer Commanding Troops were that we were not allowed to go up on deck while the ship was in port, although there were six armed guards with revolvers looking after the two of us. Even the Germans on the raider <inline font-style="italic">Wolf</inline> allowed prisoners one hour on deck each day, as stated by an English officer who was a prisoner on that ship. </para>

I was still kept down below with no air coming in. The soldier in the cell with mc is suffering from venereal disease, and the second day wc were at Fremantle he was rolling about in his bunk with pain, and when he asked for medical treatment he was told that the medical officer had gone ashore on leave. He was called up and treated on the Thursday, the 30th July. This is our fourth day here with the air cut off and not allowed up on deck for any. </para>

There are regulations forbidding soldiers to approach members of Parliament in regard to grievances and penalties are imposed for breaches of these regulations. There are penalties .too, some of them very heavy, for soldiers being absent without leave. I understand there is also a regulation which forbids the use of obscene, blasphemous and indecent language, but strangely this regulation has never been enforced, nor, as far as I know, has it ever been mentioned in any orders issued to the Army. </para>

                            <para>.- I wish to discuss a matter that is connected principally with the Departments of Commerce and Supply and Development. I refer in particular to the food situation in Australia. This is not the first occasion on which I have directed the attention of this Parliament to the very serious developments that are occurring in the food-producing industries of this country. As long ago as last March I drew the attention of the Government to the fact that unless urgent action were taken a serious decline of the quantities of foodstuffs we had been accustomed to produce was likely. I then referred principally to the foodstuffs produced by the dairying industry, such as butter, bacon and cheese. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>In connexion with food production in relation to the war, Australia has, in the main, three responsibilities: It has the responsibility of feeding its own troops at home and abroad, feeding allied troops in Australia, and helping to feed Great Britain. Each of those responsibilities must rank as a No. 1 priority, all three being of equal urgency and importance. Failure to provide sufficient food for our own use, and to assist Britain, would be as disastrous as failure to equip our troops or to provide a sufficiency of munitions of war. Food for troops, munitions workers, and civilians in Britain, is a first essential to our winning of the war. An examination of the figures reveals that we have already failed to produce and provide the foodstuffs which the United Kingdom has been accustomed to expect from us. In drawing attention to the matter, I am not suggesting that the Government has embarked upon a deliberate policy of withholding food supplies from Great Britain; but I do say that there has been grave neglect and lack of foresight in attending to the various aspects of the matter. In the immediate pre-war years and, indeed, in the first two years of the war, Australia was an important contributor to the British supplies of meat, butter, eggs, pork and cheese. The export value of those commodities was between £35,000,000 and £40,000,000 a year, and they played a considerable part in our overseas trade. Further, Australia was given a special preference in respect of those commodities on the British market. Now, however, when the United Kingdom needs our foods as it never did previously, we have substantially reduced supplies. This failure not only is damaging to the possible success of our joint cause, but also must inevitably produce an unfavorable reaction to Australian producers at the termination of the war. I shall indicate the present position of the industries I have mentioned, and compare it with the approximate position twelve months and two years ago. The average export of butter for the previous two years was approximately 93,000 tons per annum. For the year ended the 30th June last, the export of butter to the United Kingdom was only about one-half of that quantity, namely, 46,000 tons. According to a bulletin issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, Australia was asked to supply to Great Britain  60,000 tons of butter during the last contract period. We fell down on our obligation by approximately 14,000 tons. </para>

                                <para>- It is not sheer rubbish. That is not an answer to the arguments I am presenting. I shall proceed to deal with other products which the Commonwealth Government definitely undertook to send but we ourselves used. For the last fortnight, I have asked the Minister for Commerce (Mir. Scully)- to furnish the production targets for the various primary industries, notably in respect of butter for the coming twelve months, and have been unable to obtain an answer. The honorable gentleman promised to furnish the information at a later stage; but I have not yet received it. Yet I have read in Queensland newspapers that he had announced the production targets that had been fixed for that State. I have learned from another source that the production targets have been fixed. The bulletin issued by the Commonwealth Statistician states that the requirement of the United Kingdom for the new contract year will be 80,000 tons of butter and 10,000 tons of dry butter-fat. Unless effective action be taken to stimulate butter production in Australia, and at the same time to distribute it equitably between our civilian and army needs and the needs of the United Kingdom, I prophesy that we shall fall down on that quantity by approximately two-thirds. </para>

                                <para>- For the last fortnight I have been asking to be supplied with this information. I consider that I was entitled to have it, in view of the importance of this industry to my district; yet I have not been able to obtain it. I have had to go to official publications. The authority that I have cited is the Commonwealth Statistician, and the figures have been issued only within the last few days. If we cannot rely on that information, there is no other source to which we can go for it. Our exports of beef tell the same story. We dropped from 1,23:2,000 cwt. in 1940-41 to 703,000 cwt. in the year just ended. The latest figures indicate that the exports of beef have now virtually ceased. For the month of June, 1941, the quantity of beef exported to the United Kingdom was 101,000 cwt. ; but for the month of June, 1942-, the quantity was less than 4,000 cwt. That is to say, our exports of beef last June were only 4 per cent, of ou}r exports for the previous June. "We shall be told, no doubt, that this was due to the shortage of shipping, but we know that, in actual fact, it was largely due to a shortage of beef in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- That is the undoubted implication in the Minister's interjection. Knowing the critical position regarding food supplies in Great Britain, knowing how desperately the people there need beef, and knowing that Australia is one of the main sources of supply, the Minister says that we have not sent more beef to Great Britain because the Government is looking after the interests of the people of Australia. 1 congratulate him upon the success of his policy. </para>

Last season, those factories dried 12,000,000 dozen eggs, of which the British people were greatly in need. When the egg powder was ready for export, but before it had been shipped, the Supply Department, I presume it was, took the equivalent of 2,859,000 dozen eggs from what was waiting for shipment. That was how the Government looked after the interests of the people of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I suggested months ago to the Government that the proper way to meet the situation was, not to take what was needed from the British larder, but to increase production so that there would be sufficient foodstuffs both for ourselves and for Great Britain. It is true that the Australian consumer will not go short, because we are using the food ourselves. It is the people of Great Britain who are going without. That is a fine example of co-operation with one of our allies. </para>

                                <para>- The food position is very serious, and it will become infinitely worse within the next twelve months unless immediate action be taken. According to the statistician's figures, the number of pigs in the farmers' pens has dropped from 1,800,000 in 1940-41 to 1,490,000, a decrease of 17 per cent. There will, of course, be an equivalent drop in the quantity of pork and bacon, both for home consumption and for export. Moreover, the number of breeding sows has declined by 15 per cent., so that there will be fewer young pigs next year. The Government, however, has done nothing about it except to appoint committees and hold conferences. It has appointed bodies like the Supply Council and the Production Committee, not one of which has increased production by so much as a pound of butter or a pound of bacon. At a time when there is urgent need for a greater supply of foodstuffs for ourselves and for our allies, the prospects of securing even normal production are very poor. I am not blaming the Government entirely for the decline of production. Many factors are responsible, but I am blaming the Government for not doing anything but set up committees. Between 1941 and 1942, there was a decrease of 10,000 in the number of wages men on farms in New South "Wales, the decline being from 3S,000 to 28,000. The greatest decline was in the dairying districts in the coastal areas, where 36 per cent, of farm workers left the farms. The man-power position is revealed in the general decline of butter production over the last two years. In 1940-41, production declined by 10 per cent., and in 1941-42 by 13 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- I would not say that, though it was certainly a dry season. Shortage of man-power was largely responsible, and unless something be done to rectify the position, even a good season will not increase production sufficiently. The man-power authorities ought to be given more power to release labour for the farms. At present, they can make a recommendation to the commanding officer for the release of a man, but the vast majority of the applications are rejected and the men do not get back to the farm. </para>

                                <para>- About 6,000 men ought to be released if the production of food is to be sufficiently increased. Thai was the recommendation of the Director-General of Man Power, but it was rejected. We have not allowed ourselves to be inconvenienced by the decline of food production. Not only have we maintained our <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> consumption, but we have actually increased it. During the last two years, the consumption of butter in Australia has increased from 30 lb. to 35 lb. a head. The butter ration in Great Britain is 2 oz. a week, or 6-i lb. a year. Our objective ought to be to increase production so that we can meet our own needs, and those of our allies also. Investigations reveal that there are still as many cows on the dairy farms as there were twelve months ago, but there are not so many people to milk them. An investigation of this matter was instituted by the Commonwealth Statistician during the present year. Returns were lodged by 46,876 dairy.farmers. representing 46 per cent, of the industry. They showed that, in 1941-42, 19,596 men left the dairy farms, and of these 11,748 went into the military, naval and air services, and 7,848 obtained other forms of employment. Therefore. the drift from the industry was not entirely due to enlistments and military call-ups. There is no need for me to say that the chief cause of this movement to other employment was economic. That is clear to anybody who knows anything about the dairying industry. The statistician's figures show that, whilst the cost of clothing increased by 53 per cent, from the beginning of the war to the end of June last, and whilst the cost of other items which the farmers have to purchase has increased considerably, the prices of foodstuffs have increased by only 11.4 per cent, over the same period. The price of butter has increased since the outbreak of war from ls. 5d. per lb.  to ls. <inline font-style="italic">5$d.</inline> per lb., representing an increase of 3.6 per cent. In these circumstances, how can the industry carry on economically and compete with the attractions of other industries which offer high wages and better conditions? </para>

                            <para>.- I shall refer briefly to the Barings Administration of the Department of the Army. Several cases have come to my notice in which people have been forced to move out of business premises and have had to wait for a long time before obtaining settlement of their claims by the Army. I have taken these matters up with the Minister for the Army and officials of his department. I know that the Minister is not conversant with all the details of these matters, and I do not wish to embarrass him because he has many other duties to perform, but I point out that there is something radically wrong with the Hirings Administration. Many of these people are removed from their premises at short notice. The authorities are prompt in that regard, at, any rate. In one case, a. woman who had been in business for many years and had built up a thriving trading concern, was given 48 hours' notice to quit her premises. That occurred in May, but, her claim has not yet been settled by the Department of the Army. She has used her reserve funds, and is now virtually destitute. That is an inordinately long delay. Some appropriate authority, preferably attached to the Treasury, ought to be established to deal expeditiously with these claims. When the Army officials take over premises, they are not greatly concerned about the settlement of the previous occupants' claims, because they want to get on with their other important work. The organization which I have suggested could do the work satisfactorily. The Army had associated with it a Board of Business Management, but apparently it has gone out of existence. </para>

There are also State Hirings Committees, each with a representative of the Treasury. In addition, a Compensation Board, which will deal with appeals against decisions of the committees, has been established. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to hear that. We are now in the fourth year of war, and these things should have been attended to before. These anomalies cause uneasiness in the public mind and tend to bring the Government into disrepute. I want the Government to remain popular with the people. The Hirings Administration of the Army should be in the hands of competent people who are in sympathy with the policy of the Government. I hope that the Government will see that such persons are appointed to the committees and the Compensation Board. It should do so, not only in fairness to itself, but also in fairness to the people I have mentioned, who do not mind being removed from their premises so long as their claims are settled promptly. </para>

                        <para>I now direct attention to the way in which the Government's policy in the administration of the Army appears to be deliberately frustrated whenever possible by certain persons occupying high positions in the Army organization. It is apparent that this pinpricking is not accidental. There are numerous instances of the tactics to which I refer. For instance, there was the case of men who returned from abroad and were ordered to remove their Australian Imperial Force colour patches. Only foolishness could have led to such an instruction being issued. At Wallgrove camp some time ago, 200 returned men of the Australian Imperial Force were told to remove their colour patches. They had a sentimental regard for them, and some of the men were inclined to walk out of the camp as a protest. However, the coolerheaded men realized that this would be virtual mutiny, and prevailed upon them to  3end  representatives to the Commanding Officer to lodge a protest. In return for this the Commanding Officer fined them a total of £200. That sort of thing does not create contentment in the Army. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to say that the Minister for the Army permitted the men to continue to wear a miniature Australian Imperial Force colour patch. I have not heard whether  he remitted the fine. However, as the men handled the matter in a democratic and constitutional manner by sending representatives to lodge their protest, they should not have been penalized. The fine should be remitted. The same sort of thing happened in connexion with the metal " Australia " badges, which soldiers were ordered to remove from their shoulders. It was claimed that this was done in order to conserve stocks of metal. The futility of that explanation is obvious. There are miles of barbed-wire fences on many of our beaches which apparently serve no useful purpose. These could be used to make all of the " Australia " badges that the Army needs for the next 1,000 years. There was something more behind that edict than a desire to conserve metal. Somebody is endeavouring to bring the Government into disrepute among the men of the fighting services. I am glad to say that in this case also the Minister rectified the position, but he did so after the damage had been done, and discontent and friction had been caused. At Tamworth, some soldiers who did not take off their badges immediately, were sentenced to fourteen days detention. These actions do not foster the right spirit in the services. The same thing applies to the transfer to the Australian Imperial Force of members of the Australian Military Forces. It was laid down definitely in this House that there was to be no conscription for overseas service. The Government was satisfied that should the necessity again arise to send our fighting men overseas, sufficient numbers of men would transfer voluntarily from the Australian Military Force to the Australian Imperial Force. In fact, disappointment was expressed by a great number of men when a ban was placed upon transfers from the Australian Military Force to the Australian Imperial Force. The Minister for the Army removed that ban subsequently, and gave the Tight to each individual soldier to apply voluntarily for transfer to the Australian Imperial Force. However, the Minister's instructions were not put into effect immediately. Month after month went by and men who wished to transfer were not given permission by their commanding officers to do so. In the mean time officers were parading units of the Australian Military Force, and asking those who wished to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force to move to the left, and those who wished to remain with the Australian Military Force, or " Chockos " as they are called, to move to the right. Those who were in the minority were expected to accept the will of the majority. That was a form of conscription, and was defeating the policy laid down by the Government, because many soldiers in disgust decided to remain with the Australian Military Force. It took three months to give effect to the Minister's instructions. There was no reason for such a long delay. It was a deliberate hold-up on the part of somebody in authority who wished to sabotage the policy of the Government. At one stage an Army order was issued, presumably by the General Officer Commanding, stating that no member of the fighting service could have representations made on his behalf in regard to complaints or grievances. That, in effect, denied our soldiers, their relatives and friends the democratic right which they enjoy as electors to make representations through their members of Parliament. However, the Minister has had that right restored. These occurrences show that somebody in authority is out of sympathy' with the democratic ideals of the people of this country. There are men in the fighting services to-day whose antecedents should be inquired into. I. have had representations made to me privately, and by various organizations, in regard to the presence in our fighting services of such individuals as  Colonel Campbell  and Captain De Groot, who formerly were associated with the New Guard. The Minister for the Army has informed me that  Colonel Campbell  is not in the fighting services, and I accept his assurance on that point, but it is admitted that De Groot is in charge of a unit in this State. I suggest that the proper place for some of these people would be in tha Civil Constructional Corps, at the end of a pick and shovel. After all, if this country were invaded, to whom would the emissaries of Tojo or Hitler go for support? "When Hess landed in England, to whom did he go? He went to the Duke of Hamilton. Obviously, if Fascist invaders came to this country, they would not go to cranks such as members of the Australia First Movement. They would contact people like Campbell and De Groot who have Fascist tendencies, and who in the past have endeavoured to create a revolutionary state of affairs by inciting armed civilian disorder. Therein lies the real menace, and I ask the Minister for the Army to assert his authority and see that a state of military control is not permitted in this country. The Government is answerable to the people, and these individuals should be made to understand that they are subject to the instructions of the Government. The Government need only make an example of a few of them to have the whole position cleared up. I ask leave to continue my remarks. </para>

                        <para>- The shortages of potatoes and of some other vegetables are due to adverse seasonal conditions, man-power problems, shortage of fertilizer, and the heavy demands of the Services. There is not any serious shortage of fruit, but the honorable member's attention is directed to a statement regarding citrus fruits made by the Minister for Supply and Development on the 16th September, 1942. The following additional information is furnished for the information of the honorable member :  - </para>

                            - The main crop of potatoes is an annual one in each State. In the States of heaviest production, the sowing period is  from  September to December. The acreage sown in 1941 produced a crop somewhat lower than normal.When the greatly increased demands of the Australian and allied forces occurred, the supply position could not be remedied quickly. The Federal Potato Committee has planned for a greatly increased acreage during the forthcoming planting season, and, provided wet weather conditions do not interfere with the planting, the committee's objective will be nearly reached. A  normal  crop from the total acreage which it is hoped will be planted should produce supplies sufficient for all purposes. Through the Departments of Agriculture special steps are being taken to ensure priority for potato acreage in the use of fertilizers, and the close collaboration existing between the Man Power Directorate and the Commerce Department is expected to result in the provision of adequate labour for planting and harvesting. Although supplies of potatoes will be short for another two months it is estimated that 153,000 acres will be planted, and, if average yields are obtained, this should provide 450,000 tons compared with the average production of 350,000 tons.

                            - The Department of Supply and Development has made some special arrangements for the production of vegetables for Service requirements, and that department, and the Commerce Department, are providing equipment for canning and dehydration respectively. A special committee jointly organized by the Council for Scientific andIndustrial Research and the Commerce Department, has planned for the importation and production of vegetable seeds of various kinds, and sufficient quantities of seed will be available for all purposes. Arrangements have been made, through the Departments of Agriculture, for the supply of adequate quantities of fertilizers for vegetable production, but the Commonwealth Government has not adopted a special production programme for vegetables for civil consumption.

                            <para>Yes. Accumulation at dockside of large shipments of equipment necessitated augmenting civilian labourers available to ensure much-needed supplies reaching the armed forces with least possible delay. Consequently, it was decided to raise several labour companies throughout Australia. As the manpower situation prevented these units being raised by normal existing methods it was decided to withdraw suitable persons over 35 years. Tasmania's quota was 200 men, but only 106 were withdrawn. </para>

It engages different firms from time to time. Valuations are made on behalf of the Department of the Interior by the district valuators on the State staff of the Commonwealth Taxation Department, also by the District Valuer of the New South Wales Valuer-General's Department. Additional valuations arc also obtained in certain cases from the leading accredited estate agents operating in the locality in which the particular property under review is situated. A Land Valuation Committee for the State has also been set up in an arrangement between the Departments of the Interior and the Army. This committee deals with property to be acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act 1906-1936 or possessed under the National Security (General) Regulations. The committee comprises the Property Officer of the Department of the Interior in the State as  chairman,  the Chief Valuer of the Taxation Department, Sydney, and the D.A.D. of Hirings, Army Eastern Command. </para>

                        <para>- At the commencement of this sitting, the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark)</inline> asked whether it was intended to prosecute a trader who had overcharged <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Madeleine</inline> Comino 5s. 3d. on a bottle of olive oil. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Comino</inline> had been advised by the  Deputy  Prices Commissioner in New South Wales that a refund of 5s. 3d. would be available to her, but she had declined the refund and declared that she considered the trader should be prosecuted. </para>

                    <para>By arranging for a refund the  Deputy  Prices Commissioner has done nothing to interfere with the right to prosecute the offending trader. By refusing to accept the refund <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Comino</inline> will add nothing towards hastening the prosecution of the trader. The facts are that the operations of this trader are under examination to ascertain whether this is an isolated case. This is the normal practice in the administration of prices control. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Comino's</inline> complaint was attended to with reasonable promptitude, considering the burden of work falling on the prices control authorities, and the next stage is to examine the operations of the trader with a view to deciding whether a prosecution should follow. This is now in progress. </para>

                <para>Notes. - (  1 ) Rabbit skins are not sold by auction in Tasmania and statistics of quantities sold are not available. Owing to climatic conditions Tasmanian skins are of high quality. Prices paid by the principal main land firm buying in Tasmania averaged between 70d. and 75d. per lb. (2) Rabbit skins quantities in Queensland are negligible. (3) The average prices in the above table cover both "sleeved" and "butchered" skins. </para>
