            <para>- I did give the honourable member the assurance that he sought, and I took an earlier opportunity at the last meeting of the Commonwealth Health Insurance Council to reiterate and explain the views that the Government and I hold on this matter. The matter raised by him today has not been brought to my attention. If it is, I willlook at it. I think the House should take into account that the executives and boards of the health insurance funds are composed of a lot of honourable men who perform selfless work, many in an honorary capacity. They have been subjected to a tirade of abuse and misrepresentation by the honourable gentleman and his colleagues in the Labor Party over a long period of time simply to serve the political purposes of honourable members opposite. Most of the allegations made against officers of these funds were rejected by the Nimmo Committee in its report. If the honourable gentleman is to behave in this way for his own political purposes he should not scream if occasionally these people move to defend themselves and to explain their position. </para>

            <para>- I welcome the opportunity to comment on this matter. It is certainly true that some currency was given to reports that troops of Southern Command were on stand-by to prepare for and to control demonstrations which had been planned to be held against the Vietnam war on 4th July 1969. I take this opportunity to assure the House that the reports were completely unfounded. I understand that they were generated as a result of a planned programme of political propaganda directed at the Army through the Melbourne news media by left wing dissident groups which were involved in the demonstrations. False information of the disposition of troops in Southern Command was given to most of the Melbourne news media but when this information was referred to Headquarters, Southern Command, it was immediately denied by that Headquarters. In the several days prior to 4th July, Headquarters, Southern Command, was at pains to point out to all news media in the Melbourne area including the ABC that reports of this type were quite untrue. Because of this fact it is regrettable that a report was released by the ABC in the programme This Day Tonight&#39; stating that two companies of infantry were being held in reserve close to the United States Consulate in Commercial Road, Prahran, to assist the police should their assistance be required. Immediately the statement was made by the ABC, Headquarters, Southern Command contacted the television station concerned and a retraction of the statement was made. </para>

              <para>- Yes, the damage had been done. A denial of the claim was later carried by most Melbourne news media. I express concern that a national television network should release material of this kind without endeavouring to authenticate it with responsible authorities. A similar and equally unfounded report has recently been circulated that troops have been on stand-by in case they are required in connection with the current industrial unrest involving employees of the State Electricity Commission. That report is also completely unfounded. Because the Australian Army is the principal government agency applying policy in relation to Vietnam and national service it is under continual attack in this country from the lunatic fringe of the dissident and the disaffected. Undoubtedly the two instances of unfounded rumours to which I have referred are but part of this attack and it is well that the House should be aware of the situation. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister for Health. Did he say on 3rd August that the Australian Labor Party&#39;s alternative national health programme &#39;is completely dependent on the co-operation of the medical profession in using a fixed schedule of fees&#39;? Did the Nimmo Committee conclude that the element of certainty as to costs to be met by insurance is vital to any system of health insurance? Is it not then a fact that the present system of voluntary health insurance and the alternative programme put forward by the Australian Labor Party are equally dependent upon agreements being reached with the medical profession on the stabilisation of fees? </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable gentleman is no. The Nimmo Committee quite specifically rejected the proposal of a fixed schedule of fees for the very good reason - amongst others I would imagine - that it is well known that the medical profession does not regard such a scheme as desirable and, in the Australian context, would not agree to operate a fixed schedule of fees. The Nimmo Committee did put forward a proposal related to a most common fee which is a very different matter from imposing a fixed schedule of fees on the medical profession which, as I understand it, is what is contained in the proposal of the Australian Labor Party. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But the Australian Labor Party&#39;s proposal goes further than that. It is not only utterly dependent on doctors agreeing to a fixed schedule of fees, negotiated somehow or other - I would imagine, imposed on them - but also utterly dependent for its workability on doctors being prepared to send their bills direct to the health insurance funds and to accept 85% of the schedule of fees, which they probably have had imposed on them anyway. The only point that I make in answer to the honourable gentleman&#39;s question is that the Nimmo Committee&#39;s recommendations and the Australian Labor Party&#39;s proposal are utterly different. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Attorney-General. It relates to the search ordered by Cabinet and conducted by Commonwealth Police, acting under what we now know to be invalid warrants, of the premises owned and occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Maxwell</inline> Newton on 23rd May of this year. Is it a fact, as has been alleged, that some of the documents seized and some of the information obtained by the Commonwealth Police had no relation to the possible commission of any offence of the kind described in the warrants? Have any of those documents or has any of that information been conveyed to the Prime Minister or any other Minister? Finally, I ask the Attorney-General: What does the Government propose to do to make amends to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Newton</inline> for the unlawful invasion of the privacy of their home and the illegal seizure of their private papers? </para>

            <para>- Dealing first with the form of warrants, I think perhaps I should point out that no form of warrant is prescribed under section 10 of the Crimes Act. That section, under which warrants are issued, is perfectly general in its terms. The particular form used is one which has been in use since 1943 when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> was Attorney-General. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox has held that the form of the warrants was bad. Now, we are considering at the moment whether we should seek a further clarification of the law on this subject in a higher place. But, accepting for the moment the decision of  His  Honour, I think that I should put some things into perspective. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no question, on  His  Honour&#39;s findings, that the evidence which the police took to the Justice of the Peace to ask for a warrant was sufficient to entitle them to a search warrant. There is no question that they could have got a warrant in the proper form. If they had, what they in fact did might have been done under a warrant in proper form. Nevertheless, the warrant issued was incorrect in two respects according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox; , firstly because it did not contain a correct recital of the fact that the Justice of the Peace was satisfied by the evidence that he had heard that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting there was in any house or place anything as to which there were reasonable grounds for believing that it would afford evidence of an offence, but in fact set out that the Justice of the Peace had been informed by an officer of the police force that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence had been committed. </para>
          <para>But, more importantly,  His  Honour held that the warrant was general in its terms and did not specify that the search should be for documents relating to a specified offence, for instance the offence of the disclosure of the Paris cable about which evidence had been given before the Justice of the Peace. This was the main objection on which the warrants were held invalid, but I should point out that the authorities show that even if the warrants had been so restricted, had the search disclosed documents which might have revealed other offences the officers would have been permitted to take those other documents. There would therefore have been that degree of correspondence in the conduct of the search. Therefore I think it is quite premature to be asking me what amends should be made. No doubt the law provides adequate remedies if anyone has been injured and I do not think I should be asked to answer questions along these lines. </para>

            <para>- I answered the question of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition as he asked it. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition attempted to suggest that the Nimmo Committee proposed a schedule of fees. It is, of course, the policy of the Australian Labor Party to impose a schedule of fees on the medical profession. I said that the Committee did not propose a schedule of fees but a system based on a most common fee approach, which is a very different matter and is regarded as such by the medical profession. That was a factual answer. If the honourable gentleman wants to know the attitude of the Australian Medical Association to these things and its reason for having that attitude I suggest he ask the Australian Medical Association. </para>

            <para>- The expeditious processing of mail to and from Vietnam is, of course, a vital factor in the morale of our troops, and every effort is made to ensure that there is no avoidable delay. There has recently been a change in the carriage of first class mail. Previously first class mail was carried to Vietnam by Pan-American Airways from Sydney to Honolulu on 7 days a week and then from Honolulu to Saigon on 6 days a week. This has now been changed and the mail will be carried by R. and R. aircraft. The change has been made possible because space which was not previously available is now available on R. and R. aircraft. Whilst it is too early to assess in detail the result of the change, officers of my Department expect that the processing of mail will be no less favourable than it was under the previous arrangement. The time for delivery of first class mail from the post box to the soldier is between 3 and 6 days, depending on where the mail is posted. This mail, of course, is carried free of charge. There has been no change in the carriage of second class mail, which is carried by RAAF courier or charter aircraft at parcel post rates. The delivery time from post box to soldier is about 14 days. There has been no change in the arrangement for the carriage of mail between Saigon and Nui Dat. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Minister for Health. Is it correct that soldiers in Vietnam are exposed to a very high incidence of the dreaded disease of leprosy? Is it also correct that some troops have returned to their homeland with a leprosy infection? Is it correct that, due to the long incubation period, it may be 3 years before an infected person actually becomes aware of his insensitive areas? If this is so, what are the appropriate authorities doing to protect our boys against the disease while they are in Vietnam? Are they all tested immediately before or upon arrival back in Australia? What arrangements are made for tests during the incubation period of 3 years after they return from Vietnam? Are all American troops from Vietnam tested before they are allowed into Australia on leave or for other purposes? </para>

            <para>- Naturally the Government watches with some concern the trends and the strategic developments in the Indian Ocean area. There have been recent reports of increased Soviet naval activity there, but I think it is proper to put this on a factual basis. There have in fact been three separate visits by Russian naval flotillas to the Indian Ocean since early 1968. On no occasion did the flotilla consist of more than twelve ships in all, with seven fighting ships. The composition was about two cruisers, a couple of destroyers, some submarines and the balance would be supply vessels and tankers. These ships operated mainly from the Soviet base atVladivostok. Up to the present, although there has been an increasing Russian interest it poses no threat to any Australian interest. </para>

Has he noted the Nimmo Committee&#39;s conclusion that &#39;an unduly high proportion of the contributions received by some organisations is absorbed in operating expenses&#39;? Is it his responsibility to see that the amounts appropriated for operating expenses by registered health benefit organisations do not exceed a prescribed percentage of their contribution income?

Australia has sold a number of Jindivik aircraft in Europe, both to Sweden and the United Kingdom. One would assume that repairs are made in England to aircraft flown by the United Kingdom Government. But I assure the honourable member that I have no knowledge whatsoever of this aircraft being built in England and I would be extremely surprised if it were. However, in view of the certainty in the tone of his voice I will make some inquiries. </para>

Will the Minister expand on this point? Does the Government consider this to be a disturbing trend in the national fitness of this age group? Will the Minister review the situation with his colleague, the Minister for Health, with a view to the National Fitness Council engaging in a programme to reduce this percentage of rejections? </para>

            <para>- The standards which are applied by my Department are those fixed by the Army and other defence authorities. The same standard has to be met by national servicemen as is met by Regular Army recruits and those wishing to join the Citizen Military Forces. It is true that at first sight the rejections appear to be high. But what, in most cases, would appear to be a perfectly fit man or even an athletic man for ordinary purposes would not necessarily be fit for service in the jungles of South East Asia. For instance, acne, tinea and quite a number of other diseases, which normally would have little effect on Australians living in a capital city, up there would cause considerable inconvenience to and inefficiency in people if they were called upon to serve in the Army. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is our intention to continue to apply precisely the same standards as those laid down by the Army. It is not for my Department or me to apply standards. But they are the necessary minimum service standards. I have no reason to think that they are not perfectly suitable for the purpose for which they are designed. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that anybody could say with the kind of certainty which the honourable member for Yarra said that the actions in Vietnam of allied troops would cease at some early date. Indeed, I believe that the  President  of the United States has made it clear that while he wishes to disengage, that disengagement is to be dependent upon what happens at the Paris peace talks and upon the reaction of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese to the strong moves towards peace which have been made by the United States, so far without being reciprocated by those who are engaging in attacking South Vietnam. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In these circumstances, I do not believe that there is any long term precise or firm programme for the disengagement of United States troops, but that that will depend upon circumstances in the future. For ourselves, the situation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> remains as I have presented it to this House before. The forces provided by the United States for what we believe to be the proper protection of a country under attack - South Vietnam - have been greatly increased since our contingent of ground troops was built up to its present size. There has been a withdrawal of some United States troops, but I believe that unless and until there is continued withdrawal of United States troops and a programme for that which depends upon the working out of these other conditions, then it is premature to talk in terms of Australian troops. What will be necessary, of course, is that if - and this is a big &#39;if - there is to be on the part of the United States a specific, definite and drawn out plan for withdrawal, then Australian troops would need to be phased into that plan. That is all I have to say to the honourable member at the moment. </para>

              <para>- I have it in my mind - but I cannot be quite sure and definite while talking to the House at this stage - that it is quite likely that the astronauts will be visiting Australia. What they would see when they came to Australia would, I have no doubt, cover those installations, such as the Parkes telescope and other tracking installations, which would have been connected with this great adventure of man going to the moon. But that is contingent upon my being accurate in my recollection that this visit may take place. </para>

By way of support, I remind the Minister that on two recent occasions I have witnessed overbooking of seats by Trans-Australia Airlines in Sydney, to the great inconvenience of certain people. This inconvenience is aggravated by the parallel scheduling by both major airlines out of Sydney airport. In view of the many criticisms that are being expressed about this parallel scheduling and the overbooking of flights, has the Minister considered instituting a system wherein the over-booking of airline seats by Australian airlines will be subject to a type of penalty similar to that in force in the United States of America, where heavy fines are imposed upon domestic airlines which are guilty of over-booking of seats? </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the report to which the honourable gentleman refers, but in relation to the comment about our two airline system which applies to the major trunk routes in Australia I point out that it is rather unusual to have major criticism of the services which are provided, because constantly I receive requests from other countries for information regarding the system which we operate in Australia. In fact, on several occasions I have had requests for people to visit Australia in order to study our system with a view to trying to implement it in their own country because they feel that it would be an improvement. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But having said that, of course, it is realised that no <inline font-style="italic">system</inline> can be perfect, and no doubt there are some faults associated with the present system. The question of parallel timetables is one matter. Honourable members will recall that about 2 years ago I set up a special committee to investigate this matter. As a result of the committee&#39;s report, some improvements were made. We hope that as time goes on, with the introduction of new and additional aircraft, the system will be improved in that direction. The question of over-bookings has not been drawn definitely to my attention, except on casual occasions in correspondence, but I will certainly arrange for some investigation to be made. I may say that our system of bookings in Australia is in keeping with the best standards in the world. Most of this work now has been changed over to computers. Possibly some problems are arising in the changeover. I will investigate the matter to see whether any action should be taken, and if any is taken I will let the honourable gentleman know. </para>

            <para>- At the present time section 10 of the Crimes Act, which authorises the issue of warrants, gives the power to a justice of the peace. This has been so for a very long time, the theory being that there is the interposition of someone who is independent of the police or any authority seeking the warrant. Whether this should be placed in the hands of a magistrate rather than a justice of the peace is, I think, a question that ought tq be given some consideration. However, I think we should await the consideration of the present case and, following a final determination one way or the other, give consideration to the matter that has been raised. </para>

            <para>- by leave- On 10th February 1963 an article appeared in the early editions of the &#39;Sun-Herald&#39; which was withdrawn from the late editions. A report on this same matter did not appear in the early editions of the &#39;Sunday Telegraph&#39; of the same date, but it appeared in the late editions of that publication. In the week following these publications I commenced legal action in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against John Fairfax and Sons Ltd, publishers of the Sun-Herald&#39;. I also commenced action against Australian Consolidated Press Ltd, publishers of the &#39;Sunday Telegraph&#39;. In the first trial against both the &#39;Sunday Telegraph&#39; and the &#39;Sun-Herald&#39; I received substantial verdicts on all counts. In fact, I received a verdict in my favour on all counts in all three jury trials, with the exception of one count against Australian Consolidated Press Ltd. On that count a new trial was ordered, but it did not eventuate. A settlement was made out of court with John Fairfax and Sons Ltd several years ago. A public apology had earlier been published on the front page of the &#39;Sun-Herald&#39;. Australian Consolidated Press Ltd apologised in the &#39;Sunday Telegraph* on 20th July 1969. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The case against Australian Consolidated Press Ltd had a long journey through the courts. First of all, the case was heard before a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in reference to the declaration. An appeal was then heard before the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, following which the matter came before a jury of twelve in a trial which lasted for 13 days. An appeal against the verdict in this trial again went before the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. A further appeal was heard before the Full Bench of the High Court of Australia and then before the Privy Council in London. A second trial was granted and it lasted for  7  days. A further appeal was then made to the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the hearing lasted for a week. On one count the Supreme Court of New South Wales awarded a third trial, a jury trial, which did not eventuate. The matter has now been settled out of court with Australian Consolidated Press Ltd. </para>
          <para>This has been the first opportunity for me to raise this matter in the House. For the past 64 years it has been sub judice. The inspiration for the libel which was published arose from a speech made in the debate on the motion for the adjournment of this House on 29th November 1962 by the honourable member for Ballaarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Erwin).</inline> At that time he was a member of the Government&#39;s back bench. There were interesting aspects of the honourable member&#39;s contribution. Firstly, he read from a prepared speech, which at that time was contrary to the Standing Orders of the House. A point of order was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reynolds</inline> who was then honourable member for Barton. The speech of the honourable member for Ballaarat lasted for only 5 minutes, notwithstanding that he was entitled to speak for 10 minutes.  His  charges were that I was inspired by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ivan</inline> Skripov, a first secretary of the Soviet Embassy. The honourable member&#39;s speech is recorded at page 2820 of Hansard of 29th November 1962. In part he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para> I ask why certain members of the start of the Russian Embassy, particularly one <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ivan</inline> Skripov, a first secretary of the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, has been a regular visitor to this House and has been cultivating the friendship of certain members of the Australian Labor Party, in particular the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)-</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honourable member also referred to two other honourable members and continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Have these members been inspired by this Soviet diplomat to ask questions on a number of sensitive foreign policy issues, and have they been briefed for foreign policy debates. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honourable member also said:   the visit to this House yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Skripov</inline> . . . and having in mind also the sinister remarks in the debate last night, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, by the honourable members for Parkes and Reid concerning the proposed American base on the north-west coast of Australia, I suggest that we again have evidence that these honourable members are being directly inspired by Soviet Embassy officials. </para>
          <para>I rose to speak in the debate - it was a Thursday evening - but as I had spoken the night before on the motion to adjourn the House I was unable to get the call. At the conclusion of the following week the House adjourned for the Christmas recess. For some weeks prior to the termination of the sittings the House had been sitting, with the exception of Tuesday evening, into the early hours of the morning, in fact, the sitting of Wednesday, 5th December, extended until later than 3 a.m. on Thursday, at which time the honourable member for Banks <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Costa)</inline> was gagged when he sought to speak on the motion to adjourn the House. The sitting of Thursday, 6th December continued until later than 3 a.m. on Friday, 7th December. The only honourable members to participate in the valedictory were <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, who was Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and that old warrior <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> J. Ward - the only back bench member to speak. We all know his attitude towards valedictory speeches. At this time articles had already appeared in the Brisbane Telegraph* and the &#39;Daily Mirror&#39; debunking the speech of the honourable member for Ballaarat and condemning McCarthyism. I regret that at the time I did not use the forms of the House to make a personal explanation and to dissociate myself from the statements made by the honourable member for Ballaarat. I will not allow such an incident to occur again without employing the forms of the House to answer the statements made. </para>
          <para>On 7th February 1963, before the Parliament reassembled, Skripov was pronounced persona non grata. Three days later the libellous article appeared in the &#39;SunHerald&#39; and the &#39;Sunday Telegraph&#39;. In the first trial Australian Consolidated Press tendered a newspaper article in the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; in support of its plea that the libel had been &#39;published in the course of or for the purpose of discussion of some subject of public interest the public discussion of which is for the public benefit&#39;. This is a protection provided under section 17H of the New South Wales Defamation Act. The newspaper article was dated 16th July 1962. All honourable members know that Parliament is in recess at that time of the year. Although I read the Melbourne Age&#39; when Parliament is sitting, I do not generally see the newspaper when the Parliament is not sitting. The article was headed: &#39;Soviet Activities Here Arouse Interest&#39;. It was written by the Canberra correspondent of the &#39;Age&#39;, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Bennetts, who is now employed by the Australian National University. An examination of the article discloses that it resembles the speech made by the honourable member for </para>
          <para class="block">Ballaarat in the House of Representatives on 29th November 1962. In fact, some paragraphs of the article and the speech are identical. The newspaper article of 16th July and the honourable member&#39;s speech of 29th November had a similar style. It appeared as though <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bennett&#39;s</inline> had written both items. It differed in that the newspaper article of 16th July 1962 mentioned only &#39;a number of back-bench members of Federal Parliament*. The speech made on the adjournment by the honourable member for Ballaarat mentioned two honourable members as well as naming myself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bennetts</inline> was so prompt in having the names of all three honourable members published in the newspaper he represented that his paper, excluding one other, was the only morning newspaper on 30th November, outside of Canberra, that ran this smear article. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bennetts</inline> published this smear under the protection of claiming that he was reporting what was happening in Parliament. </para>
          <para>I have come to the conclusion that two things may have happened: Either the diligent, efficient honourable member for Ballaarat&#39; copied word for word some of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bennett&#39;s</inline> newspaper article and utilised the remainder of the newspaper article as the theme for his prepared speech on 29th November or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bennetts</inline> wrote the speech for the honourable member for Ballaarat so that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bennetts</inline> might smear certain honourable members under the protection of the claim that he was reporting the happenings of Federal Parliament. I cannot say which it is. I have no evidence to say that. I cannot say for certain what inspired the honourable member for Ballaarat to make such a speech. All I ask honourable members to do is to examine the articles that I have quoted. Then, honourable members may draw their own conclusions. </para>
          <para>In regard to the allegations made by the honourable member for Ballaarat on the night of 29th November 1961, so that it may be recorded in Hansard, I say that these allegations were completely false. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Skripov</inline> nor any other Russian diplomat has approached me to seek any information about any matter whatsoever. Any views expressed by me in regard to the then proposed North West Cape base were exclusively mine based, on my national outlook. I was inspired - or, should I say, prompted - to ask my first question on the proposed North West Cape base of the then Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Athol</inline> Townley, on 16th March 1961 by what I read in the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39; of 28th February 1961. This is interesting. It is a little dumbfounding for the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39; that I sued the Fairfax organisation while my source of information on this matter was the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39;. </para>
          <para>The House went into recess. During that recess, I saw another newspaper article on this subject. Again, it was in the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39;. When Parliament resumed, I asked a second question on this subject of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Townley</inline> on 15th August 1961. Again, my source of information was the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39; of 21st July 1961. If honourable members would like me to have these matters incorporated in Hansard, I have both articles here. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I seek permission to have both of these articles incorporated in Hansard. I ask for leave to do so. </para>

              <para>- The next matter that I desire to mention is this: I asked questions of the then Minister for Defence and the then Prime Minister. The source of my information for those questions was the statement in the House of Representatives on 17th May 1962 by the then Prime Minister. If anybody wishes to check on the history of this article, he will see that the Prime Minister made a statement on 17th May, which was a Thursday morning. I had my name down for the Grievance Day debate. I made a few comments during that debate about the statement made by the Prime Minister. I followed up these questions again after the parliamentary recess and continued to agitate in regard to the questions that I raised because the replies that I received from the Prime Minister were particularly negative and because I felt that, as a member of Parliament, I had the right to seek this information. </para>

It is on people - the ordinary people - that we must rely for justice. That is why I will struggle to retain the jury system. I wish to thank my senior counsel, Clive Evatt, Q.C., for standing by me during these long years. I desire to thank the staff of Parliament House for they have helped me so much.

            <para>- by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> this statement is concerned with the recent incidents near Kieta, Bougainville, in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, in connection with the provision of land for the Bougainville copper project. On 3 1st July a lease was issued to Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd under the Territory Mining Ordinance over 175 acres of land at Rorovana. On 1st August, surveyors commenced marking the boundary of this land. In view of reports that there might be violence 100 police were sent to the area in three groups. A group of approximately 20 women crowded around police guarding a concrete survey peg. The police did not use force and eventually the peg was removed and carried away by the women. Clearing and marking of the area continued on 2nd and 4th August without interference. On 5th August a bulldozer clearing scrub for the survey team was confronted by a group of approximately 65 men and women. There were approximately 70 police present. The officer in charge warned the people to disperse on at least two occasions. He then ordered a group of 15 police carrying shields and batons to move in front of the bulldozer and attempt to push the crowd away with their shields. There was a general melee and at this point the officer in charge decided to attempt to disperse the crowd with tear gas. The tear gas used is nontoxic. It was only partially effective. After further warnings police were ordered to use their batons about the legs of the natives and after a very short time the crowd dispersed. There were no injuries other than one man who appeared to have grazed his leg falling over a log. No-one was injured by the police. Minimum force was used. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The members of the Papua and New Guinea constabulary acquitted themselves with distinction in these incidents, behaving with the greatest restraint and discipline. Their actions were at all times fully in accordance with the fine traditions of this force. These are the facts of the incidents. I turn now to the situation behind them. </para>
          <para>For many years there has been some knowledge of the mineral wealth at Bougainville Island but it was not until 1960 that an Administration geologist reported the possibility of a major low-grade copper deposit. Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd began prospecting the area in 1964. In 1967 after more than 12 months of negotiation an agreement was signed between the company and the Administration. This agreement was tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament. It was debated in the Territory House of Assembly and a ratifying Ordinance was passed by the House. The House consisted of 54 elected and 10 official members. The House also amended the Territory mining legislation so as to provide that 5% of aU royalties for minerals should be paid to the owners of the land from which the minerals were taken. This was accepted by the Government. </para>
          <para>In June of this year the Territory House of Assembly (now consisting of 84 elected and 10 official members) debated a comprehensive White Paper on the Bougainville project and again endorsed it. The motion passed by the House on this occasion described the project as &#39;a major and essential development in the economic future of the Territory&#39;. </para>
          <para>In relation to the situation at Rorovana as well as at Arawa, the Administrator consulted the Administrator&#39;s Executive Council, which has a majority of elected members of the House of Assembly. The Council gave unanimous support to the Administrator&#39;s proposals for further direct consultation with the people, to be followed if unsuccessful by leasing under the Mining Ordinance or by compulsory acquisition under the Lands Ordinance, and endorsed the employment of police if necessary to ensure protection of those going about thenlawful business in the area. The Council also expressed an earnest wish that the Rorovana and Arawa villagers would sell their land to the Administration. </para>
          <para>The Bougainville copper project offers gigantic benefits to the Territory as a whole. These benefits will include jobs for 2,500 New Guineans within the next 5 years, a township of 10,000 people, a $2m training programme for indigenous people during the period to 1973, revenue to the Administration of between $200m and $300m in the first 10 years of operation, and export income in excess of Si 00m per annum. </para>
          <para>In addition, the Administration, on behalf of the people of the Territory, has the option of a 20% equity interest in the project. CRA has indicated that it may also provide opportunities for individual equity participation by the people of Bougainville. The project therefore offers a tremendous opportunity for the Territory to lift itself up out of the field of competition of low priced tropical products in international trade, and to make a giant stride towards economic self-reliance. </para>
          <para>In view of its importance to the Territory and in view of the nature of the problems involved, the Government and the Administration approached this whole question with great and careful consideration of the problems extending over many months. Advice regarding particular aspects of the attitude of the local people from expert anthropologists and psychologists has been carefully examined and the whole matter has been the subject of the most careful study. </para>
          <para>Certain difficulties were experienced in 1966 and 1967 in the actual area of mining operations at Panguna, where the open pit mine, the concentrate plant, the mine town and a location for stacking waste rock will be sited. The 10,000 acres of this land is covered by a special mining lease. </para>
          <para>The people of Guava, Moroni and Dapera who occupy or own land in this lease were originally antagonistic to the project as are the coastal people of Rorovana and Arawa now. The problems were handled patiently and sympathetically. These inland people are now reconciled to the mining operation. They are receiving full compensation for loss of housing and gardens and there will also be annual cash payments for the loss of use of land and for royalties. In summary there are about 1,000 men, women and children involved and when the mine is fully in operation cash payments are expected to total approximately $100,000 per year. Not all the compensation for loss of houses and gardens, et cetera, has yet been determined by the mining warden but some fifty people in the village of Moroni have been awarded cash and kind compensation valued at approximately $40,000. </para>
          <para>Other leases required for roads, disposal of tailings, sources of aggregate and limestone et cetera may total up to 40,000 acres. Much of this area will be swamp. It is not expected that village dwellings will be involved. </para>
          <para>The incidents on 1st and 5th August that I have referred to above relate only to requirements for the port. The company had, however, proposed that the town be sited on the coast in an area of some 2,000 acres south of the site proposed for the port. This location would have deprived some 650 villagers of their houses, gardens and economic crops. To avoid this the Administration decided to locate the town at Arawa plantation of 998 acres and to supplement this area with some 640 acres of adjacent sparsely planted village land which contained no village houses. </para>
          <para>The arrangements for land for the port and for the town that were decided upon were chosen so as to cause the least disturbance to the minimum number of native people. The land is uninhabited. No homes are lost. No villages are displaced. The people have other land. Full compensation will be paid. If need be, however, the Administration will also make other land available. </para>
          <para>In providing land for the port or for the town associated with the copper project the Administration is acting first and foremost in the interests of the Territory. The Territory gets more out of the copper project than the company, does. The project will not be on full stream until about 1980. When that happens, however, the following points apply: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">

              <para>if the Administration&#39;s option on 20% of the equity is taken up then one-fifth of the dividends paid or profits accumulated but not distributed will accrue to the Territory. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Quite apart from these financial considerations and the indirect tax benefits flowing from the huge payroll that will be financed by the project there are the jobs, training and development benefits I have already referred to. The people of Bougainville have known for years that the project would require substantial areas of land but until the detailed investigations were completed it was not possible to specify the particular areas. In March of this year the company applied for its special mining lease. This brought into operation major aspects of the Agreement, including the obligation by the Administration to provide land. For over 3 years the Administration has used all possible means to explain to the people of Bougainville the nature and implications of the mining project. The construction of Radio Kieta was expedited in 1967 to facilitate communications with the native people. </para>
          <para>Since mid-1966 over forty Administration patrols have been made in the area affected by the mining project. A primary objective of these patrols has been to explain to the people the nature of the project and how it would affect them. In addition, individual officers have spent in the aggregate hundreds of days visiting villages and individual families for this same purpose. The Administrator himself visited Bougainville earlier this year and spoke to the people and talked over Radio Bougainville. Last month an Assistant Administrator led a special mission to the Island and held meetings in the villages most affected. This mission included indigenous ministerial members of the House of Assembly and all three Bougainville members of the House. Radio and news sheets have been used extensively and the elected members for Bougainville have been given every opportunity and encouragement to inform themselves and their people of the project and the consideration it had been given by the House of Assembly. </para>
          <para>As an example of the detailed and painstaking effort on the part of the Administration to achieve communication with the local people I refer to the fact that the </para>
          <para class="block">Assistant District Commissioner of the area visited Rorovana four times in the past 4 months and the people of Rorovana themselves visited the District Headquarters at Kieta 12 times in the past 5 months for discussions. There have also been frequent discussions with the Councillors of the Rorovana Council and the Council  President. </para>
          <para>It appears that the opposition of the Rorovana people to the sale of their land to the Administration is not related to lack of information nor, indeed, to the amount of compensation offered to them. Some 175 acres of Rorovana land is required for the port area. The Rorovana people number some 450 and they have total land of approximately 1,600 acres. The loss of this 175 acres will not seriously affect their economic livelihood. They have been offered a good price and alternative productive land. There has never been any real indication that they would sell at any price. On the other hand, not all the native people are opposed. At the village of Lonsiro only a few miles from Rorovana, one native landholding family concluded arrangements with the Administration under which they were paid $5,600 for a 42-year lease of 49 acres of land. </para>
          <para>The Administration&#39;s position in relation to negotiations for land for such public purposes as ports, town sites, airfields and so on has to take account of the need for these public facilities throughout the Territory. The proposed port for which the Rorovana land is required will be for public and not just for company use. The legal authority for compulsory acquisition or lease of land exists in the Territory as in other countries to avoid the need for excessive payments out of the public purse, that is, to serve the interests of the public as a whole. </para>
          <para>Compulsory acquisition is an essential power in all communities. It is used in Australia more freely than in the Territory. Individuals or small groups are not allowed to hold the whole community up. In the Territory as here the amount of compensation is in the last resort subject to law. </para>
          <para>The Agreement between the Administration and CRA which the Commonwealth Government is backing is modern in its approach and enlightened in its ideas. There will be adequate return to the Territory Government in terms of taxes, royalties and dividends from the profits of the operation. There are those who would accept the merits of the Bougainville Copper Agreement but who would criticise the way in which the Government or the Administration had handled the matter. This is easily done. Nevertheless it ignores the tremendous difficulties of communication and of comprehension which have confronted the Administration in this matter. I have explained the painstaking nature of the Administration communication activity. There has been no effort spared. The basic difficulty has been that people of this area are living in one world and the problems of development and the requirements of development confront them with another world. </para>
          <para>In the absence of skill and patience and moderation on the part of the Administration, especially its field officers, we could easily have had a much worse situation than that which confronts us. As it is we cannot expect easy solutions. We must understand that what happened at Rorovana and what may happen elsewhere reflect the problems of transition into a modern world and a modern society. These cannot be sidestepped by an Administration that must act in the interests of the Territory as a whole. The Government, however, is grateful to the officers of the Administration for the extent to which their efforts have so far contained the problem. </para>
          <para>The Government makes no apology for the Agreement. It considers that the Agreement is a spectacular contribution to harnessing the interests of private capital and the skills of the large corporation to the development requirements of the Territory. Not many developing countries are fortunate enough to have the prospect of so large and so remunerative a development within their boundaries. In this, confidence plays a major part. The investment of $300m demands confidence. In this case the investors are showing their confidence not only in the Commonwealth Government but in the people of the Territory themselves because the mining project looks ahead to the time when the people will be running their own affairs. In this respect the projected investment is an act of imagination and confidence. There are many who seek to knock it but it has the backing of the Territory people through their House of Assembly. It will survive. </para>
          <para>The Government considers the Administration&#39;s actions are fully in accordance with the law. Action has been taken in Papua and New Guinea to test the law. The Government will welcome an authoritative and definitive judicial interpretation of the legal position. </para>
          <para>Since 1964, the Government has made available to the Territory by way of grant in aid sums totalling $400m. The Government and the House of Assembly have last year jointly backed a 5-year $ 1,000m development programme for the Territory. The Bougainville project offers a unique opportunity for the Territory to make a dramatic advance towards these objectives of development. The attitude of a handful of people may attract our sympathy, and we may go to considerable lengths to resolve their problems. But in the last resort we cannot allow them to block this great prospect and . thus throw into doubt the policies on which the futures of more than 2 million people depend. </para>
          <para>In the structure of ignorance, superstition and prejudice, persuasion and explanations are not easy but with other expatriate influences working in the opposite direction - some not without prestige in native eyes - difficulties become great. The present choice before the people of this Territory is whether to drift in a primitive and backward situation in close dependency on the generosity of the Australian taxpayer to provide a modicum towards health, education and the preservation of law and order and burdened by their ancient customs or whether to advance as a modern state financed substantially by its own resources. </para>
          <para>These resources lie dormant and will continue that way under traditional attitudes. Developed they will provide the revenues for the hospitals, the schools, the better standard of life and most important a nation not only able to stand on its own feet economically but able to opt for a meaningful independence should this be desired. This progressive transition has been the way chosen by the people of the Territory; its achievement needs sympathy and understanding from us in Australia as well as our continuing support. </para>

            <para>- by leave- The honourable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr O&#39;Connor),</inline> at the end of a very long and creditable career in this Parliament, has moved that this report be printed. The honourable member was elected to this Parliament in 1946, and in 1950 he took his place as a member of the Public Works Committee. He has served as a member of this Committee in eight Parliaments. Since 1962 he has served as Vice-Chairman in three Parliaments. This is the last act that he will perform as a member of the Committee. In a place such as this one becomes accustomed to buckets that fly; we have had a little bit of this in the short time that we have been sitting today. I place on record the appreciation of the members not only of the present Standing Committee on Public Works but all committees with which the honourable member for Dalley has been associated, of the work which he has done. It is rather refreshing to work on statutory committees where politics arc forgotten and people act in what they believe to be the best interests of a particular project or of the nation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Dalley has been Vice-Chairman of this Committee for a period longer than that for which I have been a member of the Committee. In the short period in which I have been associated with the honourable member, I have never known him to adopt a party political attitude. He has always acted in the interests of the subject under discussion. He has attended 730 meetings of the Committee at which 135 references were looked at and reported upon to this House. I hope that when the constituents he has represented for so long and so ably reflect on what he has done as a member of this Parliament they will realise that he has devoted a tremendous amount of time to looking at all sorts of projects throughout Australia and that at all times he was a creditable member of the Committee. He is held in very high esteem not only by myself but also by other Liberal Party and Country Party members on the present Committee and on earlier committees with which he was associated. </para>

This is the last day upon which our colleague will appear in the Parliament because be is to join, for the second time, the Australian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. The honourable member has had the rare experience for a parliamentarian of having his seat abolished twice in distributions - the seat of Martin in the distribution of 1954, and the present seat of Dalley in the distribution which the Parliament approved last year. Nine times the people have returned him to this place by enviably substantial majorities. He now succumbs not to the verdict of the people but to the recommendations of the distribution commissioners. He has been a member of this Parliament since 1946. He has been a member of the Public Works Committee since 19S0. The honourable member has held the office of returning officer for the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party for many years. He has given unstinting service and has earned unvarying praise in all his capacities. He has shown outstanding courage completely to surmount a disability. He has rendered excellent service to the people of his electorate which comprises an exceptionally large percentage of retired persons and migrants. These are the people who need the advice and the services of a member of Parliament In every sense he is loved by the people he represents. He has been a good citizen, a good committee member, a good parliamentarian and a fine colleague. We will miss him. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The urgent need, in view of the deterioration in relations between the Australian Administration and the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea arising out of the methods used to resume land on Bougainville Island and to enforce that resumption, to appoint a Joint Select Committee of the Australian Parliament to inquire into and report upon the most appropriate system of tenure, registration, leasing and resumption of land in the Territory. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Opposition is compelled to take this action in an earnest endeavour to save the reputation of Australia in the eyes of the world, but more particularly, in the hearts and minds of the <inline font-style="italic">2t</inline> million indigenous people of the Territory of. Papua and New Guinea. The happenings on Bougainville Island in the past few weeks are the cause of our concern. Never did we think that any Australian government or Australian administration would allow its judgment, its tolerance, its responsibility, its understanding, its patience and its reputation to be so easily shattered by acts that could have the effect of turning against us the people over whom we have been appointed trustees. </para>
          <para>A continuation of the course being followed on Bougainville Island will smash all the good work Australia has done in the Territory since the end of the Second World War. The Opposition believes that Australia enjoyed the understanding and friendship of the people of the Territory and that our relations in the future would have continued on a harmonious plane with the eventual self-government and independence of Papua and New Guinea. But the actions on Bougainville Island, with the compulsory acquisition of land from primitive people and the enforcement by force of that resumption has done Australia great harm. It may be many years before the total cost is known. It could easily be that Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd, the company the Administration set out to please, will be the first to feel the effects of our loss of prestige and trust. The blame for the whole deplorable incident must be firstly the responsibility of the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes),</inline> secondly, Cabinet and, thirdly, every member of the Government parties. Not one of them escapes - it was the inherent Liberal and Country Party philosophy to place private profits before people which allowed the situation to develop. </para>
          <para>Very few Australians would disagree with the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> P. J. Newman, M.H.A., the Acting Assistant Administrator (Economic Affairs) who, speaking in the House of Assembly at Port Moresby on 16th June 1969, described the Boungainville project as: &#39;an event of unprecedented economic and social significance in the history of the Territory&#39;. But as few would agree with his further statement that The Administration intends to fulfil its obligations under its agreement with the company and take all steps necessary to bring this great national asset into production&#39; if &#39;all steps necessary&#39; means the trampling on years of land traditions of the native people and the use of force to fulfil obligations which are not understood by the same people - obligations which were entered into by the Administration, after little, if any, consultation with the native land owners. </para>
          <para>On page 17 of the speech which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> delivered in the House of Assembly on 16th June to give members the background to the project not one word is said of any negotiations with the land owners. On page 3 of his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>After much discussion between the Company, the Administration and the Department of External Territories, an Agreement was signed on 6th June 1967 between the Company and the Administration. The Agreement sets out the various things that the Company and the Administration would guarantee to each other. </para>

          <para class="block">A few minutes ago the Minister for External Territories delivered a thirteen-page statement in the House. His speech lasted for about 22 minutes. He also gave to the members of this House some of the background to the negotiations on the Bougainvill copper project and also some of the details of the happenings earlier this month.

In his speech which lasted almost 25 minutes and which finished at about 2 minutes past 5, the Minister said: &#39;Since mid-1966 over forty Administration patrols have been made in the area affected by the mining project.&#39; In 1964 Conzinc Riotinto was in the area.

              <para>- I apologise for my transgression. The only reference which I can find in any official documents that I have read to consultations between the Administration and the people is in the 1968 report of the United Nations Visiting Mission to the Territory. I correct that statement because I now have to add: Until the Minister presented his statement about half an hour ago.&#39; The Mission visited the Bougainville area in March 1968 - 9 months after the signing of the agreement - and the report of the Mission states, in paragraph 239 on page 29: </para>

            <para>While the prospect of such a large enterprise of great potential economic benefit is welcomed throughout the Territory and on the island of Bougainville itself, considerable criticism and difficulties have been encountered in the immediate area and particularly among the local inhabitants in the mountains of Panguna whose land is directly affected. Lack of understanding of the nature of the agreement and of the law concerning ownership of sub-soil resources, combined with insufficient initial public relations, has resulted in hostility and resentment among the landowners which is only recently and slowly being dissipated. Both the Administration and the company are engaging in a continuous educational and public relations campaign among the people involved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That resembles a reference made by the Minister this afternoon to radio stations, news sheets and so forth. The paragraph in the report concludes: </para>

          <para class="block">This is a further indication that no real attempt was made to educate these people on the benefits that might be brought to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea by the development of copper resources in the area. Nobody suggests that the Administration under its mining ordinance, land ordinance or water resources ordinance did not have authority to sign the agreement and to resume any land which Boungainville Copper Pty Ltd desired for its purposes to carry out the project to a successful conclusion. The Opposition, however, suggests that the whole project has been handled in a hamfisted manner. This is the first of many large scale operations which are likely to create similar problems of land tenure, registration, leasing and resumption of land in the Territory. All of the future problems must be handled much more efficiently and with greater understanding than the present project. In these days of travel to the moon and of transistor radio, Australia must understand that the people of Papua and New Guinea know of, but perhaps do not understand, what is going on in the world around them. They certainly appear not to understand what is going on in the Bougainville area at the present time. </para>
          <para>They are simple people with simple values. The land which they and their forbears have tilled for hundreds of years is the only real thing of value in their lives. We cannot take it without explaining why it is required and the general advantages it will bring to the people of Papua and New Guinea as well as to their &#39;wan toks&#39;. The approach which the Administration took on this issue - and I dare say on similar issues since the end of World War II - is based on the old attitude which is described in pidgin English as &#39;Masta i tok, tok i dai&#39;, a rough translation of which means: &#39;The master has spoken. The talks are finished.&#39; The rub in this case is that no talks took place before mid-1966, and the agreement was signed in June 1967. The Administration is now in the untenable position of having to abide by an agreement which does not meet with the approval of people who know, from years of experience, that land is a valuable asset and is worth fighting for. The people of Australia and the people of Papua and New Guinea, therefore, judge the Australian Government and the Administration of the Territory guilty of an offence which offends hundreds of years of culture and tradition. 1 submit that every member of the Government has a case to answer - a case which has caused a great deal of embarrassment to all Australians. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> said that the present position in Bougainville has arisen because the Government places profits before the welfare of the people of New Guinea. That is a statement which I will shortly prove to be completely false. The honourable member for Lang lays the blame for the present position on the Minister for External1 Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes),</inline> the Cabinet and every member of the Government Parties. I believe that the blame for what has happened at Bougainville can be laid at the door of those Europeans who have a vested interest in stirring up trouble and unrest. The speech which has been made by the honourable member for Lang has done nothing to help the position in Bougainville. I want to make it clear at the outset that whatever I have to say will be said as a result of first hand knowledge of what is going on in Bougainville. It is less than 3 weeks since I returned from a visit there. I do not believe that the honourable member for Lang, who just spoke, has been there - certainly not in recent times. With members of the Government Parties Mining Committee I visited Panguna, Kieta and Rorovana and talked to Administration officials, to officers of the mining company and to Paul Lapun, the local member for Bougainville. We talked to villagers of Rorovana at a public meeting which was chaired by Paul Lapun. We talked to the head of the largest mission in that area and also to a man named McKillop, whose property at Arawa probably will be taken over. We talked, too, to another gentleman whose reputation would be known to the honourable member for Lang - a man named Middlemiss. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that members of the Committee received a balanced picture of what is actually going on. But one would gather from the publicity which has been given to this subject that everything associated with the venture is of a minus nature. There are plenty of pluses. Quite a number of people in Australia feel very strongly about this whole episode, but I believe that in many cases their opinions are based on misleading and incomplete information. They cannot be blamed for forming the opinions that they have, because they can form their opinions only on what they are told. AH&#39; that the public has been told by the Press is that Bougainvillians are losing their land by compulsory acquisition. This is just a bald statement; it is only part of the story and a very misleading part at that. I believe that many critics would change their views if they knew the facts. </para>
          <para>It is time that someone gave the facts, and I want to do so. The facts are these: First, freehold land has not been taken at all. The land that has been taken is on a leasehold basis. The people whose land has been resumed will be provided with an equivalent area of land if they wish it. They will be paid an annual occupation fee of <inline font-style="italic">5%</inline> of the unimproved value of the land or $2 an acre, whichever is the greater. They will be paid a minimum of $2 for every tree on their land, whether it be a coconut tree or a cocoa tree. They may be paid a greater amount but it will not be less than $2. They will be provided, on the new land given to them, with the same number of trees that they have at present, and the company will see that because a coconut tree takes 10 years to bear they will be provided with the equivalent amount of fruit that they would have taken from trees on their own land for 10 years. If they do not want to go and pick that fruit on another block provided for them, the company will deliver the fruit to them in bags. The company has undertaken - and I have the company&#39;s authority to say this - that when other land is provided for these people the company will erect for them on that land not grass huts, to which they have been accustomed, but European type houses. They will not be five-room brick houses but fibro houses with a water supply attached. </para>
          <para>At the mine site $50,000 already has been paid for the village site. The company has undertaken to rebuild the village on a new site which is satisfactory to the natives. It is actually the site on which the village existed 50 years ago. These people will be receiving $20,000 per annum in occupation fees and $80,000 per annum in royalties. </para>
          <para class="block">The people from that village will receive $100,000 annually from the company as long as copper is being mined there. The Administration in New Guinea has been offered the right to take up, on behalf of the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, 20% of the capital investment in the area. The company itself is being given tax freedom for 3 years after which it will be taxed on a rising scale until about 1980 when the taxation will be at the rate of 50% . </para>
          <para>Let us look at what the Territorians will receive. They will receive royalties with relation to the value of the copper which is being taken. They will get 20% of the profits. They will get 50% of the profits by way of taxation ultimately and they will get occupation fees. In addition to this the company is providing employment for quite a number of the natives. I understand that already more than 600 are employed by the company. We went into the assay room at Panguna where already very sophisticated equipment is being used for assaying the minerals that are being taken. This equipment is being operated by the native people. They are being checked each morning but the officer checking them said that there is no need for this because they are nearly always accurate. This is a useful skill that they are being taught. Development roads will be built and a new port will be provided as will be new schools and a hospital. A co-operative company is being set up with a 50% native ownership. In not many years, the total ownership will be given to the natives. </para>
          <para>The company already has spent more than $21m on exploration, and it will spend a total of $300m on capital works. It expects by the mid-1970s to be earning about $50m annually. This will be the largest amount that the Administration of New Guinea or the people of Papua and New Guinea will receive from any source other than from the taxpayers of Australia. Many people who live in Bougainville have been upset, but they have been stirred by people with vested interests in creating trouble. It is easy to stir up trouble. We have only to look at the trouble that has been created in some Australian universities and at what happened outside the United States Embassy with the burning of flags and the breaking of windows. If the right type of people are doing the stirring, it is easy to upset people. The people of Papua and New Guinea have been told to wait for independence when they will get the whole amount and not 20% , but actually they are not getting 20% but more than half of the profits, as I have indicated. </para>
          <para>The company is training these people to take over gradually the operations of the company so that when the time finally arrives they will be able to run everything efficiently for themselves. If they want to go on with it straight away, where would they get the $300m to do it? If they wait until independence comes - whenever that may be, and &#60;I am not putting a time on it - they will still need the ability to finance the project and they have no guarantee that the price of copper then will make it profitable - for such an amount to be spent. None of us knows whether there will be a demand for copper in a few years time. The honourable member for Lang has talked about these people being upset and our upsetting the people of Papua and New Guinea. In addition to visiting Bougainville we visited a place called Maprik, which is about 50 miles west of Wewak. Native gold miners came to talk to us. Their attitude was: &#39;Why cannot the company come up here and search in our area so that we can get some of the benefits that are going to Bougainville?&#39; These people have not been stirred up by trouble makers. </para>
          <para>If the Opposition really wants to help the people of the Territory it would do better to point out to the people the great advantages that will result to them from a successful operation by the company and the fact that they would be better prepared for independence, which this Government wants to be successful. The Liberal-Country Party Government wants to develop a strong New Guinea. We want a united people and a New Guinea strong enough financially to resist infiltration and aggression from quarters which have a vested interest in their making a failure of independence. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition&#39;s proposal is not in protest against the development of mineral resources on the island of Bougainville. It is a protest at the way in which certain aspects associated with that development have been handled by the Administration of the Territory which, of course, is backed up by the Department of External Territories and the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes).</inline> What we are protesting at is the naked viciousness of our materialism as we have seen it displayed in Kieta in recent times. The agreement at Kieta is being enforced by tear gas, batons and the use of a para-military force. The Minister for External Territories has suggested that this is emotionalism, but after all we all become emotional about something. Indeed, some people become emotionally concerned about the welfare of race horses. I would suggest that people such as those should not be too critical about those who become emotionally concerned with the welfare of human beings. </para>
          <para>Surely to God we should have learned a lesson from the Suez debacle. This Government - a new face on the same carcase - under Prime Minister Menzies was an enthusiastic supporter of armed intervention by the United Kingdom in Suez against the Arab States. What was the result of that armed intervention? It achieved no acquisition for the British Government, but an area of Arab countries which previously had been within the sphere of British influence is now within the sphere of Russian influence. Surely there is a lesson for the Government to learn from this in its handling of the situation in Bougainville. This is an area of long standing disaffection with the Administration. It has been a centre of the cargo cult, as a result of which on many occasions it has come into sharp conflict with the Administration. </para>
          <para>The people on the island of Bougainville are black skinned Bukas. They are very proud of the fact that they have black skin; that they are different from the copper skinned people on the main island of Papua and New Guinea. They see their affinity not with Papua and New Guinea as a nation conceived by the Government; they see their affinity with the Solomon islanders. There is already a strong breakaway movement at Bougainville to form a new nation with the British Solomon islanders. The very things for which the Government is responsible today and for which it tries to foist responsibility on to the House of Assembly at Port Moresby are calculated, not intentionally but through incompetence, to undermine and destroy the Government&#39;s announced objective of national unity in Papua and New Guinea. </para>
          <para>The Minister for External Territories has made the claim on a number of occasions that the House of Assembly at Port Moresby is responsible for the agreement which is being enforced at the present time. This is altogether too facile an explanation of what has transpired. In the first place, the Minister uses the House of Assembly at Port Moresby as a mask to cover his own ineptitude, that of his Government and that of certain people who work, in University Avenue in this city. </para>
          <para>Let us look at some of the facts about the House of Assembly at. Port Moresby. It is quite remote geographically from the people of Bougainville. There are eight. three members in the House of Assembly. Only three of them come from Bougainville. So given the standard of understanding of nationhood existing in Papua and New Guinea at the present time - it is practically non-existent - it is quite wrong for the Minister to suggest that this has been a responsible decision by the House of Assembly after careful consideration of all the facts involved. Does the Minister suggest that the use of tear gas and batons at Rorovana, and no doubt to be repeated at Arawa if necessary, has resulted from a decision of the House of Assembly at Port Moresby? Of course it has not. It has been a decision of the Administration, and no doubt the instructions have come from Canberra. </para>
          <para>If one looks at the agreement and the &#34;Act related to this matter one finds that the Administration has tremendous powers to vary the conditions of any lease. This is vitally important in the discussion in which we are now engaged. In fact, it is the Administration itself making the decisions about the variation of leases for the absorption of certain lands. The Minister euphemistically calls them resumptions, but he would call them seizures if he were more accurate. The facts are that in the discussions in the House of Assembly at Port Moresby there was quite clearly confusion in members&#39; minds as to the implications of the legislation which they had before them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grove,</inline> Director of Lands, Surveys and Mines, at page 2,408 of the House of Assembly debates on 8th June 1967 admitted that the agreement was a long and complicated document. Paul Lapun, one  of  the members representing the island  of  Bougainville in the House  of  Assembly, <inline font-style="italic">saW</inline> at page 2,556 of the House of Assembly debates on 30th August 1967 that he had discovered that not only native members of the House of Assembly but expatriate members too had experienced extreme difficulty in understanding the agreement. It is little wonder. It is an involved and lengthy legal document. To have some of the sections interpreted in the articles of the agreement I had to seek the advice of some of the legal practitioners who are members of this House. So how can one reasonably expect members of the House of Assembly and more especially the native members who have had, I expect, no experience in legal matters, to interpret this involved, long and difficult document? </para>
          <para>I said that there was confusion. There was also misunderstanding on the part of native members of the House of Assembly. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lapun,</inline> at page 2556 of the House of Assembly debates on the same date that I mentioned earlier, said that he was happy to accept the agreement because he believed that the undertakings which it covered were restricted to Panguna. He did not conceive that there would be any extension of activities to Arawa, Rorovana or any other places in the Kieta district, as is generally being anticipated at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grove,</inline> the Director of Lands, Surveys and Mines, on 8th June 1967 made a statement which clearly implied that the agreement would be restricted to Panguna. Let us not have any strict technical interpretations along the lines of semantics of what he said, because clearly the gist of what he said implied that the agreement would be restricted to development at Panguna. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is almost certain that, if the mining operation commences at Panguna, a modern town with new houses, water and electric power will start to grow. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He then went on to indicate the sorts of benefits which would obtain as a result of this development. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lapun</inline> made his statement in the House of Assembly some 2 months after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grove</inline> made that statement. I can find no evidence anywhere in the House of Assembly debates that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lapun&#39;s</inline> misconception of how this agreement was to be applied was corrected by responsible officials in the House of Assembly. Then we have the insensitiveness of the Minister for External Territories who, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paul</inline> Lapun in the debates on 23rd November 1966 on the </para>
          <para class="block">Mining (New Guinea) Bill (No. 2) 1966, after outlining a long list of causes for discontent and disaffection among the people at Bougainville as the result of this mining project, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A third thing, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, which</inline> makes my people antigovernment. When the Minister for Territories, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnes,</inline> visited us, he was asked if part of the royalties could be given to the Bougainville District Development Fund and if another portion could go to the owners of the land and, thirdly, if what remained could go to the Government. The Minister told the people that they had to observe Australian law, which is that royalties for minerals go to the Government and not to the owners of the land. The Government uses this money to develop the entire country. When they heard that all of the royalties would go to Port Moresby and none of them remain in Bougainville, the people asked themselves how then could Kieta become a large township. This finally made them of the opinion that they could believe nobody at all. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The implications of this are clear. There is confusion and misunderstanding and, even worse, there is lack of trust on the part of the native people towards the Administration. This is the sort of record for which the Government is responsible. </para>
          <para>The Minister is trying to claim that the House of Assembly freely, and with full information available, made a decision on this agreement. Clearly these few snippets - they are all I can quote in my restricted time - indicate that there was confusion, especially in the minds of the native members of the House of Assembly. Therefore, the decision they arrived at certainly cannot be regarded as a reliable one. In this sort of situation we ought to bend the normal parliamentary procedures, because this is not a fully developed country. It is an under-developed country and they are still at an experimental stage with their parliamentary procedures. This matter should be returned to the House of Assembly so that the people can discuss it and hammer these issues out. In any event, we ought to set up the Australian parliamentary committee which we have proposed with the objective of retrieving a situation which is worsening and which could become irretrievable unless something positive is soon done. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- We have heard a speech from the honourable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fox)</inline> in which he set out the physical facts of the situation at Bougainville in such a way that no Australian studying them could help but come to the conclusion that something has happened in Bougainville, and therefore in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, which is providential for the future of the people with whom we are concerned. The overall picture in the past years has been one of deep rooted concern that a nation which was moving towards independence might one day be hamstrung in that independence because it would not have within it the economic potential for self reliance and its own viability. This situation has been changed dramatically and rapidly in the past few years because an enormous deposit of very low grade copper and a smattering of gold which has been examined over the years by modern methods and which, because of the tremendous scale of development can now be considered to be commercial, can bring these people to a position in world society which they might not otherwise have achieved for a very long time to come. This is the positive side of the picture. At the same time it must be realised that in the island of Bougainville there is a race of very primitive and most unsophisticated people. Most of these people have never seen a road of any size, let alone a town of any size. They have absolutely no concept of what is meant by a major mining venture such as is to come to their country. Description or explanation to these people is almost impossible without illustration. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Contrary to what has been said by the honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> I believe that since the first glimmerings of viability emerged, not in I960 or 1964 as the honourable member sought to suggest, but when the company first became aware of the fact that this venture could be commercial - for a long time this did not appear likely - there have been unceasing efforts to explain to the people what is involved in the setting up of a city which will be the capital city of Bougainville^ - the capital of that part of the world; bigger than Lae or Rabaul. The establishment of this city will be a major contribution to the entire development of the Territory. Now a situation has emerged which has brought about a state of confusion and fuss and bother in the area. One wonders why this has come about. 1 believe that the answer is most simply given by a Christian gentleman, I would have the honourable member for Lang understand; by a member of his own faith, </para>
          <para>He is a missionary who has lived there virtually all his life. He told me that the people have been stirred up in about ten villages by one European, who is manager of a local plantation. He told me that before that happened things were very quiet. As far as he was able to ascertain the people had accepted the fact that the town would be there. He was not referring to the mine at Panguna, which the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> claims is the only development which the natives expected. The missionary told me that the people accepted the fact that the town was to be there, in the Rorovana area in Kieta. lt was only when this matter was stirred up that the people began to turn. </para>
          <para>Those are the words of the missionary; they are not the words of my committee, which took evidence from a large cross section of people. It is my belief that a deliberate attempt has been made to create trouble and to exploit problems, firstly, by vested interests in the Arawa - the white man&#39;s plantation. This is a magnificent piece of territory. It has been efficiently run. Tn anybody&#39;s eyes it is a shame to see these lovely trees destroyed, but this is to make way for something so valuable to 2&#163; million people. Contrary to what the honourable member for Lang has said, the hearts and minds of 2&#163; million people in Papua and New Guinea have not been estranged by what is going on. As the honourable member for Henty pointed out, we were besieged by inquiries as to how soon similar things might take place in other parts of the Territory because the advantages of what was happening were obvious to people with a little more sophistication. It is laughable for the honourable member for Lang to suggest that this land has been resumed by force. What has been done by force, if you like, has been that a few policemen have acted against one or two people who were deliberately stirred up on the admission of this person who went about ceaselessly from village to village encouraging the people, as we were told in evidence, by offering to supply them with arms and to fight alongside them if they would stand out against the Administration. This is the kind of stirring that has been going on. </para>
          <para>But there has been more, because into this area - on two occasions the &#39;Four Corners&#39; team has gone, with one objective - to highlight divisions and differences between races. Here and now 1 accuse the Four Corners&#39; team of deliberate and calculated distortion. I accuse it of the attempted creation of racial clashes. We were given evidence of those whom the team approached with a view to creating demonstrations which it could photograph to show to the Australian people. We were told of the suppression of facts given to the Four Corners&#39; team by the news sources of the Territory. We were told by reporters that they had offered facts to the team which would have presented a very different picture from the one presented to the Australian public on its television screens. These facts were rejected out of hand by the Four Corners&#39;, team. Other facts relating to the harmony and co-operation that existed between the Administration and the native people were given to the &#39;Four Corners&#39; team but were rejected as not being within the charter which the team was in the Territory to pursue. I believe that the &#39;Four Corners&#39; team went to the Territory to produce a series of programmes designed to destroy good relations between white and black people and especially to undermine the Administration. It is one thing for the Government and particularly the Postmaster-General to defend the Australian Broadcasting Commission against political pressure. It is quite another thing to defend it when it seeks to stir up hatred and violence that could endanger the lives of devoted Australian public servants who would serve a government of the opposite persuasion to the present Government just as faithfully as they serve this Government. I believe that this has been done. </para>
          <para>When people have been stirred in this way at the point of their deepest emotions - their land - how do you get them to accept facts of the kind presented by the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes)</inline> and the honourable member for Henty? I believe that there is need for a firm decision to be made. What is the alternative? Should we allow a minority to set back the tremendous opportunity presented to millions of people in the Territory? The analogy that comes to mind is that of parents with a child who has a club foot. That child has been frightened by tales of what happens in hospital and so cries that it does not want an operation to restore it to full health and enable it to become a responsible and capable person in its adult years. I believe that a similar situation has emerged in the Territory. Many times I have discussed with my colleagues the invidious position in which Australia is placed. On the one hand we ask why we should get the kicks for something which for the most part will benefit the islanders or the company concerned. But this is not all: Should we leave these people to be exploited by those who, for their own objectives, political or financial, want to stir them up? </para>
          <para>What of Australia&#39;s financial outlay in the Territory? Are we prepared to deny Australians schools, pensions and development of all kinds while we exploit our own ore resources in this country and not ask the Territory to share the burden? What alternatives does the Opposition propose? The honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> went briefly into the area. He proposes that the company delay its operations until the Territory has produced its own trained engineers and geologists. This would take 10 or 20 years, during which time, of course, Australian taxpayers would bear the burden. This is not the answer. Nor is the appointment of a select committee from this House the answer. A select committee there may well be. and should be, but I believe that it should be a committee appointed by the indigenous members of the House of Assembly. If they do not consider that it is necessary to have an inquiry, what kind of colonialist arrogance lies behind the suggestion that in this House we should override the decision of the House of Assembly and move into the Territory with our own inquiry into something which the House of Assembly itself has supported and which I believe still supports to a man? I think that the Opposition&#39;s suggestion is arrogant in the extreme. </para>

        <para>For both output and employment, 1968-69 was an exceptionally good year. Gross national product increased by 12% to $27,1 14m at current prices. Measured at constant prices the growth rate in real terms was more than 8.5%: approximately 2% being the result of the big increase in rural output following the drought of 1967-68. With allowance for this, a real growth rate of about 6.5% for the rest of the economy was a notable performance. </para>
        <para>Net immigration was at the highest level since the 1950&#39;s and added about 60,000 migrant workers to the workforce. Employment rose by about 150,000. Outside the rural sector, productivity seems to have risen by about 3.5%: the gains were widespread through industry and were particularly rapid in mining. </para>

          <title>Demand</title>
          <page.no>31</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Last year&#39;s increase in output was matched by rising demand, except in the over-supplied world wheat market In the earlier months of 1968-69, consumer spending increased rather slowly. It gained strength as the year went on and, for the year as a whole, increased by 6.7% to a total of Sl5,677m. </para>
        <para>Private capital expenditure accelerated in 1968-69 to reach boom levels. Expenditure on dwellings totalled $ 1,256m, an increase of 16% over the previous year. Expenditure on other buildings and construction rose by 15% to reach $1,0 15m. After rising by only 3% in 1967-68, expenditure on plant and equipment last year increased by 10% to $2,375m. Private investment can therefore be clearly identified as the driving force behind the expansion of the economy that became apparent in the latter half of 1968-69. </para>
        <para>Total spending by Governments and their instrumentalities also increased - by 9% to $5,948m. This was slower than the rate of increase in gross national product at current prices - 12% - and slower also than the 12% increase in public spending in 1967-68. Outlay in Australia from the Commonwealth Budget was $5,959m, which is 7.6% greater than in 1967-68 when it rose by 8.5%. </para>
        <para>By contrast, these figures emphasise the dominant part increased private investment played in lifting gross national expenditure which last year rose by 11% to $27,461m. </para>
        <para>The effects of the strong rise in demand began to show up in the labour market half-way through last financial year. At the end of December 1968 the seasonally adjusted figure for persons registered for employment was 67,439 a-nd for unfilled vacancies 36,866 - a difference of 30,573. By the end of June the corresponding figures were 55,308 and 44,411 respectively, so that the gap between the number registered for employment and unfilled vacancies was reduced to 10,897. This tightening occurred despite the big migrant inflow and the continuing addition of large numbers of married women to the employed workforce. There is no sign yet that pressure in the labour market is being reduced. On the contrary, the information available to us indicates a continued tightening. </para>

          <page.no>32</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>An unwelcome feature of the rising pressure on resources has been the over-rapid increase in costs. In the March quarter of 1969 average weekly earnings were 8.6% above the level of the year before and for 1968-69 as a whole the increase was about 7.25%. In the earlier months, the concentration of major award increases strongly contributed to the rise in wage costs. More recently, over-award payments and other elements of wage drift have had a significant effect. As a consequence of these higher costs, the consumer price index increased by 2.9% during 1968-69. The nonfood groups in the index increased by about 3.75% - a much faster rate than in 1967-68. This emphasises the effects of increasing costs on the non-food elements in the index. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Last year more than $200m was added to our holdings of gold and foreign exchange. On official account, external payments exceeded external receipts by more than $400m. On private account, the opposite occurred. An excess of external receipts over external payments of more than $600m added considerably to monetary liquidity in Australia. The big increase in Rural Credits advances by the Reserve Bank, mainly to finance the record wheat harvest, also added to the money supply. On the other side of the ledger, the domestic surplus of receipts over outlay in the Commonwealth Budget reduced monetary liquidity. Despite this, the money supply in the form of trading and savings bank deposits and notes and coin in the hands of the public increased by $1,1 69m or 9.1%. The increase in the previous year was 8.3%. </para>
        <para>There can be no doubt that the free availability of money has been contributing greatly to the growing strength of demand. </para>

        <title>THE YEAR AHEAD</title>
        <page.no>32</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>At this stage indications are that 1969-70 will be another year of strong economic growth. Except in parts of Queensland and Western Australia, seasonal conditions are promising and rural output should again increase. We could not, however, expect to repeat last year&#39;s gain in rural production which followed the recovery from the drought of 1967-68. The output from other sectors of the economy also should rise well even though, with unemployment at a low level and mainly of the short term kind, the labour market is now much tighter than it was a year back. Practically all additions to the workforce will have to come from the ranks of school-leavers, married women entering the workforce and newly-arrived migrant workers. The numbers added from these sources will probably be much the same as last year so that, with not much change in the present low level of unemployment, it seems unlikely that this year&#39;s increase in the numbers employed will be as great as last year&#39;s. Nevertheless, given productivity increases comparable with those of last year, non-farm output should expand at a rate not far short of that achieved in 1968-69. An increase of at least 6% in gross national product at constant prices seems a reasonable forecast to make. If other countries can get 4% increase in gross national product they feel that they are doing pretty well. </para>
      <para>With the expectation that there will be another good year for output we have to ask how the trends in demand are likely to develop. The rate at which incomes are rising leaves no doubt that consumption expenditure will continue to gain strength. Consumption normally accounts for about 60% of gross national expenditure so that even a small acceleration in its rate of growth can add substantially to the demands on domestic output and imported supplies. </para>
      <para>Spending by Governments and their instrumentalities for both current and capital purposes accounts for slightly more than 20% of gross national expenditure. Last year this expenditure increased by 9%. This year it seems likely to rise at much the same rate. </para>
      <para>The other main branch of expenditure is private investment. Another year of large scale private capital outlay seems certain. A number of big mining and other projects are at present in progress or will soon begin and give rise to a large amount of private capital expenditure. </para>
      <para>How strongly this expenditure will be supported by capital inflow is one of the uncertainties we have to allow for. Present conditions in capital markets abroad suggest that it would be prudent to allow for a reduction in capital inflow this year. If that occurred, it could have a direct effect on capital expenditure and would tend to modify the influences adding to monetary liquidity. </para>
      <para>At present, however, capital expenditure is imposing a considerable strain on the economy. At least in some States, the demands now being made on the building industry in particular must be pressing closely against the limit of resources. Shortages of building materials have shown up, costs have been rising at an increasing rate and construction times have lengthened. Any aggravation of these conditions must be harmful both for homebuilders and the industry. </para>

          <title>Balance of Payments</title>
          <page.no>33</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>It has to be recognised that any tendency for demand to outrun supply in the home market will have adverse effects on the balance of payments. In looking ahead, then, we must take account of the implications of excessive pressure developing in some sectors of the economy. I shall say more on this question later. </para>
        <para>The prospects for exports seem reasonably good except in the overseas wheat market. Rural exports should increase in volume and, provided prices hold, should once more add to our export earnings. Another big rise in export of minerals is certain and it is reasonable to expect exports of manufactures to improve. </para>
        <para>A rise in domestic demand is bound to attract additional imports. There could well be a trade surplus but the deficit on invisible payments will increase. Whether the net inflow of capital will balance the deficit on current account is difficult to assess. Excluding defence credits, official capital transactions abroad involve debt repayments amounting to some $200m and conditions in the international capital markets are not at the moment particularly favourable to loan raisings. Summing up, we can reasonably hope that there will be an approximate balance in our external transactions. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that we may have to draw to some extent on our external reserves. These reserves are, fortunately, strong enough to enable us to cope with a temporary oversea payments deficit. </para>

        <title>THE BUDGET AND THE ECONOMY</title>
        <page.no>33</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>In determining the structure and consistency of this year&#39;s Budget, we have endeavoured to make it fit the prospective economic conditions, including likely movements in monetary liquidity. In last year&#39;s Budget, the deficit - or the amount borrowed to make up the difference between expenditure and all revenue receipts - was reduced, as compared with that of the year before, by $257m to a net amount of $385m. This year we are budgeting for a deficit of only $30m or $356m below last year&#39;s deficit. </para>
      <para>We estimate that total receipts will rise by $825m or 13.5% to S6,954m because of buoyant conditions and strong demand. Expenditure is estimated to rise by $469m or 7.2% to $6,983m. </para>
      <para>The direct demand the Budget expenditure will make on resources is measured by the estimate of net expenditure on goods and services. This excludes transfer payments, such as pensions or interest, and net advances, such as those made to the States. In this Budget, this expenditure is estimated to increase by only 1.2% to $l,949m, compared with an increase of 7.8% in 1968-69. The much slower rate of increase is accounted for largely by a substantial reduction in defence spending abroad. </para>
      <para>It has to be emphasised that it is expenditure in Australia that adds directly to demand on local resources. Net Budget expenditure in Australia on goods and services is estimated to increase by 7.3% to $ 1,646m - a significant reduction on last year&#39;s 10% increase. </para>
      <para>We expect total outlay in Australia, including welfare and other transfer payments and advances, to increase by 9.6% to $6,533m compared with last year&#39;s rise of 7.6%. In the main, this is accounted for by increased welfare payments and the additional funds going to the States. </para>
      <para>We estimate that total receipts in Australia will exceed outlays in Australia by about $500m in 1969-70. This domestic surplus would be about $300m greater than that achieved in 1968-69. Since it represents a net withdrawal of a comparable amount from the private sector&#39;s monetary holdings in Australia, the domestic surplus should have a considerable effect in modifying the expansion of domestic monetary liquidity. This effect would be strengthened to the extent that net sales of Commonwealth securities were made to the nonbank public in Australia. Less buoyant liquidity conditions will, of course, help to contain increases in spending from local borrowings or other capital raisings in the Australian market. </para>

        <para>The Defence vote will fall this year to an estimated $1,1 04m or about 5% less than last year&#39;s defence expenditure of $l,165m. </para>
        <para>Defence expenditure overseas is expected to be about $243m or $87m less than last year. </para>
        <para>The financial requirement is somewhat smaller mainly because parts of the major equipment programme have been completed and for some projects some of the expenditure is being spread into later years. </para>
        <para>It does not amount to a reduction in our defence effort </para>
        <para>As my colleague, the Minister for Defence, has announced, the defence programmes of the future will not be limited to set 3-year periods but will always look 5 years ahead and be kept under constant review. In accordance with this concept, studies have been undertaken in the Defence Department and equipment and works proposals have been brought forward and approved for inclusion in this Budget. Studies are continuing on other projects and as these are approved they will be admitted to the programme. The projects so far approved include ship construction and various items of capital works and equipment. The ship construction programme will include a fast combat support ship, a hydrographic ship and an oceanographic ship for the Navy and heavy landing craft for the Army. It is also proposed to put in hand a preliminary design study for new light destroyers for the Navy as replacements for some of the R:A.N.&#39;s existing destroyers. There will be technical items of equipment ordered for all Services. The Army will be authorised to enter into forward commitments this year with the object of acquiring additional arms and armaments. This authorisation could involve expenditure of up to $60m next year but, as the orders placed will include long leadtime items, there will be a continuing commitment for expenditure in later years. A decision has also been taken to proceed with major airfield works at Learmonth, Western Australia; it is unlikely that there will be any expenditure on the project in 1969-70. Al) of these proposals, about which the Minister for Defence will give details in the course of the Budget debate, will add substantially to our defence capability. </para>
        <para>Further additions to the strength of the Forces are planned for the year ahead. It is expected that, by the end of this financial year, the strength of the Navy will have risen from&#39; 16,943 to 17,360, of the Army from 46,525 to 48,010 and of the Air Force from 22,712 to 23,660. These additional numbers are required to man new ships and aircraft coming into service, meet operational commitments overseas and provide supporting elements in Australia. The Citizen Military Force is expected to increase from 34,256 to 36,000. </para>
        <para>I turn now to one of the most important features of the Budget and that is social welfare. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The expenditures grouped under social, welfare constitute the largest single item in the Budget. They include expenditure on social services, repatriation, health and housing and are estimated to rise this year by $ 192m to total $ 1,659m. </para>
        <para>Over the past year, the Government has continued to give a great deal of attention to this area. In a wide and searching examination of the needs of the less fortunate members of the community, we have had the assistance of the Welfare Committee of Cabinet under the chairmanship of the Minister for Health. The proposals that I shall now outlinegive relief to the aged and our needier people and at the same time give positive incentives to thrift and self-reliance. </para>
        <para>Expenditure on social services is expected to increase by $134m to a record level of $999m, largely because of the new proposals which the Government will put before you. </para>
        <para>Expenditure on repatriation pensions and benefits is expected to rise by$8m to $293m. Health and housing benefits are expected to require$367m, an increase of $50m. </para>
        <para class="block">Age, Invalid, Widows* and Service Pensions The maximum weekly rate of pensions payable to single age and invalid pensioners and widows with children will be increased by $1 to $15 per week. For widows without children the new weekly maximum rate will be $13.25. The pension payable to a married pensioner couple will increase for each by 75 cents a week so that the maximum rate of their combined pensions will be $26.50. Persons in receipt of service pensions which are repatriation benefits - will receive similar increases as will tuberculosis sufferers in receipt of allowances. For the future, the latter will, in addition, be eligible for certain benefits and concessions available to social services pensioners. </para>
        <para>The Government has given particular attention to the needs of widows with children and proposes to introduce special measures to assist them. The allowance payable for each child, after the first, of a widow pensioner will be increased by $1 a week to bring the total payment, excluding child endowment, for each such child to $3.50 a week. This benefit will also be extended to children, other than the first, of age, invalid and service pensioners. As a further measure of assistance, the mother&#39;s and guardian&#39;s allowance is to be increased from the present rate of $4 per week to $6 per week in cases where there is a child under the age of 6 or an invalid child requiring full time care. As well, the deduction from income for means test purposes for a dependent child of a pensioner is to be increased by $1 a week to $4 a week. A widow pensioner with, say, three dependent children may thus earn $22 a week, hold property of a value up to $4,500 and still receive full pension and allowances. All these new benefits will be extended to age, invalid and service pensioners in appropriate cases. </para>
        <para>We have also decided to modify the residence qualifications for widows&#39; pensions so that certain women who are widowed overseas may be eligible for a widow&#39;s pension on return to Australia provided they have lived in Australia for a continuous period of 10 years. Because of the number of persons who have, in the past, migrated to Australia, and now wish to visit their home country, it is intended to permit pensioners making temporary visits overseas to receive payment of pension for up to 30 weeks absence on return to Australia. The present limit is 12 weeks. </para>
        <para>Persons who become pensioners because of the proposed increases in basic rates of pension will become members of the Pensioner Medical Service, giving them entitlement to free medical and hospital treatment and free pharmaceutical benefits. They will be entitled also to other subsidiary benefits provided by the Commonwealth, such as reduced radio and T.V. licence fees, telephone rentals, hearing aids and funeral benefits. Persons who become pensioners for the first time because of the introduction of the &#39;tapered&#39; means test - to which I shall now refer - will not, however, be eligible for membership of the Pensioner Medical Service or entitled to any other subsidiary fringe benefits. </para>

          <para class="block">Liberalisation of the Means Test </para>
          <para>I now come to the liberalisation of the means test. Liberalisation has been the continuing policy of the Government, and the proposal I now outline will represent the most significant move forward since the Government assumed office. </para>
          <para>Under present pension arrangements, where a pensioner has means in excess of the &#39;free&#39; level - $10 per week in the case of a single pensioner and $17 per week in the case of married pensioner couples - the pension payable is reduced by $1 for every $1 of means in excess of these limits. This provision does not provide any incentive to earn or provide for additional income. The Government proposes, therefore, to introduce a &#39;tapered&#39; means test under which additional means in excess of the &#39;free&#39; limits to which I have referred will, in future, reduce the age, invalid, widow&#39;s or service pension by only 30 cents for each additional dollar of means. As a direct consequence of this change, single pensioners with means in excess of $10 per week will all receive increased pensions and eligibility for some pension will not cut out until their means reaches $40 a week instead of $24 - the cut-off point at the existing pension rate. In the case of married couples, both being pensioners, eligibility for some pension will continue until their joint means reach a level of $70 per week. </para>
          <para>When I come to the revenue estimates I shall outline additional concessions we propose to give under the Income Tax Age Allowance to take account of the &#39;tapered&#39; means test. </para>
          <para>It is expected that approximately 250,000 persons will become eligible either for pension for the first time or for increased pensions under the proposed &#39;tapered&#39; means test. </para>

Previously, the value of land purchased or held by an aged persons&#39; homes organisation prior to 1957 has been excluded from the capital cost for the purposes of determining the amount granted by the Commonwealth towards the erection of a new home. </para>

        <para>The rates of benefit payable to unemployment and sickness beneficiaries will be raised. In the case of a married minor or adult the rate will be increased by $1.75 to $10 per week and the allowance for a dependent wife by $1 to $7 per week. Where there are children in the family of an unemployed or sickness beneficiary, the allowance for children under 16 will be raised by $1 to $2.50 a week in the case of a first child under 16 and by $2 to $3.50 a week for second and subsequent children. Appropriate increases will be made  in  the allowance payable to unmarried minors. Where they have no parent living  in  Australia they will receive the adult rate of benefit. At the same time the amount of income which may be received without affecting entitlement to the full rate of benefit is to be increased by $2 to$6 a week in the case of adults or married minors and from $2 to $3 per week in the case of unmarried minors. </para>
        <para>In order to relieve hardship  in  cases where there are frequent periods of unemployment or recurrent sickness, beneficiaries will in future need to serve only once in any period of 13 consecutive weeks the waiting period of 7 days before unemployment or sickness benefit can be paid. The Director-General of Social Services will also be authorised to exercise a discretion to waive recovery of all or part of sickness benefit in cases of hardship or special circumstances such as where inadequate compensation or damages are obtained. At present full recovery is mandatory. </para>
        <para>The total cost of all of the social service proposals I have announced is estimated to be $73m in 1969-70. In consequence, total expenditure on social services this year will be $999m. </para>

        <para>The Commonwealth is already assisting in the provision of housing for the aged, particularly through the Aged Persons Homes Scheme. Nevertheless, we recognise that the housing of some single age and service pensioners with little or no means apart from their pension is below acceptable standards and the rentals they are required to pay are excessive. The States are already providing self-contained dwelling units including units for single age pensioners at reasonable rentals. We believe that more should be done and therefore propose to offer to the States non-repayable grants of $25m over 5 years, beginning this year, so that building of this type of dwelling can be expedited. </para>

        <para>The pension payable to a totally and permanently incapacitated war pensioner will be increased by $2.50 per week to $36 per week. </para>
        <para>Last year we introduced a new form of assistance - a special compensation allowance payable to certain of the more seriously incapacitated general rate pensioners. We propose to increase this allowance by $2 per week so that a general rate pensioner who qualifies for the allowance will receive $17 per week where his incapacity is assessed at 100 per cent and $12.75 where the assessment is at 75 per cent. The rate pf pension payable to those able to work only part-time or intermittently because of a war-caused disability - the intermediate rate - will be increased by $2.25 to $26.*50 a week. </para>
        <para>War widows&#39; pension will be increased by $1 to $15 a week and, in addition, the domestic allowance payable to most war widows will be . increased by 50 cents a week. In total, then, a war widow receiving domestic allowance will receive an increase of $1.50 per week, bringing her total basic pension to $22.50 a week. </para>
        <para>Although they were increased last year, we propose to increase again the allowances payable to certain war pensioners in respect of attendants. The recreation transport allowance and the allowance to assist in meeting the running expenses of a specially equipped gift car will each be increased. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I come to what I regard as another important element in this Budget - in fact, a very important element. Increasingly in recent years the Commonwealth appropriation for education has grown. In a country dedicated to growth, the breadth and quality of education must be a critical element. As well, education and cultural development are objectives in their own right. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth has progressively increased the scale and broadened the scope of its financial support for education. Through specific purpose payments and general financial grants assistance is being provided at all levels and for all types of schools. Over $265m will be appropriated in the Budget for education this year, or 38% more than last year&#39;s expenditure. Within the total, payments to the States specifically for education will increase by 53% to $165m. </para>
        <para>Payments will include&#39; the full-year cost of the new programmes of capital grants for secondary school libraries and pre-school teachers colleges introduced last year. Provision is being made for the programme of development of Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education in prospect for the 1970-1972 triennium, as well for other new policy proposals, to which I shall refer shortly. </para>
        <para>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, will be making detailed statements about education including the recommendations of the Australian Universities Commission and the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Advanced Education for the 1970-1972 triennium. </para>
        <para>Broadly stated, the triennial programmes are based on the expectation that by 1972 total student enrolment, full and part-time, in Universities and Colleges of Advanced </para>
        <para class="block">Education will be more than 45,000 greater than in the current academic year. To meet this expected demand, these institutions will need better capital facilities and greater appropriations for recurrent costs. </para>
        <para>The recommended programmes for these institutions in the 1970-1972 triennium aggregate$910m - an increase of $263m on the programmes for the 1967-1969 triennium. The recommended programmes for Colleges of Advanced Education will account for $127m of this increase. Reflecting the growing national importance of applied science and the technologies, expenditures on these Colleges will be more than doubled in the coming triennium. </para>
        <para>Of the amount of $9 10m recommended for Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education during the next three calendar years the Commonwealth will provide approximately $420m, the remainder being provided by State Governments and by the fees and other income of the institutions themselves. </para>
        <para>During the triennium, grants to the States for Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education are expected to amount to $227m and $93m respectively. In 1969-70 the grants will be $96m, or $19m more than last year. Grants for science laboratories, technical training facilities, teacher and preschool teacher training colleges and secondary school libraries will, in the aggregate, increase by $21. 5m. </para>
        <para>For the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education, we will provide$30.2m in 1969- 70, of which $22.5m is for recurrent expenditure and $7. 7m is for capita&#93; expenditure. For the next triennium as a whole, the estimated provision will be about $100m. </para>
        <para>We share with the States the conviction that the training and education of teachers is critical to help us achieve our objectives. We have reviewed our policy relating to teacher training and have made two decisions. First, we will continue with unmatched capital grants for the construction of teachers&#39; colleges by the States after the present programme is completed in June 1970. These grants will increase to $30m in the three years to June 1973 as compared with $24m in the previous three years. Second, we will support expenditure both capital and recurrent on teacher education within Colleges of Advanced Education and, indeed, have given the first approvals for the 1970-1972 triennium. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I come now to an important new aspect of policy relating to education in independent schools. This is a significant development in the policy introduced about five years ago. From January 1970 the Commonwealth will contribute towards the running costs of independent schools throughout Australia. A subsidy at the rate of $35 per primary pupil and $50 per secondary pupil per annum will be paid to the schools. With the assistance State Governments will be providing, the Commonwealth subvention will both help the parents and enable the independent schools to improve their standards. </para>
        <para>The State Governments will be offered grants under Section 96 of the Constitution for transmission to independent schools in their respective States. The necessary legislation will be introduced later in these Sittings. In the case of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, payments will be made direct to the independent schools as an addition to the present per pupil subsidies. </para>
        <para>The estimated cost of this new measure is $l6.3m in 1969-70. Of this amount, $16m will be paid to the States. In the first full year, the comparable figures are $24. 5m and $24.1 m respectively. </para>

        <para>Turning to our rural industries, I now  outline proposals that will continue our aim to assist them with their more pressing problems. Later, I shall outline some taxation concessions that will also assist them. </para>
        <para>A subsidy of $6 a ton on standard superphosphate used in Australia was introduced in August 1963. Last year we decided to extend to October 1971 the operation of the authorising legislation and to increase the standard rate of subsidy to $8 a ton with effect from 14 August 1968. This year we have decided to increase the rate of subsidy still further. As from tomorrow the standard rate will be$1 2 per ton. At the new rate the subsidy is expected to cost $50m this year or $19m more than last year. </para>
        <para>In August 1966 we introduced a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers, for which the authorising legislation is due to expire in October 1969. We have now decided to continue the subsidy for a further three years at an estimated cost in 1969-70 of $ 15m or $4m more than last year. </para>

        <para>To afford further assistance to the wool growing industry, the Government has decided to offer the industry a more generous arrangement for the financing of wool research and promotion. For three years commencing 1 July 1970, the growers&#39; levy would be reduced from two to one per cent and the Government would meet the balance of the expenditure required for research and promotion, provided its contribution does not exceed an average of $27m per annum. In effect, the growers&#39; levy would be halved and the Government&#39;s contribution approximately doubled. The Government&#39;s offer will have to be negotiated with the Australian Wool Industry Conference together with any changes that might be required in the areas of responsibility for the administration of wool research and promotion by virtue of the increased financial commitment assumed by the Government </para>

          <page.no>39</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Since 1960-61 the Commonwealth has each year made payments to the wheat industry to enable returns to growers to be raised to the guaranteed price in respect of specified quantities of exported wheat. In 1968-69 the payment involved was $43m. This enabled the return to growers to be raised by more than 28 cents to $1.64 per bushel f.o.r. on 150m bushels of export wheat in respect of the 1967-68 season. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1968 pro vides a guaranteed price on exports of up to 200 million bushels in respect of each of the five wheat seasons 1968-69 to 1972-73. For the first of these seasons the guaranteed price is $1.45 per bushel f.o.b. and for subsequent seasons it will be adjusted in accordance with movements in cash costs. It is expected that a wheat stabilisation payment in respect of the 1968-69 crop will be made in 1970-71. No provision will be needed for a payment this year. </para>

        <para>Well over half the item Advances for Capital Purposes comprises the provision of new capital for the Post Office, mainly to assist in financing expansion and improvement of telephone services. The provision this year for the Post Office is $229m. This compares with a provision last year of $222m and actual advances of $204.5m. The latter figure was only $1m greater than in1967-68. The increase in this year&#39;s provision over actual advances in 1968-69 is due in substantial measure to two special circumstances; first, in 1968-69 the Post Office was able to achieve a greater improvement in its net cash operating surplus than is expected in 1969-70 and second, payments on some large equipment orders, which were expected to fall due last year, now have to be met in 1969-70 instead of last year. </para>

            <para>- Departmental- running expenses are estimated to increase by $43m to nearly $443m, or 10.6% higher than last year&#39;s expenditure. Close to $19m of this increase is attributed to higher rates of pay, including the increase in Third Division salaries granted as from 17th July 1969. </para>

          <para>External economic aid will be increased by $13m, or 9.3%, to total more than $l50m. This figure includes $96m for assistance to Papua and New Guinea, which will be $9m, or 10.3%, greater than last year. In addition, it is estimated that Commonwealth departments and non-commercial instrumentalities will spend about $22. 6m in the Territory. If the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank needs more capital funds this year, the Government will consider assisting the Administration to make an additional contribution. </para>
          <para>Commonwealth payments to industry will, on present estimates exceed $200m, a decrease on last year of $10.3m. As I have said, no wheat stabilisation payment is expected this year. Last year the cost was $43m. Devaluation compensation for primary industries is estimated at $29m, a reduction of $6m. Partly offsetting these decreases arc the increased subsidies on superphosphate and nitrogenous, fertilizers, and the increased grants for industrial research and development to which I referred earlier. Bounty payments for the protection of a number of manufacturing industries are estimated to increase. In the case of the shipbuilding subsidy the estimated cost is $ 16.6m, or $4m more than last year. </para>
          <para>We propose to pay a further amount of approximately $7.2m to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account to meet special expenditure in 1969-70, in particular in the fields of health, education and housing. The balance of about $1.3m in the Trust Account at 30 June 1969 will be used to meet outstanding commitments under similar programmes commenced last year; expenditure in 1968-69 on these programmes was approximately $4.0m. </para>
          <para>Of the $10m appropriated to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account last year, $4.7m was subsequently paid to the Commonwealth Capital Fund established under the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act 1968. It is not expected that any substantial addition to this Fund will be required in 1969-70. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>Another year of high and rising incomes and buoyant expenditure in all sectors of the economy is expected and we have based our revenue estimates on this expectation. Receipts from all sources except borrowing are estimated to rise to $6,954m - an increase of 13.5% on last year&#39;s receipts. Total taxation revenue is estimated to be $6,237m, an increase of 14.7% on last year. Details of these estimates are given in Statement No. 3 attached to this Speech. </para>
      <para>With a large increase of revenues in prospect we considered, in the overall budget strategy, whether greater expenditures than those proposed could have been financed or whether we could have given greater tax concessions than those I am about to mention. </para>
      <para>The essence of the situation we face is that, if our revenues rise as much as expected, it will be largely because of highly expansive economic conditions. If there were, in these circumstances, greater increases in expenditure than those proposed, we would have added further to demand on resources already under some strain. It would be much the same if we reduced taxation substantially. The consequent rise in disposable incomes and spending power would increase both demand and liquidity and would inevitably give a greater stimulus to inflationary tendencies. </para>
      <para>We have not therefore considered it prudent to give general concessions in taxation. We have, however, thought it desirable, in order to deal with special circumstances, to propose some changes in taxes and rates of charges. I shall now outline these changes. </para>

        <para>In order to cushion the transition from complete exemption to taxation at ordinary rates of tax, the age allowance provisions include &#39;shading-in&#39;&#39; arrangements to limit the amount of tax payable by an aged person with a taxable income somewhat in excess of the exemption levels. To take account of the new &#39;tapering&#39; provisions for age pensions to which I have already referred, we propose to reduce the tax payable under these limiting provisions and to extend the ranges of income within which the limitation confers a benefit. </para>

In 1960, the income tax law was amended to disallow the deduction of interest payable by companies on convertible securities.

In many cases, the convertible notes were essentially deferred issues of shares. </para>

It has therefore been decided to restore deductibility of interest for income tax purposes on convertible issues but this will be made subject to conditions designed to minimise tax avoidance. </para>

        <para>The Government has also decided that the present law granting tax deductions for subscriptions of capital to certain kinds of companies can, for some taxpayers, confer unjustified benefits. lt is a general principle of the lax Jaw that where a deduction for an amount of expenditure is authorised by more thar one provision only one deduction is allowed. There is under the existing law an exception to this principle, with the effect that where certain shares are sold by a share dealer, deductions granted with the general aim of facilitating the financing of mineral exploration or afforestation are disregarded in calculating the profit or loss on sale. In effect, a taxable profit on a sale of the shares is reduced through the allowance of two deductions for the cost of the shares and a deductible loss on a sale is likewise increased. In some cases, the reduction in tax liabilities can be as great as the total cost of the shares. </para>
        <para>It is proposed to amend section 82 of the income tax law so that dealers in shares will be allowed only one deduction for capital subscribed to mining or afforestation companies. The amendment will affect moneys paid on shares after today, except where the dealer owned the shares on or before today, or became the owner after today pursuant to an application lodged, or an agreement made, by today. People who are not regarded as dealers for tax purposes will not be affected by the amendment. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The Government has also decided that some relief should be granted from estate duty in the case of the estates of primary producers. In reaching this decision we had in mind the desirability of providing assistance to discourage the breaking-up of economic rural holdings because of the need to pay estate duty. </para>
        <para>Relief will be granted in two ways. The existing exemption levels will,&#39; for primary production estates, be raised by 20%. Some additional relief from duty will be granted in respect of land and other assets normally used in primary production such as livestock and farm plant and machinery. In broad terms, an estate will qualify for these reliefs when the assets are predominantly of the kind I have mentioned and the income of the deceased person was derived over the preceding five years principally from primary production. Relief will be granted for estates of a net value of less than $250,000. </para>
        <para>The relief will apply to estates of persons who die after the authorising legislation has been assented to. </para>
        <para>As a complementary measure some administrative requirements of the estate duty law are to be relaxed. The necessity to lodge security in order to obtain an extension of time for payment of duty is to be eliminated and the statutory limit of two years on extensions of time is to be removed. </para>

The new scale will apply only to domestic flights. As for international flights, international operators have claimed that they are already meeting a relatively high proportion of costs. A study is currently being under taken of airport and airway costs and revenues and the Government will give further consideration to charges for international flights. </para>

        <title>MONETARY LIQUIDITY</title>
        <page.no>42</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>Last year, despite a domestic surplus of about $200m in the Budget, the money supply increased by SI, 169m. The rate of change in. bank customers&#39; accounts suggests that the turnover of funds, or velocity of circulation, also increased. As I have already said these monetary influences undoubtedly contributed to the rise of inflationary pressures. </para>
      <para>This year we expect the Budget to produce a domestic surplus of about $500m. This would withdraw a similar amount from the money supply. Against that, receipts will exceed payments in private transactions abroad - possibly by much the same amount - and this will add an equivalent amount to the money supply. Further additions to the money supply will be made from other sources. In particular, the Reserve Bank will again add to Rural Credit advances outstanding as it finances payments on delivery of wheat and other commodities pending sale: though the net injection of liquidity from Rural Credits will be smaller than last year when a record harvest followed a year of drought </para>
      <para>Loans and advances by the banks will again add to the money supply. Action has been taken to moderate the rate at which the banks increase their lending. Trading banks are being called upon to transfer to their Statutory Reserve Deposits an additional amount equivalent to 1% of their deposits. This will leave them with much the same ratio of liquid assets and government securities to deposits as they had a year ago. This action has been accompanied by a rise of 0.2S% in maximum trading bank fixed deposit and maximum overdraft rates of interest. A new maximum rate of 5% now applies to both fixed deposit and certificates of deposit and within this maximum the term and rate structure has been made more flexible. On the one hand, the higher interest rates will assist the trading banks to attract funds into fixed deposits or certificates of deposit and, to that extent, to compete more effectively with other operators in the money market. On the other hand, the higher overdraft rates should induce bank customers to reduce the call they make on funds borrowed from the banks. </para>
      <para>To counter the influences which add to monetary liquidity, the Reserve Bank has been a net seller of Commonwealth securities in its open-market operations. In 1967-68, its net purchases of securities amounted to $178m. Last year it made net sales of about $78m. A new pattern of rates emerged and was reflected in the Commonwealth loan floated last month, with the yield on the long-dated securities rising from 5.4 to 6%. We have aimed at consolidating the strength of Commonwealth securities in the market. </para>
      <para>These measures are part of a precautionary move against inflationary trends. They will not in any way inhibit the real growth of the economy. The fact is that a large volume of monetary liquidity has been carried over from the past financial year. In the interests of stability and sound growth, we must limit the amount that will be added to liquidity this year. The real problem is to keep the increase within safe bounds and to prevent it becoming excessive. </para>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <page.no>43</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>This financial year will take us over the threshold of the next decade, the 1970&#39;s. From an economic point of view, the prospects are basically favourable. The new resources being opened up must add increasingly to output both for domestic use and for export. Our productivity has risen and will continue to rise. Migrants are pouring in and the work force is building up rapidly. We are attracting a good flow of capital from overseas. Our reserves are reasonably strong and, despite monetary and trade disturbances abroad, our exports are growing, diversifying and reaching out into still wider markets. </para>
      <para>This provides a margin of safety. It gives us some scope and time for any adjustments needed to keep the economy on a sure and steady course ahead. </para>
      <para>The broad promise, of future growth does not however reduce, or change essentially, the continuing problem, of economic management, that is, of keeping the national effort close to the limit of available resources but not allowing it to exceed this limit. The problem is with us this year in characteristic form. Rapidly though our supplies of labour, equipment and materials are increasing, demand is right up with them and is growing fast. There is a clear possibility that excess demand, helped by excess liquidity could upset the balance of the economy. This Budget, : in its economic aspect, together with the monetary measures taken lately, is primarily directed to minimising this risk. </para>
      <para>But budgets are much more than instruments of economic policy. This Budget is designed to share some, of our growing wealth with the less fortunate, to provide still better educational facilities for the young, to help rural industries improve their productivity and to meet competition abroad, and to expand great developmental works in many parts of the country. </para>
      <para>Although economic feasibility will, in the end, set limits to what can be done in any field, economic. purposes will have little meaning unless they contribute to personal and .humane values. It is the physical and intellectual progress of the community and of the individual human beings in it that ultimately counts. It will be seen that humane values are in the forefront of the purposes this Budget is designed to achieve. </para>
      <para>I commend it to honourable members and, if 1 may again interpolate, I think it is one of the best Budgets I have known to be introduced in the 20 years that I have been in the House. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The year just past, 1968-69, saw record growth of over 8.5 per cent in Gross National Product at constant prices. About 2 percentage points of this increase reflected recovery in rural industry and about 6.5 percentage points continued vigorous expansion in the nonfarm sector. Estimates of the main components of Gross National Product and Gross National Expenditure in 1968-69 are given in detail in the document &#39;National Income and Expenditure 1968-69&#39; presented with the Budget papers. In current price terms, these estimates show the following main changes from 1967-68:  an increase of 12.3 per cent in Gross National Product at factor cost, comprising an increase of 1 1 . 0 per cent in the gross value of non-farm output and an increase of 27.5 per cent in the gross value of farm output;  an increase of 10.9 per cent in Gross National Expenditure, including increases of 6.7 percent in personal consumption, 12.7percent in private gross fixed investment, and 8.8 per cent in public expenditure on goods and services; and  a decrease from $570 million in 1967-68 to $347 million in the excess of imports over exports of goods and services. </para>

Although lower than the abnormally large increase of over 8.5 per cent in Gross National Product at constant prices in 1968-69. the expected rate of growth in 1969-70 is high in terms of past average experience. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the demand side, the private sector seems likely to continue to increase its spending substantially in 1969-70. With personal incomes generally increasing strongly, consumer spending seems likely to be more buoyant in 1969-70. In particular, money wages have been on a steep upgrade for some time. Spending by wage and salary earners is likely to increase strongly although, to the extent that money wages continue to rise too fast, the money and &#39;real&#39; (constant price) increases in consumer spending could diverge further. Private fixed investment also seems likely to continue on its strong growth path. The State sector is expected to maintain a solid rate of expansion in its current and capital expenditures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In brief, the Budget has been framed in the context of the economy moving, and being likely to continue to move, on a strong expansionary course. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated increase of 10.8 per cent in Payments to or for the States and in State Works and Housing Programmes reflects mainly the prospective increase in financial assistance grants in 1969-70, the large estimated increase in specific purpose grants of a capital nature and the increase in State Works and Housing Programmes agreed to at the Loan Council meeting in June. </para>

This very high rate of increase in estimated receipts reflects assumptions made as to trends in economic activity in the year ahead, the recovery in primary producers&#39; incomes in 1968-69, and the substantial increase in 1968-69 in incomes of companies and individuals in business, the professions, etc. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated net decrease of $7,523,000 allows for a reduction of $22,421,000 in respect of arms, armament and equipment principally because of a change in the composition of capital equipment programmes to long lead-time items and to revised requirements for replacement and maintenance items. The estimated net decline of $1,475,000 in expenditure on accommodation and technical facilities reflects a decrease in expenditure on building works of $2,200,000 which is due to the approaching completion of several major barracks projects and a decrease of $2,260,000 in advances to the States under the Commonwealth - State Housing Agreement. That reduction is partly offset by an increase of $2,075,000 in repairs and maintenance to buildings and other facilities. There will be an estimated increase of $15,989,000 for pay, salaries, administrative expenses and general services. This reflects expected increases in strengths of both Service and civilian staffs and pay and salary rises. The estimated increases in administrative expenses and general services totalling $4,487,000 include $1 ,012,000 for higher costs and numbers of rations, $999,000 for extra freight and cartage and $742,000 for increased travelling and subsistence related to increased numbers and charges. </para>

Expenditure in 1968-69 included the cost of acquisition ($4,450,000) of the Edinburgh Base and there will be no comparable expenditure in 1969-70. These decreases are partly offset by increased expenditure of $3,767,000 on the provision of married quarters under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. </para>

After taking into account revenue proposals announced in the Budget Speech, total receipts in 1969-70 are estimated at $6,953,547,000, an increase of $824,937,000, or 13.5 per cent. In 1968-69, total receipts increased by $672,318,000, or 12.3 per cent. That increase included the effects of changes in taxation rates and other charges announced in the 1968-69 Budget, which were estimated to yield about $94,400,000 during 1968-69.

In 1968-69, average weekly earnings increased by about 7.25 per cent and average employment by more than 3 percent. Average employment in 1969-70 is assumed to be 3 per cent greater than in 1968-69. For the purpose of setting down a figure for pay-as-you-earn collections, an increase of 7 per cent has been assumed as the increase in average earnings in 1969-70 compared with 1968-69. This assumption, which takes account of the rise in average weekly earnings which has already occurred, does not imply that the trend in earnings from this point of time can be forecast with any reliability. Nor does its use imply that it is a Budget objective. Refunds of tax instalment deductions are estimated to increase by $43,432,000 so that, at existing rates of taxation, net pay as you earn collections are estimated to increase by $307,710,000 to $2,035,000,000. </para>

        <para>In 1969-70, the Commonwealth&#39;s deficit is estimated to be $30 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Drawings under the credit arrangements for purchases of defence equipment in the United States of America are expected to be $51 million while repayments are expected to be $52 million. Maturing securities of other overseas loans, which will have to be redeemed in 1969-70, and other payments to reduce indebtedness overseas may amount to about $200 million as compared with $96 million in 1968-69. It is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount that might be raised by new borrowings abroad. In view, however, of the present state of international money markets, it is unlikely that it will be possible to raise in 1969-70 as much as the record amount of $183 million obtained in 1968-69. There may, therefore, be net repayments overseas in 1969-70, in contrast to the net borrowings of $142 million in 1968-69. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On that basis, the amount to be financed in Australia would be greater than the estimated deficit of $30 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net loan proceeds and the change in the Treasury Note issue in Australia cannot be estimated in. advance with any degree of assurance. Nor is it possible to predict what changes will occur in holdings of Commonwealth securities by the public, on the one hand, and by the banking system, on the other. These will reflect monetary and other developments during the course of the year. It is relevant, however, that at the beginning of 1969-70 the value of maturing securities held in non-official hands amounted to about $486 million, whereas the corresponding figure at the commencement of 1968-69 was $278 million. This suggests that redemptions could be substantially greater in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. In the cash and conversion loan in July, new cash proceeds were only slightly greater than redemptions of maturing securities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The economy remains highly liquid as a result of the build-up in liquidity in 1968-69. Further additions to liquidity in the private sector, both from overseas transactions and from net additions to Rural Credits advances during the year, are expected. Against this, with the reduction in the Budget deficit in 1969-70, there will be an increase in the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic surplus (the excess of the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic receipts over its domestic expenditures). On present estimates, the increase in the domestic surplus will be about $300 million. This will help to offset the effects of factors, including bank lending, likely to add to domestic liquidity during the year. How holdings of Commonwealth securities by the non-bank public may change is not predictable; any increase in such holdings would also operate to subtract from liquidity in the domestic economy but any decrease would add to liquidity. The overall trends in liquidity during the year will depend on many factors, in addition to the Budget and the Commonwealth&#39;s debt operations, which affect the monetary situation. On balance, however, it seems likely that any increase in the money supply this year will be smaller than last year. </para>

        <inline font-style="italic">Defence Services.</inline>Expenditure on Defence Services was $52 million less than the Budget estimate. Expenditure on the purchase and manufacture of aircraft was $43 million less than estimated as a result of savings on Orion aircraft and rephasing of payments on FI 1 1C aircraft. In addition, there was a shortfall of $15 million in expenditure on equipment and stores for the R.A.A.F. attributable to delays in delivery and in ordering. Defence Aid for Malaysia and Singapore was $3 million less than estimated and, because of reduced activity, there was a shortfall of $2 million in expenditure on the British/Australian Joint Project. Expenditure on pay and allowances of members of the Forces and on other salaries and administrative expenses was $10 million greater than estimated. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States.</inline>In total, these payments were a net $9 million less than the Budget estimate. There were, however, some sizable variations in a number of items. Payments of general revenue grants were $28 million greater than the Budget estimate. Financial assistance grants were $14 million greater, mainly because average wages for the year ended March 1969 were higher than had been estimated at the time of the Budget. In addition, special revenue assistance totalling $14 million, for which no allowance was made in the Budget, was paid to the States to assist them in meeting budget difficulties is 1968-69. Specific purpose payments of a revenue nature were about $3 million greater than the Budget estimate, mainly because natural disaster relief payments were greater than had been estimated. There was a net shortfall of $40 million in expenditure on specific purpose payments of a capital nature. Assistance to Tasmania for a hydro-electric scheme was $11 million less than the Budget estimate, capital grants to the States for universities $7 million less, the amounts provided for assistance to teachers colleges $4 million less, and payments for railway projects $4 million less. Advances to South Australia to assist in the financing of the construction of a natural gas pipeline were $4 million less than estimated, mainly because of the use of alternative sources of finance for the project. Payments in respect of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme were $3 million greater than the Budget estimate. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">National Welfare Fund.</inline>The payment to the National Welfare Fund was $2 million greater than the Budget estimate. Expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits (including benefits for pensioners) was $8 million greater, reflecting an increase in the number of prescriptions issued. The largest shortfall was $6 million in expenditure on age and invalid pensions, largely the result of a smaller-than-estimated increase in the number of pensioners. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Departmental Running Expenses.</inline>Departmental Running Expenses were $1 6 million greater than the Budget estimate, largely as a result of the decision of the Arbitration Commission in the National Wage Case and other increases in wage and salary awards made after the Budget was presented. Increases in staff numbers and in general administrative costs also contributed to the increase. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">External Economic Aid (including Papua and New Guinea).</inline>Expenditure on externa) economic aid was $6 million less than the Budget estimate.

Payments to the Asian Development Bank were $4 million greater than estimated. </para>

        <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Payments to Industry.</inline>Commonwealth Payments to Industry were $5 million less than the Budget estimate. Payments of phosphate fertilizers bounty and nitrogenous fertilizers subsidy were, respectively, $5 million and $3 million less than the Budget estimate. An allowance of $1 million was made in the Budget for the marginal dairy farm reconstruction scheme, but no expenditure was incurred in 1968-69. Payments of raw cotton bounty and net shipbuilding subsidy payments were $3 million and $2 million, respectively, greater than estimated. </para>

        <inline font-style="italic">Other Expenditures.</inline>Expenditures under this heading were $1 1 million greater than the Budget estimate. Expenditure on assisted-passage immigration schemes exceeded the Budget estimate by $5 million because of a greater-than-estimated intake of assisted migrants in 1968-69. Payments to the Stevedoring Industry Authority and expenditure on wool promotion and research were each $2 million greater than had been estimated. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Advances for Capital Purposes.</inline>In total, these payments fell short of the Budget estimate by $27 million. The advance to the Post Office was $18 million less because of operating economies and reduced commitments due to the deferment of payment for some large equipment orders.

      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On the outlay side of the Budget there is an important distinction between payments made within Australia and payments made overseas. The immediate effects of overseas outlays are on the balance of payments^); such outlays must therefore be deducted from total outlay as a step in the process of assessing the impact of the Budget on the domestic economy in the year immediately ahead. This is done in the following table: </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The table shows that the greater increase in total outlay this year is attributable to the trend in the domestic component. Following a decrease of $44 million in 1968-69, overseas outlays are estimated to decrease by a further $48 million in the current year.(2) </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">After deducting overseas outlay the estimated increase in domestic outlay is $574 million compared with an actual increase of $419 million in 1968-69. This represents an estimated increase of 9.6 per cent this year, compared with an actual increase of 7.6 per cent in 1968-69. Although the increase in Budget outlays within Australia is estimated to be considerably greater in 1969-70 than in 1968-69, it is again substantially smaller than the concurrent increase in receipts. The implications of the domestic surplus for liquidity conditions are discussed in Statement No. 4. </para>
      <para class="italic">
        <inline font-style="italic">Composition of domestic outlay</inline>
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Within the domestic component of outlay there is a further basic distinction to be made between expenditure on goods and services, and transfers and advances from the Budget. Expenditure on goods and services adds <inline font-style="italic">directly</inline> to demand within the economy (gross national expenditure), while the impact on demand of transfers and advances depends on their effects on the spending of the recipients.(3) </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The following table compares, for each main component of domestic outlay, the estimated increase in 1969-70 with the actual increase in 1968-69. (&#39;) Such payments do not add to domestic incomes and the demand for locally-produced goods and services. Payments within Australia may add <inline font-style="italic">indirectly</inline> to overseas rather than Australian incomes, because orders met by local suppliers may include an import content. Although it is not possible to make reliable estimates of the import content of Commonwealth expenditure within Australia, the proportion would not be large, and it may be assumed that it is unlikely to change markedly between one year and the next. By contrast, direct payments overseas by the Commonwealth may fluctuate widely between one year and another. (*) The main overseas components are shown separately in Table 2 on page 9 of the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin, entitled &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39;, being published concurrently wilh the Budget. (&#39;) Whether payments from the Commonwealth Budget are themselves a source of demand for domestic resources, or add to demand indirectly by transferring purchasing power to other public authorities or the private sector, the initial impact on expenditure of Budget outlays can be expected to induce further increases which are financed out or the incomes earned in meeting the initial change in demand. As the <inline font-style="italic">relative</inline> sizes of the total increase in demand in two successive years would depend largely on the relative sizes of the initial increases which supported them, these &#39;multiplier&#39; effects are not considered explicitly in the discussion which follows. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The estimated percentage increase in domestic expenditure on goods and services is substantially less than in 1968-69. This is true also of each of the main components distinguished in the table - war and defence, other current expenditure and capital expenditure. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">A considerably larger increase than in 1968-69 is expected in domestic transfer payments a.:d net advances. As noted above, the impact of these payments on demand and incomes depends on the effects on the spending of the recipients. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Grants and advances to the States are estimated to rise by 11 .4 per cent in 1969-70, compared with 5.3 per cent in 1968-69. The comparison is affected to some extent by sugar industry assistance amounting to $24 million in 1967-68; apart from this item, the increase in payments to the States was 6.6 per cent in 1968-69. The much larger rise in these payments in 1969-70 will increase the funds available to finance the expenditures of the States and their authorities, which are predominantly expenditures on goods and services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Cash benefits to persons are estimated to increase by 13 .2 per cent in 1969-70 compared with 8.7 per cent in 1968-69. For the purpose of judging the influence of such payments on <inline font-style="italic">rates</inline> of income or expenditure <inline font-style="italic">within</inline> a year, these increases should be adjusted to remove the effects of variations in the incidence of pay-days and to allow for the &#39;full-year* effects of changes in rates of benefit!.1). After these adjustments, the estimated increase in cash benefits in 1969-70 is 12.5 per cent compared with 9.9 per cent in 1968-69. These payments would largely be spent by the recipients on goods and services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The larger increase in the advance to the Post Office is attributable in part to a smaller prospective increase in its operating surplus in 1969-70. To this extent, the figures in the table cannot be taken as an indication of the trend in expenditure by the Post Office on goods and services(2). (&#39;) A table showing how this adjustment is derived appears on page 10 or the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin being published concurrently with the Budget.

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the receipts side of the Budget, there are also differences in the significance which different classes of receipts may have for prospective trends in the economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The distinction drawn on the outlay side between transactions within Australia and transactions overseas does not have the same practical importance here. With relatively few exceptions, the budget receipts are derived from within Australia. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Another distinction is between those receipts which will emerge as by-products of evolving trends in incomes and spending in the economy and those which will not be closely related to these trends but will be, as it were, superimposed on them. The former, being the result of prospective trends in economic activities, cannot be regarded as an independent factor influencing those trends(1). The latter can be regarded as a source of influence on those trends. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This distinction is not, in practice, an easy one to make. For the most part, gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions, indirect taxes and the income of public enterprises, at existing rates and charges, fall within the former class. The other class is most clearly exemplified by new revenue measures which involve changes in rates of taxation or in other charges. The position as regards taxation collections from companies and individuals subject to provisional tax is somewhat ambiguous; as noted below, this depends on the spending and saving habits of various classes of taxpayers. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As in most years, the greater part of the increase in receipts in 1969-70 is expected to be induced by the prospective growth in expenditure and incomes in the economy. On the basis of existing legislation, gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions, indirect taxes and the income of public enterprises are estimated to increase in 1969-70 by $553 million or 13.3 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In passing, it might be noted that revenue estimates may sometimes reflect prospective trends in some particular areas of activity which are not the most desirable from the point of view of economic balance and reasonable price stability but which cannot, in practice, be corrected fully or quickly enough by fiscal or monetary means. An example relevant to the revenue estimates for 1969-70 is the very large increase which has been assumed in average earnings. Should average earnings rise less than assumed, taxation revenue would be less than estimated and the budget deficit would be greater(2). It would not follow, however, that the Budget objective of maintaining an environment conducive to balanced economic growth would be adversely affected by such a development; on the contrary, such a result would be more likely to serve the broad economic purposes to which budget policy is directed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Mainly because of the substantial increase which occurred in 1968-69 in the incomes of companies and of persons subject to provisional tax (especially primary producers), the increase in receipts not closely related to future trends in economic activity will be exceptionally large in 1969-70(3). On the basis of existing legislation, taxation collections from companies and individuals subject to provisional tax are estimated to increase by $307 million, or 18 per cent. As noted above, the effect of changes in these tax payments on the spending of the taxpayers in the year of payment cannot be assessed or predicted with any precision. It depends on many factors, including the extent to which the taxpayers concerned have made taxation provisions out of the previous year&#39;s income and the availability of funds for (&#39;) The prevailing structure of taxation does, of course, play a part in determining the total change in money income or expenditure which develops from a given initial change- in the same way, for example, as physical laws play a part in determining the increase in speed achieved by a car under given conditions. The retarding forces of friction and air resistance build up as the speed of a car increases; but being themselves a result of the increase in speed, these forces cannot be regarded as an independent influence. A decrease in the retardation attributable to air resistance would not be the <inline font-style="italic">cause</inline> of an increase in speed because it can only occur as a <inline font-style="italic">result</inline> of a decrease in speed; and vice versa. (*) The deficit would not be greater to the full extent of the shortfall in receipts, because some components of expenditure - for example, financial assistance grants to the States- could also be lower than estimated if average earnings g&#62; rose more slowly than assumed. (*) This increase consists mainly of the movements in receipts of certain taxes which are related to incomes in the year prior to the collection of the tax, but includes also the changes in some minor hems of receipts. <inline font-style="italic">See</inline> August 1968 Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39;, pages 18 and 19. expenditure in the year of payment. With respect to 1969-70, it is unlikely that a large proportion of these particular receipts would operate to offset the expansionary impact of budget outlays but there would be some elements of these receipts which would operate in this direction. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The taxation measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to <inline font-style="italic">reduce</inline> receipts by $21 million in a full year. By contrast, the revenue measures in the 1968-69 Budget were estimated to <inline font-style="italic">add</inline> $108 million to total receipts in a full year. The minor taxation concessions proposed for 1969-70 will, of course, have expansionary effects. </para>

Subject to the qualifications outlined later in this Statement, the figures are broadly consistent with the figures for 1968-69 and the estimates for 1969-70 set out in Statements No. 1 to 5. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Table 3 on pages 50 and 51 shows figures for each year since 1959-60 in national accounting form. In this form, transfers between different parts of the Commonwealth&#39;s accounts are eliminated so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Commonwealth Government and the rest of the economy or overseas. These transactions are classified into economically significant categories, corresponding with those for which similar information is provided, in respect of past years, for the entire economy in the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure. The figures contained in this table are comparable with those set out in Statement No. 6. Notes on the composition of the figures are set out later in this Statement. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the period 1959-60 to 1968-69, Commonwealth expenditures rose by 115 per cent. Within this increase, there was an increase of 199 per cent in expenditures on defence services while other expenditures rose by 103 per cent </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Total receipts and total taxation revenue were each 119 per cent greater in 1968-69 than in 1959-60. The largest single increase was in net pay-as-you-earn collections from wage and salary income which increased by 216 per cent over this period. Collections from this source rose as a proportion of total receipts from 19.3 per cent in 1959-60 to 28.0 per cent in 1968-69. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the period, the size of the deficit varied considerably. In 1960-61, it amounted to $32 million; in 1967-68 it reached $642 million. In 1969-70, it is estimated to be $30 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The financial year 1968-69 saw the highest level of net proceeds of borrowings overseas available towards financing of the deficit. $142 million. Net proceeds of loans raised in Australia and of Treasury Notes were highest in 1962-63 when they exceeded $500 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Commonwealth Budget outlays rose from 22.0 per cent of Gross National Product in 1959-60 to 25.6 per cent in 1967-68 and then declined slightly to 24.2 per cent in 1968-69. This implies that there was a relative increase over this period in the quantum of transactions passing through the Commonwealth Budget as compared with the growth in the value of goods and services produced in Australia. At the same time, it has to be recognised that a large part of Commonwealth outlays consists of transfer payments, mainly payments of pensions, subsidies, etc., to persons, and grants and advances to the States and to Commonwealth authorities outside the Budget. This is illustrated by the comparison in the following table of outlays in total and as a percentage of Gross National Product in 1959-60 and 1968-69. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The official economic assistance financed through the Commonwealth Budget which Australia provides to developing countries, including Papua and New Guinea, is estimated to total $1 62,389,000 in 1 969-70. This is $1 1 ,738,000, or 7 . 8 per cent, greater than expenditure in 1968-69. Details are set out in the following table: </para>

      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The totals shown in this table differ from those quoted in Statement No. 2 - Estimates of Expenditures, 1969-70, because of the inclusion of the estimates of direct expenditure of an economic nature which various Commonwealth Departments incur in Papua and New Guinea from other votes in the Budget. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">No allowance has been made in this table for the large subventions which the Commonwealth and State Governments make each year towards financing various educational institutions in Australia which are attended by several thousands of private and officiallysponsored students from other countries. Moreover, the figures do not allow for the fact that part of Australia&#39;s contributions to the regular budgets of certain international organizations not listed in the table is used to finance aid projects in developing countries. Nor do the figures include defence aid to Malaysia and Singapore, which is estimated to total $7,852,000 in 1969-70, compared with $6,243,000 in 1968-69. Various expenditures of a military nature incurred in Papua and New Guinea also help indirectly to promote economic development. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Some brief comments on the more important items shown in the above table follow. </para>
      <para class="block" pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">International Development Association.</inline>Australia has pledged a total of $57,125,000 ($US63,980,000) to IDA since its inception. This sum comprises: - an initial capital subscription of $US20, 180,000, payable over the five year period, 1960-1964; - a contribution of $US19,800,000 towards the first replenishment of the Association&#39;s resources over the triennium 1965-1967; and - an offer by the Government earlier this year voluntarily to contribute $US24 million to IDA over the next three years in anticipation of the coming into effect of the international agreement governing the second replenishment of IDA&#39;s resources. This agreement was negotiated early in 1968 and was originally intended to relate to the period 1968-1970 but, in the event, it did not come into effect until 23 July 1969. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Contributions to EDA are initially made available in the form of non-negotiable, noninterestbearing promissory notes which are cashed as and when the funds are required by IDA. Actual cash payments to IDA up to 30 June 1969 totalled $29,933,000. Because of the delay in implementing the second replenishment agreement, the calls made by IDA on its member countries in 1968-69 were lower than usual. Australia was called upon to make cash payments of only $2,020,000 to IDA in that year, compared with $7,134,000 in the previous year. In 1969-70, cash payments to IDA are estimated to total $5,510,000. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Asian Development Bank.</inline>Australia agreed to subscribe $75,893,000 ($US85 million) to the capital stock of the Asian Development Bank, which has been set up in Manila to promote the economic growth of developing countries in the ECAFE region by providing loans, on both commercial and concessional terms, and technical assistance to these countries. Australia&#39;s subscription is the fourth largest after those of the United States and Japan (each $US200 million) and India ($US93 million). One-half is to remain at call as security for any borrowings which the Bank might make on international capital, markets to supplement its subscribed capital. The balance is payable in five annual instalments, half in convertible currency and half in domestic currency. Use of the domestic currency portion is confined to the procurement of goods and services in Australia. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The amount of $3,795,000 provided in the Budget represents the fourth annual instalment of the convertible currency portion of Australia&#39;s subscription. The corresponding domestic currency payment will be made in the form of a non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing promissory note which will be cashed as and when the Bank requires funds to purchase goods and services in Australia. Steps were taken in 1968-69 to encash one of these promissory notes. Apart from enabling the Bank to meet expenses associated with the Annual Meeting of its Board of Governors in Sydney last April, this action will help the Bank to increase the overall return which it obtains on its investments in Australia. As similar action is not envisaged in 1969-70, the payment to the Bank will be $3,794,000 less than last year. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Other Multilateral Programmes.</inline>The estimates provide for increases in Australia&#39;s contributions to various multilateral aid schemes. The main increase relates to the UN Development Programme, to which Australia will contribute $US2 million in 1970, compared with $US1,451,000 in 1969. Australia&#39;s contribution to the UN High Commissioner&#39;s Programmes for Refugees will be increased by 30 per cent to $175,000 in 1969-70. Voluntary contributions of meteorological equipment totalling $40,000 will be made to developing countries in Asia in 1969-70 in connection with the World Weather Watch mounted by the World Meteorological Organization. The number of Australian experts participating in surveys and studies organized by the Asian Industrial Development Council to promote greater economic co-operation between countries in the ECAFE region is expected to increase markedly in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Colombo Plan.</inline>This is by far Australia&#39;s largest bilateral aid programme. It covers a wide range of activities, including the training of numerous overseas students and officials in many different subjects in educational institutions, government services and private industry in Australia as well as the assignment of Australian experts in various fields to work and teach in developing countries overseas. At the present time, it also embraces the provision of heavy machinery and equipment for large construction projects (for example, highways, bridges , dams and town water supplies) undertaken in collaboration with foreign governments. In addition, it includes the installation of radio telecommunication systems, assistance in the rehabilitation of telephone and railway networks, and gifts of such diverse items as trucks, buses, landrovers. irrigation and farm equipment, railway wagons and sleepers, dredges, pumps, hospital and broadcasting equipment, wool, bakery equipment, and lathes and teaching aids for vocational training institutes. Various other commodities and manufactured goods have been given to developing countries under the Colombo Plan in the past. Further details of the present programme are given in various official publications by the Department of External Affairs. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Since 1967-68, special emergency assistance has been provided to Indonesia under the Colombo Plan to help that country to stabilise and rehabilitate its economy. Most of this assistance has been used to finance what are, in effect, commercial exports to Indonesia of predominantly Australian-made goods on the &#39;Bonus Export&#39; (B.E.) list which that country has drawn up to reflect its most pressing requirements. As such, it has served to provide general financial support to Indonesia&#39;s budgetary and balance of payments position. In 1968-69, this B.E. aid was supplemented with government-to-government gifts of flour, fertilizer, railway equipment and other commodities. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The total amount of aid to be provided to Indonesia in 1969-70 is $15 million, compared with expenditure of $11,500,000 in 1968-69. This will be financed from various votes under the Colombo Plan and from the provision for Australia&#39;s food aid commitment under the International Grains Arrangement. Thus, it is envisaged that gifts of flour worth $4 million f.o.b. will be made to Indonesia in 1969-70. The comparable figure for 1968-69 was $3,541,000. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The total provision for the Colombo Plan in 1969-70, at $23,500,000, is $4,683,000, or 25 per cent, greater than expenditure in 1968-69. Of this increase, $3,041,000 relates to aid to Indonesia. The estimates provide for a substantial increase in the number of training awards to overseas students and officials to study in Australia in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">International Grains Arrangement - Food Aid Convention.</inline>Provision has been made in the Budget to meet Australia&#39;s commitment under the International Grains Arrangement to provide 225,000 metric tons of wheat or flour equivalent as food aid to developing countries in 1969-70. The estimate is slightly below actual expenditure in 1968-69 because certain expenses incurred last year on freight and insurance costs associated with a shipment of wheat will be recouped in 1969-70. Countries which received gifts of wheat or flour from Australia in 1968-69 were India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Afghanistan, Korea, Nigeria, Fiji and, as previously mentioned, Indonesia. The bulk of the food aid to be provided in 1969-70 is again expected to go to traditional recipients of aid from Australia in the Asian and Pacific regions. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Indus Waters Scheme.</inline>Australia has undertaken to contribute a total of $23,269,000 to the Indus Basin Development Fund to help finance the construction of dams, link canals and barrages on various tributaries of the Indus River designed to divide the waters between India and Pakistan in an equitable manner. Total expenditures for this purpose to 30 June 1969 amounted to $16,366,000. It is expected that the World Bank, which is responsible for administering this scheme, will call up $733,000 of Australia&#39;s outstanding commitment in 1969-70, compared with $2,137,000 in 1968-69. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Other Bilateral Programmes.</inline>The estimates for all other bilateral aid items, with two exceptions, are greater than expenditures in 1968-69, in some cases significantly so. The estimates for the relatively new South Pacific Aid Programme and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan, for example, are both more than 20 per cent greater. The two exceptions are the Foreign Exchange Operations Fund in Laos, to which Australia made a supplementary contribution in 1968 greater than the amount by which its pledge for 1969 has been increased, and the contribution that Australia made to the appeal which the International Red Cross organized on behalf of refugees in Nigeria last year. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Provision has been made in the Budget for two new items: an initial contribution of $13,500 by Australia towards the Food and Fertilizer Technology Centre to be established in Taipei under the auspices of the Asian and Pacific Council, and expenditure of up to $100,000 in 1969-70 on the establishment of a new aid scheme designed to enlist the services of selected universities in Australia in helping similar institutions in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia to tackle the twin problems of food production and population control confronting those countries. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Papua and New Guinea.</inline>Provision has been made for a grant of $96 million to the Administration of Papua and New Guinea in 1969-70. This represents an increase of $9,006,000, or more than 10 per cent, on last year, and is designed to assist the continued economic and social development of the Territory in accordance with the overall economic development plan which has been drawn up in the light of the recommendations of general survey missions from the World Bank. Direct expenditures in Papua and New Guinea by various Commonwealth Departments are expected to decline this year. </para>
      <para class="block">Growth in Australia&#39;s Aid </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As the following table reveals, Australia has provided nearly $1,300 million in official economic assistance to developing countries, including Papua and New Guinea, since the end of World War II. The Budget allows for a further $162 million to be provided in 1969-70. These figures do not include defence aid, official assistance provided from extra-budgetary sources, indirect educational subsidies to overseas students, or Australia&#39;s contributions to the budgets of certain international organizations which finance aid projects in developing countries as part of their regular activities. By the end of the current financial year, Australia will have provided considerably more than $500 million in official aid to developing countries apart from Papua and New Guinea. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although the annual rate of increase in aid expenditures slowed down in 1968-69, largely for reasons over which Australia had no control, aid expenditures have on the whole increased at a much faster rate than total government spending and National Income over the past decade. The fastest rate of increase has occurred in Australia&#39;s bilateral aid programmes, which are concentrated upon developing countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Because of conceptual and statistical difficulties, international comparisons of aid efforts by different countries are subject to reservations or qualifications of one kind or another. Nevertheless, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development regularly publishes data on the aid performances of individual member countries which are sometimes used for comparative purposes. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Thus, for example, the DAC publishes information on the total flows of financial resources from its members to developing countries each year; these statistics include not only official grants and loans but also private capital flows which comprise both direct and portfolio investments and commercial and trade credits of more than twelve months&#39; duration. It is very doubtful whether such disparate items can be aggregated in any meaningful sense. Nevertheless, all these items are included in the present definition of the &#39;aid&#39; volume target of one per cent of Gross National Product to which developed countries have been asked to subscribe in international circles. At the same time, the target specifically allows for &#39;the special position of those countries which are net importers of capital*, such as Australia. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In view of the shortcomings in these total flow figures as a measure of aid effort and burden-sharing, the DAC also publishes data on official flows only. These figures are subject to some reservations in that they include loans extended on commercial terms and for purposes other than aid. For example, net purchases by central monetary authorities of bonds issued by institutions like the World Bank are included. Moreover, these statistics fail to allow fully for the difference between grants and loans inasmuch as interest receipts are not deducted in calculating net flows. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Further refinements to these statistics are still being made, and the DAC now distinguishes between &#39;official development assistance&#39; and other official flows. The data for official development assistance provide a more suitable basis for comparing the aid efforts of other donor countries with that of Australia, although the problem of equating loans with grants still remains. On this basis, according to the DAC, Australia ranked among the first three countries in the world in 1968. Preliminary figures for individual donor countries showing their net official development assistance to developing countries in 1968 expressed as percentages of National Income and Gross National Product are set out in the following table: </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Assistance to Australian industry is provided through the Budget by way of bounties, subsidies and other payments, and by way of contributions to promotion and research. In addition, services and facilities are provided by the Commonwealth for which no charge is made or for which charges fall well short of covering the costs incurred. A large part of the current expenditure of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, for which it is estimated $37 million will be provided from Consolidated Revenue in 1969-70, is on activities undertaken for the benefit of Australian industry. Commonwealth Departments providing assistance in the form of services and facilities include Primary Industry, Trade and Industry (including the Australian Tourist Commission), National Development (Bureau of Mineral Resources, and Forestry and Timber Bureau), Civil Aviation and Labour and National Service. A number of the specific purpose grants to the States also assist primary industries - for instance, payments for beef cattle roads, brigalow lands development, water resources investigations, softwood forestry, and so on. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In addition, a very considerable and rapidly increasing amount of assistance is being provided through the Budget by way of special taxation concessions which, as they result in a reduction of Commonwealth revenues and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients, are as much a call on the Budget as direct payments which add to expenditures. Assistance of this type is mainly provided by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their incomes for taxation purposes beyond those normally permitted under the income tax law. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In total, the Commonwealth assistance specified under the following three headings, which does not include all the forms of assistance referred to above, amounted to $440 million in 1968-69. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Raw Cotton Bounty.</inline>The estimated reduction of $1,020,000 in bounty payments on raw cotton results chiefly from an amendment made in 1969 to the Raw Cotton Bounty Act. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">This amendment reduced the ceiling on total bounty payments from $4,000,000 for 1969 to $3,000,000 for 1970. In addition, payments in 1968-69 were accelerated slightly as, during that year, the bounty became payable on a production rather than a sale basis. </para>

The main reason for this reduction is that no payments in respect of forward exchange losses incurred at the time of devaluation will be made in 1969-70. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty.</inline>As a result of a proposed increase from $8 to $12 per ton in the standard rate of bounty and an expected increase in sales, it is estimated that expenditure on the bounty in 1969-70 will increase by $18,735,000 to $50,400,000. </para>

The expected increase of $5,063,000 in expenditure in 1969-70 is attributable to increased shipbuilding activity. Receipts are also estimated to increase in 1969-70, though not to the same extent as expenditure, mainly because receipts in 1968-69 included a higher-than-normal incidence of progress payments by purchasers of ships. The net subsidy is estimated to increase by $4,025,000. </para>

It is estimated that payments of this bounty will amount to $800,000 in 1969-70. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Sulphate of Ammonia Bounty.</inline>There are two reasons for the increase of $780,000 in expected expenditure in 1969-70. Payments in 1968-69 covered sales for a nine-months period only, whereas subsidy payments in 1969-70 will cover sales in a 15-months period, and price reductions by manufacturers are expected to lead to increased sales. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Sulphuric Acid Bounty.</inline>Expenditure in 1969-70 is expected to be $208,000 lower than in 1968-69 because of reduced acid production from indigenous sulphur-bearing materials. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The amount of revenue forgone in 1968-69 through the main concessions in the income tax field is estimated at no less than $177,000,000. The latest estimates for particular concessions which contribute to this total are given below. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In addition to the concessions in the income tax law, there are numerous concessions in the sales tax field in the form of special exemptions to assist particular industries. In the case of the pay-roll tax, there is the export rebate scheme, which involved a cost to revenue of $29,000,000 in 1968-69 and is estimated to cost $37,000,000 in 1969-70. </para>

While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Commonwealth Budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write oft* the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the value to them of having the use of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving credit in their account with the taxation revenue. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">In the light of the rapid expansion that is occurring and is in prospect in the mining and petroleum exploration and production industries, it seems certain that there will be increases in the cost of the various income tax concessions which these industries enjoy. In particular, as the income from production of Australian petroleum grows, there will be an increasing cost to revenue of the special allowances permitted for petroleum-producing enterprises. These allowances effectively free from tax income from the sale of Australian petroleum and hs products until the capital expenditure incurred in finding and recovering the petroleum and not, in effect, transferred for deduction against shareholders&#39; income by reason of Section 77a, has been recouped out of the mining profits.

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>we are discussing one of the most important matters which is likely to come before this House in this session or which has come before the House over recent years. It refers to Australia&#39;s trusteeship responsibilities in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Australia is charged with the responsibility of developing this new nation which has an area of 180,000 square miles and a population of between 2 million and <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> million. These people to our north will be either our friends or hostile to us in the future. The Australian Government has bungled its administration of this trusteeship area terribly and tragically over the last few weeks. Just before the suspension of the sitting for dinner we heard some economic euphoria pouring from the lips of the honourable member . for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Mackay).</inline> He said that everything will be wonderful and that if a big mine is opened up everything must be beautiful. He suggested that roads will be built, houses will be built, the people will advance socially and there will be tons of money for everybody. Has he ever taken a look at any other mining activities around the world? He does not have to look much further than New Caledonia. The honourable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cross)</inline> has been there, and he might have something to say about it later. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of course, honourable members opposite in the debate this afternoon have avoided their responsibilities in this matter as they have attempted to avoid them all along: The Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes)</inline> made a statement to the House this afternoon about the situation on Bougainville Island but refused to debate the matter. He refused to adopt the simplest procedure in the House to allow honourable members to debate the matter. He was avoiding his responsibility, and most of the honourable members on the other side of the House have likewise avoided their responsibilities. The honourable member for Evans consoled himself by attacking the &#39;Four Corners&#39; television programme which brought this matter to the notice of the people of Australia. There is an unbridgeable gap between the view taken by honourable members opposite and that taken by honourable members on this side of the House. We are concerned with human values and we are sensitive about the traditions and the humane treatment of the people of Papua and New Guinea. Honourable members on the other side of the House are concerned with material values and the power-derived authority they will enforce come what may. </para>
          <para>There are some matters that have not been considered this afternoon. For instance, today the Government of Zambia announced that it will nationalise in fact, if not in law, the copper mines of that country. No Government of Australia can write a charter for the future of Papua and New Guinea. No Government can give an unconditional guarantee to any company, no matter how keenly and sincerely we feel about it, that its future in the Territory will be secure no matter what we do. The events which have taken place at Bougainville over the last few weeks have ensured that the people there will have a continuing resentment not only of the Administration but also of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia. In handling affairs at Bougainville, the Government has committed the greatest act of folly in the 25 years since the war. On the whole there has been reasonable, though conservative and cautious, progress in Papua and New Guinea. I have been a fairly consistent critic of many of the things which have been done in Papua and New Guinea, but I have always paid tribute to any advances to which I think Australians ought to pay tribute. On the whole the Australian Government has performed better in New Guinea than any other Government has in comparable circumstances, but Australia has done itself a great disservice by its actions in recent weeks. </para>
          <para>A few weeks ago, as a result of inquiries around my electorate, I visited Bougainville. The Minister for External Territories, on television or in an interview somewhere in his electorate, implied that I had gone to Bougainville and incited the people to revolt. If I can incite people to revolt in 1 day I am greater than Lenin. If I were able to do that I would be the most revolutionary character you have ever seen. But of course that is all nonsense. Part of the reason why the Minister does not see the facts of life is that he is trying to escape from them. I visited Papua and New Guinea. I placed an advertisement in the daily press. People throughout the Territory saw the advertisement and people in the area under discussion saw it. I sent telegrams to the local member of the House of Assembly. I said that I would be there to hear what they had to say, and see things for myself, and that is what I did. I was concerned with what had happened. I had watched the operations of our Government with the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory, so I went to Bougainville with an open mind but with grave doubts. </para>
          <para>I went to the area and I discussed the matter with the officials. I received absolute courtesy from them. They are dedicated people. They said to me that they were going to enforce the law. I went up and looked at the mine which is 13 or 15 miles up a very rough, dangerous and difficult road. The visit was worth while. I went down to the beach and sat for 3 hours with the people, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paul</inline> Lapun, who is their local member, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leo</inline> Hannett, who has been here, who is a member of the University of Papua and New Guinea and who had with him a tape recorder. Somewhere in Papua and New Guinea is a record of this meeting, if anyone cares to look for it. Those people said to me as we sat under the coconut palms on the beach that afternoon: &#39;If they come on to our land we will fight. We have nothing to fight with, but we will fight.&#39; I was touched with the tragedy and pathos of the situation. These simple folk have nothing but their land and now, with all the power at our disposal, we intend to take that land from them. I had no resources which would enable me to convince them otherwise. I had no way of opening up their minds, if they are to be opened up. Because of the way that we are carrying out this operation I do not believe that these people can be convinced that we do not intend to take their land. </para>
          <para>When I came back to Australia I made a statement about what I had seen and a fortnight ago I went to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> and told him that so far as I was concerned I had done my duty as well as I was able, that I had no intention of inciting anybody but that I was making sure that I knew what I was answering for as a member of this Parliament. I believe that what is going on up there is a deep disgrace. I foresaw and prophesied that it would happen. It has happened, and it will go on unless we take steps to stop it. The Prime Minister abdicated his responsibility in the matter, as has the Minister for External Territories, who is now at the table. The fact is that we have a deep trust in Papua and New Guinea. We do not own the place. We have no rights there; we have only duties. We have power in the Territory, but that does not give us the right to railroad people and to do what we like. Bougainville does not belong to us. In the future it might not even be part of a new Papua and New Guinea. It could be associated with the Solomon Islands or be an independent country in some different context altogether. If Nauru and Tonga can be independent, Bougainville also might be independent. </para>
          <para>In this area we have betrayed the trust that has been placed upon us. We cannot act like this with these people. We do not own them. We treat them even more as foreigners than the people of Italy, France or Greece. People from those countries can settle in Australia, but the people of Bougainville are not permitted to do so. We have a trust; this is a tremendous project. The point that has not been made clear by Government supporters is that we are not arguing today about the mining project. The facts are that the mining project will proceed, that the mining land has been alienated, that the people are going to receive, I think, $2 per acre per year for it and that they are going to be left with a hole in the ground about 8,000 feet long, 4,000 feet wide and perhaps a half mile deep. We are arguing about land for a housing estate - that is what it is. The Commonwealth is to buy land for a housing development. The Commonwealth is going to buy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McKillop&#39;s</inline> land, or acquire it, and take land from the Rorovana people - not for a mine, but for a town for other people. It is going to disadvantage one group of people so that another group can be advantaged. </para>
          <para>When I sat on the beach on that afternoon the people said to me: &#39;Why can&#39;t they build the town up there on that swamp land?&#39; They were referring to the low-lying land behind the beach. Honourable members will find that land mentioned in the debates in the House of Assembly and in statements that have been made here and there. From the map, I would say that the area to which they referred covered 4 or 5 square miles. Of course the area would have to be filled in; but is there any great difficulty in draining marshes or in filling in swamps? There will be about 30 million tons of overburden from the mine. But of course that will not be done; that would take too long. There is an alternative to what has been done. There was an alternative site available, development of which required only money and engineering skill, which is possessed in a very large measure by both the company and the Administration. </para>
          <para class="block">To do what was. done on Bougainville in order to avoid disadvantage to a private mining company was an act of incredible folly. In my view it is completely unethical for the Government of Australia to act as agent for a private mining company in such an instance. It must be made clear to the people of Australia that what has happened on Bougainville that has led to the trouble has nothing to do with the mining of copper; it is part of the ancillary services. Alternative land is available if we have the wit and the will to utilise it. We have abdicated our responsibilities. We have breached our trust. We will sow the seeds of continuing resentment that will make it difficult for us to operate in the area for years to come. Over the last 3 or 4 years the people have expressed their resentment about certain things. A man at Kieta was sentenced to 2 months gaol last September because he resisted somebody chopping down trees on his land. The Commonwealth will spend millions of dollars on this project for the company&#39;s advantage. It will build roads where it would not build them for the local people. It will build primary, secondary and technical schools where it never had the money to build them for the local people. On every count the Government is to be censured in respect of this operation. There is an alternative area for the town site. Anybody who looks at the map or appreciates the competence of Australian engineers can see that there are alternatives. The people of the area have been driven to a state of resentment. The Government has acted with unbecoming violence and in a manner completely unbecoming an Australian and civilised community. In my opinion this is one of the most disgraceful actions- </para>

Together with members of the Government Members Mining Committee I met a very comprehensive cross-section of the community. We were prepared to talk to everybody because it was our desire to ascertain the problems confronting the people of the area. In particular we wanted to meet the indigenous people of the area. We wanted to ascertain their problems and to see what could be done to assist them if assistance could be given. Tonight the Opposition is trying only to make political capital out of a difficult situation. This debate will only add confusion in an area where already the greatest difficulty is being experienced in providing a proper picture of what the natives will eventually get from this project. </para>

              <para>- If he is patient the honourable member for Wilmot will find out in a minute or two. Having regard to its objectives the Administration welcomed an investigation of the possibility of economic development of mineral resources in the area by a company with the financial resources and technical skills possessed by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia. If those financial resources and technical skills had not been available to the company it is quite possible that this very valuable development would never have taken place because a great deal of investigation was required before the mineral deposits could be proved to be of economic significance. When it became obvious that this project was likely to eventuate the Administration&#39;s field officers in the area did all they could to explain the position to the natives. I would emphasise the tremendous difficulties with which those officers were confronted. No mention of these difficulties has been made. Reference has been made to the number of languages spoken in the area. There are some 700 over the whole of the Territory. It has been mentioned that there are 19 in Bougainville itself. People who live in quite close proximity to one another cannot converse except by the use of pidgin. Whilst pidgin has done a remarkable job in enabling communication to take place, it leaves a lot to be desired as a medium of communication when explaining something which is entirely new to these people. These were the problems which were faced by the Administration and its officers. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Wills went on to say that we have done ourselves a great disservice in this matter. I say that the great disservice has been done by those people who were consistently - and to some effect - stirring up trouble in the area and trying to undermine the good work that has been done by the officers of the Administration. I know, and everyone knows who has been there, that these people have a very great love for their land. They do not want to be moved from it, but when the position is explained to them and when they have a reasonable conception of what is taking place they are prepared to co-operate as they did in relation to the 10,000 acres at Panguna where the mine is situated. The same problems arose there but they were overcome and the natives now are getting some of the benefits from this mining venture. They accepted the proposal because the disrupters did not have quite the same amount of time to get amongst them. It is very easy to convince these primitive people, particularly when you are quite untruthful, stop at nothing and use the tactics that they used to convince these people that the intentions of the Administration are not to benefit them. </para>

              <para>- There were enough of them in the area. Fortunately there were not more of them, otherwise there would have been more trouble. I will not name them. The honourable member was there and if he had looked around as I did he would know them and would not want me to name them. There is no need for me to name them. Anyone who has been there in recent times knows that there were not many of them but that they caused a good deal of trouble. As I have said, when we were there we tried to get an opinion from everyone we could interview. We went to the mission; we went to the mine; we went to the Administration officers; we went to the people who were managing the mine. We spoke to the native people wherever we had an opportunity to do so. We went to the Rorovana area and had a meeting with the people. The member for the area, Paul </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">Lapun, was with us and acted as interpreter to convey our remarks to the native people. Our main objective was to learn the problems of the indigenes. At the meeting, which was attended by some fifty people, only one person asked questions although we gave everyone the opportunity to do so. This person, who had been indoctrinated by the people who were trying to undermine the Administration, asked question after question until finally I said: &#39;It is time someone else was given the opportunity to ask questions&#39;. It appeared that one or two others wished to ask questions. Of the whole group only two others asked questions of us. There we were, members of the Australian Parliament, asking them to tell us their problems so that we could assist them in whatever way we could: We were anxious that they should approach us but they did not tell us of any of their problems. </para>
          <para>We learned too that they had had discussions with Administration officials who had been approached by the natives at all hours of the day and night - we checked that particularly - and the officials were prepared to listen to the natives as long as the natives wanted to talk. The natives were given every opportunity. This was confirmed by the head of the mission in the area who said that over a considerable period the natives had been approaching him to have the objectives explained to them. There is no doubt that the cooperation which is being given to the Administration and to the company in the area of the mine would certainly have been given in the area where the land is needed for the supporting industries for this great project. I have not the time to deal with many of the aspects of the benefits that will accrue from this venture when it gets under way. I will quote one benefit as an example. I quote from an address given to the House of Assembly. Referring to the educational programme, the  speaker  stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is estimated that this programme, when fully under way, will involve the company with an annual expenditure of about half a million dollars. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Many other benefits&#39;, including health benefits, will come as a result of this venture. </para>
          <para>I do want to emphasise the success that the Administration has achieved. The sensations that we have seen in some of the forms of mass media that provide information to the public show that the mass media have forgotten about the successes that have been achieved. The Administration is to be congratulated on what it has done particularly when its achievements are looked at against the background of the very great difficulties that it has experienced. I wish to congratulate the Administration on what it has achieved. The greatest need at this time is patience, tolerance, understanding and co-operation on the part of all people who have an interest and a concern in this matter. </para>

              <para>-The people who are genuinely interested in the welfare of the natives of this area dp regret that any force has to be used.. But the blame for that is on the disrupters who have gone into the area. If the Administration had been given a reasonable opportunity to employ the methods that it was using to encourage the natives to co-operate with it, the problems would have been resolved. When this type of disruption comes into the situation, I suggest that the position becomes tremendously difficult. The real need at this time, is an understanding of the position as well as the tolerance that is required to enable the natives to understand what will happen. Once the natives start to get some tangible benefit from this development, I am sure that we will see a repetition of what happened in the mining area in the area where land is being sought at the moment </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>a lot of heat has been engendered in this debate which has been brought before the Parliament today by the honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart).</inline> Some very bard things have been said and some very truthful things have been said about various aspects of Australia&#39;s administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and that particular part of the Territory on which we focus our attention this evening. I welcome the fact that the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes)</inline> wm follow me in this debate to sum up and to reply from the point of view of the Government. I hope that, in his reply, with his knowledge of the Territory he will clear up some of the misapprehensions and some of the doubts that have been introduced in this debate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition has brought this matter before the Parliament not in order to make party political capital from the debate but to direct attention to our trusteeship of this Territory. The trusteeship of this Territory was handed over to Australia by the League of Nations. We continue the administration of the Territory under trusteeship from the United Nations. It is a very responsible trust. Unhappily, certain incidents having occurred in the Territory in recent times, we are debating this matter in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. But the Opposition has brought this matter before the Parliament because we would be failing in our duty if these unfortunate incidents in which batons and tear gas have been used against the indigenous people of Bougainville were not discussed properly in this Parliament. </para>
          <para>We are asking for a clear statement on what the Government proposes to do. Quite frankly, every Australian is proud of the Australian Administration in Papua and New Guinea. In my time in this Parliament, which has been approximately 8 years, I do not recall any occasion on which the Opposition ever has suggested that the amount of expenditure in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea should not be increased. Indeed, on so many of these things, we are on common ground with the Government. But this is an occasion when, these matters having been brought before the Parliament this afternoon and this evening, the Minister and the Government should not spell out their complacency. The Minister, of course, has not spoken in this debate yet. But we have heard from other Government speakers statements on what has happened, and on the great benefits that will accrue to the Territory. Many features of the Territory&#39;s administration we. ourselves support. But we are asking, in the light of what actually has happened, what the Government proposes to do now. </para>
          <para>I would like the Minister, in his reply, to clear up some of the very loose statements which have been made. He is reported as saying that the situation has not been reported properly in the Australian Press. I hope that the Minister spells out those matters which have not been reported properly in the Australian Press and that he tells us the Government&#39;s objectives and in what way he, his Department and the Administration have been misrepresented. A number of speakers from the Government side have spoken of stirrers and agitators who have gone there to stir up trouble. My friend the honourable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Corbett)</inline> rather suggested that I had been to Bougainville. Unfortunately, at this point of time I have not. I would have liked to go with my colleague, the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> but commitments prevented me from going at that time. </para>

I have known of the interest of the honourable member for Wills in the land rights of Aboriginals at Yirrkala and the rights of the Gurindji people and others. These mysterious statements about agitators and stirrers stirring up trouble have been made by a number of members on the Government side, but we want a clear statement from the Government as to whether these people who are stirring up trouble in the Territory are members of the House of Assembly, missionaries or whatever they might be. Let the Government and the Minister cut aside this cloak of ambiguity and anonymity that shrouds these people and clearly state who is causing trouble in Bougainville. </para>

          <para>None of us debates the importance of this development for the Territory. I know we would be at variance in this Parliament as to whether or not we should leave these people completely alone. Every responsible member of Parliament realises not only that we carry a responsibility to the people of the Territory of Papua and to the people of the Trust Territory of New Guinea, but also that in the years ahead we will carry a responsibility to the Australian taxpayer. too. The responsibility of advancing the Territory in the future is one that will become increasingly burdensome to this country. We meet this responsibility cheerfully because it is fairly small compared with the responsibility mat Great Britain and other countries have met in the past. Notwithstanding that, the Australian Labor Party, which advocates far greater development in the Territory and the establishment of a far more equitable society in Australia, realises probably more than does any other political Party represented in this Parliament the need for the economy of New Guinea to be placed on a stable and sound basis. </para>
          <para>So we are not opposed to this mining development, but one has to look at the realities of the situation. A great deal of Australian and overseas capital is being placed into this venture. A great deal of risk capital is involved. I think we would all commend the enterprise, the foresight and the courage of those entrepreneurs who are prepared to invest in an area like Bougainville - an area of possible political instability. I remember that when I came here in 1961, in the aftermath of the Foot report, people said that we would like to be in New Guinea for 30 years but that we may be there for only 7 years. Rather happily, our period of trusteeship seems to have extended. Notwithstanding any of those things, I think that most people who are placing a great deal of capital into an enter, prise there realise that they are taking certain risks. In New Guinea we operate under pressure from the United Nations and from international opinion quite outside the United Nations. Therefore our tenure of office in our capacity as a trustee is uncertain. In all those circumstances Conzinc Riotinto of Australia and Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd have shown some courage; they have displayed some enterprise. Thengreatest asset in the future for the investment they are making in the Territory is the goodwill of the people of the Territory. It is precisely this question that is the crux of the whole debate. We have had certain incidents in which the people of Bougainville have shown their resentment and opposition to the development &#39;that is taking place there. We have been told that the Administration over a period of some years has gone to a considerable amount of trouble to endeavour to explain to the people just what this development means to them, to their children and to the Territory in the years ahead. We know that the unity of this nation is not well established. We know that some of the problems in the Territory for which we have responsibility are akin to the problems that exist in Indonesia where the national motto is &#39;Unity in Diversity&#39;. We know that these problems exist. </para>
          <para>We do not want, in bringing this matter before the House, a statement of complacency. We do not want Government supporters to come forward and say: &#39;We have done our best. Everything we have done is all right, as time will show&#39;. We believe the unhappy incidents in Bougainville in recent times have been an indication that the actions which have been taken have not been good enough. What the Parliament is calling for tonight, and what the Opposition and the people of Australia are seeking is for the Minister to spell out in the reply he will make in a few minutes just what additional measures the Administration will take and what additional measures the Government will take. The situation is that all Australians are proud of what we have done in New Guinea. We have come to the cross roads in this situation. We have come to the cross roads in regard to an enterprise which economically and in other ways is of great importance to the future of the Territory and which is important, because of that, to the people of this country. We do not want the Government to be complacent, nor do we want the Minister to be complacent, because although we recognise what his administration and he himself have tried to do, the incidents that have happened there indicate that further action is necessary. If we are going to build in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, including Bougainville, the kind of society and the kind of nationhood we all hope will be built, the ball is back at the feet of the Government and the Minister. We now look forward to the Minister&#39;s reply. We hope it will be not a complacent one but one which shows the sense of responsibility which all Australians wish to see in our dealings with the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. </para>

            <para>- First of all, I would like to clear up a misrepresentation by the Opposition. It has been suggested that the Government endeavoured to avoid a debate on this matter by refusing to move that the paper be noted. We were forced to do this as a result of our negotiations with the Opposition. I had hoped to have a full and open debate on my statement because I believed that this House, and through this House the people of Australia, should be properly informed of everything that happened at Bougainville. Members of the Government Mining Committee have been there observing the situation. We have had most valuable contributions from them tonight which unfortunately were limited to 10 minutes. What on earth can be done in 10 minutes? They had most valuable tape recordings. The Opposition gave us to understand that it would refuse permission for me to make a statement and the arrangement was that we should not move that the paper be noted so that the Opposition could go on with this discussion of a matter of public importance. As far as I am concerned, this is a disgraceful situation. This was the arrangement. </para>

              <para>- It is. Here we are and we have to make do with this. The honourable member should get in touch with his  deputy  leader and he will find out that this was the arrangement. Anyway, we are doing well enough as it is and we do not need to go any further into that question. We wanted a full debate, and obviously on what has been stated by my colleagues who were up there and observed the situation for themselves it is easy to understand why the Opposition did not want to hear any more. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It has been suggested that loose statements have been made and that I have to follow up and gather them together. I made a very full statement covering all details and all questions before this debate began. 1 suggest to those honourable members who have not listened, or if they did listen do not appear to have taken it in, that they should read the statement. If the statement is published people will have an understanding of what has happened. We fear nothing. It is unfortunate when force has to be used; but here again it is the will of the people who have come into this operation and it is the will of the members of the House of Assembly. They made this decision in the interests of their country. </para>
          <para>Under the Budget introduced tonight, the contribution by the Australian taxpayers this year will be a little short of SI 20m. This is a grant, with no strings tied to it. It is for this Territory of two million people. It represents $60 per capita. No other country measures up to that sort of contribution or comes anywhere near it. Our objective is to bring these people to a point where they are able to run their own show. First of all, they have to have economic viability. They have to be reasonably independent from an economic point of view; otherwise, as I said in my statement today, independence is meaningless. </para>
          <para>In this primitive operation one is dealing with primitive customs and attitudes, particularly in relation to land - it is a very emotional issue even between native and native - which produce these difficult situations. Over recent weeks, I think, somewhere between ten and fifteen natives have lost their lives in inter-tribal disputes over land. These are the things that are happening all over the Territory. These are the things that one must look at in the context of the Territory. </para>
          <para>There is one point about which 1 am really concerned in regard to the attitude of the Opposition. It is the denigration of the House of Assembly. This is a very serious situation. The honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> indicated that the members of the House of Assembly did not know what they were doing. He said that they were remote and so on. Although he had no reason to answer my interjection, I interjected to clear up this situation. But he would not answer me. The tone of his speech was that the members of the House of Assembly are remote; they do not know what is happening on Bougainville; and the people feel that they are not represented. </para>
          <para>To support my statement, I point to the very terms of this matter of public importance raised by the Labor Party. They are so strange that they make me quite suspicious that members of the Labor Party did not want a full debate but that they felt duty bound to come up with something. What they have raised is a matter of public importance, which has the lowest status of any protest that can be made in this House, lt is not a motion of censure; it is not an urgency motion; it is a matter of public importance. It shows their attitude when they raise the matter in the lowest status in which a protest can be made. </para>

              <para>- They have. This is political expediency. We have heard valuable contributions from my colleagues on this side of the House, especially the members of the Government Members Mining Committee. They have pointed to the stirrers. The honourable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Mackay)</inline> said that the manager of a plantation went to a village and said he would supply arms for an uprising against the company and that he would fight alongside the villagers. This is the sort of thing that has happened. </para>

          <para>It has been reported to me that the honourable member for Wills advised the people not to sell their land. But here tonight he said that he only listened. Can any honourable member imagine the honourable member for Wills only listening? That would be absolutely impossible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I do not think I need add anything more. This is the weakest proposition that Opposi tion members have ever put, but I say again that I am concerned at their snubbing of the House of Assembly. </para>

When the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes)</inline> commenced his speech, he commented on the procedure that was to be adopted when he made a statement earlier today. I inform the House that the arrangement sought by the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Erwin),</inline> acting in his capacity as Leader of the House, was that he would not move that the House take note of the paper. I agreed on the understanding that the honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> would be allowed to proceed with the matter of public .importance that he wished to raise. I think the Minister ought to understand the position fully. </para>

              <para>Seasonal fluctuations are common in all prawn fisheries and the current decline in catches taken in the Gulf of Carpentaria is not unique. Research into prawn fisheries has taken place in various parts of the world without as yet providing fully satisfactory management techniques. The need for research into the prawn fisheries of northern Australia is fully recognised and steps have already been taken by the Government for an extensive research programme as soon as men and facilities can be arranged. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The Commonwealth/ Queensland surveyin the south-east of the Gulf that first located commercial quantities of prawns gave indicationsthat the continuing level of take was likely to be well above that obtained last year. The Government has already acted to rationalise this industry in order to avoid over-exploitation. The Commonwealth has limited the number of processing vessels licensed to operate in the Gulf of Carpentaria and limited the number of processing plants in the Northern Territory. In respect of Queensland, as indicated in my reply to Question 1360 by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the introduction of a licensing system for processing plants in that State has presented a number of legal problems which it is hoped can soon be resolved. I understand that the catch taken by foreign boats has been only a fraction of that taken by Australian boats. During 1969 the only fishing undertaken by foreign boats in the Gulf of Carpentaria was by boats attached to approved joint venture enterprises; special conditions have been imposed on such vessels. </para>

            <para>The information in this reply concerning the States has been provided through the co-operation of the State Directors-General of Education. </para>
            <para>A brief summary of the facilities made available by the Commonwealth and State Governments and independent organisations for the education and training of mentally and physically handicapped children in Australia is contained in  a  Bulletin released by my Department in October last year. Before setting out the reply in detail, 1 would like to point out that the State authorities have responded in different ways to the Honourable Member&#39;s question and it was found that to answer each part of the question specifically, from the information provided, would have resulted in misleading comparisons. In defining &#39;mentally retarded&#39; the States generally base their classification on intelligence quotients, but point out that intelligence quotients are only one of a number of criteria <inline font-style="italic">used</inline> in determining placement in special schools and classes. The percentage of the school population falling into particular intelligence groupings can be estimated and would be similar from State to State, but such estimates may not provide a reliable guide to the need for special forms of education. As indicated, intelligence quotients are only one factor and many children who are mildly handicapped are able to be educated satisfactorily in normal schools. </para>

                <para>The term &#39;eligible&#39; has been interpreted differently by the State authorities. To provide a meaningful answer it would be necessary to reach  a  uniform definition of the term. This was not found to be practicable within the context of the Honourable Member&#39;s question. However, the following comments for some States may supplement the information given in answers to other parts of this question, particularly (5): </para>

            <para>Victoria - The total known eligibility is 4,319. South Australia - Mentally retarded children are brought to the notice of the South Australian Education Department by regular annual surveys or they are referred by medical practitioners and parents. The annual increase is approximately 100 students. </para>
            <para>Although the Education Department endeavours to place all eligible mentally retarded children in special schools, it may be that the placements are slightly less than the actual number of eligible children. Despite the efforts of the Department, the exact number of children cannot be accurately ascertained, as a few parents do not accept the possibility of schooling for their children. </para>
            <para>Western Australia - A distinction is made between educable mentally retarded children who are capable of managing a modified school course relating closely to adult needs and likely to manage  a  routine job in the open labour market, if special placement help is given on leaving school between15 and 16 years of age and trainable mentally retarded children. </para>
            <para>The total numbers eligible for admission to a special school are 5,250 educable and 900 trainable. </para>
            <para>Tasmania- Only those mentally retarded children whose intellectual handicaps are ascertained as being of such complexity and severity as to render them incapable of profiting from attendance at a special school for moderately mentally retarded children would be considered ineligible for admission to school. Of these, a number attend the Health Department&#39;s Day Centre in Hobart and others have been hospitalised. </para>

              <para>and (2) The grades of income used in Schedule 1.1 of Taxation Statistics 1966-67&#39; were not the same as those used in the tabulations of statistics for some earlier years.

              <para>It is not possible to derive figures for Britain, the United States of America and Canada which are fully comparable with those for Australia. For one thing there are difficulties in the way of determining what level of income in one country would be comparable with a given level of income in another country. Because of differences in income distributions and in levels of real income it cannot be assumed that incomes on the basis of current rates of exchange are in fact comparable. Further, while statutory rates of tax apply to taxable incomes the concept of what constitutes taxable income differs from country to country. The choice of the tax unit, whether the individual or the married couple, is also relevant in this context. In addition, deductions which are allowed from actual income to arrive at taxable income, such as for dependants, medical expenses, etc., vary in both nature and amounts. Apart from these and other complications, account needs to be taken of differences in the roles played by governments, not just as regards their importance in the economy in an aggregate sense, but also in terms of the nature of Government expenditurethat is, what the taxpayer gets in return for the taxes he pays. </para>

              <para>No precise figure can be given with respect to proved reserves of titanium in Australia. Reserve figures of rutile and ilmenite (the principal ores of titanium) are those collated from data made available by operating companies, and as such are probably equivalent to measured and indicated reserves. </para>

            <item label="(b)">
              <para>Rutile (96% Ti02). Reserves of rutile based on a cut-off grade of 0.25% rutile in the ground, are estimated to be about 6 million tons. Reserves are virtually confined to the mineral sand deposits of the east coast. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Ilmenite (55%Ti02). Ilmenite reserves in Western Australia are estimated to be about15 million tons. In addition, extensive deposits of ilmenite are known to occ along the central Queensland coast and on the offshore islands viz. Fraser and Curtis Islands. If these deposits are proved to be economic, overall ilmenite reserves would be almost doubled. </para>

              <para>Companies which apply for subsidy under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act 1959-1969 for drilling operations and geophysical surveys (there is no subsidy for geological investigations) are required under the provisions of the General Conditions to the Agreement to submit a statement certified by the Operator&#39;s auditors showing in detail the costs incurred. The General Conditions form part of the Agreement between the Commonwealth and the Operator in all subsidised operations and these requirements are provided for under section 9 of the Act. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The General Conditions provide for inclusion in the allowable costs, supervision in the field and the processing, interpretation and presentation of the results of the operation in report form. Geologists, geophysicists and petroleum engineers employed by the Operator are involved in these activities and their salaries and other costs associated with their part in the operation may be included in the cost statement. </para>

          </list>
          <para>Details of these salaries are provided by the applicants for subsidy on a confidential basis. In the case of contractors, who also .employ scientists, the salaries are included in the contract charges and are not specified separately. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>In calculating subsidy the Commonwealth policy is te allow the salary paid by the operating company provided that it does not exceed the rate charged by consultants in the same profession. </para>

            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Although detailed cost estimates may be included in the applications for subsidy and are available in the final cost statements these figures have always been considered strictly confidential. Only the total cost of an operation is available for release. I believe it would be unwise to release details of company personnel salaries as it would constitute a breach of trust. Currently the rates for consultants are of the order of $100 per day but they may range above or below this figure. Rates payable to company geologists, geophysicists and petroleum engineers in subsidised surveys range from $30 to $108 per day. For the calculation of subsidy payments $100 is the maximum rate allowed at the present time. </para>

          <para>It is not possible to compare realistically the rates paid to company personnel and. Bureau scientists because the conditions and work requirements of the two groups are rarely comparable. </para>

            <para>The last formal meeting of Commonwealth and Suite Ministers and officials concerned with northern development was held at Port Hedland on 9th April 1969. Previous formal meetings &#34;of Ministers, with officials also present, were held in Canberra on 7th May 1964 and 27th August 1965 and in Brisbane on 11th July 1967. Between these meetings continuity has been maintained as necessary by direct contact between myself and the appropriate Commonwealth and/or State Ministers. </para>

These three officers together with the officers from the Commonwealth concerned with the Northern Territory have met formally on one occasion in Canberra on 11th November 1965. Further separate formal meetings of officials have not been found necessary as these officials are in continuous contact on northern development matters. </para>

Salaries of officers appointed or promoted to positions covered by the Determination on or after the date of effect of the Determination were adjusted by applying the normal rules for salary on appointment or promotion as if the new salary scale had in fact been in existence at the time of their appointment or promotion. </para>
          <para>Determinations having retrospective effect are consistently applied by the Board in this manner.

The request came from the Federation of Catholic Parents and Friends&#39; Associations. In the course of my reply of 26th February 1969, which was subsequently made public, I wrote - </para>
          <para>I note your view that despite the efforts of your Government to assist independent schools, more needs to be done if the non-Government sector of our dual system of education is to be maintained at a desirable standard. You referred to a noticeable drift of Roman Catholic children to Government schools. In the light of these trends, you asked me to consider supplementing the assistance which the States are able to provide from their own resources. </para>
          <para>I share your view that the financial problems of independent schools are important and of concern to all Australian governments. For its part, the Commonwealth Government appreciates the significant role played by independent schools in the education of young Australians and both by policy pronouncement and by programmes introduced, has demonstrated its willingness to provide direct assistance to these schools .... </para>
          <para>My colleagues and I are well aware of the particular problems with the running costs of independent schools and of the difficulties which many of them are experiencing in obtaining sufficient teachers and in paying them reasonable salaries having regard to salaries in Government schools. We have received representations from the Federal Catholic Schools Committee and have had discussions with members of that Committee. As a consequence we have undertaken to look carefully into ways in which the Commonwealth might assist these schools further as part of its policy of assisting both Government and independent school authorities to improve the quality of Australian education. However, anything the Commonwealth were to do would have significant budgetary implications and therefore must be considered with that aspect well in mind. The same situation applies to the specific requests for Commonwealth assistance contained in the resolution conveyed to you by the Federation of Catholic Parents and Citizens Associations. </para>
          <para>We will be considering the problems of independent schools further in the coming months and will bear in mind the support you have registered for some additional Commonwealth contribution to supplement what the States are now doing&#39;. </para>

            <para>I have been advised that at present quotas actually taken up under the Australian system of tariff preferences for developing countries have fallen well short of the total concessions available. For the quota period January-June 1969, the available total was $24.1 million: of this, quotas actually taken up by importers amounted to $8.6 million. There is no one general reason for the shortfall. Lack of demand could be a factor. However, every concession in the schedule has been established as a result of requests by developing countries themselves, by Australian importers, or by exporters of the goods concerned. In many cases the requests might well be based on prospects for future growth in demand rather than any large-scale current demand. Again, the success of developing countries in exploiting the quotas depends on the energy and expertise with which they attempt it, and different countries have naturally bad differing degrees of success. </para>

Further extensions to the schedule are continually being examined. </para>

              <para>The value of official external aid provided by the Government depends upon the resources available to the Government and the pressure of other demands on those resources. In deciding what proportion of its funds should be allocated to external aid, the Government must take into account all demands upon its funds as well as the requests of the governments of the less developed countries for economic assistance from Australia. The Government is sympathetic to the needs of developing countries for more external assistance and the rapid growth in Australia&#39;s aid expenditures over recent years testifies to this. Australia has supported resolutions on the aid volume target in various international bodies and has been able to do so because the target, as at present defined, includes the clause &#39;. . . having regard to the special position of those countries which arc net importers of capital&#39;. But the government has reservations about the value of setting arbitrary statistical targets for aid-giving which pay no heed to the form and quality of the assistance that is provided or the use to which il is put, and which do not take account of the fact that, just as the aid needs of developing countries might vary from time to time, so the ability of donor countries to provide aid can be affected by changing economic circumstances. </para>

The fact that defence expenditure has increased at an even faster rate since 1963-64 reflects the Government&#39;s assessment of the needs of defence over this period. </para>

              <para>, (3), (4). The Government has imposed no restrictions on Australian Commanders in Vietnam which might inhibit tactical freedom of action. Broad directions for the conduct of operations by Australian forces in Vietnam are contained in a directive issued by the Australian Government. This directive gives the. Commander Australian Force Vietnam (COMAFV) overall command of units and personnel of theRAN, Australian Army, and RAAF assigned to him for duty in Vietnam, and charges him with the responsibility for their overall conduct and activities including their safety and well being. The directive also defines the approved locations, roles and employment of the respective elements of the force and the areas in which they may be employed, as agreed with the Republic of Vietnam and United Slates Authorities. Operational control of each element of the Australian force is assigned to the appropriate United States Naval, Army, or Air Force Commander who allocates the tasks or missions to the Australian commander concerned. In the case of the Army, the Australian Task Force Commander having been allocated tasks has complete freedom within his allotted area of operations for the employment of his force as the tactical situation dictates. There are no restrictions placed by the Government which would binder him in any way in this regard. </para>

              <para>to (3) lt is firm Government policy to ensure, to the extent possible, that no man should suffer avoidable hardship or restriction because of his national service liability. There are, for example, comprehensive provisions in the National Service Act and the Defence (Re-establishment) Act, binding on all employers, which afford protection to a national service registrant in relation to his existing employment and provide for his rehabilitation and re-instatement in employment after service. Particularly relevant is the provision that an employer may not penalise or prejudice an employee in any way, including by dismissal from his employment, for the reason (hat he is or may become liable to render national service. Any apparent breach which is brought to the notice of my Department is investigated promptly and thoroughly and pursued to finality. In any proceedings the burden is upon the employer to prove that an employee proved to have been penalised or prejudiced in his employment was so penalised or prejudiced for a reason other than national service. Experience has been that employers generally are recognising and honouring their obligations. Very few cases of alleged discrimination have been brought to notice and none has resulted in prosecution action. </para>

          </list>
          <para>Where a man is employed under a contract of apprenticeship it is binding only for the period covered by the indentures and it is for the employer to decide whether to continue employment beyond that period. A number of employers have a long standing practice of nol retaining all their apprentices when they become journeymen; some wish their tradesmen to have had wider experience than in their own organisation, others train apprentices in excess of their own requirements as a contribution to industry&#39;s skilled work force. </para>
          <para>The arrangements for the call-up of apprentices liable for national service were determined only after a careful examination of all relevant factors, including trade training, employment and reestablishment after service. They are granted deferment of call-up to enable them to complete their apprenticeships and are medically examined shortly before reaching that stage so that if passed fit they can be included in the first following Army intake. Thus the interval between attaining journeyman status and enlistment in the Army is kept to the minimum and, as I have indicated, employment problems during that period do not normally arise. </para>
          <para>The honourable member may be assured that in all cases where an employment problem is brought to notice, my Department not only investigates the possibility of a breach of the law but endeavours, through the Commonwealth Employment Service, to place the registrant concerned in suitable employment. </para>

            <para>The Chief Film Censor has not recommended an &#39;X&#39; certificate system for films in his annual reports. </para>
            <para>Under current Commonwealth legislation the Film Censorship Board has no authority to apply classifications to films for theatrical use. However, by virtue of the provisions of the Censorship of Films Acts of Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania and agreement between these States and the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Fibs Censorship Board does impose classifications. </para>
            <para>At a conference in Hobart in January 1968, State Ministers rejected a proposal by the  President  of the Australian Council for Children&#39;s Films and Television that an &#39;X&#39; type certificate be incorporated in the State systems of film classification. </para>
            <para>Should the States reverse this decision the Commonwealth, through the Film Censorship Board, would have no objection to applying an &#39;X&#39; certificate classification. </para>
