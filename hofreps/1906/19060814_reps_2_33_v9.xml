Has he noticed that the correction has. been arrived at by adding to the population of Victoria the percentage which has hitherto been deducted for unrecorded departures, and that no such addition has been made to the populations of the other States? Will he promise before using any statistics such as those which the Statistician of Victoria has prepared on this new basis to see that the calculations made in respect to all the States are on the same footing? . </para>

                        <para>- I do not know why the figures referred to should be used by the Commonwealth. I saw it stated in this morning's newspaper thai: certain figures have been prepared, and reference was made to another set, appearing in an earlier issue, which I have not yet seen. I shall look into the matter, but can assure the honorable member that figures used for Commonwealth purposes will be prepared on an absolutely uniform basis. So far, only such figures have been used as may be used according to the definite rules laid down by the Representation Act, and no figures will be used by the Department in this connexion unless they are authorized by law. </para>

                <para class="block">In view of the interest taken in this question in both Houses, as shown by the motions which have been tabled this session, I wish to mention a few facts, although the papers speak for themselves. The proclamation of the Papua Act will take effect on the 1st September. On that date there will be added to the Executive Council three representatives of the settlers - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Whitten, storekeeper, of Samarai; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederic</inline> Weekley, miner, of Woodlark Island ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Little, miner, of the Northern Division. Our officials in Papua will retain their positions pending the report of the Royal Commission. If we had been able to secure the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McGregor, a veteran administrator in tropical countries, possessed of marked ability, long experience, and special knowledge of Papua, this step might not have been necessary ; but, in view of the facts set out in the papers, and, especially as the present Administrator has asked for . an inquiry into his administration, no other course is open to us. The Commission will consist of Colonel J. A. K. Mackay, CB., M.L.C., ' of New South Wales, formerly Vice-President of the Executive Council of the State, and representative of the Government in the Legislative Council ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> E. Parry Okeden, I.S.O., formerly Principal UnderSecretary and  Commissioner  of Police, Queensland ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> E. Herbert, Government Resident and Judge of the Northern Territory. These gentlemen are charged with the task of inquiring into, and reporting before the end of the year, upon the best method of improving the conditions of settlement iri Papua, and of recommending any changes in its Administration they may think necessary. Having received that report. I trust that we shall be in a position to place the affairs of the Territory, upon a business footing, and provide for the best utilization of a country which, from the time of its annexation, has had to contend with a whole series of misfortunes and difficulties which are being gradually surmounted.. </para>

                        <para>- Iwish <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make a short explanation with reference to the proposals relating to the import and Excise duties on spirits. I need scarcely say that I have been deluged with letters from various persons, most of whom wish that certain alterations shall be made in the proposals now before the Committee. As I stated previously, the proposals embody the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, with certain modifications. I also mentioned that the duties proposed by the Tariff Commission had been increased, in order to prevent a loss of revenue. An estimate has been prepared by the officers of the Customs Department, who believe that if the duties were altered in the manner suggested by the Com miss don, 204,000 gallons of imported spirits would be displaced by spirits of local production, and that£60,000 would thus be lost to the revenue. They estimate, further, that a. loss of £14,000 per annum would result from making a rebate of duty in respect to spirits under proof strength. In connexion with spirits for fortifying wine, there would be a reduction of revenue amounting to£6,500, the drawback allowed upon spirit used in wine afterwards exported would amount to £4,000, and the abolition of the duty on methylated spirits would involve a loss of £6, 000. It is estimated that the total loss of revenue would amount to , £90,500, and that would be a very serious matter. I should have preferred to accept the recommendations of the Commission, with some slight modifications, but the Treasurer naturally objects to the loss of revenue that would be involved. It is a great pity that the Treasurer cannot get along without any revenue, but he is deserving of every credit for endeavoring to maintain the returns;, so that he may be able to hand over to the States as large a sum as possible. The object of increasing the duty upon imported spirits from 14s., as recommended by the Commission, to 15s., is to obviate any loss of revenue. Honorable members will notice that the second paragraph, under the head of " Excise duties, " reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">Then comes the second proposal, under which a duty of 12s. per proof gallon is levied upon brandy which is distilled partly from .grape wine and partly from other materials, and which contains not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. I am urged that to make the comparison complete the duty of 12s. per proof gallon ought to be increased to 14s., because three-fourths of the brandy which is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials is composed chiefly of spirit made from molasses. That is an inferior spirit, and its presence has the effect of making the whole of the brandy thus distilled inferior to brandy which is distilled wholly from pure wine spirit. </para>

Further, the second proposal relating to excise offers an inducement to distillers to use spirit other than that which is distilled wholly from grape wine, because it can- be produced for about is. 6d. per gallon, whereas the better and the purer spirit cannot be produced for less than 3s. 6d. per gallon. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that the honorable member is referring to a recent report from the United States, where it is stated that spirit from molasses is being produced for 4d. per .gallon, and used for purposes other than human consumption. However, I am not prepared to deal with that matter at the present time. I mention it because I wish it to be thoroughly ventilated. It is a matter of very great importance that the public should be supplied with pure spirit, and it is the public interest which I regard as paramount in this connexion. Within the last few days I have had an opportunity of visiting various distilleries in South Australia, and I must say that- I have gained a very great deal of knowledge in regard to this particular question. Upon the present occasion I am simply giving the facts as they present themselves to my mind. Before we finally dispose of these resolutions, I think it will probably be found that it is advisable to make some variation in the duties proposed. That is why I emphasize the fact that the Government have submitted these resolutions in their present form, because they embody the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. They were arrived at upon the evidence of officers - I cannot give the testimony of each officer - in the Department of Trade and Customs. Those officers were: - Messrs. H. D. Brown, Inspector of Excise, New South Wales; T. H. Norrie, Analytical Chemist, Customs Department, Sydney; W. E. Burrell, Senior Inspector of Excise, Queensland ; E. P. Clarke, Senior Inspector of Excise, South Australia; P. Awcock, Inspector of Excise and Distilleries, Western Australia. There were other outside witnesses such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> W. Knox, general manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Sydney - there is no doubt that he is interested in the production of spirit from molasses - <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fiaschi,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> B. Holmes. In Victoria, the following gentlemen gave evidence: - Messrs. H. Brind, distiller, Warrenheip ; S. Joshua, managing director of Joshua Brothers Proprietary Limited, Melbourne; J. M. Joshua, C. P. Preston, Australian Distillery Company, South Melbourne; H. A. Preston, distiller, Abbotsford; and W. P. Wilkinson, Government Analyst for the State of Victoria. These were the principal witnesses who gave evidence before the Commission. After having analyzed their testimony very thoroughly during the past few days, it seems to me that the recommendations of the Commission are based upon, I will not say a mistake, but upon a miscalculation. But there is no doubt of one thing, namely, that the Treasurer cannot afford to lose all the revenue that would be sacrificed if we adopted their recommendations. Therefore the Government are compelled to submit proposals which otherwise they would not have made. I hope that honorable members - many of whom have particular knowledge of this question - will give this matter their very close attention. This morning I have been in consultation with the Comptroller-General, who has gone through these resolutions, and he is now framing certain alterations which he thinks ought to be made in them. These I hope to have in my possession before the debate closes. </para>

                        <para>- - I congratulate the Minister of Trade and Customs upon having brought down a set of proposals in which "he does not believe, and upon having thrown them on the table in much the same way as a man throws a bone to his dog. I have not the slightest intention of commencing to gnaw that bone myself. I prefer to wait until the Minister has brought down his mature and definite proposals, so that honorable members may discuss something of a tangible character. I have certainly never known a Minister who was engaged in formulating proposals as important as these are - they affect our revenue to the extent of millions sterling, so far as their total yield is concerned - to frankly tell the Committee that he has no definite propositions to submit, and to ask honorable members in the meantime to discuss something before the Chamber, but to which his own knowledge led him to believe he could not subscribe. That is an unheard-of position of affairs, and one that I venture to say will find no parallel in any of our State political arenas in connexion with proposals made by any of our State Ministries. </para>

The position is that the Minister, who is responsible for the conduct of his own Department, and who is the custodian of the Customs and Excise revenues of the Commonwealth, should know what he ought to do under a given set of circumstances. After having received the mature opinions of the Tariff Commission, which have spent many anxious months in the consideration of these matters, he ought to have made up his mind as to what would be his final attitude in regard to them. </para>

                            <para>- It appears to me that the trouble of which the Minister speaks has only arisen since his visit to South Australia. May be if he paid a visit to New South Wales in connexion with this matter his opinion might be again varied. I hope, at all events, that the further proposals will not be like the lame, silly speech which the honorable gentleman made at Adelaide on Saturday night last. Perhaps it was because his mind was preoccupied with these more important matters that he then delivered the disjointed speech which we read in the newspapers. </para>

                            <para>- It has, since, among other' statements which the honorable gentleman made at the meeting in question, was the assertion that he believed in protection, and not in Excise duties. Are we to understand that when he spoke in that way he was referring to the spirit duties? I should say that he will have to believe in Excise duties in relation to spirits, whether or not he likes them in connexion with other matters. But I am not going to discuss this Question at the present stage; I prefer to wait until the Minister brings down his definite proposals. </para>

                            <para>- I am not particularly concerned in that regard. I point out that the Minister now seems to be in a most casual mood. He appears to be proceeding in the most leisurely way in regard to these matters, which were at one time said to be of pressing urgency and importance. . We have heard times out of number of the way in which our Australian distillers have been and are being punished by our mangling and strangling Tariff. It seems now, however, that the nearer we approach the general election the less urgency there is in relation to Tariff questions. Here we have another illustration of this fact. The Minister of Trade and Customs is in the most casual and leisurely mood, and does not care whether or not he proceeds with the consideration of these matters. If he cares nothing about them, I fail to see why the Opposition should trouble very much. I rose only to protest against the Minister's method of proceeding with important matters, since he has indicated to the Committee that he has another set of proposals which may radically differ from those now before us, and which he will bring down on a subsequent date. </para>

At any rate, his tentative, timid attitude serves only to make the position more serious. Other honorable members may proceed, if they desire to do so, to discuss these questions, but I propose to wait until the Minister comes down with matured and connected propositions which the Government are able to stand by - subject, of course, to reasonable discussion in Committee - in other words, until Ministers have finally made up their minds as to what they propose to do with regard to the spirit duties. </para>

As a member of the Commission, I can give the Committee an assurance on behalf of my brother members and myself that we have no desire to thresh out this question any further than we have done. </para>

                            <para>- We have done our duty to the best of our ability, and in the light of the information which we have gathered from all parts of Australia. We have heard all sides and every possible phase of this great and important question. Our conclusions are based, not upon any personal predeliction, sympathy, or tendency, but strictly upon the evidence- given on oath before us. They have been arrived at after very careful, thoughtful discussion and consideration, and we have done our very best. If they do not please the Minister or the Committee, or the1 country, we are very sorry, but we cannot help it. It is not my desire to occupy the time of the Committee to any extent in. appearing before it in the capacity of an advocate or pleader on behalf of the report of the Commission. That report speaks for itself, and I hope honorable members will not think that I or my honorable colleagues desire, whilst giving explanations of it, to appear in the character of partisans or advocates. We are quite prepared to listen to arguments or to offer explanations ; in the last resort, of course, the consideration and determination of details, depends upon the Committee. I should like to say, however, that it would be rather unsatisfactory to the members of the Commission who have been -investigating and considering this question for upwards of fifteen months if the conclusions which they have reduced to writing and submitted to Parliament were lightly or carelessly thrown .aside in response to clamouring letters in the press, to clamouring deputations to the Minister, or to representations made to him, and, it may be, to other honorable members., by those who are not quite satisfied with some of the details of the report. It will not be satisfactory to us, and I do not think that justice will be done to the great cause, if honorable members allow themselves to be lightly or hastily influenced by letters in the press or communications addressed directly to them, or if our deliberations be disregarded in favour of suggestions made either by letter or in the course of an interview. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The members of the Commission are absolutely disinterested, but would like the Committee to do them the favour of considering their report and reading the evidence upon which it is based, before they denounce their work and reject it as useless. I was rather sorry to hear the Minister launch the debate this afternoon in such a light-hearted way, to hear the almost disparaging terms in which he referred to the report of the Commission, and to notice the way in which he seemed to brush aside some of its recommendations. No doubt those remarks would, to some extent, prejudice the case at the very outset ; but I point out to the Minister that he, at any rate, cannot claim to have given this subject, which is, to some extent, scientific and technical in many of its branches and phases, the same amount of consideration and thought that members of the Tariff Commission have given to it over a long period of time. None of their conclusions are hasty ; none, I think, can be regarded as conclusions based on anything like party considerations. As honorable members well know, these are the considered conclusions of both parties - both sides of the House - in fact, all round the House. The Labour Party and the Free-trade Party are both well and ably represented on the Commission, and I need not say anything in regard to the Protectionist Party. All classes and all sections of the House are represented, and every one has had a fair hearing; so that it would be very unfair to this great work if honorable members were to allow themselves to be deluded by fugitive correspondence and letters in the press. In this great question, as in all other great questions, there are several aspects to be considered. Many of these aspects are local ; there is a South Australian aspect, and also a Victorian and a New South Wales aspect. </para>

                            <para>- So far as the Tariff Commission is concerned, we have endeavoured to view everything from an Australian stand-point, and, so far as we could, to be fair, and do justice all round ; and it may be that there is complaint for the reason that we have not been able to please everybody. It is impossible to please everybody, and those who attempt to do so must fail. So far as Joshua Brothers are concerned, I do not think that they are satisfied, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> was, I believe, the first to complain. I have seen him buzzing about the precincts of the House for a considerable time past, and I know that he has been writing letters on this subject ; indeed, from what I can hear, he is one of the most dissatisfied. At any rate, he sent letters to me expressing dissatisfaction ; and the fact that there is dissatisfaction all round may lead honorable members to the conclusion that there are many aspects to be considered, and that, after all, it is not what Messrs. Joshua or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penfold</inline> may think that has to be taken into account, but what this House thinks on the whole question, after giving due attention to all its phases. I do not propose at this stage to enter into the details of the scheme submitted, because I think that would be anticipating many stages through which we have vet to pass. But, with the permission of honorable members, I shall, at various stages of the discussion, say a few words on particular branches of the question. It would be of no use to cover the whole ground at the present stage, and to deal with a lot of technical matters which might be lost sight of when we come to consider the question in detail. But, before passing away from a few general observations. I should like to quote one or two letters I have received - I suppose other honorable members have also received them - giving a general idea of the position of the distilling industry in Australia in relation to the reports of the Tariff Commission. Messrs. Joshua Brothers, in a letter dated 7th July, say : - </para>

                        <para>The report, as a whole, is highly satisfactory to us, and we think also that it is of great satisfaction to Australian distillers generally. What we regard as flaws in it are quite subsidiary, but might, nevertheless, prove disastrous if allowed to go unchallenged. We desire to point out that our letter of 21st February, which you have been good enough to print as an appendix to the report, sets forth that our malt whisky and wine brandy have been distilled up to a maximum strength of 35 o.p. Spirits required to blend with these, in order to make the popular tasting liquors-, require to be distilled up to a higher strength. </para>

                            <para>- I am only referring to the result of the piecemeal manner in which the report was submitted. I know of no report of a Royal Commission having been similarly treated, namely, the body of the report separated from the recommendations - the body of the report submitted at one stage, and the recommendations submitted at another stage, and both afterwards forming two separate parliamentary documents. That was hardly fair to the Royal Commission, and no wonder misapprehension arose, as in the case of Messrs. Joshua Brothers, who admit that they were misled by the fragmentary manner in which the reports were circulated. </para>

                        <para>I have the honour and pleasure of saying that the best thanks of the distillers and the general public are due to. you and the members of the Commission for your recommendations, and, if passed by Parliament, Australia will have the most scientific Tariff in the world with regard to spirits. Britain and France are both demanding such a one at the present time. It would have the threefold incidence of protection - against the world's cheap and inferior spirits - for the local distiller who wishes to make a good article, as against the one who may not ; and, lastly, for the consumers, in that they will know what they are getting, and have a better article cheapened to them by way of difference of duty. I particularly desire to emphasize the fact that neither whisky for blending purposes, pure malt whisky, nor grape brandy, should be distilled above 40 degrees overproof, and all distillation should be through pot-stills only. In conclusion, I trust that Parliament will see fit to indorse your recommendations by passing them into law as nearly intact as is possible. </para>

These matters of detail are fairly open to consideration. They are matters upon which, even members of the Commission have no very pronounced views. Whether distillation should be at an alcoholic strength of 35 per cent, or 45 per cent, over-proof is not a vital question, but it is vital that unless these spirits are distilled at a certain defined strength over-proof, they shall not receive the preference and advantages which we have recommended. </para>

                            <para>- That is but one of the immense number of details involved in the scheme. I shall deal with it later on, but I am now giving an explanation of some of the ' leading points at issue. I should like to say that the 'general principle of the scheme of Excise duties on spirits recommended bv the Commission is that certain concessions and advantages should be granted to spirits of Australian origin, distilled under the supervision of the Excise authorities, and complying with certain Excise conditions. Apart from any question of free-trade or protection, the members of the Commission reasoned the matter out in this way : If we were to recommend Parliament to impose certain stringent conditions for the production of spirits, certain improvements in production by pot still, patent still, or other methods, a certain strength of production, a certain time for maturing, and the use of certain materials, we could fairly recommend </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Parliament to grant concessions and advantages to the manufacturers who produced spirits in compliance with those conditions. That is the basic principle of the whole scheme. We therefore proposed a scheme of Excise duties upon spirits based upon the following principles of classification : - First, with respect to materials of origin, such as grape wine brandy, barley malt whisky, blended brandy, blended whisky, rum from molasses, gin from barley malt or other grain, and, finally, spirits, <inline font-style="italic">n.e.i.</inline> These ave the materials of origin indicated in the Commissions report, and with reference to them, it was felt that there might be, instead of a uniform Excise duty, a graduated duty, because it was. thought that a spirit produced from barley malt or grape wine at a cost of from 3s. to 4s. per gallon should not bear the same Excise duty as a cheap spirit produced at a cost of only is. per gallon. Hence the graduation of the duties recommended was based to a large extent upon the cost of production. </para>

The material of origin was the first consideration, the second consideration was the method of distillation and- the initial alcoholic strength. The third was detention in bond for a specified period in order to secure age and maturity. The fourth was compliance with the directions of the excise officers and strict excise supervision, and, finally, the coping stone of the whole scheme was that no spirit should be entitled to the proposed differential advantages and concessions, unless they were certified by a Commonwealth analyst to comply with the conditions named, were good and true to name, and produced in accordance with the regulations. Honorable members will see at a glance that, even though we may not have been successful, we, at any rate, endeavoured to base our scheme of classification on something like logical and reasonable grounds.

Then I must say that the honorable gentleman has hardly grasped- the scheme yet, and it might have been wise and prudent on his part to take a little more time to consider it before he came down to denounce it, and to say something so disparaging concerning it as to be calculated to destroy it. If the Minister begins in this way, in all probability the scheme might as well be thrown into the waste-paper basket, unless honorable members generally rise to the occasion, take the matter into their own hands, and work out the problem for themselves, apart from the Minister's advice.

                            <para>- What is meant is, that it is to be certified by a Commonwealth analyst to be true to name,- and true in respect of compliance with the 1 statutory provision. Everything in that item is based upon evidence given on oath before the Commission, and that is the best specification for the production of a true brandy that we were able to devise. It might be called a scientific stipulation as to the mode in which it is to be made in order to secure the preference of 4s. If the distillers comply with those conditions and requisites, they are to get that preference, but not otherwise. The next point is a blended brandy, and I believe it is in connexion with the blending that the whole controversy has arisen. I admit that on this question, there was a regular battle before the Commission between practically two great parties. One contended for a brandy which is to be composed of grape wine spirit exclusively - that is, without the introduction of any other kind of spirit - while the other party contended that whilst it was true that originally the true brandy was a spirit distilled from grape wine, in the course of time another kind known as the brandy of commerce came into use, and that the base of that brandy is grape wine spirit with which has been mixed a blending spirit composed of, or derived from, other material such as grain, potatoes, rice, or molasses. The whole contention is as to whether we are to recognise a blended brandy - the brandy of commerce - or as to whether there is to be a brandy known only as grape wine brandy. </para>

Would you describe genuine brandy as a brandy made from a spirit distilled from grapes? - It is described in that way by some lexicographers; but as a fact there is very little brandy of that description in the world. I have before me the figures showing the production of France. 877. What would you describe as a good brandy fit for human consumption? - I should say a blended brandy, such as is understood <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the trade as the brandy of commerce. 878. But have you not just told us that the brandy of commerce may mean a brandy which is the product of distillation from potatoes, beet,, and other things? - It could be. 879. What is the blend that you speak of a» a good, wholesome spirit? - Wine spirit with  grain spirit, or malt spirit, or sugar spirit. Blended together, as made in France. </para>

                    <para class="block">In reply to question 882 he gave figures - which were challenged at first, but which were confirmed afterwards as absolutely true - as to the production cf brandy in France. He gave statistics showing that in a period of eleven years, the average quantity of brandy produced from grape wine was 2,500,000 gallons, and yet. in that period, France, he went on to prove, purported to manufacture, consume, and export, 45,000,000 gallons, the obvious inference being that the 45,000,000 gallons of so-called brandy was a blended brandy, and could not possibly have been made exclusively from grape wine, because only 2,500,000 gallons of grape wine spirit were produced annually in all France. That is all the 'evidence I shall quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saul</inline> Joshua, as some honorable members seem to think that he is interested. T shall now quote from the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daniel</inline> Ferguson, a disinterested witness, who is Chief Inspector of Distilleries in Victoria, and a thorough expert. He did not take sides between the distillers. In reply to the honorable member for Perth, he gave the following evidence: - 2106. Is wine invariably used for the production of brandy? - They have first of all to use wine. 2107. Is any brandy made in Victoria from material other than wine? - The foundation of brandy is grape spirit, but other spirit may be added to it. </para>

                            <para>- It could . be higher than 25 per cent., but that is the minimum. 2108. Why? - For reasons affecting the article, and to give the brandy a distinctive taste. The public do not like a pure grape brandy, because there is too much of the wine taste in it. Hence the distillers try to produce an article which will -suit the public taste. 2109. At one time, when people drank brandy, they drank what was undoubtedly the product of the grape? - They may have done that years ago. 2110. Is the taste for grape brandy modified with other spirit a correct taste? - That is for «he public to decide. If I wanted brandy purely as a beverage, I would prefer that to which a little spirit had been added ; but if, I wanted it purely as a medicine, I would desire pure wine brandy. </para>

                            <para>- A little white, or highly-rectified, spirit. The next witness to whose evidence I invite attention in justification of this differentiation is Henry Duncan Brown, the Chief Distillery Officer in New South Wales, a very able and disinterested man. His evidence is as follows : - 18662. Do you think that the name " brandy " should be restricted to spirits produced from grape-wine, or grape materials? - There is a great difference of opinion on that subject. For my own part, T do not think that a mixture of pure grape-spirit - that is, brandy, as some wish it to be called - with silent spirit would be unwholesome. I doubt very much whether such a mixture would not be better for drinking purposes than is a pure grape brandy. 18663. Such a mixture might be wholesome, but it would not be brandy? - That is so. 18664. Should it not be called by its true name - a blend ? - Yes ; but the difficulty is that brandy can be imported without any restriction. 18665. Certainly, but the same system would have to be applied all round? - That is where the difficulty would arise. 18666. Could not such a provision be applied to the imported article? - No; for a reason that I shall explain. If a blend consisting of a pure grape spirit, and a silent were imported, an analyst would not be able to say what it contained. He would only find spirits derived from grape brandy. If an imported article consisted of a blending of potato spirit and pure grape spirit, and were labelled " Pure grape brandy," the analyst would not be able to detect the fraud. </para>

                    <para class="block">He pointed out that, while true brandy is produced from grape wine, what is called a blended brandy has come into use, but he would confine the term brandy to brandy made from grape wine spirit, labelling the mixed spirit known as blended brandy in such a way that the public would be aware that in purchasing it they were buying, not true brandy, but a blend. I will quote another short passage from his evidence - 18994. Do you think it would be right to require that brandy shall not be mixed with alcohol derived from any other source than grape wine? - I do not see any objection to the blending of brandy with silent spirit, and calling it a commercial brandy. 18995. Do vo" see any objection to requiring such brandy to be labelled "blended brandy"? - I am decidedly in accord with that. </para>

Would you allow the term " blended brandy " to be applied to a mixture of grape spirit and grain, or some other spirit? - Yes.

                            <para>- I think that I have read enough to support my own case. Evidence was given in South Australia by Messrs. Cleland and Reid, who fought most strongly for the view that the term brandy should be confined exclusively to spirit obtained from grape wine, and that no consideration) whatever should be given to other spirit, under the name blended brandy, distilled partly from grape wine spirit, and partly from other materials. The Commission used the words "other materials," however, because we did not feel bound to restrict the makers of blended brandy to grape spirit and grape wine spirit. To do so would not be fair to our distillers, because it would restrict their choice of material, and prevent them from using barley, oats, rye, maize, beet, and other produce, the growers of which hope to profit by any increase in Australian distillation. The distillers claim the right to make their blends of such materials as they may see fit to use, instead of using only grape wine spirit distilled at a strength of 35 or 40 degrees overproof together with a highly rectified grape wine spirit. On the other hand, the South Australians - and it is to their honour and credit - have developed a first class brandy, which, I believe, is the best in Australia. I do them the justice of saying that. </para>

                            <para>- They will do them no harm whatever. The South Australian manufacturers of brandy have been carried away by panic - a panic which has been based upon a misconception. In the same way, Messrs. Joshua Brothers were acting under a misapprehension. The South Australian manufacturers desire that the word "materials" shall be struck out, and the words, " other grape wine," or " other grape refuse," inserted. We could not comply with their request, because we could not see our way to limit the blenders of brandy to the use of grape wine spirit. If we had done so, we should have acted in absolute contradiction to the knowledge and experience of the whole world with respect to blended brandy. Although in ancient days brandy was understood to be made wholly of grape spirit, we have moved forward since then, and the public taste has undergone a modification. As is shown bv the evidence, a large section of the public do not like brandy made wholly of wine spirit, because of the wine t'aste imparted to it. They want brandy made partly of some other spirit. This mav be a vitiated taste, but the distillers say that' they have to cater for the public requirements and to study the public inclinations, and that they cannot be tied down to the manufacture of brandy out of wine spirit pure and simple. </para>

                            <para>- The use of the word " adulteration" is also founded upon a misapprehension. That term can be applied only when spirits are blended with the object of deceiving the public. In cases, however, where the spirit is honestly described, and the brandy is sold as blended brandy - in cases where, as we recommend, the description is affixed to the bottles and the packages - no one can 'be deceived, and it is wrong to apply the word "adulteration." I appeal to honorable members to say whether brandy sold under an honest description, and certified to by the Excise officers as having been distilled in a certain manner, and blended in a certain manner, can be called adulterated spirit. In such a case, the term adulteration is a misnomer. It is a purely hackneyed cry that has been raised to serve a certain purpose. </para>

If a blended brandy is sold as pure grape wine brandy, there is deception; but if customers wish to buy a bottle of blended brandy, and the word " blend " appears on the bottle, no deception is practised upon them. The word " blend " is frequently used to indicate that the liquor is made up of spirits that are not of uniform character. </para>

                            <para>- They will, because, if the recommendations of the Commission are carried out, each bottle will bear upon it a description of the materials of which the spirit is made. The whole of the objections to these proposals are due to an alarmist cry that has been raised in South Australia, and, if honorable member's would calmly consider the whole matter, they would not be so ready to condemn the recommendations of the Commission. We cannot fly in the face of the public taste, or preferences. The South Australian manufacturers complain of the proposal that distillers should be permitted to apply the term " brandy " to any liquor that is blended with other than grape spirit, and it seems to me that that is a most unreasonable view to take. Blended brandies have been in existence in Australia, France, and Great Britain for years past, and we cannot fly in the face of custom and the public taste. In paragraph 2, honorable members will see that a definition of blended brandy is given. The whole of the objections that have been urged against the recommendation apply to the inclusion of the word "materials." If, however, that word were struck out, the whole virtue of the definition would be destroyed. </para>

                            <para>- We propose to establish a standard for pure brandy, and a standard for blended brandy, and it is intended, in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5, to extend certain exclusive rights, privileges, and advantages to those who comply with the conditions laid down. If the brandy-makers of South Australia maintain their present high standard, and make brandy exclusively from grape wine spirit, they will have the sole right to describe it as pure Australian standard brandy. No other persons, unless they produce brandy of a similar character and composition, will be entitled to use that name. The makers of pure brandy will have a Commonwealth certificate to the effect that their spirit is of a certain standard, and no one else will be able to compete with them, unless their spirit possesses the necessary qualities. I contend that that is the most important protection. </para>

                            <para>- Those who make blended brandy will not be permitted to call it the Australian standard brandy, but must describe it as blended brandy. I believe that, asa matter of fact, there is a greater demand for blended spirits than for high standard spirits, such as pure grape brandy. That may be regrettable, but it is a fact, and the distillers have to manufacture spirits that will sell. Coming now to the question of preference, honorable members will see that grape wine brandy is to have a preference of 4s. per gallon, whereas blended brandy will have a preference of 3s. per gallon. The preference of 3s. per gallon given to blended brandy is based upon a minimum percentage of 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. That is to say, the blend shall consist of not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. But most manufacturers of the blended brandy will, in the course of practice, use more than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. Many will probably use 50 per cent., and some, perhaps, 75 per cent., of pure grape wine spirit. </para>

                            <para>- They may do so for the sake of producing a better blend of brandy. In all probability it will be to their interests to use more than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit in producing their blend, in order that they may give it more body, more tone, and more quality, and thus make, upon the whole, a superior article. That is the reason why the Commission could not distinguish between fractions of a shilling. We could not say that a duty of a shilling should be split up in accordance with the proportion of pure grape wine spirit which is contained in any blended brandy. We could not say, for example, that 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit in a blended brandy should give the distiller an advantage of 3d. per proof gallon, that 50 per cent, should confer an advantage of 6d. per proof gallon, and that 75 per cent, should confer an advantage of9d. per proof gallon. We had to make allowance for the fact that in all probability the manufacturers of blended brandies would use at least 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit, and that others would require to use, perhaps, 50 or even 75 per cent, of that spirit. </para>

                            <para>- The Commission recommended that a blended brandy should contain not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. It is claimed that our proposal constitutes a preference to the blended article as against the pure article. I fail to see it. If anybody thinks he can make a better differentiation, I should like him to try. Of course, any persons can say. "Let us destroy the scheme," but my reply is, " Let them suggest something better." The members of the Commission have done their best. We could not favour the distillers in South Australia as 'against the distillers in other States. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member should recollect that the report of the Commission was signed by four freetraders as well as by four protectionists. It is high time that he dropped his allusions to Messrs. Joshua Brothers. The Commission had to consider the whole of Australia. In Western Australia some distillers intend to go in for the manufacture of a blended brandy. It may not be to their interests to use the lowest percentage of pure grape wine spirit - namely, 25 per cent. - in the production of that article. If the higher percentage of grape wine spirit be used, the preference will probably parr out at about 2s. 6d. instead of 3s. per gallon. </para>

The same principle of classification, differentiation and gradation, is applicable in each case. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am told that the whisky distillers desire the word "materials" to be eliminated, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the word "grain." They urge this alteration in order to exclude the possibility of a blended whisky being composed partly of barley malt spirit and partly of molasses spirit. In regard to that suggestion I am quite willing to keep an open mind. I am prepared to hear arguments from both sides. The Commission inserted the word' " materials "so as to make the proposal harmonize with the proposal which is contained in their second recommendation, thus giving the distillers discretionary power to produce a blend out of a basic spirit - in one case that spirit being pure grape wine spirit, and in the other a malt spirit - mixed with pure and highly rectified spirits made from other materials, subject to the veto of the Excise officer. If the latter found that the materials so used were injurious to the public, he could veto them. Some slight alteration has been suggested in regard to other matters, which I need' not occupy time in debating. I have merely put before the Committee sufficient material to launch the discussion, with a view to affording honorable members an opportunity of considering some of the leading points. </para>

                    <para class="block">Upon a full consideration of the whole of these proposals, we arrived at the conclusion that whilst we were justified in recommending certain reductions in the Excise duties upon spirits, we could not - and we deliberately refused to do so - recommend any alteration in the import duty. We worked out a scheme designed to give certain advantages and concessions to the local manufacturer, but we desired that those advantages and concessions should be plainly and clearly expressed upon the statute-book, without any reservation or condition - without anything arising indirectly, and producing results which we did not anticipate or did not desire to express. We arrived at the conclusion that, provided that the conditions I have mentioned were complied with, grape wine brandy was entitled to a clear advantage of 4s. per gallon ; that blended brandy should have an advantage of 3s. per gallon; malt whisky, 4s. per gallon ; blended whisky, 3s. per gallon ; rum and gin, 2s. per gallon, and so forth. In arriving at this decision, we did not wish in any way to alter the existing import duty, nor to cause any disturbance in trade in regard to the ordinary wholesale or retail selling prices. Under the Commonwealth Tariff, during the last five or six years, there has been in operation an import duty of 14s. per gallon. That has led to certain selling rates in the Commonwealth, and it was thought that if there were an increase in the import duty it would disturb the existing selling rates, and, perhaps, to some extent, prejudicially affect the wholesale as well as the retail trade. We intended no such disturbance; we intended to give a certain clear positive advantage without upsetting existing trade arrangements and methods of selling in the wholesale or retail trade. We also felt justified, for certain special reasons which I shall proceed to mention, in refraining from recommending an alteration in the import duty. Those special reasons are, shortly, that under the Commonwealth Tariff, there has been an enormous expansion in the production of spirits in Australia. That is proved by the following figures: - In 1899 - which was a normal year before _ the adoption of the Commonwealth Tariff - there were distilled in all the Australian States 737,200 proof gallons of spirits, whereas in 1905 the production jumped up to the enormous quantity of 1,506,339 gallons, showing an increase of 769,I39 gallons since 1899. The increase in the main was in the production of spirits from molasses in New South Wales and Queensland. By the establishment of Inter-State freetrade, those spirits obtained free access to the whole of the Australian markets, and an enormous impetus was thus given to the industry in Queensland and New South Wales.' Prior to Federation, those cheap spirits would have had to pay high duties, and, consequently, they were shut out of the other Australian markets. But, as the result of the abolition of the Inter-State duties, the trade in molasses spirit received a tremendous impetus, and their production jumped up from almost zero to 700,000, 800,000, or 900,000 gallons a year. That is a very large expansion. There is also the expansion in the. Australian production of brandy, which accounts altogether for the total increase I have mentioned. In the distillation of whisky, however, there was an absolute and complete collapse, resulting in the closing of all the whisky distilleries in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The figures I have quoted show an enormous increase in production, and, of course, that increased production meant increased revenue from excise duties. In 1899 the total amount received by way of excise on spirits produced in the Australian. States was only <inline font-style="italic">£I47&gt;935</inline> - a comparatively small sum. In the year 1905, however, the excise collected on spirits, under the Commonwealth Tariff jumped up to the large sum of ^£267,454,- showing an increase, as compared with the return for 1899, of ^119,519. The following figures, as to imported spirits, are interesting. In 1899, 2,504,926 gallons of proof spirit were imported into the various Australian States; whilst in 1905, 2,560,813 gallons were imported, showing an increase of nearly 60,000 gallons. I may say that, in the interval, there had been a big jump in the quantity of spirits imported, but that it fell away apparently to the normal figures of some 2,500,000 gallons. There was thus a slight increase on importations and an enormous increase in local production, and in the amount received from the accompanying excise duties. The result is that from imported, as well as from locally - made spirits, there has been a very large increase in revenue since the establishment of the Commonwealth - an increase amounting, probably, to ^200,000. When the right honorable member for Adelaide submitted his scheme of duties on spirits, he based it, no doubt, on certain revenue expectations. These expectations have been more than realized. The revenue has been increasing, by leaps and bounds, and this is particularly so in the case of the revenue from, excise duties, for there has been every year since 1899 a gradual ascent in the returns. In view of these facts, the Commission arrived at the conclusion that, although they were about to recommend a reduction in the' excise duties, they need not necessarily recommend any increase of the import duty. The total amount of revenue from spirits as a whole was so great - so far beyond expectations, and above all necessity that we felt we could reasonably reduce the Excise duties without recommending any increase of duty on the imported article. I am of that opinion still, and I see no reason to alter it. I have not had time to examine the figures quoted to-day, though I mav, perhaps, find an opportunity during the debate to do so, and see whether there is anything to be said about the estimated loss of the £70,000, the ,£80,000, or the £90,000. Assuming the estimate to be true, this expanding revenue from spirit is so great that there is no necessity to have any additional duty, in order to repair the loss. </para>

                            <para>- I have mentioned that in the interval between 1899 and 1905 there was a big jump, but that since then matters have come to their normal level. I did not want to bother honorable members with the figures in full. The real reason the Tariff Commission did not recommend any change was that the revenue was of such a character that burdens might be struck off those suffering from the Excise duties, without imposing further import duties with, of course, a corresponding rise in Excise duties. I intend to support the recommendation of the Commission that there be no increase in the import duty. I see no justification for any increase; the time has arrived when we may fairly say that £2,000,000 is enough to receive from the spirit duties. </para>

                        <para>. - I think we may fairly compliment the honorable and learned member for Bendigo on his very careful exposition of the position- from his point of view, and on the exceedingly good work he has done as Chairman of the Tariff Commission. Many of us must have been struck by the almost stupendous labours which the honorable and learned member and some of his colleagues have had to face in the work not only of taking evidence, but of afterwards reducing to synthetic expression the clashing opinions submitted to them. That is certainly a discharge of patriotic duty, which we, as members, can keenly appreciate. I can quite understand, at the same time, the anxiety of the honorable and' learned member for Bendigo that the recommendations of the Tariff Commission should not be disturbed. We all, of course," have a little liking for our political offspring, no matter what it may be. It is a sort of reflection on our discretion or judgment - sometimes it touches our <inline font-style="italic">amour propre-if</inline> even the Ministry propose to interfere with recommendations, especially after such an elaboration of purpose and adjusting of evidence as we have 'had in this instance. At the same time, I admire the wisdom of the Ministry in seeking new light on the duties proposed. I fully appreciate the view that resolutions, illegal in themselves because they have to be hurriedly introduced, are, to a certain extent, tentative. They have to be quickly conceived in order to protect the revenue, and very often the technical information that may be desirable and necessary is not available; because the Minister would have to seek expert advice from persons, who, of course, may be just those prepared to take advantage of the new schedule of duties. Without an absolute disclosure of the Ministerial proposals, any man, not a fool, could very well gauge what duties were likely to be brought down or increased from the questions submitted to him by the Minister seeking his advice. I can well understand, therefore, that the resolutions tabled about a fortnight ago by the Minister in regard to spirits, are, to a large extent, imperfect, and subject to such alteration as the Ministry may see fit in the course of the debate to make. Considering that we are still seeking light, I shall not do more than indicate the supreme importance of these proposals to South Australia, and also, of course, to the Commonwealth. This is not a South Australian matter purely. That State is very largely concerned, but the question of the purity of the spirits used in the blending of brandy is one that concerns the States as a whole. South Australia, it happens, however, is keenly interested in the matter. That fact does not altogether influence me, though it may undoubtedly stimulate me; I should not be here as a representative of that State if I did not feel, when her interests are specially affected, a higher degree of stimulus than that to which we must confess when we have before us matters which concern us purely as Commonwealth representatives. We represent particular districts and States, and questions affecting these we view with keener interest than we do those of general Australian application. At the same time, mere local interests do not influence me if I think that the higher interests of the Commonwealth direct another stand. I need only refer to the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, in connexion with which I had to some extent to oppose some interests of the district I represent. In the matter under discussion, if I thought it my duty to support the motion, of the Ministry I should do so ; but from the best information I could get in the last few days, as well as from reading the reports  of  the Tariff Commission, I have come to the conclusion that we cannot accept the duties proposed by the Government. As to the effects of a blend of brandy not made purely from grape spirit - that is, 25 per cent, of pot still, and the rest rectified grape spirit - I have only to mention that last year in South Australia there was made 956,000 gallons of spirit from wine. Figures have already been quoted showing that in Australia nine-tenths of the brandy distilled is from wine. I think that the total production of wine in South Australia last year was 2,625,430 gallons - the largest quantity ever distilled in one State. A few years ago viticulture, which ought to be one of the leading industries of Australia, considering our climatic conditions and the peculiar character of the soil, had not assumed large proportions. There were then only a few thousand acres devoted to viticulture in Australia, whereas now, according to the Tariff Commission, there are about 65,000 acres thus used. The labour employed averages about ,£5 an acre, which, therefore, represents nearly ^330,000 'a year. When we consider that this industry, as measured by the progress of the last five or six years, is still only in its infancy, we can see the enormous possibilities, under fair fiscal treatment - that is under a differentiation that does not discourage the production of the pure article - which lie before the Australian producers. The position of South Australia is further emphasized by the fact that under the inspection duty of is. per gallon on spirits used for the fortification of wine, ^45,000 was collected in 1904-5, of which, in round figures, ,£22,000 was paid bv that one State alone. This indicates the importance of this question to South Austra-Iia, and I am pleased to see that the Government suggests the remission of this duty. From the revenue point of view, it was open to every objection that could be levelled against a pure revenue duty. It was unequal in its incidence in the different States - the figures I have given show that - and besides it was irregular in its return. Whilst the total revenue received from it was .£45,000 in 1905, the total in 1904 was under ^£5,000, So that in addition to the other reasons given by the members of the Tariff Commission - and on this point there was unanimity - the disparity of incidence upon the States, and of yield from year to year, render the duty objectionable from the point of view of revenue. Hence, </para>

                    <para class="block">The report goes on to deal with matters to which I do not desire to refer at present, but on the question of purity, to which the honorable and learned member for Bendigo made so much reference, I should like to say that there seems to have been a great conflict of evidence before the Commission as. to whether spirits other than pure grape spirit used for the rectification of wine, are pure; whether, for instance, alcohol made from, molasses is absolutely pure. But I failed to observe that any doubt was expressed as to the purity of the spirit made from grapes. That is the point, and when we can have a pure spirit by relying upon distillation from the grape itself, I do not see why we should be driven back upon a spirit of conjectural purity, in order that resort may be had to molasses, potatoes, or other articles. There is a great conflict of evidence, not as to the purity of grape spirit, but as to the purity of other spirits. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has quoted the opinion of some experts, showing that it is possible to get a certain degree of purity in the rectification of molasses spirit. .It is said by some that ultimately all the spirits are pure from whatever material they may be produced. But we never get that ideal purity. As a matter of fact, it is never supplied, and if it were, there would be no such thing as flavouring. The flavour of brandy is not an idea - it is an element, the attenuation of the element to about its lowest state. Men in speaking of flavour in this connexion sometimes speak of it as though it were, to some extent, an idea like the flavour of smoking, but it is not. Wisely, I think, there is no proposition made to interfere with the provisions of the ' Distillation Act, under which wine can be fortified only by a grape spirit, but the same <inline font-style="italic">argument</inline> which was then urged in favour of the continuation of that provision, certainly applies with equal force to the manufacture of brandy from a pure grape spirit. At page 11 of the report of the Commission on the wine-growing industry of Australia, I find this evidence dealing with the use of various spirits for the fortification of wine. According to the Commission's report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> D. Brown, who was quoted by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, thought that potato spirit, if added, would interfere with the quality of the wine. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Henry Norrie, analytical chemist, said it is a distinct advantage to the wine to use grape spirit for fortifying purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleland,</inline> a South Australian, considered that grape wine spirit was the best for fortifying wine. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Adrian</inline> Despeissis, Horticultural and Viticultural Expert of Western Australia, was of the same opinion. These are strong opinions in favour of the view taken by South Australians, but I again emphasize the point that there can be no doubt about the purity of brandy that is made of not Jess than 25 per cent, from pot-still brandy and the balance from rectified spirit dis-. tilled from the grape. Once we begin to blend with- any inferior spirit, we shall not be getting what Australia should desire, and that is a brandy that will bear a reputation throughout the world for purity. We heard from the honorable and learned member for Bendigo that certain brandies are so pure that they are objected to. What are the brandies that are objected to? The pot-still brandy, which has to be matured for two years, because it contains the greatest percentage of oils requiring to the oxidized to make pure ethers, is not consumed in the ordinary way by the drinking public, but is mixed with another grape spirit, so as to produce a blend, 75 per cent, of which is rectified spirit taken from the grape and 25 per cent, of pot-still spirit. That is the blend in relation to which the duties are objected to as being the same as for the blend from molasses spirit. As regards purity. I have quoted from the Tariff Commission's report, but I find also that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> A. Mann, Government Analyst of Western Australia, as the result of recent tests of spirits made in Perth, has certified that all the Australian brandy he examined, without exception, appeared to be of genuine character. As nine-tenths of the brandy produced in Australia is made in South Australia from .grape spirit, that is a wide testimony to the value of the South Australian production. I do not think that in England they allow brandy which is not altogether produced from grape spirit to be used for medicinal purposes. I have no doubt that, in common with myself, other honorable members have received ,a letter on this subject from Messrs. Penfold and Company. I think that it deals only with the consumption for medicinal , purposes, but an extract is enclosed in the letter from Messrs. Penfold from the <inline font-style="italic">Licensing Review</inline> of 30th July and of 6th August, 1904, in which honorable members will find very high testimony paid to brandy, whether blended or not, produced altogether from grape spirit. I need not read the quotation, as it is in the hands of honorable members. There is another matter to be considered in connexion with this. If a blend of molasses spirit is permitted, and molasses spirit to the extent of 75 per cent, is used, it will completely displace the use of grapes for the distillation of spirit. There is no question about that. According to the best evidence I have seen, it costs about 4s. per gallon to make rectified spirit from grapes. Molasses spirit can be bought at is. per gallon. Estimates for it are given from 8d. up to is. 3d. per gallon. If the duty proposed were 12s., the position as regards the grape blend would be 12s. duty and 4s. cost per gallon, or a total of 16s., whilst the molasses would be 12s. duty, and is. cost per gallon, or a total of 13s. per gallon. In 0:her words, there is a difference of 3s. per gallon in favour of molasses. It would be impossible for the pure spirit to compete with it ; it would be knocked completely out of the market. What would that mean ? A few days ago I was in a part of South Australia - it is in my own district - where, within a radius of ten miles, between 10,000 and 12,000 tons of grapes are purchased every year for wine and the distillation of spirits. Let honorable members imagine farmers with acreages running from 10 to 130 or 140 having a ready market within a radius of a few miles for the sale of their grapes. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely none. According to the season, these farmers get from <inline font-style="italic">£&gt;2 t0 £5</inline> a ton for the grapes. But suppose that they were paid <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> a ton, as they were last year. It would mean the purchase of 10,000 tons of grapes from the very class of men who ought to be encouraged, if there is anything in all this talk about democracy. But what is the position in that district? There are four of the leading distillers ready, in the intervals between seasons, to make advances on the crop of grapes, and without interest, I am told; so they really act as &lt;a sort of accommodation banker to the growers. There we. have the beginnings of an ideal community. What do we get from the molasses? We get the product of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and that is the best output of the industry. I wonder what the planters of Queensland got last year out of a total surrender of £314,006, either directly in bonuses or indirectly through the shrinkage of duties as compared with 1901. I wonder how much the planters in New South Wales and Queensland will get this year out of bonuses which total up to £278,000. There is no bonus given on grape production; but molasses is the waste product of an industry which is already over-protected. According' to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua,</inline> the total quantity of molasses devoted to the production of spirits in 1904-5 was 7,000 tons, but the total production of sugar was 196,000 tons, so that the demand created for molasses by allowing brandy to be blended to the extent of 75 per cent, with molasses spirit is comparatively insignificant in relation to the total product of the sugar industry. I have told 'honorable members what this .proposal will mean to the small vine-growers in a district of South Australia, and within a radius of "ten miles. But let me now push the matter home. Are we driven to leave molasses alone? Will it remain a waste product if this preference be not given - a preference which might injure the reputation of our wine or brandy? On the 28th May, the American Senate passed a Bill allowing the use of spirits made from wood, potatoes, molasses, and other such materials for industrial purposes. It provides that it is to be denatured or adulterated - both) words are used - under Government inspection, and then it is freed from excise. The matter was fully discussed in the <inline font-style="italic">Scientific Amencan</inline> for July and previously. A few nights ago I read the articles, which fully explained the actual cost of production, and the uses to which the spirit can be put. On that point I should like to quote the evidence of a periodical showing that in their experience the very best way to break down the monopoly of such bodies as the Standard Oil Company is. to encourage, by freeing from duty, the use of spirit when denatured for industrial purposes, because, for cleanliness and other qualities, it is likely to supersede for many purposes the use of kerosene and other oils for supplying light, heat, and power. The quotation, which is taken from an American trade journal of about six weeks ago, reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>On 24th May the Senate passed by a unanimous vote the Bill which provides for the freeing from taxation, after 1st January, 1907, of denatured alcohol used for industrial purposes. The Bill had previously been passed by the House, where it was opposed chiefly by the manufacturers of wood alcohol. This substance is to be used as an adulterant, however, to make the alcohol unfit for drinking. According to the provisions of the new law, the adulteration, or denaturizing of the alcohol is to be done in the various factories under the supervision of an internal revenue officer. By removing the tax from industrial alcohol, our Government has effectually put a stop to the domination of the oil trust over the use' of liquid fuel for light, heat, and power. In Germany and France devices for using denatured alcohol for these purposes have already been perfected, and placed in actual use, and their adoption in this country will no doubt come quickly as soon as industrial alcohol is on the market. As this fuel can be produced from many vegetable products that have heretofore gone to waste, and that, too, at a very considerably lower price than is obtained for gasoline and kerosene to-day ; there need never be any fear of lack of fuel, even should the coal measures all become exhausted, and the supply of natural oil cease. The new fuel, besides being cleaner and less volatile, will, when used in suitably-designed internal-combustion motors, develop about as much power per gallon as will the old, while for light and heat it is far superior. Its introduction will create a new market for the farmers of our country, while they will benefit directly from it also by using it themselves for the production of light and power. </para>

                            <para>- The quotation is not the less valuable on that account. I was going on to mention that that recommendation has been made by the Tariff Commission, so that all we have to do is to get the Minister to adopt it; and, as far as there is any necessity, therefore, to allow distillation from molasses, the spirit could be devoted to a use which would lead to a far greater consumption than one which might mean the death of the great wine spirit industry. I think I could quote from several witnesses before the Tariff Commission to show the advisability of keeping our blends pure. As to the price of the molasses, it is somewhat significant that, in speaking of a scale of protective duties, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> talks about a duty of 2s. per gallon on molasses spirit, but a duty of 6s. per gallon on grape wine spirit, showing a bigger differentiation in cost between grape spirit and molasses spirit than I gave for the purpose of the comparison. I would strongly put it to the Committee that, by preventing the use of molasses spirit for the purpose of blending brandy, or, at all events, by so adjusting the duties 'that we do not differentiate against grape spirit, as is the case at present, we shall help the extension of a primary industry which ought ultimately to give a reputation to Australia. It is not a matter affecting a few men such as control the sugar industry ; in some districts there are hundreds of farmers engaged in grape-growing. I ask that reasonable opportunities be, given under the Tariff for the continuation of the development of this industry, which, during the last four years, under which the old Tariff of us. Excise on grape brandy, and 13s. on n.e.i., has made a tremendous advance, but which, if the blending provided for by the Government is allowed, will be destroyed, because growers will be unable to get rid of their grapes. That is why the representatives of South Australia are displaying an anxiety in regard to the matter which, although it may have distracted the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, is justified in view of the possible effect of the new duties. </para>

                        <para>.- Whilst, in common with the other members of the Tariff Commission, I am perfectly prepare3 to justify and stand by the unanimous report to which we agreed after the hearing of much evidence, and a lengthy and earnest consideration of all the facts, I am not willing to do so after the flaunting manner in which the Minister of Trade and Customs has dealt with the subject. A few years ago, the Prime Minister used to say that the politics of the Federal Parliament would be on a higher plane than those of any State Parliament, and I ask him if the speech of the Minister this afternoon had the effect of placing our proceedings on a higher plane than those of a State Parliament? The honorable gentleman has admitted that he has not yet made up his mind in regard to the proposals which he has placed before the Committee, and he asks us to amuse ourselves by discussing them while he finds time to consider whether he is justified in what he has done. I sympathize deeply with the Chairman of the Tariff Commission in the humiliating position in which he was placed by the Minister, and, as a member of the Commission, I feel that our report has been flaunted. The Minister, on his own acknowledgment, does not understand its nature and tenor. Apparently, he will not stand by his motion, but intends later to introduce more mature proposals. Because of some outside agitation, and because of letters written to and interviews held with the Minister by persons who had every opportunity during, several months to place their case before the Commission, the honorable gentleman tells us that he has not given the subject full consideration, and asks us to waste our time in discussing what he has brought forward, although he may later propose something quite different. I resent this treatment, both as a member of the Commission, and as a member of the Committee, and I ask the Prime Minister whether, as leader of the Government, he should not do something to place our proceedings on the higher plane of which he was so fond of speaking in years gone by, and which they do not now occupy. </para>

                        <para>. - I am unable to find a reason for the honorable and learned member's impassioned words. The Minister of Trade and Customs said that he had obtained in South Australia and elsewhere information leading him to doubt whether sufficient protection is being afforded to the manufacture of pure wine brandy. But that is a subject for future consideration. Before we can deal with it, we must dispose of the motion now before the Chair, in which it is not involved, though honorable members have the undoubted right to criticise the whole of the proposals at this stage. The Government do not desire to prolong such general criticism. They would prefer the Committee to come at once to close quarters with the motion submitted. I do not think any honorable members could take exception to the fullness with which the 'Chairman of the Tariff Commission supported such of its recommendations as have been questioned by my honorable colleague. </para>

It is true, as the honorable and learned member for Bendigo has said, that there is a South Australian view of the subject as distinguished from the New South Wales or the Victorian view, but the report of the Tariff Commission shows that the view of the vignerons of South Australia was indorsed by every prominent and influential vigneron in the other States. </para>

I understood my honorable colleague to refer to comparatively minor alterations, which I do not wish to discuss now in anticipation, thus unnecessarily prolonging the debate. They cannot be dealt with until we have finished with the proposals for Customs duties, and have come to the proposals for Excise duties. The honorable and learned member, in quoting from a speech which I made at Footscray, brought together two parts of it in such a way as to alter the meaning of the second part. It is quite true that at Footscray I said that this report, having been indorsed by both sections of the Commission, should be disposed of in a very short time - I hoped, in a single night. At that time, however, the consequences to the revenue had not been presented to us, as they were afterwards, by the officers of both the Customs and the Treasury Departments. In response to their representations, the Government, whilst adopting in principle the whole of the scheme of the Commission, with very great reluctance altered some of the duties. We sought, in the light of the best information available to us, to maintain the revenue at about its present level. At a later stage of my speech I spoke of those cases in which the members of the Commission might be divided, and expressed the hope that no one would raise the theoretical question of freetrade <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> protection - a mere abstract question for argument between those of opposite fiscal faiths.

                            <para>- That statement does not appear to me to cast any reflection upon the Tariff Commission. I said in effect that Parliament was not here to dis cuss abstract questions, nor to ask the two sections of the Tariff Commission to do so. All that we were justified in doing: was to ask the members of the Commission to give us the benefit of their practical experience. The honorable and learned member, therefore, has interpreted' my statement in a manner that it was never intended to bear. </para>

I must say that at this moment I am not prepared to argue how the manufacture of blended" brandy and whisky in the Commonwealth ought to be treated.' Mv honorable colleague's criticisms were limited to two, one of which the honorable and learned member for Bendigo admits was of only secondary importance. Therefore the only exception that could be taken to his remarks is to the one suggestion with reference to the increase of the duty upon blended spirits. Surely my honorable colleague was perfectly candid in communicating to honorable members the impression that had been made on his mind bv the <inline font-style="italic">viva voce</inline> representations made to him. </para>

                            <para>- We have accepted the proposals as being based, upon the recommendations of the Tariff Commission after an exhaustive inquiry. The Minister was naturally disposed to rely upon their recommendations, and now he merely challenges one of them tentatively, and asks honorable members to assist him in discussing it. He has frankly placed before honorable members the difficulty that has occurred to him. Of course, if the matter had been placed before the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, he would, no doubt, have replied as he has done to-day - he would have given, in part, at all events, the reasons which could be urged against any modification of the recommendations of the Commission. No doubt there is a great deal to be said in support of the point of view put by him, but we can fully discuss the matter when the Excise duties are dealt with in detail. We have not yet reached that stage. We shall be called upon to deal first with the proposals to substitute higher duties for those previously collected upon imported spirits. The consideration of that matter is in no way affected by the suggestion of my honorable colleague, that one of the later proposals relating to the Excise duties may require to be reconsidered to some extent. My honorable colleague did not commit himself to any antagonism to the proposal, but indicated that when the time came he would be glad to receive further information. Therefore, after the issue immediately before us has been disposed of, we shall be able to fully examine the point that has been raised, and endeavour to settle any doubt that may exist. </para>

                        <para>.- It is very good indeed of the Prime Minister to come to the rescue of his colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in connexion with these remarkable proposals of the Government. Unfortunately, however, we are being asked to consider certain recommendations of the Tariff Commission which the Government are themselves unable to indorse until they have further information. It is obvious that the proper course to adopt would be to postpone this debate until such time as the Government is in possession of the information necessary to enable us to discuss the question before us in a proper way. I am quite sure that no member of the Tariff Commission would say that the proposals of that body are not open to improvement. We have given a great deal of time to our work, and have considered the question now before the Committee from every possible point of view. We are prepared, at the proper time, to vindicate our attitude, but the Commission and honorable members are placed in an entirely false position when they are asked to debate certain proposals in regard to which the Government have practically no information to offer. Surely I am asking what is reasonable when I urge that this debate should be adjourned until the Government are in a position to put before honorable members the information which they intend to obtain. </para>

                            <para>- to me it is rather surprising that something in that direction was not done long since. More than two years ago I called attention to the quality of the spirits that were being imported. I pointed out that nearly all the spirits coming into the Commonwealth were being imported in bulk, also that very little case whisky was being introduced, and that the imported spirits were being sold without any real supervision being exercised over them. I stated that this was particularly the case in South Australia, where there was a conflict between the State and Commonwealth enactments in regard to the matter. I am' rather surprised to learn that under the Customs Act it was possible to prevent these inferior spirits from being imported. I agree , with the honorable member for Bland that we ought to incorporate in the Bill some such provision as he has outlined. We have in the past trusted too much to administration bv means of regulations, which either have never been framed or have never been put into force. I do not think that it is necessary at this stage to discuss all the matters dealt with in the motion. </para>

                            <para>- I have always voted consistently, and that is more than the honorable member has done. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo mentioned that he considered a minimum of 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit was sufficient in the case of blended brandy, but I would point out that in the old country a number of prosecutions have been instituted against persons for selling brandy that is not the pure juice of the grape. In the case of one firm which was so prosecuted, it was stated in the course of the evidence that the great firm of Gilbey always labelled brandy not derived solely from the grape as a "mixture of genuine grape brandy, and rectified British spirit." It is recognised in the old land that brandy ought really to be the pure juice of the grape. That is the contention of the representatives of South Australia. Why should we allow pure grape spirit to be adulterated to the extent of 75 per cent, with the cheapest and most inferior spirit that one can name, and sold as brandy ? What hope has the manufacturer of a really genuine brandy in competition with such an adulteration ? . He cannot possibly live against such competition. In the case to which I have referred, an eminent legal authority gave evidence that if brandy not made of the pure juice of the grape were given to a patient, it would set up irritation, and do him injury. The authorities tell us that the ethers in brandy make it more valuable than is any other spirit. The purer the brandy, the higher the percentage of ethers, and the greater its value from a medicinal stand-point. The highest medical authorities tell us that the giving of a mixture of pure grape brandy and some other spirit, to an invalid, is likely to be dangerous. If it be dangerous to give brandy so adulterated to a sick man, it cannot be desirable to give it to a healthy individual. As we shall have another opportunity to deal with this phase of the question, I shall not, at this stage, make further reference to it, but I trust that the Government intend immediately to subject imported spirits to the same conditions as are applied to those made within Australia. The whole purpose of the inquiry by the Tariff Commission has been to seek a means to protect our existing manufacturers and to encourage others to enter the industry. There is room for great expansion in this industry, but if we deal with it in the slipshod way that has characterized our actions for some time, we shall afford it but little protection. </para>

                    <para class="block">Bland, that the same conditions should apply to imported spirits as are imposed with respect to those produced within the Commonwealth, I would point out that in the question now under consideration, something more is involved. The basic principle underlying the taxation of spirits is that since they have a deleterious effect upon those who indulge in them, and their consumption leads to increased cost in civic government, high duties should be imposed. I view this question, however, from the stand-point of revenue. . Whether spirits be manufactured within or outside the Commonwealth, the effect of their use is to increase the cost of government. Looking over the returns published by the Commission, I find that there is nothing in them to warrant an increase in the import duty on spirits, and, as a matter of fact, no increase is recommended. The revenue derived from the import duty has decreased in proportion to the increase in the consumption of locally-made spirits, but, unfortunately, the cost of government has not been decreased by their use. In 1899 737,000 gallons of spirits were produced in Australia, whereas, in 1905 1,506,000 gallons were produced, the figures showing a large expansion in the local industry. On the other hand, although there was an increase of nearly 60,000 gallons in the quantity of spirits imported in 1905 as compared with the quantity introduced in 1899, the imports -last -year -were considerably less than those of a few years ago. </para>

                            <para>- When we adjourned for dinner I was pointing out that, in my opinion, the proposed duty of 15s. per gallon on imported spirits would be detrimental to the revenue ; and I am supported in that view by the figures presented to us by the Tariff Commission. I find that in 1899 the quantity of spirits imported was 2,504,926 gallons, while in 1905 the quantity was 2,560,813 gallons. In. the growth of this industry we see the effect of the protective incidence of the duty of 14s. per gallon ; and I venture to submit that if we raise the Tariff to 15s., there will be a marked falling-off in revenue. In 1901, the total imports were 3,000,096 gallons, which is much larger than the imports at the present time. it must be apparent to any one who takes an interest in these matters that the Australian distilling industry was then subject to much severer competition from imported spirits than it is to-day. In the meantime, not because the people drink more, but as the result of increased population, local production has increased at a much greater ratio than has the consumption. As I have already stated, the only justification we have for high duties are the effects, and consequent cost in other directions, of over-indulgence in alcohol. I take it that, even from the protectionist's stand-point, not much can be said for the distilling industry as an employer of labour; because, practically, in this connexion, it stands lowest. The marked increase in the local production of spirits in New South Wales is noticeable. In that State, the increase in the period indicated has been, in round figures, 566,000 gallons, as compared with a total increase for all Australia of 749,000 gallons. In other words, the output in this industry has been doubled in six years. Some capital has been made of the fact that Messrs. Joshua Brothers have practically closed their distillery in Victoria. This occurrence has created something of a panic in the State of Victoria, and has been attributed to the Commonwealth Tariff. The official figures, however, prove, if they prove anything, that the firm mentioned have suffered not so much from the Tariff as from the breaking down of the barriers between the States, and the consequent influx of spirit from New South Wales. </para>

Personally I cannot see that there is anything to justify an increased duty. The Tariff Commission, the members of which have gone fully into the question, recommend a duty of 14s, and in order to test the opinion of honorable members,. I desire to submit an amendment reducing the duty to that figure. </para>

                        <para>.- I have already entered a protest against proceeding with this motion, seeing that the proposals of the Government are in a very crude and immature state. I again urge that we should proceed no further with this particular matter, in view of the fact that the Government are not able to explain whether they are prepared to introduce certain conditions into these specific arrangements for duties, whether they are going; to embody them in a series of resolutions, or whether, as has been suggested by the Tariff Commission, it is intended to propose modifications of the Distillation Act, the Excise Act, and other Acts dealing with this item. I may point out that the Tariff" Commission make a recommendation similar to that contained in the amendment of the honorable member for Bland, with a view to protecting the consumer against the use of immature spirits, whether locally made or imported.. Our idea was that it should be dealt with apart from the specific duties. The Government should give the Committee some definite Information as to the plan on which they propose to work in dealing with all the matters that are naturally included in the scope of this debate. On page 5 of the recommendations submitted by the Tariff Commission honorable members will find No. 8 to read as follows: - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>All these matters could be much better dealt with apart from the resolutions imposing specific duties, but if we are to have- no explanation from the Government as to the method of procedure they intend to adopt, I and others will have to support the amendment of the honorable member' for Bland. I can well imagine that if we are compelled to follow this scrappy and piecemeal method right through the proposed alterations to the Tariff, we shall have produced a very remarkable document indeed by the time we are finished. I am entirely in accord with the proposal of the honorable member for Bland. It is absolutely necessary that the health of the people who use spirits should be protected in the direction indicated. There is not the least doubt that a large quantity of unwholesome immature spirit is imported into the Commonwealth. It is not strictly relevant to this question, but I must also mention that a considerable quantity of this class of spirit that comes into consumption is produced within the Commonwealth. In this matter it is the duty of Parliament to say that those who indulge in spirits shall be protected so far as is considered necessary and reasonable by authorities on the subject. There is, .in this connexion, attached to the report of the Tariff Commission, a supplementary recommendation, signed by four members of the Commission, in favour of a differentiation of is. per gallon less than the existing Customs duty in respect of certain alcoholic liquors, admittedly of the highest quality. I should like to give the Committee an opportunity to vote upon that, but again I am in a difficulty as to where and how the Government propose to deal with such an issue. Then we have yet another issue which may probably arise, and that is the question of a preference to British goods. We have heard a great deal of preferential trade from those protectionists who have been favouring the country with their eloquence of late. I am anxious in this connexion to give those honorable gentlemen who are so loyal to the Empire an opportunity to prove their loyalty by making a differentiation in respect of spirits . proved to be of British origin. Again, I ask the Government to :aV 1 where that provision should be introduced ; whether it should be introduced in connexion with the imposition of these specific duties, or in the way suggested in the Tariff Commission's report. </para>

                            <para>- It happens, and this supports the suggestion I submit, that the better qualities of alcoholic liquors in the shape of whiskies that are imported to Australia are produced within the Empire, and those which admittedly are deleterious to health come from outside the Empire. The way is,' therefore, clear for those who are prepared to adopt in this connexion the scheme of preference of which we have heard so much recently. With regard to the proposal for a duty of 15s. per gallon, I have no hesitation in saying that if it be the intention of the Government to obtain the highest amount of revenue from this source, they are going the wrong way about it. </para>

                            <para>- In view of all the evidence which was submitted, and of certain evidence which was not submitted I thoroughly indorse the proposal made by the Chairman of the Commission, and approved by all its members that the duty on imported spirits should not be higher than 14s. per gallon. We may each have our own idea with regard to other items in the Commission's recommendations, some of which I intend to touch upon at the proper time, but in this particular case, in view of the evidence, the Commission was unanimously of opinion, that" it would be a serious mistake to levy a duty of more than 14s. per gallon on imported spirits. </para>

                            <para>- First, because it would entail a loss of revenue, and second, because it would lead to the consumption of an inferior quality of spirits. In view of the evidence before honorable members, and of the experience of most of the other States, especially those which have the largest population, and in which the conditions are most nearly normal, it rests with the Government, I contend, to show reason why the additional duty of is. per gallon on imported spirits should be imposed. So far, I have heard from Ministers nothing beyond a mere expression of opinion to justify the increase, and if they car, give no stronger evidence than that I venture to think that honorable members would prefer the more definite expression of opinion, based upon a consideration of the evidence, from the Tariff Commission. </para>

                        <para>.- This motion is on a par with all those other proposals which we have been accustomed to receive at the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs. I think I am right in saying that during this session he has not brought down a single proposal which has given evidence of careful consideration, matured judgment, correct information, or even a clear knowledge of its character. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> find ourselves to-day in a position in which we have frequently found ourselves. The Minister brought down a proposal, but before we had time to enter upon the discussion of it, he discovered that it was untenable, and therefore he intends to submit certain amendments. This has happened in the case of every measure he has submitted. I venture to say that in no other Parliament has there ever been such an exhibition of incapacity on the part of a Minister as that to which we have been treated toy him on this as on previous occasions. Like all other measures with which he has been associated, the main object of this proposal is obviously to benefit Victorian industries at the expense of the other States. It is a most singular thing that a Minister representing a New South Wales constituency should always have so little regard to the interest of his own State. Whenever an opportunity is offered, he invariably brings down measures which he declares are to benefit Australian industries, but which in their operation would more largely benefit Victoria than any other State. It is plainly evident that the proposal before the Committee is made in the interests of not even Victoria as a whole, but of one firm in that State, and that is the firm of Joshua Brothers. I am credibly informed that it is the one firm in the whole of Australia which goes in largely for the adulteration of liquor. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care whether the Tariff Commission favours what the firm is doing or not. Had it anything to do with the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, or the Commerce Bill, or other Bills which were framed to favour Victorian manufacturers at the expense of the other States? That is what I am complaining about. We know quite well that the whole of this legislation is submitted in consequence of an agitation which has been conducted mainly by the firm of Joshua Brothers. I am credibly informed that, before the new duties were proposed. Joshua Brothers had their warehouses full of spirits which they wanted to unload on the market, but - so I am informed by local hotelkeepers - the public prefer imported spirits to those manufactured by Joshua Brothers; that, as a matter of fact, that firm's spirits are not healthful, but, on the contrary, very injurious. </para>

In these matters I prefer to take thu opinion of experts to the opinions of tho"who have no claim to be experts. The honorable member for Bland, however, may be an expert for all I know to the contrary. Joshua Brothers is the one firm in Australia which would secure a practical monopoly as the result of this legislation. It must 'be remembered that, to a large extent, it is only a distributor of spirits which are manufactured in an adjoining State. All the spirit which comes to Victoria from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in New South Wales is sold to Joshua Brothers. </para>

                            <para>- Messrs. Joshua Bros, gave it out that their desire was not to increase prices, but merely to get their goods upon the market. But what I want to know is what has become of the obliging foreigner who protectionists always tell us pays all our duties ? I do not take alcoholic stimulants, and, in my opinion, it would be a good thing if the importation and local manufacture of spirits, except for medicinal purposes, were absolutely prohibited, and those engaged in the industry employed in some undertaking which would be helpful instead of injurious to the community. The plea cannot rightly be put forward that protection must be given to the distilling industry because of the number of persons that it employs, since there are fewer hands employed in that industry than in any other in proportion to the value of the output. A little time since, I went through the Colonial Sugar Company's distillery at Pyrmont, Sydney. That is a very large place, fitted up with the latest and most improved appliances for the distillation of spirits, and having a very large output; but the total number of hands employed is only about a dozen. However, my wish is to deal with the probable effect of the proposed duties. In my opinion, the result of their imposition will be to give those who consume spirituous liquors a more impure and more deleterious rather than a purer and better article, and to bring down the standard of Australian production. So far as I can gather from the information supplied to me, the purest spirit made in Australia is distilled from molasses by the patent still process. It has been urged that the rectification of spirit gets rid of valuable qualities, but, on the other hand, experts say that the purest spirit is the least harmful from a toxic stand-point. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the ordinary commercial Cognac is not pure brandy. I have been told by persons well versed in the spirit trade that certain brandies are popular because of their palatable flavour. This flavour is due to the presence in the spirit of certain deleterious elements which are not extracted in pot-still distillation as they are in the process of rectification by the patent still processes. In the Colonial Sugar Company's distilleries the spirit is distilled above 60 degrees over-proof for the purpose of getting rid of the fusel oil and other deleterious elements. </para>

                            <para>- It is proposed that no spirit shall be sold unless it has been kept in wood for two years after distillation, but nothing is to be gained by keeping highly rectified spirit in wood for any length of time after it has been distilled. As a matter of fact, all the impurities are extracted in the process of rectification. Spirit distilled at a strength of, say, 35 per cent, over-proof contains a large proportion of fusel oil and other deleterious elements which are nauseous, and that is the reason why it is kept in wood for a considerable time - for two, and sometimes three, years. I am informed, further, that the effect of keeping such spirit in the wood is not to rid it of impurities, but merely to disguise their presence, and make the spirit more palatable than it otherwise would be. </para>

                            <para>- No. It was pointed out to me that silent spirit has no odour until it is rubbed on the hands, and the aroma is brought out by the heat caused by friction. The provision relating to the spirit being kept for two years in wood is also made to apply to gin. Those who are best qualified to speak upon the matter tell me that gin, above all other spirits. should be consumed as soon as possible afte» it has been distilled, in order that the full benefit of the juniper juice used in its manufacture may be derived by the drinker. Then with regard to rum, I may. point out that the Australian product is made from silent white spirit extracted from molasses and coloured with burnt sugar. This spirit is ready for immediate consumption, and nothing is to be gained by keeping it in wood for the period proposed. If the condition sought to be imposed is insisted upon, the Colonial Sugar Company in Sydney and a number of similar establishments in Queensland will have to be closed up, or the spirits manufactured will have to be exported to Europe. Thence they will probably be brought back to Australia in the shape of popular blends of brandy or whisky. I have a copy of a letter from the South Australian Winegrowers' Association, in which attention is directed to the disabilities under which Australian wine-growers will be placed by the proposed legislation. I wish to refer to this letter to show that in order to benefit one Victorian manufacturer, it is proposed to place disabilities upon others engaged in primary industries connected with the same line of business. This letter, which was addressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs, reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>This definition will be found in the final paragraph of Section XXV. on page 35 of the report in question, where a serious anomaly has crept in - doubtless inadvertently - because " Appendix D " (which is quoted) is entirely at variance with that decision. </para>
                        <para>The anomaly referred to consists in this - that whereas the definition of " whisky," blended for commercial purposes, is that such blend shall consist of 25 per cent, of spirit, distilled from barley malt, and the remainder grain spirit to the exclusion of any spirit distilled from other sources, that of brandy is that such blend shall consist of 25 per cent, of true brandy, while the remainder " may be patent still spirits from any approved material. (See appendix B)." </para>
                        <para>My council feel that the trade in Australian pure grape brandy is essential to the well-being of the viticultural industry of the Commonwealth, as well as to that of this State, and that if this permission obtains, the trade already secured will be seriously prejudiced, if not destroyed. </para>
                        <para>During the last fifteen years the South Australian distillers have been building up a large trade in grape wine brandies, distilled under strict Customs supervision, and a reputation for an article of undoubted purity. This trade will be ruined in many directions if future legislation permits of a liquid, 75 per cent, of which may consist of cheap spirit produced from molasses, potatoes, grain, or maize, being foisted on the public as brandy. In this connexion it is satisfactory to notice, as a result of recent tests of spirits made in Perth by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> A. Mann, the Government Analyst of Western Australia, that all the Australian brandies examined, without exception, appeared to be of genuine character. </para>
                        <para>The importance of the brandy industry to the vine-growers of this State alone may be shown by the fact that in 1904 no less than 956,000 gallons of wine were distilled, and if this industry should be destroyed by reason of lax legislation, the value of 50,000 acres of vineyards would be seriously affected. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That is a very serious matter to these vinegrowers. </para>

                        <para>My association is therefore of opinion that the term " brandy " should only be allowed to apply to spirit distilled exclusively from fermented grape juice, and that, iri view of the large and increasing proportion of brandy in use for medical purposes, its purity should be absolute, and still guaranteed by strict Government inspection. </para>
                        <para>In the case of all spirits imported into the Commonwealth under the name of " brandy " or " Cognac," they should be accompanied by a certificate of origin, which should guarantee that such spirit is genuine. </para>

                    <para>That letter is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Creswell, the secretary of the South Australian Vine-growers' Association. The proposals now under consideration will undoubtedly promote the production of a less pure spirit than has hitherto been placed upon the Australian market. Thus, instead of being supplied with brandies made from pure grape wine spirit, we shall get brandies which contain a very large proportion of spirit which has been produced from molasses and potatoes. In other words, instead of obtaining an article which will be useful for medicinal purposes, the Government proposals will tend to destroy that portion of the industry which goes in for the distillation of pure brandy, and to promote the production of impure brandy, which .contains only one-fourth or 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit, and three-fourths of spirit which has been distilled from molasses and potatoes and other materials. As a matter of fact, I have been informed that at the end of last week, Messrs. Joshua Brothers gave an order to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company of Sydney for 10,000 gallons of white spirit, which is to be used in the production of brandy. Messrs. Joshua Brothers' " Boomerang" brand of brandy consists of 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit, and 75 per cent, of spirit which is obtained from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. </para>

                            <para>- But the important point is that the spirit itself is distilled from the pure juice of the grape. The other spirit is obtained from molasses. The Queensland distilleries and the distillery of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in New South Wales only produce spirit from molasses as far as I know. I do not profess to be an expert upon this subject, but the complaint is made bv vignerons, and by other persons who are engaged in the trade that the effect of these proposals will be to promote adulteration, and to discourage the production of pure grape spirit. At the present time Australian spirit has a good reputation upon the European market. The persons to whom I have referred complain that under the Government proposals they will Le. placed at a disadvantage in that market, and instead of enjoying a reputation for selling only good, pure grape spirit, they will be regarded as adulterators, and will be included in the same category as persons who are engaged in some of the Chicago meat industries. In regard to what constitutes brandy, I think I may be pardoned for quoting the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Henry</inline> Macnaughton-Jones, the well-known obstetrician, of Harley-street, who gave evidence in a test case which was recently heard at the North London Court.

                        <para>I would not call that brandy. I would not administer a brandy that would create a burning sensation, and probably set up irritation, and a tendency to reject the intended stimulant. Pure brandy has no such tendency. It has a stimulating and sustaining effect. </para>

                    <para class="block">If we are to engage in the liquor-producing industry in Australia we should endeavour to insure that as pure an article as possible is supplied to the public. Personally I am opposed to the liquor industry absolutely, but until we can get rid of it altogether we should endeavour to insure the least amount of injury to health in connexion with it. But if legislation of this character will have the effect of destroying the purity of the articles which are being supplied by Australian distillers, it will be mischievous in a double sense. In the first place, it will tend to destroy one set of industries for the purpose of affording protection to a single manufacturer, and in the second it will tend to still further injure - if not to absolutely destroy - the health of a great number of persons in the community. </para>

                        <para>.- Nothing could be more opposed to the true spirit of parliamentary government than for a moribund Parliament - and unquestionably this Parliament may be so described - to be called upon to deal with1 motions relating to the Tariff that may have the effect of unsettling trade and disturbing our commercial relations with other countries, and which, in the circumstances, cannot receive that consideration to which they would otherwise be entitled. </para>

                    <para class="block">No one will deny that this Parliament is at present on its last legs, and that the Government are, as it were, simply " sparring for wind." The position would not be so serious as it appears if it were not that the Budget has not yet been dealt with, and that until it has, there can be no attempt to close the session. At the fag end of its life of three years, this Parliament is asked to enter upon a discussion which, affecting as it does a mat&gt;ter of vital principle, must give rise to serious divisions of opinion. It is' true that the motion before us at present relates to a very small part of the Tariff, but we have been told that another motion dealing with other manufactures, and particularly with the manufacture of harvesters, is to be brought forward. I invite the Government to say, even at this late stage, whether or not it is in consonance with any sound maxim of parliamentary government that we should now be asked to deal with this question. I say unhesitatingly that it is not. It is wrong that a party consisting of only fifteen or sixteen members, dominating another party of twenty-six or twenty-seven - - </para>

                            <para>- Now that this little digression is over, I wish to point out) that a question of this kind ought not to be dealt with when the result of an adverse vote to the Government for the time "being must be a dissolution, and more especially: when we know that the rolls are mot ready for an election, and that, therefore, in the event of a dissolution, Parliament, so to speak, would be hung up for the time being. We know that we ought not to be dealing with a matter of this sort at the present time. In proof of that statement, I would point out that the very Minister responsible for this motion is so concerned with the near approach of the next general election that he has gone away to his own electorate to argue matters with one who is likely to oppose him. </para>

                            <para>- He is not. The position appears to be all the more serious when we consider what will be the result of the carrying of this motion. There is only one linn of distillers, in Australia; Victoria is the only State in which the manufacture of spirits has been permitted. The Temperance Party elsewhere are sufficiently strong to put an end to such an industry, but whilst in Victoria they talk about temperance, we find grand masters of the order always ready to vote for any proposal which would increase the difference between the import and the Excise duties to such an extent as to allow of the manufacture of spirits in this State. I believe that even the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and others have taken a most active part in bringing about this big difference between' the Excise and import duties. </para>

                            <para>- Can it be said that I am hitting below the belt when I point out what an honorable member does in the open - that he is endeavouring to build up a drink factory here? Surely when the votes cast by him in this House show that he is always in favour of trying to build up grog manufacturing shops - that his speeches when before temperance gatherings are not to be taken as indicative of his real feelings- he is not ashamed to have these facts stated. We have to consider, not the newspaper reports of speeches showing that he is in favour of temperance, but the votes recorded by him in this House - votes to put down temperance. The honorable member is not the only one who acts in this way. I dare say that we shall find two or three others who, as leaders of temperance leagues, strongly advocate temperance, casting votes that will have the effect of increasing the difference between the import and Excise duties to such an extent that grog manufactories must spring up. How is it that this industry did not spring up in New South Wales ? Simply and solely because care was taken by temperance men, who were true to their principles, not to permit this difference between the import duty and the Excise ; what these men advocated on the platform outside, they advocated in Parliament. In Victoria, however, there has been a very different state of affairs. However strongly certain men may speak in favour of temperance outside, they support this difference in duties within the walls of Parliament. The direct effect of such a policy, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> himself, would be to build up a great grog manufactory in Australia. The only reason the manufacture of drink is allowed im most countries is that it is not known very well how to get rid of it; but with Customs duties all deleterious liquor may, by proper supervision, be debarred. As I say, under the system proposed by the Government, the only result can be to build up a great grog manufactory. </para>

                            <para>- If so, then the States laws come into force; and that is another argument against the Government proposal. I never was a believer in prohibition, because I believe that the secrecy and the breaking of the law which result are more injurious than would be the drink traffic under proper control. In that opinion I am fortified by those who have had experience of the prohibition States of America. At any rate, the results of prohibition have not been what was expected. If the proposals of the Government be adopted, we shall simply throw away£150,000 per annum in revenue, in order to establish a big industry in the manufacture of drink. It seems almost incredible that the Prime Minister, who has prated of temperance, should have the audacity to countenance such a proposal, more especially in view of the fact that only 5 per cent, of the cost of production is expended in wages. In every other industry, I suppose, the cost of wages in proportion to the whole is at least four or five times 5 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I quite understand that it is a matter of molasses rather than a matter of grain. Even so, we are spending between£500,000 and£600,000 in order to have white people engaged in the production of sugar, and, it follows, to encourage the production of grog from molasses. Then, again, I feel sure that the members of the Tariff Commission have not quite seen the full force of one of their recommendations. Unfortunately, it was not pointed out to them that it is possible to distil off every ether in spirits until there remains an absolute alcohol, which could not make any one drunk. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, if he consumed a couple of ounces of alcohol, obtained from the chemist, would walk down the street quite sober. If, however, the honorable member were given an ounce of distilled spirit, he would tumble into the gutter. All I desire to point out is that, by repeated distillation, spirits may be brought to almost any degree of purity. When a man says that he can tell whether a spirit has been distilled from this or from that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred he has not the faintest idea of what he is talking about. As a matter of fact, no man can tell the difference between brandy and whisky except by the amount of different flavouring matters added to the spirit. I have already adverted to the serious injury that would accrue to the community if we were to go so far as to absolutely by our legislation bring into existence a big distillery shop in Australia. We should lose that control over the liquor which we have at the present time. It would certainly pass away from the hands of the Federal Parliament into the hands of the State Parliament. This Parliament would have nothing whatever to do with it the moment it got outside the bond. ' In addition to that, the effect of this proposal brought forward at the present time should be considered. There is practically only one firm of distillers in Australia, and that is Joshua Brothers. They have 600,000 gallons of spirits, and the effect of the proposal giving the local article a preference of 4s. a gallon will be to put £120,000 into their pockets. I ask whether any one believes that this Parliament should legislate in such a way as to do that. </para>

                            <para>- Very well; I will accept the right honorable gentleman's correction, and, instead of £120,000, I will say roughly that the effect would be to put into the pockets of this firm a little over £100,000. That would be an uncommonly nice Christmas present for this Parliament to make to anybody. I believe that the Tariff Commission made a mistake when they suggested that for two years no spirits should go out of bond. As a matter of fact, processes are now adopted by which by repeated distillations the immaturity of the spirit and other faults can be entirely overcome. In addition to that, by forcing a certain amount of oxygen through the spirit it can be brought to the same condition as it would be in after being twenty years in butts. I was absolutely staggered when I heard the leader of the Labour Party express an opinion in favour of the proposal. </para>

That is a matter of common knowledge. I do not intend to inter into a disquisition on such a subject just now, but I am sure that if the honor- able member will look into the matter he will find that, by making age the test of purity, we are relying upon the chemistry of half a century ago instead of on the chemical knowledge of to-day. Nothing struck me with greater surprise than to find From the evidence submitted to the Commission that three or four men who undoubtedly knew the facts, and who, if asked the question, would have given the information, never voluntarily supplied the members of the Commission with the information they had. As a matter of fact, they neglected to give the information because none of them were asked questions which would have elicited it. That is why that evidence was not before the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I make this point : that at the present time this Parliament is asked to assent to a measure which will place in the hands of one distiller a direct profit of from , £100,000 to , £125,000. That should be done, if done at all, not by men who will escape punishment because they are going to be rejected by their constituents, but by a House just returned from the people with a mandate to carry out certain things.. There is no escape from the fact that we are being asked to make Joshua Brothers a direct present of the amount stated. I estimated the amount at £120,000, being 600,000 gallons at 4s. per gallon. I have accepted the Treasurer's correction that it should be estimated at 3s. per gallon, but I think that it might have been estimated at 4s. per gallon on the class of spirits which Joshua Brothers have. In any case, the amount would be over , £100,000, and it is a monstrous thing that such a proposal should be made. It is almost beyond the bounds of credibility that any Parliament could be. so far dead to a sense of what is due to it as to accept a measure brought forward, </para>

And further, the proposal has not been considered as it should have been. </para>

Minister getting up and showing how little he knows about it. He told us that the Minister in charge of it had gone away to consider it, but we find that he has actually gone away to discover how the vote of his electors are likely to go at the next election. We are in this dangerous position : that if the honorable gentleman finds out that the votes of the electors of his constituency are likely to be against him he will not care what he does in this House, how he pledges his constituents, or 'how he brings the Ministry into disrepute and contempt. There is no doubt that they will be brought into disrepute and contempt if this proposal is carried through. </para>

                            <para>- To the Government, who are bringing the measure forward. Are not the members of the Government responsible for their own acts? Do they think so little about what they do that they put forward this proposal in a light-hearted way? If this moribund House were to accept a proposal which would encourage the creation of a big manufacturing whisky distillery, .and so on, it would not be studying the interests of the community. When we find, moreover, that it would be done at a cost of about £150,000. to be extracted from the pockets of other citizens, the proposal is seen to be still more reprehensible. When we find, further, that it would have the effect of putting between ,£100,000 and ,£120,000 into the pockets of one set of individuals, then it becomes tinged with suspicion, and we cannot but see that it is the last step which the Parliament ought to take. I cast no reflection upon the big distiller who wishes to carry on his business in that way. If the Excise duty and the import duty were exactly the same, I would have no more objection to him than 1 would to any other citizen carrying on the business. In fact, if I had to make a choice between the two, provided that the quality was the same, I should accept the local article as against the imported article, merely because my prejudice - I do not say my reason - happened to run in that way. If this Parliament adopted such a proposal then, so far from blaming the particular firm to whom it had made a large grant, I should wish that I had even one-half df the money. It must be perfectly understood that we make no reflection upon the members of this firm - I do not think I have ever seen them - in their private capacity as citizens. It is only when a man comes along and says, " I am entitled to some help as against other citizens ' ' that I object. The moment he says to me, " I ought to have some privileges which are not accorded to others," I object. The moment he says, " You have a right to guarantee me the interest on my money," I say, " If that is so, other citizens have a right to get guaranteed work. If you make any profit it shall be distributed amongst the other citizens." Other citizens, if they have the power, have the right to take from him in exactly the same measure as he would take from' th'em if he had the power. I so strongly object to any one citizen or class of citizens being fostered at the expense of any other class that I oppose this proposal <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline> There is another matter, of course, to be considered, and that is, that the high duty proposed would lead to a serious loss of revenue. If that loss were to bring about a diminution of  drinking, I should perhaps not abject. But when the decrease of revenue would not bring about a decrease of drinking, but would establish grog factories, of which, as his votes seem to show, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, seems to be so much in favour, it is an entirely reprehensible proposal. We ought not to be asked to depart from the principle which we established when we fixed the difference between the import duty and the Excise dutv at such a rate that we practically said, " We shall have all the grog that is sent into consumption under our control."' Of course, we lose control of the grog immediately the duty has been paid ; but there are a hundred-and-one different: ways of getting over that difficulty. When the grog is imported, the quantity in the cask can be gauged, and the amount to be paid can be estimated. But if it were distilled here we should never be able to estimate or discover what the leakage was. Moreover, it would be the means of training scores of men in the art of distilling, and it would encourage in other ways the growth of sly-grog shops throughout Australia. Because if the industry were profitable those trained men would want to start on their own account. I trust that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports now perceives the dangerous position in which he has placed himself; that he will recognise that this is not a matter to 'jest over, and that if he really believes in those principles of temperance which he has so often advocated on the platform, he will take care by his vote not to set them aside. During the last four or five years we have had a fairly large difference between the import duty and the Excise duty - too targe a difference in my opinion - and no explanation can gloss over the fact that the proposal of the Government, if adopted, would increase the difference so greatly _ that it would practically bring into existence places for the manufacture of grog, and grog only. If its acceptance would be attended with that result, then it is a departure from previous legislation. "Under any circumstances - good or bad - the very last House to deal with a question of this sort where the direct result would be to put so much money into the hands of individuals, and to create a big grog shop is one which is in the last hours of its existence. If, in the last session of a Parliament, we were to pass such proposals we should never know where we were, and the danger would be that in every succeeding Parliament, just as happened in America, when men thought that they were not going to present themselves for re-election, or believed that they were likely to be defeated, they would vote for any measure, however dishonest it might be, which happened to be brought forward. The acceptance of the proposal before the Committee would, in, my opinion,' seriously jeopardize the standing which this Parliament has obtained in the eyes of the community. It would be impossible to explain to the people - in fact, nobody could explain why it had agreed to put £100,000 into the pockets of one firm of distillers. </para>

                    <para>Mir. CONROY.- How much brandy is there in the distillery ? Very little ! For the reason .1 have already given, I put it at £100,000; 4s. would have made it £125,000. Honorable members cannot get away from the fact that, if the Committee passes the motions; which have been moved, the direct result will be a difference of £1.00,000 in the value of those spirits. I am glad to have had the opportunity to draw attention to the danger of doing anything like this. Honorable members may talk as they like, but will not the inference be drawn by sensible persons that these men were able to arrange with one or two of the managers of Parliament to have passed a measure which should not be passed? Their success will lead . to attempts at the subornation of honorable members. In my opinion, we should hesitate about passing these, proposals in the very last session of the Parliament, and, no doubt, only shortly before the political end of several of us. The Minister who brought them forward does not dare to defend them. He has run away from them, unable to meet the charges which have been levelled against him. The members of the Labour Party are in a very peculiar position. The more they examine these proposals the more reason must they find for suspicion. But, while they may attempt to justify them to their constituents, I shall not do likewise, because I do not believe that they are founded on justice, or that they will lead to the sobriety of the people. </para>

                        <para>. - The action of the Minister in respect to this matter is extraordinary. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in moving a motion affecting the duty on harvesters, intimated that the Government had not made up its mind as to accepting, whether with or without amendment, the proposals of the Tariff Commission. That was a perfectly legitimate statement, seeing that he asked for the imposition of the duty recommended by a section of the Commission merely to protect the revenue. The Government did not commit itself to the proposal when brought forward, but promised further consideration, and, if necessary, amendment. But the honorable gentleman told us that, having given consideration to the recommendations of the Commission in regard to alterations of the spirit duties, the Ministry had decided to introduce proposals which differed from those of the Commission. He did not say, "Accept the Commission's recommendation until we have had an opportunity to consider the matter." He said, " We have considered them and do not approve of them. We therefore ask you to accept different proposals, which we put forward." This afternoon, however, he. told us that it is likely that further proposals, at any rate <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> regard to Excise, will be introduced, but that he wishes time to consider this question at greater length. We are entitled to something more than mere proposals. We should have some guarantee of the correctness and accuracy of the conclusions of the Ministry. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister told us that he had taken advice before submitting his proposals, and he professed to regard the advice as reliable. But why does he now tell us that he will probably alter the proposals founded upon that advice? I may say, in passing, that it is very objectionable to have to deal with first one Minister and then another in connexion with a. measure. I realize that sometimes a Minister cannot help being called away from the House, but the Minister of Customs is continuously away when, measures of which he is supposed to be in charge are before Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- That may be. I hope that the Treasurer will demonstrate it. Then, again, it is rather extraordinary that we should be asked to delay our decision until the Minister of Trade and Customs has had time to consider certain matters which are likely to cause him to alter his opinion, and that then the Minister should go right away, and apparently abandon all consideration of the question. With regard' to distillation generally, I am rather in favour of the policy of New Zealand, which has abandoned local distillation. It was recognised that the amount of labour employed in the industry was exceedingly small, and that not one penny more was paid for agricultural produce in consequence of local distillers carrying on business. The prices of products such as wheat and barley were ruled by the rates prevailing in outside markets, which were equivalent to those offered for grain for local distillation purposes. . It was realized further, that imported spirits were the source of such a large amount of revenue that it was not desirable to interfere with them, and it was also felt that the extra revenue that might be obtained from the duties on imported spirits, were there no distillation, could be applied in such a manner as to confer greater advantage upon the community than would be derived from the small amount of employment that might be afforded by the distilling industry. I regard the matter in very much the same light, but Ido not propose to go deeply into it now, because I recognise that we are dealing with a proposal to increase the import duties, and that the question to which I have been referring is connected more directly with the Excise duties. The Minister of Trade and Customs claimed that if the import duties were increased by1s. per gallon, no loss of revenue would result.. He pointed out that under his present proposals - we do not know what they will be eventually - there will be the same difference between the Excise and import duties as under the proposals of the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- It looks very much like that. The Government are, in effect, saying to honorable members, " Gentlemen, tell us your opinions, and we shall decide when we have ascertained the feeling of the majority." The Minister of Trade and Customs maintains that the proposed increased import duties would not result in any reduction of the revenue. I would point out, however, that if the incr eased import duty lead to a larger consumption of locally manufactured spirit, there must be a loss of revenue. Although, under the Minister's proposal, the same proportion is preserved between import and Excise duties as under the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, the latter stops short at the present level, so far as the import duties are concerned. Apparently, the Commission considered that if they increased the duties upon imported spirits, a reduction of the revenue would ensue. The Minister's conclusion cannot be supported, because the increase of the import duties to 15s.per gallon may so reduce the profit of those who sell spirits, and who say that they are now very heavily handicapped, and have gone as far as they can, that there, will be a far heavier run upon locally produced spirit. Consequently, the revenue might be much more reduced under the Minister's proposal than under that of the Commission. I admit that it is difficult to arrive at a conclusion in this connexion; but I would point out that the right honorable member for Balaclava, who was one of the most reliable Treasurers that Victoria ever had, did not, after his experience of the 15s. per gallon duty that was levied in Victoria, share the opinion of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Although the revenue did not increase when the duty was reduced to 12s., it maintained about the same level. </para>

Although the figures in. my' possession do not show that a much larger revenue was produced, by the duty of 12s. per gallon, they do show that there must have been a larger consumption of imported spirits, otherwise the 12s. per gallon duty could not have produced practically the same amount of revenue as was collected under the 15s. per gallon rate. </para>

                            <para>- It is not the increased consumption that we have to consider, but how far the Government can absorb the profit to an extent which can be withstood by those engaged in the trade. If it be absorbed we may be sure that they will not cease to sell spirit, but that they will be forced to sell a cheaper article. That would have the effect of reducing the revenue, even if Excise were paid upon it. The Barton Government, of which several members of the present Ministry were members, deliberately resisted a proposal to increase ' the duty upon imported spirits to 15s. per gallon. The reason which they urged for their action, was that such a high duty must lead to a reduced consumption of imported spirits, and consequently to loss of revenue. The present Government have abandoned the position which was taken up by a previous Administration., of which a number of Ministers were members. Now, I come to the Tariff Commission. I feel very disinclined to dissent from the decision of that body, which has taken a vast amount of evidence all over Australia, and which has given the matter the fullest and most careful consideration. In this connexion we must recollect that the Commission was composed of members of opposite fiscal views, . and, seeing that they have arrived at a unanimous decision, I am reluctant to disturb their recommendations. I recognise that upon that Commission were members who would give full attention to the possible financial effect of their recommendations, as well as to other considerations. I realize also that they were not of one way of thinking fiscally, and consequently were not all biassed in one direction. It is evident from their reports, too, that they had the health and well-being of the community in mind when they were framing their recommendations. Under these circumstances - unless the Minister can show that the Commission was absolutely wrong, and that he is right. I am very reluctant to depart from its finding. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly he would. I give the same credit to those honorable members of this Committee who were members of the Tariff Commission. Other members of that body might not have deemed it necessary to give the. matter the same amount of consideration, but I am perfectly certain that those who have to deal with our Estimates and with our Ways and Means made no recommendation without first considering what would be its effect upon the revenue. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has shown by his speech to-day, that that aspect of the question was considered. I should now like to say a few words in reference to the amendment of the honorable member for Bland regarding the Customs duties upon imported spirits. I fear that he submitted his amendment with too little consideration, and that if it be enforced at once a most serious position will arise. He practically proposes that no spirits shall be admitted into the Commonwealth unless they have been matured in wood for two years. It is really ridiculous to spring a surprise of that sort upon a trade which Parliament has had under its control for years. If the amendment were adopted, what would happen? A quantity of spirits are now in bond - not in wood, but in bottle. A large quantity are upon the sea in bottle, and a large quantity have been ordered in bottle. How can these spirits be matured in wood for two years? The Prime Minister, I think, will recognise the difficulty to which I refer. If he sees any difference between my reading of the amendment and his own, he might inform me of it. My reading of the proposal of the honorable member for Bland is that spirits must be matured in wood for two years before they are permitted to pay the import duty. How can such a proposal be applied to bottled spirit which is in bond, or- upon the sea, or which has already been ordered ? </para>

                            <para>- Or necessary. L shall refer to that in regard to rectified spirits at a later stage. In the absence of proper notice, the proposal of the honorable member for Bland would practically lead to the confiscation of the spirits to which I have referred. In reply to an interjection which I made whilst the honorable member was speaking, he stated that the spirits to which I have alluded could be kept in bond for two years. Has the honorable member any idea of the cost of keeping anything, and especially volatile articles such as spirits - which diminish by evaporation - in bond for two years? The cost would be so exceedingly heavy as to amount practically to the confiscation of a large proportion of the 'goods from- people who had done no wrong, but who, on the contrary, had been importing their spirits for years under a different Government system, and surely ought to receive due notice before any alteration in that system is made. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring only to notice of the departure from what has hitherto been the practice. An attempt is to be made to cause importers to do that which is impossible, by providing that spirits shall have been matured in wood for two years before duty is paid upon them. Spirits might come out in cases and might have been matured for four or five years, but no satisfactory evidence of that could be given to the Department, and consequently a great deal of their value would be forfeited. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. But as, I have said, the keeping of spirits in bond for two years would be a very costly proceeding, and, before we required that to be done, we should give due notice to those Concerned. Another reason why we should be very careful in adopting this proposal, both in regard to spirits that are the subject of import and of Excise duties, is that if it were at once rigidly inforced, the revenue would go down very rapidly, since there would not be sufficient spirit available which could be shown to have been matured in wood two years. </para>

Whatever may be the intentions of the honorable member for Bland, his amendment, iri the bald form in which it is proposed, would practically be wrongfully injurious to a large number of traders. It would almost be impossible to carry it out without largely stopping the supply of spirits, and consequently reducing, the revenue to a very serious extent. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I saw a communication addressed to the honorable and learned member for Angas, which he has, perhaps, put before the Committee, and in which it is stated that rectified spirit actually deteriorates by being kept. I know nothing as to the correctness of that statement ; but, according to high scientific authorities, a rectified spirit cannot be further matured. ' On the other hand, it is said that the maturing of spirit containing ethers is necessary, since it would be injurious if used soon after leaving the pot-still. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say anything in regard to that point, but Ministers, who have the departmental experts to advise them, should consider the question, and decide whether each of these spirits should be treated in the same way. I have already said that I prefer the duty of 14s. proposed by the Tariff Commission to the duty of 15 s. proposed by the Ministry. I have that preference largely because I am informed, by the best authorities I can consult - including the honorable member for Balaclava, some members of the Barton Ministry who refused to raise the duty when asked to do so, and also the Tariff Commission - that a duty of 14s. is more favorable as regards revenue than 15s., and will lead to a less use of, I shall not say inferior spirit, but, at any rate, of the cheaper spirit, which has not realized the same revenue as has the imported article. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot help feeling that the Government appear to be treating this business in a somewhat slip-shod manner. When we are dealing with Tariff reform, surely we are entitled to the presence of the Minister of Trade and Customs, if it is at all possible for him to be here. The difficulty is that, in the absence of the Minister for Trade and Customs, we are not able to get def inite proposals from the Government. </para>

                        <para>- We are unwittingly, it appears to me, drifting into a complex position. We were discussing, first of all, the general proposal to impose a duty of 15s. instead of a duty of 14s. Apparently, that discussion was closed, for the question was about to be put when the honorable member for Bland, assuming the general discussion to have terminated, or, at all events, in the exercise of his undoubted right, submitted his amendment. That amendment must be disposed of before we can reach the question whether or not a duty of 15s. shall be imposed. I think it will be admitted that the question whether the duty shall be 14s. or 15 s. or 13s. has nothing to do with this proposal as to the time which shall be allowed for the maturing of imported spirits, in order that the same restrictions may be imposed in this connexion as are intended by the Tariff Commission, and by the Government to apply to spirit manufactured in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- And, perhaps, quite rightly. But, at the same time, when I am asked to enter into the question of revenue, while we are confronted with the amendment of the honorable member for Bland, it appears to me that we shall only increase rather than diminish the confusion. We should not turn to the revenue phase before we have disposed of that amendment. </para>

We could then dispose of this question. I admit that it would be necessary to follow that up with some interim proposal to cover spirit already shipped. I have had some consultation with the officers of the Department, but in the meantime, in order that we may deal with one thing at a time, if the honorable member for Bland accepts for his amendment the form suggested by the Tariff Commission, we can dispose of it,, get face to face with the vital question as to whether the duty should be 15s. or 14s., and concentrate our attention upon that. That will meet the wishes of the honorable member for Boothby that we should deal with one point at a time, especially as the current discussion is quite foreign to the question of revenue or the amount of duty to be imposed. </para>

                            <para>- When we "are imposing new, and in some respects severe, conditions, the least we can do is to give those interested due notice. I suppose that nobody desires to deal harshly with people. After we have made their occupation legitimate no one wishes i.o abruptly deprive them of anything they are already in the enjoyment of, except in a fair and proper way. The honorable member for Bland had better leave this matter to be dealt with in the Bill to which reference has been made. I should like again to appeal to the Prime Minister to allow the whole question to stand over until to-morrow, when I understand he has in contemplation the bringing down of some amending proposal. </para>

                        <para>.- Assuming that we do carry some amendment on the lines suggested by the honorable member for Bland, of course it is right that it should only be made operative after period of two years to get over the difficulty referred to by the honorable member for North Sydney, and also to the difficulty we will have to face in connexion with blended brandy and whisky. If we adopt this amendment as affecting imports, we must retain it also as regards the Excise provisions, which prescribe, not only that pot-still, but rectified, spirit must be matured for two years. Is it clear .that we should make that provision in regard to rectified spirit at all? If the amendment pf the honorable member for Bland be carried, it will apply, not only to pot-still whisky or brandy, which requires maturation in order to eliminate certain volatile oils", which in the pot-still process pass over into the distillate, but it will also apply to rectified spirit, the rectification of which is supposed to get rid of those oils, so far as they can be got rid of, for commercial purposes, and to secure a silent spirit, which, of course, is never really secured in the sense in which it is regarded by chemists. The morning after these resolutions were introduced, it was pointed out to me that there was not in all Australia a rectified spirit two years old. </para>

                            <para>- It is with that amendment I am dealing, and at the same time with the suggestion that it should be amended in a certain direction to secure the application of that principle after a period of two years has elapsed. The effect of the amendment will be that before a spirit is put on the market for consumption, whether it be pot-still spirit or a blend of whisky, brandy, gin, or anything else, it must have matured for two years. The application of the principle is not to come into effect until after a period of two years has elapsed, and whether from the date of shipment, or the passing of the resolutions does not matter. A strong opinion has been expressed to me, not only by letter, but also personally by men who seem to know their business, to the effect that it is not necessary to mature anything except the 25 per cent, element, and that rectified spirit does not improve, and in some cases really deteriorates, by keeping. I am informed that gin actually deteriorates by being ( kept in wood, because it absorbs some of the tannic acid from the wood, and is also discoloured by it. For that reason, in South Australia they do not keep gin iri wood, but in some sort of metal tanks. I have no wish to trespass on the time of honorable members by 1 reading a letter on this point from a man who can speak with authority, seeing that he has been engaged in the distillation of brandy, whisky, and liqueurs for many years, and whose testimony is borne out by Excise officers. I have tested this matter, not merely bv the information of persons who might seem to be interested, but of officials connected with the Government, and they bear out what is stated by my correspondent. I shall read a. short extract from the letter, as it puts the matter very clearly. </para>

                        <para>The present Tariff regulations prescribe that such rectified spirit shall be at least two years old, but as there is no spirit of such age obtainable in the Commonwealth, and as very few distillers have blended more than six months ahead, it can be seen at once that the sale of pure South Australian grape brandy has been stopped. </para>
                        <para>The object of ageing spirits has a clear and distinct reason. When spirits are distilled on the pot still from either wine <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> malt, various volatile oils are passed over into the distillate". During the period of maturation in wood these oils are gradually oxidized and converted into fragrant ethers. The spirituous portion itself, we desire to emphasize, does not materially change during that period. Attempts have been made at various times to place on the market a pure pot still brandy, but owing to the excessive quantity of ethers it is distinctly unpalatable, and has had to be withdrawn. In order to make the flavour of the brandy more harmonious it is blended with certain proportions of pure rectified grape spirit in the manner already indicated. </para>
                        <para>It is an indisputable scientific fact that a highly rectified grape spirit does not change or alter its chemical properties by ageing, and we believe we are correct in saying that it has not been deemed necessary by the authorities of other countries to make this proviso in their regulations. </para>
                        <para>The South Australian distillers are unanimous in their opinion that pot still spirit should be aged in wood for a period of two years before entering into consumption, but they are also strongly of opinion that no possible benefit could be derived from applying this proviso to rectified spirit. </para>
                        <para>We have ourselves been manufacturers of liqueurs and bitters for over fifty years, and as a matter of fact Seppeltsfield has been built up on the foundations laid down by these two lines. . </para>
                        <para>Pure rectified grape spirit enters very largely into their manufacture, and the two years' proviso has, we are afraid, also effectively stopped this branch of industry. </para>
                        <para>Under the old tariff we were able to clear our spirit at11s. per proof gallon, but unless such spirit is now two years old it will have to pay a duty of 40s. per proof gallon, which of course is out of the question, more so as similar imported goods will be able to enter at 15s. per proof gallon, and put the local product out of the market. </para>
                        <para>Pure neutral rectified spirit is a regular article of commerce. It is largely used by druggists, and has moreover a widespread application. To store such spirit for a period of two years in wood completely discolours it, and as a considerable quantity of tannic acid is absorbed it becomes useless for such purposes. </para>

                        <para>. - Notwithstanding what the honorable member for Angas has said about some honorable members wishing the Committee to " bolt " the recommendations of the Tariff Commission whole, I think it is to be deplored that it has allowed itself to drift into the present desultory discussion. I do not think that honorable members fully realize where we are. We have just listened to a most complete treatise on the chemistry of distillation, and the honorable member who has made that contribution seems to me to have lost sight of the fact that to-night the Committee is taking a step which may aim a serious blow at Royal Commissions in the future. Honorable members are talking of the Tariff Commission as if it were simply a Select Committee of the House, forgetful of the fact that the question which is being discussed, and into which I do not intend to enter, because I am not competent to discuss its merits, is really one on which the Commission has been sitting for over fifteen months. Why did the House require this and other questions to be referred, not to a Select Committee, but to a Commission composed of men who were supposed to have time and inclination to make a deep study of the questions involved, in the light of an enormous mass of evidence which was to be brought forward? </para>

                            <para>- Well, I should apply the same answer. The members of the Tariff Commission sat for over fifteen months; they sacrificed .their personal convenience, and listened to volumes of evidence from all sides; and the Committee appears to attach so little importance to the judicial aspect of their report that it is now proceeding to drift into a debate on one of the very questions which the Commission has settled. And on what testimony is it being asked to upset those conclusions ? On the one-sided testimony of a number of discontented people who had their chance of submitting all the facts, which, if submitted, were duly considered. The Minister puts the Committee in a most humiliating position. When he came forward, what did he say ? With very little ceremony - which I think should have received some notice from the Prime Minister - he moved a motion which involved a stultification of the conclusions at which the Commission had arrived. He actually said that his proposals were at the present time in an undecided form, but he would like the Committee to "thresh them out." For what reason? Presumably that he might ascertain what it thought before he put his proposal into a definite form. </para>

                            <para>- I do not hope to impress the honorable member ; I address myself to those who have had political experience, and recognise with me the great importance of this situation. I am much disappointed that the Prime Minister has shown so little appreciation of the seriousness of the situation as to fail to make a statement of his reasons for departing from the traditions and practices of Parliaments. I do not say that if a Royal Com-" mission makes a demonstrable blunder, obvious to all, its recommendation should be accepted, but when a Royal Commission has been appointed by the Crown to examine difficult and complex questions, to take evidence on all sides, on oath, and bring up an impartial finding, its conclusions should not be treated in the haphazard and cavalier way in which the Minister for Trade and Customs has dealt with the conclusions of the Tariff Commission. He had not a resolution ready to place before the Committee, and, when it was pointed out to him that we were being called upon to debate something which had not been put into the form of a definite issue, he said, "Well, I should like honorable members to thresh the matter out," presumably to give him an inkling as to the opinions of the majority, so that he may act accordingly, and so that the Government may float with the tide, instead, possibly, of struggling against it. I do not hesitate to say that if I were in the position of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo as Chairman of the Royal Commission, I should throw up my commission, because of , the contempt with which he and his colleagues have been treated by the Government. What evidence has the Minister resorted to to show that the Commission misunderstood this question ? I received today, as I suppose every other honorable member did, a copy of a letter addressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs by the South Australian Wine Growers'" Association, beginning - </para>

                            <para>- We can have it at the wrong time. The Commission has dealt judicially with an immense mass of evidence given on oath, and it is not only unfair, but an insult, to the Commission to put aside their conclusions because of <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> and unworn statements of persons who probably gave evidence which was considered of less weight than evidence in support of a contrary view. In its far-reaching consequences the want of appreciation of the dignity of the Commission shown by the Prime Minister and the Government mav be, a verv serious matter. If I, or any other honorable member, were now asked to sit upon a Commission, what would be the obvious answer? Would it not be said, " I might give mv time, and sacrifice my personal interests, for fifteen months, or more, and, having arrived at sound judicial conclusions in regard to an immense body of evidence, might then find that a Minister bad invited interested parties, who were disappointed with the findings of the Commission, to send in objections, and on them would be ready to set aside the Commission's recommendations " ? </para>

                            <para>- I have not said ,. so, nor is that inference to be drawn from v any sentence I have uttered. What I say is, that it would be impossible for honorable members to deal with, in a night or in a week, the evidence which the Commission took on oath from persons of all shades of opinion, and in regard to which they made unanimous recommendations. The Minister proposes to set aside, these recommendations because of the statement of persons who are admittedly interested, and who gave evidence before the Commission. It is as if, after the parties had stated their respective cases on oath in a Court of law, and the jury had given its verdict, one of them had said to the Judge, " I want you to hear me again, with a view to upset the verdict, because I am dissatisfied with it." I hope that the members of the Commission will take the step which. I have suggested, so that the country may realize the seriousness of what is being done. If I were one of them, I should throw up my commission at once, and not file another report. If the Government had a true sense of the constitutional importance of the situation it would refuse to allow the Minister of Trade and Customs to practically tout for objections from interested parties against the conclusions of the Commission, and would accept the recommendations of the body which they were practically the means of appointing, and which has made practically a judicial examination of the whole subject. </para>

                        <para>.- The advice offered to the members of the Commission by the honorable and learned member for Parkes is no doubt very good, from his point of view ; but it must be remembered that a Commission may do many things that do not come within the scope of its functions. I can find nothing in the shape of an instruction to the Commissioners that they were to take upon themselves the responsibility of the Executive with regard to the probable effect of their recommendations upon the revenue. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to give the members of the Commission every credit for having undertaken to perform an important public duty at great inconvenience, and perhaps some expense, to themselves. It is well, however, to remember that one of the ablest of British Prime Ministers stated that when the Government were in a corner, the proper thing for them to do was to appoint a Commission. It was in such an emergency that the Tariff Commission was appointed. The members of that body have worked hard, and have no doubt done their duty to the country faithfully and well, but that has nothing to do with the point to which I wish to direct attention. The commission reads as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- If I had been a member of the Commission, I venture to say that I should have given some attention to that matter; but I contend that the Commissioners have no power to go beyond the powers conferred upon them by the terms of their commission. If it had been intended that the Commission should consider the effect of their proposals upon the revenue, that fact should have been clearly set forth in the reference to the Commission. I am not complaining of the action of the Commissioners, nor can I blame the Government for taking up the position that they cannot afford to lose the amount of revenue that would have to be surrendered if the recommendations of the Commission were adopted. But I agree with the honorable and learned member for Parkes that the Government should have laid before honorable members such facts and figures as would have afforded justification for the action they have taken. On the other hand, I think that if it is demonstrated to the Commissioners that their recommendations, however excellent, would, if carried out, result in a loss of revenue which the Commonwealth could not afford to incur, they should not object to their proposals being modified. The fact that a man is appointed as a member of a Commission does not add to his intelligence or to his ability to conduct public affairs. </para>

The Government have not vouchsafed to honorable members the information which should have been afforded as to their reasons for departing from the recommendations of the Commission, and I trust that they will realize that they cannot deal with important matters such as that now before us, in a haphazard way. They should submit the fullest information, and afford honorable members every opportunity to arrive at a conclusion that would be in the best interests of the country. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable and learned member for Parkes has, to my mind, advanced rather a novel idea in respect of the work of Royal Commissions. I do not know whether he intended to go so far, but the plain inference to be drawn from his statement, was that we must accept <inline font-style="italic">holus bolus</inline> the decisions of Royal Commissions. </para>

                            <para>- I can draw no other conclusion from the statements of the honorable and learned member. If he did not mean that, it seems to me that his speech was merely a beating of the air. I have as keen an appreciation of the work of the Tariff Commission as has any honorable member. I recognise that the gentlemen comprising that body have made a great number of sacrifices in performing the immense work which they have accomplished. But the value of their labours consists in a very large measure in the information which they have been able to put before the public through the evidence which has been tendered, and does not rest entirely upon the conclusions at which they have arrived. That is so in regard to all Royal Commissions. Their main object is to get information, and while I confess that much may occasionally be learned from the demeanour of witnesses - and that therefore the Commissioners are best able to judge of the conclusions which should be drawn from the testimony of witnesses - still it does not follow that they are right in every case. </para>

It has reported, and consequently has ceased to have any further responsibility. The witnesses had no opportunity of commenting upon the conclusions of the Commission until they were invited to do so. The recommendation to which I have referred is- in itself a sufficient justification for further inquiries being made. </para>

                            <para>- It has finally dealt with this particular matter. The honorable member seems to be oblivious of that fact. When once the Commission has reported, its members have nothing further to do with this question. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, as Chairman of the Commission, stated in reply to a gentleman who wished to give further evidence in regard to its conclusions that the matter had now passed out of the hands of that body. The small distinction which has been made between the duty upon brandy produced from grape spirit, and that upon blended brandy is in itself an evidence that the Commission has not sufficiently appreciated the difference between the cost of the materials from which these two classes of spirits are distilled. </para>

                            <para>- It is ; but it does not happen to touch the particular point to which I am addressing myself. The Com. mission recommend that a protection of 4s. per gallon shall be granted to pure brandy, and of 3s. per gallon to blended brandy. The difference between the cost of the materials from which these two classes of spirit are made is so great that the margin between the two rates of duty is, to my mind, insufficient. No doubt, it is a matter upon which there is room for a legitimate difference of opinion. </para>

                        <para>.- Although I have no desire to be heard too frequently upon this matter, so much has been said regarding the unfortunate Tariff Commission that I am justified in making a few observations in reply. If many members of that Commission had followed their natural inclinations, they would have resigned from it long ago. Probably that would have suited a good many honorable members. Speaking for myself, and, I believe, for many other members of the Commission, I may say that we realized that we had been appointed to perform an important and necessary duty. We realized that an experimental Tariff had been in existence in the Commonwealth for a few years, and that it was highly desirable that an inquiry of a thoroughly exhaustive nature should be made into its effect. Recognising this, I accepted a position on the Commission, and, in spite of the blackguardly attacks made upon it outside the House, I made up my mind that I would see the work through. That I am determined to do, regardless of what transpires, either inside or outside the House, in the nature of attacks upon the Commission and its work. The honorable and learned member for Parkes has come to the rescue of the Commission in a way that I, for one, fully appreciate. Although this debate has been in progress for only a few hours, I have heard an insinuation of something very like corruption against the Commission, and I have also heard insinuations of ignorance and incompetence against its members. One cannot help wondering what will be the outcome if this sort of thing is to continue. Probably we shall find the members of the Commission with armoured cars and machine guns to protect them from the outraged opinions of their colleagues in the Chamber. Be that as it may, if the Committee will exercise only a little patience, and listen, to what the members of the Commission may have to say in response to Ministerial proposals, we shall be able to fully justify any recommendations that we have made. We are in the unfortunate position of having little or nothing to which to reply; we are in the position of having to prove practically a negative. It is the duty of the Government, who bring down modifications of our proposals, to show the reasons for those modifications, and, in the absence of such reasons, members of the Commission are naturally handicapped in dealing with this matter. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly ; but since the Commission is being put on its defence in this House, this difficulty applies in a greater degree to its members. The honorable and learned member for Parkes referred very properly to the methods of the Minister in obtaining information from sources other than those that were open to the Commission. The honorable member for Wide Bay has also pointed out that it is the duty of Ministers to obtain all information possible with respect to the question of revenue - a phase of this question which could be touched upon only incidentally by the Commission. I agree with that, but I wish to point out that quotations have been made in this Chamber from letters which have apparently influenced the Minister, letters from individuals who had opportunities to give evidence before the Commission, but refrained from doing so. I am going to state why they did not come before us. It is much easier for these people to address to honorable members letters containing more or less mystifying and incorrect statements than to go before a Commission, which will put them on their oath, and make them responsible for their statements. We have had a good deal of technical instruction from members of the Committee regarding pure and impure spirits, and as to what constitutes genuine brandy, and that which is not genuine. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I am of opinion that it would have been much better for those who talk about genuine brandy to have said nothing in that connexion, so far as the proposals of the Commission are concerned. Those who make genuine Australian brandy are perhaps in a better position, under the recommendation of the Commission, than they will be when the full and fierce light of discussion is thrown on their situation in common with that of the manufacturers of other classes of spirit. We have been told that it is not fair, for instance, to put blended brandy in competition with that which is not blended. A great deal of emphasis has been laid upon the quality of the so called pure Australian brandies. We have been told that much of the spirit required for the fortification of those brandies is highly rectified*. Why is that so? The honorable member who gave us that information omitted to tell the Committee 'that it was necessary to rectify the fortifying spirit since it is largely produced from "off" or unsound wine, and that it has to be rectified in order to avoid the deleterious effect of the sources of its origin. Then again, it is suggested that the brandy which Australia produces from the grape is the finest that can be made anywhere. I make bold to say. that there is not a single gallon of Australian brandy distilled according to the methods of that district of France in which the purest and most perfect kinds of brandy are produced ; that the method of manufacture is more or less defective, and that if we are going to insist on a genuine brandy, we shall have to provide, first of all, that no "off" or damaged wine shall be used in its production, and that secondly, the proper method of distillation shall be observed. That method is to employ the old-fashioned pot-still similar to that used in the Charente district of France, for producing the highest quality of brandy. If those two points were observed, it might be well worth our while to consider the suggestions of those who wish to protect more completely than at present brandy made from the pure juice of the grape. But . until that is done, I would suggest to those who are asking for more consideration for Australian brandy that they should ask' themselves whether it is worth while insisting on conditions which necessarily will have to be amplified if our brandies are to be of the perfect kind indicated by several honorable members. We have been told by honorable members that highly rectified spirit does not require to be kept in order to mature. But one gentleman interested in distillation by the patent still process - I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> - expressed the opinion, when before the Commission, that even that class of spirit required to be matured ; he advocated that it should be kept in bond for not less than two years. That is the evidence of a gentleman interested in the production of this particular class of spirit. It is undoubtedly a very technical and abstract matter. </para>
