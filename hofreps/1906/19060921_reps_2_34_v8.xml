                    <para class="block">When the schedule was under consideration in Committee, the Minister moved the inclusion of fertilizers and seed drills, on the ground that they were similar to the other articles therein included. though the similarity between corn-shellers and huskers, and fertilizers and seed drills is past the comprehension of any man. I have not had time to look the matter up, but my recollection is that the Tariff Commission declined to recommend an increase in the duties on fertilizers and seed drills, on the ground that, being covered largely by patent rights, they were manufactured chiefly in America, very few being made here. I ask the Chairman of the Commission if that is not so? </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw it, if it is unparliamentary. When a Minister leads honorable members to believe that what he is proposing is in accord with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, and the contrary is the fact, they may be left to draw their own conclusions. I need not trv to characterize such conduct. My complaint is that the Minister led the Committee to believe that fertilizers and seed drills were practically in the same category as the other items in the schedule, and, believing that the Tariff Commission had made a recommendation supporting his action, we permitted them to be inserted? </para>

                        <para>. - It is a surprise to me that the Minister wishes to increase the duties on fertilizers and seed drills. These machines are most necessary. They play a great part in the dry farming to which so much attention has been devoted of late. Indeed, it is impossible to carry out certain operations without them. The Victorian Government has ordered from America because no machine of the kind can be obtained here. If a few sample machines are introduced, and they were not protected by patents, our agricultural implement manufacturers will very soon enter upon the work of producing similar implements adapted to the requirements of our farmers. </para>

The implement to which I referred is not to be obtained h&#39;ere, and we should afford every facility for its introduction, so that our farmers may have the benefit of the latest inventions. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the honorable member is in error in speaking of the implement that is being imported by the Victorian Government as a fertilizer and seed drill. The Victorian Government are importing a sub-soil packer, a special implement that is used in connexion with dry farming. Fertilizer and seed drills, which were, in the first instance, imported from America, and improved on in Australia, have proved of incalculable benefit to our farmers. The old system of fertilizing was a very expenpensive and cumbrous one, and the introduction of the fertilizer drill and chemical manures has in many ways contributed to economy in cultivation. It is now possible by supplying the necessary plant foods to use the same land over and over again without resorting to the rotation of crops. Soon after the implements were introduced into Australia, the local manufacturers started to turn out a similar article, with improvements to suit local conditions, and now the local production is sufficient to meet all our demands. Not* only so, but the cost of the drills has been very materially decreased. Under these circumstances, I hope that the honorable member for Parramatta will not insist upon the recommittal of the item. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the question. What I say is that the local article is cheaper and more suitable to our requirements than was the imported implement before our manufacturers placed theirs on the market. We can regulate the price so that the farmer will not be over-charged, and I think that we shall act unwisely if we deprive our local manufacturers of the small modicum of protection they now enjoy </para>

                        <para>.- As one keenly interested in agriculture, I heartily support the proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta. I need hardly point out that the bulk of the grain produced in Australia has to be sold in outside markets, and that we should do everything in our power to assist our farmers to produce their crops as cheaply as possible. The honorable member for Laanecoorie informed us that Melbourne manufacturers were making seed drills, but I am informed that they import the parts and merely. put the machines together. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the manufacturing operations here have not reached such a- stage that everything required for. the construction of the machines can be made here, and therefore we should not place any obstacle in the way of importations. It is owing to the inventive genius of the Americans that our farmers, instead of sowing 2 bushels of wheat per acre broadcast, are now able by means of seed drills, to perform their sowing operations with three-quarters of a bushel per acre. Practically everything that the farmer needs is subject to high protective duties, and I think that we should show more consideration for our heavily-burdened agriculturists. Only last night the representatives of the gold miners of Western Australia, and of the coal miners of New South Wales, challenged the proposal of the Government to extend a&#39; preference to fuse and blasting powder imported from the United Kingdom. -They rightly contended that those articles are the tools of trade of the miner. Surely the tools of trade of the farmer are equally entitled to consideration. Honorable members must realize that the prosperity of the country depends upon the agriculturists and the miners. By so much as we levy duties upon their implements, bv so much do we reduce their profits. We have been told that at various times in our history the States Parliaments have recognised their obligations to our primary producers. That fact, however, does not lessen&#39; our responsibility in that connexion. I, therefore, ask honorable members to assist the deputy leader of the Opposition to remove the duty which it is proposed to levy upon seed drills and fertilizers. </para>

                        <para>.- It is quite true that the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission, in their report upon agricultural implements, did not recommend any alteration in the existing rate of duty upon seed drills and fertilizers. This is one of those questions which I feel justified in leaving to the deliberative judgment of the House, without attempting to influence honorable members either one way or the other. I shall content myself with reading from page 15 of Progress Report No. 5 of the Tariff Commission. Under the side heading of &#34;Drills,&#34; I find the following:- </para>

                        <para>Seed drills have been in general use in Australia for about thirty years, but in the year 1900 the manufacture of grain drills, grain and fertilizer drills, ,was commenced by a Victorian implement maker, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Mitchell. For the first two years he fared very badly ;! then he took up an agency for bidders, and put on a large staff of travellers, with the result that, since igo2 his drill sales have been improving. At the present time about 5,000 drills ore imported into, and sold in, Australia every year. If all these drills could be manufactured in Australia instead of being imported, it would mean a tremendous increase in the number of hands employed. At present only between 500 and 600 drills are made in Australia every year. There is, however, every prospect, under better fiscal conditions, of the number increasing. Victorian drills vary in price from ^34 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;v&#62;,</inline> and ^47, according to size. </para>

These articles we recommended should bear a duty of 20 per cent. The third group embraces lighter and less extensive implements, specialties, &#38;c, upon which we recommend that the existing duty of 12^ per cent, should be retained. </para>

He informed the House that these implements were being manufactured very successfully in Australia, and that, as a matter of fact, they were being sold cheaper than the imported article. If his statement be true, it is conclusive evidence that there is no need to levy an increased duty upon these implements. </para>

                            <para>- If the local article were sold at a cheaper rate before the imposition of the duty, it proves that the industry is sufficiently established to exist without the aid of that duty. If it has flourished to such an extent that locally manufactured drills can be sold cheaper than can the imported article, there is no need to continue the duty. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; and only one manufacturer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin,</inline> of South Australia, asked for these duties. Agriculturists say that the locally-manufactured machine is too brittle, and that, although the imported article costs more, its superiority is so marked that they prefer it. I agree with the honorable member for Wilmot, that there appears to be an overweening desire on the part of the members of the Government to pile taxation on the farmer for the advantage more particularly of Victorian manufacturers, and that in taking up this attitude they receive&#39; the support of certain honorable members who are supposed to be representatives of farming constituencies. I believe in making the lot of the farmer, who is handicapped more than any other section of the community, as happy as possible by decreasing taxation in his favour. I would go so far as to remove all taxation from .agricultural implements and machinery. On the other hand, the policy of the Minister has been throughout to unduly advance the cost of implements and machinery ! for farming purposes. The farmer has, so to speak, to pay &#34; through the nose &#34; for everything he buys in order that an advantage may be given to city manufacturers. It is time that we gave the farmers a show. It is time that an emphatic protest were made against this constant piling up of duties against him.

                        <para>. - I appreciate the view expressed by honorable members of the Opposition, that it is desirable that we should, as far as possible, relieve the people of taxation and I sympathize with their objective when they lay stress upon the hardships endured by the farmers as a result of the establishment of agricultural implement making works in Australia. They have laid great stress on the point that if we do not continue to import these machines the farmers will be taxed to a very serious extent. It is to be regretted that they are not prepared to accept information offered by those whose practical experience enables them to speak with authority upon this question. I do not suppose that any electorate embraces a larger proportion of farmers than is to be found in that which I represent; and I do not think that there is a farmer in my constituency who is not prepared to admit that the man who wishes to obtain expensive scrap iron will buy the imported article. On the other hand, if he desires a cheap, reliable article, he will buy the Australian production. </para>

                            <para>- Under the Federal Tariff, none of these farming implements are subject to a dutv of more than 12^ per cent. Under the Victorian Tariff, however, they were dutiable at 15 per cent., but the price lists show that, notwithstanding the reduced duty, no reduction has been made in the price of these imported implements. The importer does not ask for protective duties; he appeals every time for a reduction of duty. It has been proved by evidence, given before the Tariff Commission that, although the Victorian duty on seed drills and ploughs was reduced under the Federal Tariff, no reduction was made on the selling price of the imported implements. It is strange that if the manufacturers of the imported implements had to pay more for their raw materia&#93;, the Australian manufacturer, who would have been subject to exactly the same conditions, did not see fit to increase his prices in the same degree. I was one of the first to recognise that that section of the Commission which recommended an increased duty on certain agricultural implements made one important omission1 in failing to recommend that a reduction in the selling price of the locally-made articles should be required. The Government have provided in the Bill that a reduction in the price of harvesters shall follow the imposition of the increased duty, and I ask them to insert a similar provision with regard to seed drills. If that be done, we shall be able to test the prophetic powers of those honorable members who say that the increased dutv will raise the price to the consumer. We could provide that within a certain period a reduction of 10 per cent, in the selling price shall take place. Would the Opposition be satisfied with a provision of that kind? </para>

Have not all the improvements been due to the practical knowledge and inventive genius of Australian &#39; mechanics? A standard machine, known as the Superior drill, when first imported from America, was placed in the hands of two or three agents, but made no headway in the market. Eventually, an engineer and implement-maker secured the agency, and within three years, as the result of his labours, the implement practically took pride of place, and came to be generally favoured by the farmers. This was the result of considerable expense - which was doubtless borne largely by the owner of the implements - and much work on the part of this engineer, who brought to bear his ability and knowledge of local conditions, and effected considerable&#39; improvements. </para>

But instead of the man getting any benefit from his invention, the owners of the machine got what profits there were in it, and, as soon as it was perfected, took the agency out of his hands and gave it to another man who had been sent from America. </para>

                            <para>- Machines made abroad have to be adapted to local conditions, the best results being obtainable only when local knowledge is applied by men of skill and experience. These machines are now being made in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, and are equal, if not superior, to any imported machine. No imported drill has as perfect a carrying wheel. That is admitted Joy importers and local manufacturers alike. Unquestionably we can make a drill suited to our requirements, and if our manufacturers had the whole of the Australian market there would soon be sufficient competition to effect a further reduction in prices. As to the possibility of unrestricted competition from abroad, I would point out that last year 5,000 machines were imported. </para>

                            <para>- It was stated by a firm making drills that, until very recently, it was found that the American malleable castings were better than Australian castings where light castings were required. That firm, however, sent a representative to America to inquire into their method of casting; the South Australian manufacturers are prosecuting similar inquiries; and the manufacturers of a leading &#39;standard Australian harvester have for some years been experimenting and investigating in regard to the matter. There has been a general desire to produce locally a casting equal to the American malleable casting, the Australian casting, although good enough for heavy work, not having been entirely suitable where lightness was required. It is admitted today by the best experts that we have malleable castings which can be used for all parts of seed drills or harvesters., and are equal to any imported. Every part of a seed drill can be manufactured in Australia, and the Australian parts prove equal to the imported parts. </para>

As to price, we know that there was no reduction when the Victorian Tariff was superseded by the Federal Tariff, although there was a lowering of duties. According to the representative of the Massey-Harris Company, the cost of a thirteen-hole drill in Melbourne is &#163;21 13s., but the farmers have to pay&#163;37 for it. Is that a fair deal? </para>

                            <para>- Two manufacturers, if they put down a special plant, could make5,000 machines a year. Experience shows that practically any mechanic possessing a lathe and a drill can build up seed drills. There are a number of foundries scattered throughout the farming districts on the Goulburn, the Wimmera, and in the North- West, for instance, where they will make castings up to blocks weighing15 cwt., and of considerable dimensions, to pattern, in pursuance of orders. Consequently, there is no danger of a monopoly being created. It does not require an expensive plant to make these implements when mouldings and castings can be procured to pattern, the chief thing necessary being, a certain amount of mechanical skill in setting them up. I shall support an amendment providing that there must be a reduction of 10 per cent, on the present selling prices within the next twelve months. </para>

As the representative of a farming constituency, I know that the very best results have followed the local manufacture of implements, the farmers being altogether better served. The seed drill is practically a modern appliance. </para>

There are also patents in regard to harvesters, and yet twelve months ago, when the Tariff Commission was taking evidence, there were twenty-four Australian manufacturers of harvesters, while to-day there are probably fifty, and within twelve months there will be a hundred. There are four firms engaged in the manufacture of drills under a protection of 12 J per cent.; but if the Australian market were conserved for local manufacturers, there would very soon be 104, and any man specializing in drills could knock the present prices kite high. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that&#39;. As one who has an intimate knowledge of the conditions prevailing, I have no fear that the imposition of these duties will have the effect of increasing the cost to the farmers. We should obtain a considerable reduction straight away, and there is no reason why the price should not be reduced. by 20 per cent, within two years. The implement makers do not require to put up an expensive plant in order to manufacture seed drills. We have it in evidence that the cost of manufacturing1 these drills is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;21</inline> 13s. ; but, unfortunately, owing to the methods of distribution which prevail, the farmers have to pay ^37. It will be seen by reference to the report of the Tariff Commission that the methods adopted by the importers in putting their goods upon the market lead to -the increased cost of distribution. </para>

                            <para>- Fertilizer and seed drills are like stripper-harvesters, in the sense that their present market price can be ascertained with accuracy. Both articles are sufficiently large and high in price to be sold singly, and, therefore, the transactions relating to them are easily traceable. I want to know whether the Minister is prepared to accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Moira to impose, in regard to drills, a condition similar to that which has already been promised with respect to stripper-harvesters ? That is to say, will he provide that there shall be a reduction in the selling price as an equivalent for the increased dutv of, say, 10 per cent. ? I recognise that with an annual consumption of 6,000 seed drills, of which only &#93;.000 are produced locally, there is a risk, unless some precaution is adopted, of the manufacturers taking advantage of the increased duty to raise the price to the consumer. As far as I am able to judge, the present margin between the cost price and the selling price is amply sufficient to leave a reasonable profit for the manufacturer, and I think there is room for a reduction of 10 per cent, upon the present selling price as an equivalent for the much greater control of the local market that will be given to the local manufacturer by reason of the increased duty. It is a truism that an increased market makes it possible to sell articles at a reduced price without interfering with the profits of the manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- It may be, but the history of Australian industries shows conclusively that the establishment of manufactures in Australia has almost, without exception, resulted in a reduction of the selling price to the consumer. The reason is perfectly obvious. So long as the supply is controlled solely by importers, there is not the kind of competition that compels the reduction of the selling price to a reasonable amount. The almost invariable experience has been that the establishment of a local industry, with or without a duty - and it is almost impossible without a duty - means a reduction of price to the consumer. It is not until the local industry has been established that the reduction in price takes place, and I see no hope of any substantial reduction in the price if we leave matters as they stood prior to the introduction of the resolution. But if an increased market is secured to the local manufacturers, they should be prepared to give some benefit to the consumer in return for the advantage accorded to them. I say frankly that I am prepared to support the proposed increase of duty if the Minister will agree to the suggestion of the honorable member for Moira. It comes from the honorable member for Moira, and not from me, and, therefore, the Minister has not the least ground for suspecting it, as he might otherwise do. As he is of a suspicious frame of mind- which, after all, is not a bad thing in a Minister of Trade and Customs- </para>

                            <para>- I have never joined in the criticisms of the Minister which have been based upon the suspicions to which he refers. My theory is, &#34; If you believe that a man has done wrong, get up your case and challenge him with it; but unless you have your case, hold your tongue.&#34; If I thought that the Minister had done wrong, much as I might cherish him in private, my sense of public duty would compel me to challenge him direct. The Minister must have had plenty of time to consider this question, and a single word from him by way of interjection would settle the matter. Is he prepared to provide for a compulsory reduction of 10 per cent, in the selling price of the drills in return for the increased protection granted - in exactly the same way that a reduction&#39; of price is being required in connexion with stripper-harvesters? If so, I shall vote for the dufy as it stands. I do not think there is any doubt that the difference between the cost price and the selling price is ample because there is a margin of&#163;16 - as between &#163;21 and&#163;37. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite satisfied with that assurance, because we can deal with the matter when the Bill is introduced ; and I am perfectly sure that the Minister will not find any insuperable obstacle. If a provision such as that suggested is inserted, the argument that a higher duty will lead to an increase in the selling price will be at once refuted. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to vote with the Government on this occasion. My object in rising is to make a personal explanation with reference to a little comedy of errors in which the honorable member for Wentworth and I took part on the 6th September. Upon referring to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> report, which I feel sure is absolutely correct, I have come to- the conclusion that the honorable member for Wentworth was, perfectly justified in putting the construction he did upon my words, in the same way that I was justified in placing upon his words the construction that I did. It was not my desire to accuse the honorable member of cooking accounts. But from my knowledge of the rings in America. I think that they would be capable of cooking anything. In our cooler moments we are induced to take a view different&#39; from that which occurs to us when we are under the influence of excitement, and I feel sure that the honorable member for Wentworth will accept my explanation in the same spirit that he displayed when we recently had a private conversation. </para>

                        <para>.- Upon the last occasion that the duty upon seed drills was under consideration I was unavoidably absent, but I paired in favour of it. I do not intend to reverse the vote which I then registered. I think that the thanks of agriculturists generally are due to the honorable member for Parramatta for having brought this question forward, because, as the result of his action, they will obtain a concession in the shape of a reduction in, the price of seed drills. I am certain that the Minister will give effect to his promise, and I think, therefore, that everybody should be very well satisfied. With me it is a question of what my constituents have to pay for these implements more than one of the duty which should be levied upon them. So long as a reasonable market is secured to them I am indifferent as to what rate of duty is charged. I should like the Minister to add to the list of exemptions the &#34; sub-soil packer.&#34; This is an entirely new implement. It was only introduced a year or two ago. There are none of these machines in Australia, and they are not manufactured! locally. The Minister will be doing a great service to our arid &#39;districts if he will allow these implements to be admitted free. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. If, as has been alleged, the Australian manufacturer has been the means of reducing the price charged for these implements by manufacturers in America - some of whom turn out as many as 20,000 machines a year - that is not an argument .in favour of an increased duty. There seems to be no doubt that the parts of these machines must be imported. </para>

                    <para class="block">Martin, of South Australia. All the other manufacturers requested that they should be admitted free. In other words, they desire to import them with a view to putting them together here, and of dubbing the undertaking an industry. That is what they do in respect of pianos. When we were considering the reciprocal Tariff agreement with New Zealand, I admired the attitude which was taken up by the honorable member for Moira, who maintained that under equal conditions the Australian farmer could hold his own against the New Zealander. It is a singular thing that, in the matter of implements, he should argue that the Australian manufacturer is not the equal of manufacturers in other parts of the world. His attitude in this connexion is most inconsistent. </para>

                            <para>- I say, &#34; God help the producer&#34; whether he is in the hands of the importer or of the manufacturer. There is not an atom of difference between the two classes. If we raise a Tariff wall in respect to these implements I maintain that the manufacturer will extend no more consideration to the farmer than does the importer. At the same time, I hold that the imposition of reasonable duties insures the charging of reasonable prices. </para>

                            <para>- I have always entertained that view. It is idle to split straws in a matter of this kind. We must recognise that whatever duty may be levied will be protective in its incidence. It is merely a question of degree. I hold that the duty which was recently imposed upon harvesters is prohibitive. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that this discussion has shown us the way in which we are attempting to deal with manufacture and trade. Here we have a proposal which, even in its best shape, means that we intend deliberately to hand over the users of seed-drills to the tender mercies of certain manufacturers, to whom we propose to give the control of the trade in Australia. That is the whole position. To what degree they will take advantage of that position it is quite impossible for me to say. Their advocates in this House say in effect - &#34; Give us the whole of this trade. Secure to us from &#163;60,000 to &#163;70,000 of profit - which we admit is to be made in the business - and we will give 10 per cent, of it to the consumer, whom we shall hold in the hollow of our hands.&#34; And what is that profit? It is admitted that it represents 80 per cent, of the value of these implements. </para>

                            <para>- He did. He said that the cost of these seed-drills was &#163;21, and that their selling price was &#163;37. If the honorable member for Melbourne Ports will peruse the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, he will find that it is admitted that the margin between the cost of their manufacture and their selling price is 80 per cent. Out of this 80 per cent, it is proposed that the makers shall distribute 10 per cent, to the users of the machine. It is a most extraordinary, proposition. We are asked to place the local manufacturers in such a position that they will be able to command the market. They will not have to display those activities which competition would induce them to display. They will not have to keep their inventive faculties moving in order that they may be able to fight their competitors. On the contrary, they will be able to say, &#34; Now we have a clear field, and an opportunity to annex ,&#163;60,000 or &#163;70,000 by way of profit. We can take our ease. We do not need to push our machines against an active competition. We need not try to keep level with the improvements of our competitors. We have the market, and all we have to do is to avail ourselves of it to the fullest extent.&#34; They .might even be prepared - although I do not say they would be - to submit to an Excise duty of i2&#167; per cent, in order to secure a still greater &#34;&#39;advantage. I do not presume, however, that there would be any necessity for them to propose anything of the kind. There is already a difference of 80 per cent, between the cost of manufacture and their selling price, and even if their price be reduced as proposed, they will have a margin of 60 per cent., representing an enormous profit on so large a trade. This - Parliament proposes to deliberately declare that 60 per cent, is a reasonable profit for the makers of these machines to wring from the users. In this respect the importer is in no sense different from the manufacturer, nor the manufacturer from the importer, since each is prepared to avail himself of- an opportunity to make a large profit. </para>

                            <para>- There may be, but I do not know of one. We, as a Parliament, will declare by our legislation that as long as the local manufacturers continue to make 60 per cent, profit on these machines, they may have the whole market to themselves, and we say, in effect to them, &#34; To enable you to do this, we will make you independent of competition - independent of the improvements and advantages of competition.&#34; This is an extraordinary proposal. Rather than recognise such a position, it would be infinitely better for us not to demand a 10 per cent, reduction. It would be better for us to allow the position to remain unaltered rather than to place our political <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> upon the making of an admitted profit of 60 per cent. As the honorable member for Grey has pointed out, the honorable member for Kennedy has taken up a remarkable attitude in strongly supporting a proposal which the farmers themselves say will injuriously, affect them, whilst at the same time - for reasons which are sound in one respect, and not in another - he supports a reduction of duties in favour of New Zealand produce. Although representing a farming constituency he is prepared apparently to increase the competition which farmers have to face, and at the same time to deprive them of the advantages of competition in regard to the machines they use. As there is admittedly a large margin of profit in the manufacture of these machines, one of the most effective steps that a local manufacturer could take to secure a large trade would be to grant a substantial reduction in prices. He would have a wide margin to work upon, and if his machine were as good as others, reduced prices, without any Government assistance, would enable him to secure a materially enlarged trade. It is astonishing that the Government should be called upon to come to the aid of this industry, when so wide a difference between the cost and the selling price of the product is admitted. I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta, and with the report of the Commission that we should remove from the schedule the items of fertilizers and seed-drills. No reason has been shown for increasing the existing dutv of 12 J- per cent, to 25 per cent. We have in the report of the Commission the statement that- </para>

                            <para>- - So far as I know, he was. I have the greatest contempt for a so-called industry that consists of the mere assembling of imported parts. Under the Tariff, however, such a business is protected, on the ground that it is an industry. The opportunity to do that sort of thing simply restrains industry. If the Tariff did not make it so profitable to import parts, and screw or assemble them together, new industries would be established. It must also be remembered that any provision which we may insert in a Bill as to a 10 per cent, reduction on selling prices can have regard only to the prices of to-day. It is absurd to imagine that, despite market fluctuations and improvements in production, the present prices will always prevail. There should, and I hope will, be natural reductions in- the selling prices. The prices of the future may bear no relation to those of to-day, and yet we are proposing to insert in this Bill a provision which bears only upon current prices. At some future lime these machines maybe made of entirely different material.; they may be differently constructed. </para>

                            <para>- It has been stated that, owing to the operations of the importers, the local manufacturers incur a heavy cost in selling their machines. That may be so, but if the market is practically secured for them, they will have no competition on the part of . sellers of imported machines. Consequently, their selling cost would be reduced, arid the greater proportion of the margin between the cost and the selling price would represent a profit, I repeat that the local manufacturers of a standard machine would find a substantial reduction in price the best stimulus to trade. We are asked to recognise by legislation that something must be done for the manufacturers, who can show a margin of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;16</inline> between the cost and the selling price of their machine. I think that the principle is wrong. We are asked by the Government to impose on the community a tax which is unnecessary, and I shall therefore support the proposal of the&#34; honorable member for Parramatta. </para>

                        <para>.- In regard to the exemptions, I should have preferred the method suggested by the honorable and learned member for Corinella to some of those which have been adopted. I should prefer that the Commonwealth label should be attached to the goods. I understand, however, that the Attorney-General holds that that would be discrimination in taxation, within the meaning of the Constitution. </para>

It would be left to the people in each State to regulate the wages as they might think fit in accordance with climatic and other conditions. That could not be considered discrimination within the terms of the Constituton </para>

This could be applied afterwards to any manufacturers in other States who might desire to come under it. All that the provisions do is to impose the same responsibility that exists in connexion with industrial agreements made under the Commonwealth Act, namely, to register the consent of both parties in any industry to prevent disputes extending over more than one State. </para>

                            <para>- If once an agreement were registered by the employers in any two States, it would be possible for the manufacturers in other States to bring themselves under its operation. Suppose, for instance, that an industrial agreement were entered into by the manufacturers of Victoria and New South Wales, or between those of New South Wales and Queensland, the manufacturers of other States could come under it, because it would be a Federal agreement registered in a Federal Court. If they did so, they would be relieved of any further difficulty, because a standard wage would at once be established. </para>

                            <para>- An individual agreement under the Commonwealth Act can be registered by manufacturers in any one State. Then, the honorable member suggests an almost impossible contingency. Supposing that such a thing did occur, there would be an alternative. This is a comparatively short and simple method of bringing the manufacturers and employers in all the States together, and I believe that they will take advantage of it. It follows the lines of our Arbitration Act, and, if used, will at once relieve manufacturers from the necessity of manufacturing excisable goods. If there should be a special outlying case, such as the honorable member indicated, advantage could be taken of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> under which it is only necessary to satisfy the Minister that the wages are in accordance with the terms of a proposed industrial agreement which is fair and reasonable, and into which the manufacturer is willing, but his workmen refuse to enter. </para>

If the manufacturers and workmen in one State come to an arrangement, their agreement could net be filed under the Arbitration Act, but there is no reason why it should not be accepted if it is fair and reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- But. a certain proportion or standard must be observed. I am referring to haphazard certificates, fixing upon a certain rate of wage for one State, and upon rates 50 per cent, lower or higher in another State under similar circumstances. Personally, I do not apprehend any difficulty whatever in dealing with this as a Federal matter. For the purposes of argument, I have been speaking of cases which might arise in a single State. We must remember, however, that all the employers and employes in this industry throughout the Commonwealth will have a common interest, and the natural and obvious means of protecting that interest will be by joint action all round. Simple means are provided for dealing with agreements entered into in more than one State. </para>

                        <para>.- Before the sitting was suspended, it was suggested to the Prime Minister that honorable members might be&#39; granted at least till two o&#39;clock to think over these important proposals. Although I have given them what attention I could during the adjournment, I do not feel that I am in any better position to discuss them now than I was previously. To my mind protective duties which benefit only the manufacturer fall far short of conferring any real advantage upon the community. It is desirable that some portion of the direct benefits derived from the imposition of duties should, if possible, go to the employes, and there are also considerations relating to the consumer which have to be taken into account. Looking at the duty side of the matter for the present, I recognise that these proposals represent ah effort to insure that the increases of duties which we have recently been considering in connexion with agricultural- implements and machinery, shall be accompanied bv proper wages conditions for the employes in the industries concerned. But in considering any such proposals, we have to be reasonably satisfied of two things - first, that they will achieve the &#39;desired result, and. secondly, that they will not work an unanticipated injury to those whom they are designed to benefit. As I understand the position, the great difficulty which has arisen is due to the limitation of our powers under the Constitution. I understand that the Attorney-General has advised that in dealing with this matter it is necessary to be constantly on our guard lest we infringe that provision of the Constitution which declares that taxation shall not discriminate between States or parts of States, because various methods which might be effective and which might work without any accompanying injury of substance, are inadmissible owing to that constitutional provision. I must confess that, so far as I have been able to give very hasty consideration to the question, it appears to me that if the view of the Attorney-General be correct, that the freeing of manufacturers from excise on compliance with State industrial conditions of any kind - whether they be in the nature of the decisions of Wages Boards or of State Arbitration Courts - would be an infringement of the provision relating to non-discrimination in matters of taxation, we have arrived at an <inline font-style="italic">impasse</inline> from which, at the present moment, I can see no escape. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade &#39;and Customs are aware that in this regard my desires are exactly the same as their own. I have previously made suggestions in this connexion. But I do feel that we are not ready to settle a matter of this importance to-day, and I think that time would be saved if we were afforded a further opportunity of considering it. I do not make this suggestion with a view to bringing about delay- </para>

                            <para>- It is that we should adjourn the discussion of this matter, and allow honorable members a further opportunity to consider it. Although the Cabinet has been engaged in considering it very fully from all stand-points, members of this Committee have not had an opportunity to do so. I must confess that the taxation aspect of the question had not occurred to my mind, and with every respect to those who entertain the view to which I have alluded, I am not prepared to give my adhesion to it. But understanding, as I do, that it is the view which is entertained by every legal member of the Cabinet, as well as bv the permanent Crown law officers, I am compelled to give it the weightiest consideration. If their view be correct, I fear that the way out of the difficulty is not visible just now. Personally, I am not in a position <inline font-style="italic">to discuss the</inline> matter with the clearness of. view that I ought to possess. I should like to know whether the Prime Minister does not think that we should be more likely to save time if our ideas upon it were allowed to clarify. It is a matter of first-class importance. Under ordinary circumstances, there would be an adjournment extending over several days after it had been introduced. It is at east as important as is a Bill of magnitude, involving fundamental principles. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that they will boil down to the manufacturers paying the Excise, the employe&#39;s deriving no benefit, and the consumers failing to get any reduction in price. In other words, I fear that the whole thing will mean a hampering of Australian industry without benefit to anybody except the manufacturers abroad. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. I fear that these proposals will not work out in the way that is anticipated. Under them, the small man will suffer enormously. The difficulty which occurs to my mind is that if we omit paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and paragraph /, I fear that no manufacturer in Australia - unless he had an Inter-State manufacturing industry - would be able to get the benefits which would be conferred bv paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b. c, d,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline></para>

                            <para>- - No. My idea is that the application to the President of the Arbitration Court must be within the limits of the arbitration powers granted by the Constitution. It all depends upon the authority to whom this Parliament can delegate its powers of determination. If it can delegate them to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration as an individual, and not in his official capacity, and limited by our constitutional powers, why can it not delegate them to John Brown, and if it can delegate them to John Brown, why can it not delegate them to the Wages Board of a State ? </para>

                            <para>- Why cannot this Parliament declare that it will exempt from excise anybody who is complying with anybody else&#39;s decisions? The decisions might be those of the British Board of Trade, for example. Why cannot we adopt federally what has been done in a State capacity? If we cannot do that, it appears to me that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> is limited in exactly the same way. I take it that that provision really refers to the President of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration within the constitutional limits of the powers of conciliation and arbitration bestowed upon us. </para>

The fact that I have not succeeded in making it clear to a man who is so capable of understanding a non-lucid argument as is the Attorney-General, shows&#39; that I require more time to consider this matter. Usually - irrespective of whether I am right or wrong - I succeed in making mv views clear. </para>

                            <para>- Was it not put in that form for the reason that it was thought that it might be beyond our competence? It does not matter how a discrimination in taxation arises - whether it arises from the doings of a State tribunal or those of the Federal Parliament. If the Minister approved of an agreement in one State, but not in another, would not a discrimination in taxation immediately arise? Discrimination in taxation may arise from our act as well as from that of others. If paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> were put in the simple form I have mentioned, it would offend against the canons of taxation which have been laid down. </para>

The rate might vary in different districts, and the Minister is to be satisfied in the matter. According to the honorable and learned member&#39;s reasoning that provision must be unconstitutional. </para>

                            <para>- I am responsible, not to the Minister, but to my constituents. It is my duty to satisfy myself that the provision is all right, and not to accept even the assurance of the Minister that it is. I generally give him the benefit of the doubt - foolishly, it may be - and accept his view. But I cannot do so in this case. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> might also give rise to discrimination. If the fears that I entertain have any reasonable foundation - if this provision will not be easily and conveniently operative - the Excise duty may have to be paid by people who should not be called upon to pay it. If those who were employing labour under proper conditions of all kinds - who, for example, were complying with all the provisions of an award of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, or whose employes were working under Wages Boards&#39; conditions in Victoria - came under these Excise provisions, the result might be disastrous to employer, employe, and consumer alike. When an honorable member honestly entertains apprehensions of this kind, he has very good reason for urging that the question demands careful consideration. I cannot understand why the Government should not at once agree to give us time to think over this proposal. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that cry before. In the Victorian Parliament, there prevailed the bad practice of allowing amendments in a Bill to be moved upon the third reading. Honorable members without much experience of the procedure were often told in Committee that if the clause to which they objected were allowed to pass it could be dealt with at the third reading stage, but those who once acted on that information required no further experience to induce them to say that the Committee was the proper place in which to thresh out their difficulties. I hold the same view in regard to this question. The passing of the Bill itself should be a mere matter of form. My present feeling is that this proposal will destroy Australian industries, and I am not going to assist to agree to anything that will have that effect. I desire time to consider the motion. In its present form it seems to me that it will be disastrous to Australia, and I refuse to join in the passing of any proposition that might have that effect. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable and learned member for Corinella has dealt with some of the legal and constitutional difficulties associated with this proposal, and I desire now to point out several of. the practical difficulties. It is proposed in an extraordinary manner to extend the tribunals that may deal with the industrial conditions prevailing in the Commonwealth. We are creating a complicated set of laws, which, if they have any effect at all, must hamper the industries of the community. I have no faith whatever in the capacity of some at least of the new tribunals named in this motion to deal with industrial matters. In two paragraphs of the motion the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act is recognised, but apart from those provisions we are proposing to allow the Parliament to decide whether the conditions prevailing in a particular class of industry or, it may be, a particular business, are fair and reasonable. How could we separate from the decision of such matters the prejudices arising from fiscal opinions or associations? </para>

                            <para>- I have no hesitation in saving that the Parliament could not be relied upon to give a judicial decision in regard to these disputes. Its decision in relation to the industrial conditions prevailing in a certain employment might vary according to the firm whose affairs were brought under consideration. I am not referring to the attitude likely to be taken up by either one side or the other, but I repeat that Parliament might be induced to give a decision against a firm because of the policy which that firm had been supporting. If the same question were brought forward by another firm, a different decision might be given. We have so fully recognised the inability of Parliament to deal judicially with matters of this kind, that we have appointed a special tribunal to decide them. A still more objectionable paragraph in this motion is that providing that the Minister may be the tribunal to decide whether a proposed industrial agreement is reasonable and fair. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister may have the fullest confidence in himself, and the fact that he holds his present position is evidence that Parliament has confidence in him ; but, even assuming him to be an angel of light, and infallible, he must sooner or later have a successor, and ten to one he will say of that successor that he cannot trust his impartiality. It would be absurd to contend that the fact that a man holds office is evidence of his qualifications to decide a matter of this sort. Besides, we cannot tell who our future Ministers will be. If the House had to select some person whose business it would be to decide these questions, we should have the greatest difficulty in choosing one who would possess the special qualifications needed, and there is certainly no guarantee that any man who, in the hurly-burly of politics, may obtain a portfolio, will have these qualifications. Coming now to the working, of the provisions, I would point out that there is no recognition of the States Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. </para>

                            <para>- What is the difficulty? The honorable and learned gentleman has clothed all sorts of State institutions and persons with Federal power; why cannot he. for the purposes of this legislation, so clothe the States Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards? As matters stand, there will be conflicting jurisdictions and conflicting decisions. Men when engaged in making some article cognate to those in the list will be subject to a State Wages Board, and when making an article in the list, subject to a Federal tribunal. I am very doubtful about the success of a lot of legislation of this kind. But those who are in favour of it should try to make it workable and simple. As it stands at present, it will create most serious and absurd situations. Contrary decisions will be given, which will destroy the effective working of our industries. The request of the honorable and learned member for Corinella, that we should have more time for consideration, is a reasonable one. We should be given an opportunity to determine whether the difficulties which have been pointed out cannot be removed, and if they can be removed, to find means of removing them. Every honorable member must recognise that the complications surrounding the carrying on of an industry will be very great if the men employed in a factory are subject during the time that they are working on one set of articles to one tribunal, and during the time that they are working on another set of articles to another tribunal. A man engaged in making wood-work might be subject to a State authority when that wood-work was intended for one set of machines, and to a Commonwealth authority when it was intended for another set of madhines. </para>

                            <para>- The list of articles mentioned in the schedule mav form only a comparatively small part of the output of a certain industry. In regard to the rest of the output the States Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts will decide what are fair and reasonable conditions, and their decisions are the best evidence obtainable on the subject. An employer may be working his men under these conditions, and a question may arise which will have to be settled by some other tribunal, perhaps bv Parliament. We know that the decisions of Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards do not always give satisfaction to those to whom they apply, and thus questions in dispute may be brought before Parliament, and &#39;their consideration complicated with a number of side issues. If the determination varies from the original decision, we shall have nothing but confusion, because operatives for a portion of their time will be subjected to the control of the State authority, while, in regard to another portion of their time, that control will be overridden by the Federal authority. It may be said that the manufacturers, with all their men, should come under the Federal authority if it has decided on higher rates of wages than those required by the State authority; but thy cannot be expected to do that. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, I am not criticising the proposal from the legal stand-point, but from the industrial point of view. We ought to endeavour to meet the industrial necessities of the case, and personally I can see no difficulty. I do not see why we should not make use of the States bodies to which I have referred as Federal tribunals, for the time being, and for a particular purpose. If we do not adopt this course, we shall bring about all sorts of complications and difficulties. It may be said that where higher rates of wages and shorter hours are fixed by our Commonwealth tribunal, as reasonable and fair, the manufacturer can free himself from the Excise by carrying on all his operations under the specified conditions. But just consider the difficulty that might arise. The manufacture of implements might &#39; constitute only a minor portion of his work. The manufacturer might engage in other lines of business, and whilst he might be compelled to pay throughout his establishment the higher wages stipulated by the Commonwealth authority, his competitors in other lines of business, who might not be manufacturing implements, could carry on their operations under the more favorable decisions of the States tribunals. I do not think that we ought to pass the proposals in their present form. Whatever time is needed for the purpose of effecting an improvement should be granted. As the result of the partial criticism - I could carry my criticism much further - which has been directed to the proposals, new considerations have arisen, and it is important that in a matter of this kind, which may affect our industries very considerably, we should have the fullest time for consideration and for making good any shortcomings that may be exposed by criticism. </para>

                        <para>.- I quite agree with the honorable member for North Sydney that the. step now being taken is a very important one: From &#39;the stand-point of protectionists, I think that it marks an era in our legislation. No previous attempt has been made in the manner now proposed to secure some definite proportion of the benefits of protection for the employes. Therefore this proposal, combined with the provision which is intended to protect the consumers . by limiting the selling price of the article, marks a step of great importance. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, it is very often impossible to achieve the .object aimed at without bandages. Judging from the tottering condition of free-trade, even bandages would not be of much avail. It is in the highest degree desirable that we should provide the simplest possible machinery for making this proposal effective. There is some force, in the criticism offered by the honorable member for North Sydney with reference to the difficulties that confront the manufacturer who has to comply with both State and Common wealth requirements. I can quite understand that it is difficult, especially in view of the constitutional limitations, to arrive at the easiest way of giving effect to these conditions. If we. were prepared to go to the expense of providing the same machinery that we use in connexion with the sugar bounty system, we should have comparatively little trouble. That is to say, we could levy an Excise duty all round, and provide for a bounty by way of rebate to those manufacturers who complied with certain conditions. I can see that the constitutional difficulty would be at once avoided if we could adopt this course. But the machinery required would be considerable, and Excise officers would have to be stationed in every factory. If there is any effective method short of that cumbrous plan, we should adopt it. As I indicated before lunch, I do not see how the use of the Commonwealth label would constitute a discrimination in taxation such as would be contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. But, upon that point, I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Attorney-General and the law officers of the Crown. It does not seem to me that the same objection would apply to clothing with Federal power some of the States authorities, such as the Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts. I do not know whether the interjection of the Attorney-General a few minutes ago indicated that he perceived the distinction between accepting the determinations of States Wages Boards as such, and accepting, for this purpose, the decision of a State Wages Board clothed with Federal authority. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad to hear that. The criticism of the honorable member for North Sydney, aided by interjections by myself and the honorable and learned member for Corinella, and others, have at least achieved something. It would be preferable from every standpoint to recognise a standard established by an outside authority rather than depend upon any Ministerial or parliamentary determination. Without for a moment SuK gesting anything beyond a lack of practical knowledge on the part of Parliament, and Ministers, I think that it would be undesirable to leave too much to the option of the Minister. The authorities of whose services it is proposed we shall avail ourselves, exist in four of the States- New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. </para>

In three of the States, the necessary machinery is actually in operation, and there should be no difficulty in making use of it in South Australia. With regard to Queensland and Tasmania, we should still require to leave some power in the hands of the Minister, or of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- - It has Deen urged that more time is required for the consideration of the matter now before us. but I am prepared to vote upon it at &#39;once. It seems to me that we are introducing an entirely novel and most complicated principle, which, if it has anything to recommend it, should be applied to all our industries. If we are doing right in regulating the wages paid in certain branches of manufacture, we are doing wrong in not extending the same principle to other branches of industry We have to look at the genesis of this proposal. Only a short time ago, the Government proposed to impose abnormally high duties upon certain agricultural machinery, and it was then suggested that we should simultaneously impose an Excise duty, and associate with it the principle of giving relief from Excise duties to those manufacturers who complied with certain labour conditions, and sold their goods at certain prices. I am not prepared, at a moment&#39;s notice, to apply a new set of principles, not only to taxation, but to the regulation of the social conditions of the people. I was not able to obtain a copy of the proposals until after the luncheon hour, and I do not think that we should, at short notice, be called upon to deal with the most complicated system of Excise of which I have ever heard. The Attorney-General appears to think that he can softsoap us into accepting the proposals by adopting the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- I a I agree with some of the honorable member&#39;s criticisms, which were of the most destructive character. He spoke as the result of his wide acquaintance with commercial undertakings, and furnished the best of reasons why the Government proposals should not be adopted. It is impossible for anybody to predict what the ultimate effect of these proposals will be. This Excise duty is not imposed for the purpose of producing revenue. It is levied for the purpose of levelling down a protective tax which has been imposed upon stripper-harvesters. Could we not achieve our purpose in a much easier way by lowering the import duty ? The Government have been compelled to accept a suggestion which emanated from the Labour corner, and to adopt what is known as the &#34;new&#34; protection. That &#34;new&#34; protection is intended to improve the social conditions of the operatives who create wealth. </para>

                            <para>- I stated the other night that if a new fiscal policy of that character is to be introduced, I shall be obliged to review my position as a freetrader. My objection to protection has never been based upon the assumption &#39;that it would result in better conditions for the worker, but rather upon the fact that under it the worker is robbed, for the benefit of a small number of individuals. If we are going to introduce a system of protection under which we seek to improve the condition of the workers. T shall have to reconsider my position. But a Parliament which seeks to bring into operation a great principle like that for the _ sake of a few units in the community, is manifestly doing an injustice to the great majority. </para>

                            <para>- Having in view the complicated nature of these proposals, and the fact that the few commercial men in the House cannot predict their ultimate effect, it is only fair to ask the Minister to allow honorable members a few days in which to consider them. It has been frequently said that these novel proposals seldom fulfil either the predictions of their opponents or of their supporters. I think it behoves us to look at the, matter more carefully before agreeing to propositions so novel in character and likely to be disastrous in their effects. As the honorable member for North Sydney has pointed out, the Clyde Engineering Company in New South Wales manufactures a number of the articles which will be subject to these. Excise duties, and also turns out locomotives. Their workmen are frequently moved from one branch of the establishment to another. A man may perhaps be engaged upon a locomotive to-day and up a stump-jump plough to-morrow. Under these proposals we should compel that firm to comply with all the conditions relating to the employment of their men, if. they wish to escape the payment of the Excise duty. </para>

                        <para>. &#39; - If the honorable member for South Sydney will permit me to say so, without disrespect, his concluding remarks were based upon a fallacy. He said that we had endeavoured to place upon the statute-book provisions to regulate the wages of industrial workers, and that, if we had been successful, these proposals were not required. I would point out to him that the Federal Constitution - great as it is - is not altogether symmetrical. It is the result of a good many compromises, and provides that taxation must be levied without regard to States. Conciliation and arbitration have their foundation in the States. We have no power to legislate concerning conciliation and arbitration in respect of industrial disputes unless those disputes extend beyond the limits of any one State. Therefore, we have two conflicting principles, and that is how the difficulty arises. In regard to taxation, we must exclude from our minds all considerations of States. We must deal with Australia as a whole, without discriminating between State and State, or between parts of States. That is the awkward feature of the situation. That is why, in my opinion, we can- not take up State laws as such, and declare that, to&#39; exempt a manufacturer from taxation, the Victorian laws shall apply in Victoria, and that the New South Wales laws shall apply in that State in the same way. We cannot recognise State laws which alter the incidence of taxation. The Government have given very anxious consideration to this matter, and I take it that every member of this Committee acquiesces in the idea that we do not wish to impose duties merely to enrich manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- We could not do that under a Harvester Bill. If we are dealing with ploughs and stripper-harvesters, we cannot go so far as to deal with the wages of bootmakers. I should be very glad indeed to see our way constitutionally to recognise the State laws in this matter. We did so in the Trade Marks Act, but, in my opinion, we cannot do so under any taxation proposal, because the Constitution expressly forbids discriminations. To say that a manufacturer in Victoria shall be exempt from the payment of the Excise duty if he complies with the Victorian law, and that a manufacturer in New South Wales shall be exempt from the payment of Excise duty if he complies with the State law there, which may be quite different, would be to discriminate between the States. It would give a man an advantage, according to whether he was resident in one State or another. </para>

                            <para>- We can do it effectively,, though not in the particular way that we have been asked to do it. What we say is that we are going to provide various methods by which manufacturers may deal reasonably with &#39;their employes, and so avoid the payment of Excise. We say_. in effect, that so long as a manufacturer treats his employes reasonably, he shall be freed from the payment of Excise, and we give him the choice of several means of proving that he is dealing reasonably with them. In. the first place, we say to him -that, if he comes to Parliament and establishes his claim that the remuneration of his employes, and their conditions of labour are fair and reasonable, he shall not be liable to pay the Excise. No doubt that is rather a cumbersome method. We further say to him that if he complies with an industrial award of the Commonwealth Conciliation &#39; and Arbitration Court, that will suffice. We say that if he does not feel himself called upon to take either of these courses, he may adopt an industrial agreement. Then we provide in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> that if he is willing to enter into an agreement, and his employes are not, he shall not be debarred from participating in these advantages, but shall have an opportunity to go before the. Minister, and prove his willingness. Thereupon the Minister, if he thinks that the terms offered by the manufacturer are favorable, may exempt him. These provisions are all in favour of the manufacturer. We go on to provide that if application is made to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration - not under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act - the learned Justice may refer the matter to a Judge of the Supreme Court of the State, and that if either he or the Judge of the Supreme Court declares the terms to be reasonable the manufacturer shall be exempt. Some provision of the kind is necessary to meet the position of those carrying on business in States where, there is no industrial authority. Paragraph / contains a provision designed to meet the exigencies of the situation - a provision with which no one will quarrel. The honorable member for North Sydney made a reference to State industrial authorities, which I thought at the time suggested a way by which we could meet his views without contravening the provisions of the Constitution. While we cannot in my opinion adopt a State law, as such, w&#39;e might utilize the services of gentlemen who are acting as State industrial authorities by asking them to determine the question of fairness and reasonableness. No doubt in deciding such a question they, would be guided by the considerations on which they base their determinations under the State laws, but that would not mean our adoption of the State laws as such. We could make the same use of these industrial authorities as we could of a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State. </para>

                            <para>- There is no prohibition against doing anything that is reasonable or fair in any part of Australia. Local conditions may be taken into consideration ; but for the purposes of taxation we cannot draw a hard-and-fast line according to State boundaries. That is the position. What might be fair and reasonable in one town might not necessarily be fair and reasonable in another in the same State. It might be quite fair and reasonable to have in Albury different conditions from those prevailing in Wodonga, but that difference would not be determined merely by the fact that the two towns are separated by the Murray. </para>

                            <para>- It would. We know that in two or three of the States there are practically no industrial authorities. Queensland and Tasmania ought not to be placed in a worse position in this regard than any of the other States. South Australia; too, at present has not a substantially-constituted industrial authority. That being so, we desire an opportunity to allow a Judge of the Supreme Court to deal with these matters. If any of these States should at any time have a properly constituted industrial authority, a question under these provisions could be referred to that authority. I think that the provision giving the Minister power to decide whether the terms of an agreement are fair and reasonable ought to be retained, because in some distant parts of Queensland or South Australia, or even Tasmania, if might be found inconvenient to refer the&#39; question to the State industrial authority in another part of that State, or to a Judge of the Supreme Court, or the President of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. </para>

                            <para>- It might be found far more convenient to refer the matter, through a Customs officer, to the Minister for determination. I think that it would be wise to give manufacturers an opportunity to do that which may be found best suited to their convenience. The only desire of the .Government is to facilitate the settlement of these matters, so as to avoid any block in industrial occupations. That is the position of affairs. I think we are all agreed that some provision of the kind should be made. The only point in dispute is as to the way in which we should secure the object we have in view. I have detailed the considerations which have animated the Government, and with these observations would ask the Committee to deal with the motion at once, more especially as the Bill itself will have to be considered in Committee. </para>

                    <para>Mi. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) &#91;3.24&#93;. - 1 am one of those who agree that if we have protective duties of the character contained in the schedule, the workers ought certainly to receive some advantage from them. At the same time, I do not think that this proposal is fair or reasonable. The question now before us is not the only one incidental to high protective duties. We have been dealing with two schedules - one of which has not yet been finally disposed of - providing for the imposition of much higher rates. What is to be done in regard to them? Are we going to deliberately set up an anomalous condition of affairs? Are we going to agree to the anomaly that one section of the manufacturers shall subscribe to these new conditions, while others go free? I differ altogether from the view that it is impossible to treat them upon some common ground, and in accordance with some common principle. It occurs to me that the best course for the Government to pursue would be to bring down a set of industrial propositions which would apply to all manufacturers whom we are proposing to treat in this favoured way. What is to be the position in regard to the duties imposed under the reciprocal agreement with New Zealand and the British preferential proposals ? In both cases duties are increased very considerably. I find, for instance, that the duty on the bulk of our importations of furniture from foreign countries is to be increased &#39;by 10 per cent. That concession to local furniture-makers is almost as large as that which we are making to the manufacturers of these agricultural implements. Then, again, the duty on engines, cutlery n.e.i., drawing, mathematical, and surveying instruments, plated ware, and plated cutlery is also to be increased by 10 per cent, in respect of importations from foreign countries, whilst the duty on boots and shoes from foreign countries is to be increased from 30 to 40 per cent. In other words, the bootmakers of Australia are to have a 40 per cent, protective duty, and to remain exempt from the conditions to be imposed upon the makers of the agricultural implements now under consideration. Is there any sort of justice in this proposal? Will any one, no matter how strongly he may favour protective duties or industrial conditions such as are contemplated in the proposals now before us, defend the exemption of bootmakers enjoying protection&#39; to the extent of 40 per cent., &#39;.from the conditions that are to be imposed upon agricultural machine-makers, who enjoy a protection of from 20 to 25 per cent. ? </para>

                            <para>- There is only a very small section working under such awards. I am afraid that the honorable member is thinking only of the position in Victoria, where Wages Boards&#39; are in operation, and, I am told, work very well. There are bootmakers in all the States who are not subject to these industrial provisions. They enjoy, a protection of 40 per cent., and should comply with the same industrial conditions that are imposed on implement-makers having a protection of 20 or 25 per cent. This proposal is one to differentiate in a way which we were told the Constitution was designed to prevent. </para>

                            <para>- I hold that they could. There are two other schedules before us, which cover a much wider range of duties than those immediately under discussion, but it is not proposed to attach to them the provisions which we are now considering. Although we are going to increase the protection enjoyed by a number of manufactures, it is proposed to apply industrial conditions in regard to the manufacture of agricultural machinery only. A Federal Parliament, working under a Constitution which forbids discrimination, has no right to differentiate in this way. With every desire that the labour conditions applied to manufacture shall bc as liberal as possible, I am unable to see that these provisions will be anything but unworkable. Apart from that, whatever is done should apply to the whole range of protected industries. I suggest, therefore, the withdrawal of these provisions for the present, in order that a Bill may be framed which will apply equally and universally. </para>

                            <para>- We are laying it down as one of the principles of the new protection that, when duties are imposed, consumers and employes, as well&#39; as manufacturers, shall benefit. But that principle is to be applied only partially, although we are in a position to apply it generally and equitably. We deny justice to employes in industries which are being protected by duties of 40 per cent., although we are ready to impose these conditions on industries protected by duties of only 20 per cent, or 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>.- I. congratulate the Minister upon the introduction of these proposals, which I think embody the wishes expressed by honorable members generally last week. The criticism which has been levelled against them must be regarded with satisfaction by those who believe in the principle of the proposals, since no one has been able to raise objection to it. The objections taken have been directed almost solely to the form adopted, while the honorable member for Parramatta complains that the proposals are not sufficiently far-reaching. It is refreshing to hear that complaint coming from the Opposition. Any proposal to extend the scope of this legislation will have my hearty support. A beginning must be made in all &#39;things, as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has pointed out. The establishment of Wages Boards was objected to on the ground upon which . the honorable member for Parramatta objects to the proposals before us, that it would be unfair and inequitable to single out any single industry. But it has been found that those who make the most of that objection always seek to limit the Wages Boards to the smallest compass. If we are going to adopt the principle that when protective duties are imposed, the workmen engaged in the protected industries shall be given better conditions, we must carry into law some such proposals as these; and we must make a start somewhere. I do not think that we can reasonably be blamed for taking in hand the particular indus- tries now affected. We are not now engaged i!n any general revision o&#39;fl the Tariff. That, I suppose, will be one of the first duties of the new Parliament. When it is entered upon, I shall endeavour, if I am here, to have conditions such as are now under discussion applied wherever possible, and I hope that the honorable member for Parramatta will lend his assistance. The honorable member for South Sydney has stated that the introduction of these proposals amounts to a declaration that our Conciliation and Arbitration Act is at fault. Nothing of the kind. That Act passed, not merely to regulate wages or conditions of labour, but to appoint a tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes, with a view to the prevention of strikes. Seeing that the honorable member is prepared to vote for Australian rates of wages, I am surprised that he intends to oppose these proposals. The legal difficulties surrounding the whole matter must be admitted. They are due chiefly to the fact that we are working under a written Constitution which expressly provides against discrimination between the States. It is admittedly difficult to apply general principles when conditions are dissimilar, unless exceptions are made, and 1 do not think that it is possible to suggest any simple plan. The Government have made a very fair attempt to do what is desired, and we shall, soon be able to see how their proposals will work. In regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, we must wait until a dispute coming within the meaning of the Act arises before we can know whether our legislation is likely to be successful, but if we put these proposals into effect we shall very soon see how they will work. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. There will be no difficulty&#39; in finding out whether the proposals are workable if they are once carried into effect, and, at the worst, if found to be unworkable, they can be remedied by the new Parliament two or three months hence. Honorable members will admit that if the scheme does not work, it can only delay the operation of the duties. Therefore we shall not expose the community to any risks. The present conditions would prevail until we could bring a workable scheme into operation. I can quite conceive of complications arising; but I do not anticipate that insuperable difficulties will be met with. I trust that the Committee will pass the resolution. We shall have ample time before the Bill is introduced to consider any objections, and to endeavour, if possible, to devise a better scheme. Personally, I should have preferred to adopt the method suggested by the &#39;honorable and learned member for Corinella, and I am sorry to learn that there are constitutional difficulties in the way. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so; but my reasons may be different from those which the honorable member imagines. It seemed to me that it was proposed to enter upon a course of action entirely different from that which Parliament had hitherto adopted, namely, that of intrusting the settlement of industrial matters to tribunals altogether dissociated from politics. It also seemed to me that the proposals were calculated to encroach! upon the autonomous right of each State to regulate its own industrial affairs. Under the Constitution, we have no authority in industrial matters, except in regard to disputes extending beyond any one State. Therefore, I thought we should be invading the State domain. The amendments suggested by the Attorney-General, to a certain extent overcome both of my objections, because hie presents the alternative of an appeal to the President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court or a Judge of a State Supreme Court, and through them to any person or persons in whom may be vested the authority to deal with State industrial matters. Therefore the decision would be left to the local authorities. My third objection is of an entirely different character. I disapprove entirely of the application of Excise duties to businesses such as that with which we are now dealing. I quite agree with the observations of the honorable member for North Sydney. Both He and I have had considerable experience with regard to the operation of Excise duties. There is no more embarrassing ot unsuitable means of raising taxation or attaining any object through taxation, and in other parts of the world Excise duties are levied in few cases except those of spirits and tobacco. I wish to place on record my opinion that if a system of Excise is to be applied to all industries which are the subject of protective duties, it will have the effect of impeding their development. Honorable members who have not a practical acquaintance with business cannot conceive of the difficulties that will be created. I do not see how the authorities are going to carry on their work without greatly impeding the operations of those engaged in the manufacture of implements. The work must be conducted in bond, under the supervision of lockers, and this seems to be the most clumsy expedient that could be adopted. Ministers will have to discover some better means of accomplishing their ends than that of imposing Excise duties. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the honorable and learned member for Corinella made a reasonable request when he asked that time should be afforded for the further consideration of these proposals, with which honorable members were not acquainted until just prior to the adjournment for luncheon. I cannot understand why the Minister of Trade and Customs should endeavour to press this matter, unless he wishes to maintain his reputation for &#34;bullocking&#34; things through. We are asked to pass legislation without being afforded any opportunity to properly comprehend its purposes or probable effect. I think that the best way to awaken the electors to a true sense of the position is by allowing the Government measures to be passed in the crude state in which they are presented. When we direct our best efforts to making them less objectionable, we do not obtain proper credit for it, because &#39; Ministers claim the improved measures as their own. Only two honorable members on this side had criticised these proposals when we found all the legal luminaries in the Ministerial ranks were engaged in drafting amendments with a view to improving them. The Attorney-General has admitted that they are defective, and should be amended. There has not been a single measure submitted by this Government which they have not found themselves forced to ask the House to give them leave to amend. I should prefer to see the whole of the provisions knocked out, because then the Excise duties would counteract to a large extent the effect of the Customs duties. If these paragraphs be agreed to the Excise duties will have no effect and the manufacturers will reap the full benefit to be derived from the increased Customs duties which have been imposed. As a free-trader, I strongly object to that. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the Minister is to be commended for having introduced proposals of this character. I claim that it is our duty to see that the workers secure a fair share of the protection which has been extended to the manufacturers. They should receive increased wages, and to my mind, it would be a pity to eliminate the conditions under which those wages will be paid. At the same time, I believe that great difficulty will be experienced in collecting the Excise duties. The Minister will encounter more trouble in that connexion than he experienced in framing regulations under the Commerce Act. </para>

I think it is desirable that we should not permit the maximum selling price throughout Australia to be that ruling in any one State. Unless some such amendment as I propose be inserted, the manufacturers will be able, in the case of machines sold in States in which they are not made, to add to the maximum prices fixed in this clause considerable charges in respect of distribution and selling costs. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we should conserve the interests of the users of these machines by adopting the course I propose. Honorable members must not lose sight of the fact that we are fixing the maximum, not the minimum, selling price, and that we ought, therefore, to determine what shall be the maximum price for Australia. Unless we do so, those living in States in which these machines are not manufactured will be placed at a disadvantage. They will have to pay more than those residing in the State of manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that, in any event, the farmer in the interior must be at a disadvantage. But, under the clause as it stands, an agreement might be arrived at by the manufacturers to make these machines in only one State, with the result that the price to those living in all the other States would be considerably increased. The position is very serious from the point of view of farmers in Western Australia. By the imposition of these duties, we shall practically shut out importations. In, Western Australia the farmers would have hitherto been able to obtain machines from Great Britain&#39;s other colonies and other parts of the world almost as cheaply as from some of the eastern States. Those sources of supply will now be closed to them, and unless we fix a maximum price for Australia, they will derive no advantage from this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There are not many farmers in my constituency, but I hold that, as the result of an arrangement as to prices arrived at by the manufacturers, the farmers generally of. Western Australia have hitherto been fleeced. They will be placed under an additional disadvantage unless the maximum prices be applied to every State. The suggestion that the difficulty would be overcome by the establishment of factories in Western Australia may be readily answered. In view of the wages conditions which we have inserted, it is hardly likely that a factory would be established immediately in that State, where the wages paid to mechanics and other workmen at the present time are higher than those paid in most of the eastern States. It may be said also that the margin of profit allowed under the Minister&#39;s proposal is not sufficient to permit of the adoption of my suggestion. I do not think that such a contention could be seriously maintained. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission is that the cost of manufacturing the Australian machines is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;41.</inline> whereas the selling cost is equal to an, additional <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40.</inline> We propose to reduce that extraordinary cost by only 10 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- It is the decision of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission, based on sworn evidence. We are given the cost of the imported Massey-Harris machine, the imported Internationa&#93; harvester, and the locally-made machine. I am justified in trying to provide that the users of harvesters in Western Australia shall not be placed at a disadvantage by legislation which is being passed without much consideration on the part of honorable members generally. I dare say it will be argued that my proposal will not be in the interests of the manufacturers of the small States; but what I wish to do is merely to fix a maximum price. The manufacturer who tries to sell in a distant State will then have to produce at a cost sufficiently below that price to enable him to pay the expenses of transport there. I appeal to the Minister to fix the maximum selling price as the price at the railway station or port of the capital city of each of the States. If the price inserted in the Bill is found not to be high enough, I shall be prepared, when that is demonstrated, to increase it ; but every consideration should be given to the users of these machines.

                    <para>.- It seems to me that the amendment will not work, and that it &#39;does not apply a principle upon which it is proper for us to act. What we wish to insure is that the factory price, that is, the price at which the manufacturer sells, shall be reasonable. To it must be added, as a natural operation of commerce, the cost of conveyance from the factory to the place of delivery. If we fixed a uniform price for the whole of Australia, one of the anomalies that would occur would be that farmers who had paid high prices to secure land close to markets and to manufacturing centres, would be charged as much freight as farmers in distant parts who had secured their land cheaply because of its remoteness from markets. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt. Machines are now being made in Corowa and other small towns in New South Wales and Victoria which compete with McKay&#39;s Sunshine harvesters, and there is no reason why factories should not be established in places like Perth, or even at Northam. The Bill provides for a very substantial reduction in the price of harvesters. Within the last few weeks McKay&#39;s Sunshine harvesters have been selling for ,&#163;81 each. </para>

                        <para>- The farmers in my electorate who have to pay railway freight from Melbourne or Sydney are placed at a disadvantage compared with men who reside half that distance from the metropolitan cities. I do not see how we can equalize the conditions all round, and it certainly would not be fair to load up the men who are near the source of supply, in order to confer an advantage upon those who live at a distance. I think that we should insist upon a fair selling price at the factory and allow the freight charges to be added. These machines are now being made in New South Wales and Victoria, and I have every hope that they will shortly be produced in Western Australia also. </para>

                    <para>.- So far as I can judge, the proposal of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie is impracticable. The only fair way of fixing the selling price is by providing that the machines shall be sold for a certain figure at the factory. The manufacturers in Victoria quote for delivery at rail or wharf, and the buyers have to pay the freight. A farmer in the Goulburn Valley would have to pay 50s. freight upon a machine sent to him from Melbourne, and thus the cost to him would amount altogether to ^83 10s. A farmer in Western . Australia would probably have to pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> freight from Melbourne to Fremantle, and thus the cost of the machine landed on the wharf would be about ,&#163;86. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps so, but we are now endeavouring to get beyond the control of the combine and to secure a reduction of prices. This proposal works out just as equitably for the farmers of Western Australia as for those in close proximity to the seat of manufacture. If we fix a maximum selling price at the factory, the Western Australian farmer will get exactly the same proportion of rebate as the farmer in Victoria. It is only reasonable to assume that before very long a factory will be established in Western Australia for the manufacture of harvesters. The present freights are high, and as the agricultural industry expands in that State there will be every inducement to manufacturers to open workshops there. In the meantime it would not be fair to fix a maximum selling price in that State. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that as it is evidently intended under the new system of protection . to protect every one, we should safeguard the interests of the residents of the various States. If we keep out the imported article it is only right that we should make provision against any State being penalized. If it is proper for us to protect the manufacturers of Victoria, we should also see that no injury is done to the consumers in other parts of the Commonwealth. We do not use strippers in Tasmania, but legislation may shortly be introduced affecting other classes of manufactured goods, and, therefore, I desire at the outset to make provision for equitable treatment all round. If the Victorian manufacturer has to pay very heavy freight upon machines which are sent to Western Australia he may be induced to make on the spot the machines required there. But I would point out that a large factory can always produce a machine at a less cost than can a small factory. In considering this question, it seems to me that we should be careful not to inflict an injury upon people who are resident in the smaller States. I have had a little experience of what the Victorian manufacturers will do. I know that in the matter of Australian-made bedsteads, some manufacturers appointed a single agent in towns in the distant States, and refused to supply anybody else. The retailers are thus prevented from obtaining the Australian-made article. I consider that we should not merely study the manufacturers, and that if we arrange for a place of delivery it ought to be in the capital of each State. </para>

In reply to the fears expressed by the honorable member, that the establishments in Melbourne and Sydney will come into competition with those in Perth, I would point out that the Perth manufacturers will still enjoy a natural protection of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> or /&#91;$ per ton by reason of freight charges. I do not know whether the honorable member is aware of it, but there are small factories preparing to start operations all over the country. There are three or four in my own electorate, and in the adjoining electorate there are others. Why cannot factories be started in Perth or Brisbane just as easily ? </para>

                    <para>. - I am absolutely dissatisfied with the statement of the Minister. The honorable member for Bland believes that under my amendment the man .who is in close proximity to the market would be deprived of the advantage which he possesses over the individual who is resident in the more remote portions of the State. If that be so, we need to extend to this question of fixing a maximum selling price a, larger amount of consideration than I have yet devoted to it. I thought that what was contemplated was a maximum selling price for Australia, and that internal competition, assisted by the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, would reduce the price of these machines to the consumer near the factories very much below the amount mentioned in the Bill. But now it seems to be accepted that it will do nothing of the kind, but that the maximum selling price specified in the Bill merely represents the price which will be paid for the machines by the consumer who is most favorably situated. </para>

                    <para>.- I am at a loss to understand the basis on which the Minister framed these provisions as to the rates and sizes of these machines. It came as a surprise to many when the manufacturers, who in the first instance asked for an increased duty on harvesters, expressed their willingness to grant a reduction in prices if their requests were complied with. In paragraph 3 of the report of that section of the Tariff Commission which recommended an increased duty it is set forth that that increase should be granted subject to the imposition of conditions as to the retail selling price not being increased, as to the observance of reasonable conditions of labour in the industry, and, in the case of harvesters, a reduction in the selling price within a certain date. The lines suggested by those engaged in the industry were practically adopted, and it was recommended that the price of a standard machine, within two years, should be reduced from ^81 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;70.</inline> As the rate of duty has been increased by 12J per cent., that represents a reduction of 14 per cent, on the selling price, whereas the proposal embodied in this clause is that there shall be a reduction of 20 per cent. I think that we are expecting teo much. We are proposing for the first time to grant an increased duty, subject to a reduction in the selling price of the machines to which it is applied. The implement-makers, and that section of the Tariff Commission which recommended ;an increase, agreed upon what should be a fair reduction. It was what I expected when the duty was fixed at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;12.</inline> I said then, as I say now, that the amount of the duty need not concern the Australian user of machines. Within the next eighteen months we are to get a reduction of 14 per cent, on the&#39; selling price of standard machines. </para>

                        <para>- The Tariff Commission reports that within two years the price of the standard machine, which is now selling at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;ii,</inline> could be reduced to ,&#163;72. That machine has a width of comb of from 5 feet to 5 ft. 6 in. But there is a machine, now in its second year, and found to be satisfactory last year, which has a comb of the width of 6 feet. It was being sold for &#163;&#38;&#62;&#93; ros., and, under the Bill, must after the 1st February, 1908, be sold for ^70, which, I think, is too great a reduction in the time. If the Australian market were wholly conserved to the local manufacturers the reduction might be brought about, but under the circumstances it is too great. </para>

                        <para>- Both importers and manufacturers have refused to state their actual factory costs, and the Tariff Commission had before them only the same evidence as was before the Minister of Trade and Customs when he fixed the value at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;65.</inline> I should like the Minister to adopt a recommendation which was put before him at an interview, and indorsed by a section of the Tariff Commission. That is, that the machine now selling at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;&#38;i</inline> should be reduced in the first year to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;T5,</inline> and in the second year to ,&#163;70, a total reduction of 14 per cent., and that a <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> reduction should be made in regard to the 6 feet machine. There are also machines from 4 ft. 6 in. to 5 feet in the comb, which have been selling for .^75, and they might very well be brought to ,&#163;65 within two years. In my opinion, it would be best to make three classes - machines under 5 feet to be reduced to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;65</inline> in two years, machines under 5 ft. 6 in. to be reduced to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;70,</inline> and machines under 6 feet to be reduced to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15-</inline> That is practically what was in the mind of every honorable member who voted for the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;12</inline> duty, and would carry into effect the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                    <para>. - Perhaps it would be better to have three classes, because virtually no provision is made for the 6 feet harvester, which was being tested out West last season. I think, however, that the rates I have fixed are very reasonable. The duties will check importations to a large extent, and next year there will be a large increase in the local output. Of late there have been serious complaints as to the prices charged for harvesters, which have been altogether too high. The manufacturers themselves have admitted that one reason for keeping prices up has been the expense to which they are put in sending agents through the country to extend their trade. I think, however, that, taking into account the duty - which I should like to have been higher - they will do very well, though, perhaps, an exception might be made in favour of the third class of. harvester, at an increase of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline></para>

                    <para>.- The Bill makes provision only for stripper-harvesters 5 ft. and 5 ft. 6 in. wide, but there is in use at present a harvester 6 feet wide, or very nearly so. I think that provision should be made for strippers of sizes between those specified, because, as the clause stands, harvesters 5 ft. r in. in width would not come under the Bill. I hope that the Minister does not. intend to increase the selling prices. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen it, and experts have explained to me its possibilities. In view of the fact that we have fixed the selling price at the factory, and that manufacturers have practically been instructed to charge the maximum price, and to. get as much as they can from farmers who are carrying on their operations in distant parts, we ought to be very careful in adopting a maximum quotation. The proposals of the Government are too liberal. The Tariff Commission, which has made a most exhaustive inquiry, reports that the landed cost of, stripper-harvesters is &#163;41, and that &#163;38 is a fair valuation for Customs purposes. In my opinion, the selling price of the), machine should not be fixed at about &#163;30 above these figures, and it is altogether absurd for the Minister to propose to adopt a still higher maximum for 6-feet machines. I would certainly not agree to any proposal for increasing the selling price. </para>

                        <para>- The manufacturers had a meeting, and afterwards waited upon me, and asked that on and after 1st February, 1907, the cash selling prices of standard stripper-harvesters, known as 5 ft. machines, having a width between the drum cheeks of 4 ft. 6 in., at the port of manufacture or the nearest railway station, should be not more than &#163;75, and that the cash selling price of stripper-harvesters known as 5 ft. 6 in. machines, having a width between the drum cheeks of 5 feet, should not be more than &#163;5 extra. They asked for &#163;5 more than I am proposing, and I told them that I could not grant their request. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but I am proposing- to give them &#163;5 less than they ask. I know that a very much larger and improved harvester is being tested now. At the first trial at Narromine, this .harvester stripped 31 acres per day for fourteen days. It is what is called a push machine, the horses being hitched up behind instead of in front of the machine. If we fixed the price of this harvester so low that it would not pay the manufacturers to sell it, we should discourage them from placing it upon the market. It is much more expensive to make than the ordinary harvesters, and gets through three times as much work. Therefore, I think that it is fair to fix the price at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> more than that adopted for the s ft. 6 in. machine. </para>

I wish to point out to the Minister that in making such a distinction between 5 ft. and 5 ft. 6 in. machines, he is offering a special inducement to the manufacturer of the. smaller machines. I think that he would be acting wisely if he fixed the selling price at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;70</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15,</inline> and allowed intermediate sized machines to be sold at intermediate figures. </para>

                    <para>. - It is about time the Committee became aware of the fact that there is an Opposition. Honorable members opposite are beginning to quarrel amongst themselves as if there were no Opposition. We have entered into an arrangement with the Government that this Bill shall be put through this afternoon, and some finality ought certainly to be arrived at. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has had a good innings, and he has done very well. That being the case, I hope the Government will push the Bill forward and complete the arrangement which was arrived at with the Opposition. </para>

Whilst he was speaking,- I interjected that over twenty years ago I purchased harvesters in America for $85. Thereupon the honor able member stated that they were only invented ten .years ago. It may be only ten years to the honorable member, but I recollect that McCormack&#39;s harvester, the Deering, the Miller, the Blue Rock, the Rocky Mountain, the Massachusetts, the Ohio, and twenty or thirty more machines were being operated in Western America - it fell to my lot to operate one - long before the honorable member was born. I wish him to understand that I am not accustomed to make statements which are inaccurate. I am just as honorable as he is. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Darwin is evidently under the impression that what he says he was doing in America about twenty-five years ago has some relevance to the price of harvesters. I must confess that I am unable to see the connexion. I wish to learn from the Minister whether he does not think that the minimum and the maximum prices fixed in this Bill should be the prices of the smallest and largest machines respectively, and that we should fix intermediate prices for intermediate machines. </para>

                    <para>. - When I prepared the schedule to this Bill I had in mind only two classes of machines, namely, the 5 feet and 5 ft. 6 in. machines. I was not then aware that a 6-ft. machine was made. Obviously we cannot fix the same selling prices for a 6-ft. machine that we impose for a 5-ft. machine. I understand that the cost of the &#34;push&#34; machine is &#163;120. This is 12 feet. I find, therefore, that altogether there are four kinds. </para>

                    <para>.- It is perfectly correct to say that the 6-ft. machine has been tested. It was tested last year. The Minister has established a standard, which he says is a fair one. He has not adopted the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. That body recommended that the price of the 5 ft. 6 in. should be fixed at &#163;75. I say that the minimum price for a machine which is over 5 ft. 6 in. should be &#163;75. </para>

                    <para>. - This is the machine to which I referred earlier in the day as Professor Campbell&#39;s cultivator. I pointed out that, unless it were specifically named in the list of free goods, it might be held to be dutiable at 20 per cent., under the heading of &#34;Cultivators other than disc&#34; in Part I, and I assume that, as the result of my action in drawing attention to the matter, the Minister, after making inquiries, has decided to place it on the free list. The machine cannot be manufactured here, and I am pleased that the Minister has submitted this amendment. </para>

Hitherto, on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> leaving the chair, it has always been removed. I do not know of what use it is, but it seems to be the emblem of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> office. Perhaps the fact that it has been retained on the table whilst you, sir, are temporarily occupying the Speaker&#39;s chair, is an indication that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will be translated to&#39; a higher sphere, namely, that of the High Commissioner in London, and that we shall have the pleasure of seeing you elected in his place. </para>

                        <para>. - Could the Prime Minister make any definite statement as to the intentions of the Government with regard to the close of the session ? Some honorable members have already left for their homes, and others have fixed upon certain dates for leaving Melbourne. The Prime Minister will realize that it is not fair to keep one set of members working here whilst others are allowed to go back to their constituents and enter upon their electoral campaigns. Those honorable members who have to travel by sea to the distant States have to make their arrangements some days beforehand, and, therefore, I should like to have some indication as to the date upon which we shall be relieved of our duties. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that with assiduity, we shall be able, so far as this House is concerned, to practically dispose of the remaining business next week. Our labours may, however, have to be extended into the first days of the following week. Most of the measures now before the Senate have already been before us, and will not require to engage our further attention unless requests or amendments are made, as in the case of the Spirits Bill. I hope that, by applying ourselves closely to the work before us, and with some good fortune, we shall be able to dispose of the business upon the notice-paper next week, and, if necessary, give attention to any Bills that may come back from the Senate during the following week. As to the date of the elections, I would point out that two of the&#39; measures passed by an absolute majority last night require to be dealt with in a similar manner in another place. After they have been so approved, two months must elapse before the elections can be held. That means that the elections cannot take place until the last days of November or the first week in December. </para>
