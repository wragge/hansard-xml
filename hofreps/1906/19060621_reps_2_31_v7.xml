                        <para>- The matter with which I now propose to deal was referred to at the close of last session ; but the scope then proposed to be given was too long. No doubt tine position of the honorable member for Coolgardie, that under the law the general elections cannot take place in October next, is the correct one ; but, if the date which I have set down is fixed upon, a fortnight more than is actually required will be given. 'No action was taken in this matter last session, because no motion dealing with it was. pressed : but the Minister of Home Affairs expressed sympathy with the object of those who supported the views which <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> am about to repeat. I am afraid that his sympathy has now dwindled away, because he seems not to be at all anxious to hold the elections earlier in the year than they were held in 1903. The statement that the rolls cannot be got ready in time for an earlier election is puerile. Four or five months must elapse between the present date and that which I propose, and if the staff of the Department is not large enough 1:0 get the rolls ready in .that time, it can be increased to the number necessary to do the work. We have been given to understand that preparations for the holding of the elections have been going on for some time past in anticipation of the approval of Parliament to the Commissioners' redistributions of divisions ; and, as those redistributions have been approved of without alteration, there can <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> no excuse for delay on their account. I intend to take the sense of the House on this question, because it is too serious to be trifled with. As honorable members know, a farmer might, by a day or two's neglect in the month of December, lose the results of his year's labour, because a dry wind might come, and if his wheat was not garnered, half of it might fall to the ground. For this reason the farmers cannot be expected to attend at the polling- booths as they should if the day for the holding of the general elections is chosen in so unseasonable a month of the year as December. It must be remembered that the next elections will be of immense importance. For several years past the political position, so far as Commonwealth affairs are concerned, has been very unsatisfactory. Old parties have been broken up, and new parties have been formed ; but there has been no proper following of party leaders, and no cohesion, and honorable members have not known where they were. I do not propose to say who, in my opinion, is responsible for this state of affairs ; but I regard it as having retarded Federal development, while it has bitterly* disappointed the public of Australia, and has caused embarrassment, and, in some cases, perhaps, humiliation, to honorable members. Business has been conducted here almost on go-as-you-please principles, but, throughout, one party has been pushing steadily, ruthlessly, and persistently ahead, and has lost no chance of improving its position. In saying that, I cast no reflection upon the party to which I refer, because, if I were a member of it, I should be glad to see it working om those lines. Its object hitherto has been, by holding the balance of power, to control the conduct of government, and in that it has largely succeeded, although its members have had to cast their fiscal opinions aside to achieve that end. </para>

                        <para>- They have a great deal' to do with it, as the honorable member will presently discover. Having hitherto controlled to a great extent the administration of affairs, the Labour Party will make at the next elections a determined attempt to capture the reins of government. For that I shall not blame them; but it will make the next elections of the utmost importance, and will require an expression of opinion from the whole of the people of Australia. If they had a majority of the electors behind them, they should take charge of 'the affairs of the country. I do not know that in such a case the conditions would be much worse than they are now. .1. am quite willing that the Labour Party shall control the administration if they have the support of the majority of the electors, but [ am not content that they shall exercise such a large influence as th?y do over the affairs of State whilst they represent a minority of the electors. The object of the party has been fairly and clearly set out by t,heir leader as being the nationalization of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that in discussing the question as to the date upon which the next elections should be held, I was in order in referring to the policies of the various parties that will be appealing to the country at that time. However, I shall not transgress any further, except to say that the Labour Party, although it has not a majority in this House, plays its cards remarkably well. No one takes exception to the leader, to whose tact and general characteristics the success of the party has been mainly due. That honorable member, however, is merely a chip on the stream, and when the tide begins to run a little more strongly, he may be swept aside, and landed on the bank. We know very well that his views do not coincide with those held by certain extreme members of his party, and the date is not far distant when he will have to part company either with his position or his conscience. The Labour Party propose to run candidates in all the divisions of the Commonwealth, and they are even setting up opposition to the candidature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> In my view, that is a. most unworthy thing to do. It is never done in Great Britain. Last year a friend of mine entered upon a contest for the Carlisle seat against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowther.</inline> He had been working for many months, and had spent considerable sums, of money, when the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gully</inline> from the Speakership of the House of Commons led to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowther.</inline> My friend immediately abandoned his campaign, because it is always recognised in Great Britain that the Speaker is above party, and ought not to meet with party opposition. Therefore, he is always returned unopposed. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that the' members of the Labour Party do not like to hear the truth. It seems that I am touching them on the raw. I do not think that it is creditable for politicians of high standing to enter into an arrangement that will render them immune from the opposition of any party. At present we will call them immunists, who are on the road to becoming communists. If the next elections are held at the same period of the year as that at which the last elections took place, the primary producers of .the Commonwealth - and more especially of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia - will be placed at a great disadvantage. No other section of the population is situated in quite the same way. Every other class will have an opportunity of voting, because, if men happen to be away from home, they can arrange to record their votes by post. The farmer, however, cannot afford, during the harvest, to lose the time that would be occupied in going to the poll-. This matter rests entirely with the Government, and I do not think that any exception can be taken to an expression of opinion on the part of the House. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister must not drag that red herring across the track. The language of the motion is respectful and courteous, and no censure is implied. The Government, as I have said, has this matter in their full control, and there is no valid reason - departmental or otherwise - why the elections should not be held before the date I have named. No plea of want of time will be of any avail. Of course, I am quite aware that some Ministers are in a very peculiar position. Their seats depend upon the action of the party to whom the criticisms of some of their number have been directed. It is possible, therefore, that there will be a division in the Cabinet with regard to this matter. If there is, I hope that the Prime Minister will put his foot down and do justice. If he does, he will merit the thanks of the farming community. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not propose to follow the example of the honorable member for Echuca in discussing this very important question, by entering upon a general disquisition upon the atrocious policy, or want of policy, that characterizes honorable members on the Opposition benches. I think that that may be very well left out of the discussion of a matter of this kind. I share the anxiety exhibited by the honorable member to have the election held at a time that will suit every one in the community. I think that all parties should join in an endeavour to so arrange the election that the least possible number of persons will be inconvenienced. I should like to point out that there is no grave reason why this anxiety for an early election should be confined to the members of the party with which the honorable member for Echuca happens to be associated, because for every farmer who is disfranchised owing to the election taking place at harvest time, a much greater number of farm labourers are prevented from voting. Labour candidates desire that the election shall be held at an early date quite as strongly as does the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. In my district last year a considerable number of persons refrained from going to the poll because of the inconvenience and possible loss that would have been involved if they had left their homesteads at that time. A. few months later, when the harvest was over, and a general election was held in New South Wales, the Labour candidate in my constituency polled 5,000 more votes than were recorded in my favour in the previous December. It seems to me that there is not much comfort for the honorable member for Echuca in these facts. ' ' For a considerable time past, it has seemed to me that it is altogether undesirable to hold the elections at any time during the latter half of the year. No matter what period you fix between June and December, you will disfranchise some large section of the community. At any rate, if you do not dis- f ranchise them, you will cause them serious inconvenience. In Queensland, the sugar harvest has commenced', and men are engaged in cutting cane, or are otherwise busily occupied in work just as urgent as. that which has to be done when Che wheat crops are ripe. From what I can understand, sugar cane cannot be allowed to stand for any considerable time after it is ripe, and, therefore, the work of cutting it is a matter of urgency. In the pastoral" districts of Queensland, shearing is now proceeding, and a little later, the shearers will be moving down to New South Wales, and still later to Victoria. So that during the latter half of the year, the harvest is being gathered in some part of Australia, and a large section of the electors would be seriously inconvenienced if they had to attend the poll. I trust that the honorable member who tabled the motion' will be disposed to give some consideration to classes other than those who are most numerously represented in his own constituency. </para>

In many cases, witnesses cannot be obtained" near the shearing sheds to enable the essential preliminaries to be gone through to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot, and to prevent impersonation. Therefore, there are difficulties in the way of the shearers as well as in the way of the farmers. </para>

Long before the honorable member began to agitate upon this question, long before the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> commenced to publish its diatribes about the attitude of the Labour Party in this connexion, I suggested in the House that there was one way in which the inconvenience at present experienced could be prevented so far as the election ensuing after the next is concerned. </para>

Before the newspapers had attributed to the Labour Party a wish to delay the forthcoming elections until December, I advocated that an effort should' be made to amend the Constitution so as to give to honorable members of both Houses, of the next Parliament an additional tenure of three months, thus allowing the genera] election to be projected into March, when practically everybody would be able to exercise the franchise. </para>

                        <para>- We have not the power 'to do that, however desirable it might be. It has been urged that the adoption of the plan suggested would not insure the holding of all subsequent elections at the same period of the year. But we could at least insure that, unless there were a penal dissolution of both Houses, under the deadlock provisions of the Constitution, the elections for the Senate would be held at a much more convenient time than they are at present. So far as this House is concerned, penal dissolutions are always possible, but we are at present under just as great a liability to have the elections of the two Houses separated as we would be then. To insure that in future the inconvenience to which allusion has been made shall be minimized as much as possible, the effort, I think, is worth making. So far as the present position is concerned, I quite agree with the honorable member for Echuca, that the Ministry and the Department of Home Affairs should be expected to use every means in their power to put the electoral machinery in order at the earliest possible moment. At the same time, I am inclined to think that the honorable member his overlooked the immense distances which exist in Australia. The Department has to deal, not merely with the electors of New South Wales or Victoria, but with those of the Northern Territory, the northwest corner of Western Australia, and the far north of Queensland with which places communication is not frequent. Though an earl v election might not inconvenience the voters resident in' these remote portions, of the Continent, their distance from the centres of population increases the difficulties of the Department in getting the electoral machinery to work. That machinery is more difficult to work in respect of the places I have mentioned than it is in respect of places like Echuca or Wagga. I think that the Government should strain every nerve to enable the forthcoming elections to be held at the earliest possible moment. I Quite agree with the honorable member for Echuca that if it can be done it is' desirable that the next general election should take place earlier than did the election of three years ago. I believe that a few weeks can be saved in that way, and I hope that the Government - without any instructions from the House - will use every possible effort to permit of the elections being held at such a time as will minimize the inconvenience that must inevitably attach to their conduct, no matter at what period of the year they may be held. </para>

At the same time it concerns certain statements that have been made by the honorable member for Echuca, who, I fear, has not enjoyed an intimate acquaintance with the leader of the Labour Party so long as I have. My experience of the honorable member for Bland is that he is indeed a most useful man to his party, because, while believing in as extreme and ultimate a form of Socialism as any member of that party - as his own statements clearly show - he yet has such a smooth and amiable way of putting his doctrines before the country as to produce in the minds of the people an impression similar to that which is entertained by the honorable member for Echuca. For instance, only yesterday I was quoting a statement which the leader of the Labour Party made- </para>

                        <para>- I regret to say that I did not hear the last few remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta. There are such constant conversations proceeding in all parts of the Chamber that I frequently experience difficulty in following the utterances of honorable members. I must, therefore, ask them to cease their conversations, or else to conduct them in a much lower tone of voice. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that I shall be in order in replying to certain statements which have been made, and which were not ruled out of order. If honorable members* desire a specimen of the very 'cute and clever attitude which is adopted by my honorable friend, the leader of the Labour Party, they have merely to recollect his statements of a few moments ago. With that suave exterior of his, he laid a quiet claim to a purely class vote, and accused the honorable member for Echuca of seeking merely to study the interests of that section of the laboring class known as the farmers. He declared that the honorable member spoke in the interests of the farmers, and he added that the Labour Party would secure the farm labourers' vote. He quoted figures to show that this was so. For instance, he said that 5,000 more votes were cast in the agricultural constituency which he represents at the last State elections than were recorded in his own favour at the general elections for this Parliament. It may be that that is the reason why he is leaving that district for a city constituency. If he feels so sure that all the farm labourers' votes will be cast in favour of his party, why is he leaving them and seeking a purely city constituency? </para>

                        <para>- Another quiet bit of unction which the honorable member for Bland laid to his soul was that he had preceded the honorable member for Echuca in his agitation for an alteration in the date of holding the general elections. As a matter of Tact, when the leader of the Labour Party spoke last year upon this question, it was upon the motion of the honorable member for Echuca. He was not ahead of the honorable member for Echuca in any way. The leader of the Labour Party, under that mild and pleasant exterior which he successfully presents to most members of the Chamber, made this quiet claim for labour, which the more out spoken members of his party would never have dreamed of doing. I know quite too much of the method of propagandism adopted by him to subscribe to the great eulogies that have been heaped upon him from time to time by members of my own party. However, that may pass. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the Government ought to facilitate the holding of the elections at the earliest possible moment, and so permit those who ordinarily vote with great inconvenience to vote as little under those natural disadvantages, which are inseparable from distance and other considerations as is possible. I am not quite clear in my own mind that the Government are treating this matter as they ought to do. The other day, in response to a request by a member of the Labour Party, the Minister of Home Affairs quoted a certificate which had been issued to him by the Electoral Office, and in which it was pointed out that the elections could not be held in October. </para>

                        <para>- All that was contained in the circular in question was of a negative character. An estimate of the difficulties which had to be faced in the Electoral Office had evidently been made to allow even of a negative certificate being furnished as to the earliest period at which the elections could be held!. Yet. when I asked the Minister whether his officers had made an estimate as to the probable earliest date at which they could take place, he declined to say anything except that he would institute inquiries into the matter. I submit that by this time the Minister ought to have a reliable estimate in his Department of the earliest date at which the elections can be held. If what the honorable gentleman has told us represents the whole of the facts of the case, it does not redound to the credit of the Department that, within a few months of the time when this Parliament must expire, it has no idea of what its electoral arrangements are. </para>

                        <para>- That is all the more reason why it should be able to forecast the earliest date at which the elections can be held. The same muddle occurred at the last elections. Everything was in confusion, and thousands of electors were disfranchised. Certainly that was so in my own constituency, and I venture to say it was the common experience of honorable members. Since then three years have elapsed, but though we are within a few months of a general appeal to the people, we are told by the Minister that he cannot say when the necessary machinery for the conduct of the elections will be in readiness. That is a condition of things that ought not to exist, and the sooner it is remedied the better it will be for all concerned. Let us suppose that something occurred which necessitated an immediate appeal to the country. What would be the position? Would the Government say, "We cannot settle these issues"? Let us suppose that upon some vital question - going, it may be, to the very existence of our national life - a dissolution took place, would the Government come to the House, and exclaim. "I do not know when we shall be ready to make this appeal to the country"? All this is a confession of Ministerial weakness, and of departmental inefficiency. Certainly it is a confession of departmental unpreparedness. After five or six years of our Commonwealth life our electoral machinery ought to be in such a state of efficiency as to be ready for use almost at a month's notice. Instead of that, the Minister told us that the Department will not be ready in October, the month spoken of as the one in which the elections should take place. We know, also, that there has been a protest against the holding of the elections in October on the part of the honorable member for Darling. I presume that that hastened the supply of the circular. It was a notification to the Government that they had better look out for October. </para>

                        <para>- So we got a circular from the Minister that the elections could not be carried out in October. Presumably the honorable member for Darling is satisfied for the moment, but I should' like to know why we cannot be satisfied in the same way. By this time our Electoral Department should have reached such a state of efficiency as to be able to fix the probable date on which the electoral machinery can be used. Instead of that, the Minister does not know when it can be used ; he will make inquiries, but he has not the remotest idea. There is a careful estimate and an accurate conclusion as to October, and everything else is vague and in the air. </para>

                        <para>- That is precisely the case I am putting - some grave emergency arising requiring an immediate appeal to the people on some matter affecting their interests. According to the dictum of the Minister, a period of six months must elapse before the electoral machinery can be ready. All this is neither more nor less than a reflection upon the condition of things which obtains in the Department in regard to matters most vitally affecting this Parliament and the interests of the people. My own impression is the same as that of the honorable member for Bland, and I 'believe of honorable members generally, that the December date fixed for the Senate is the most inconvenient that could possibly be fixed. I urge upon .the Government the advisability of submitting a simple constitutional amendment fixing the date of the termination of a Senate term earlier or later than that now provided for. In all the circumstances it would seem that a later date is preferable to an earlier one - that is to sa.v. that a date in February. March, or April, would best suit almost the whole of the people of Australia. It is impossible to fix a date which will suit the interests of all the people, but we mav have a fair idea of what will suit the great majority, and in all these questions, which are matters of expediency and administration, it is the interests of the great majority that we ought to consult I am not quite sure whether what I have suggested should not be done at the forthcoming elections. Certain it is that until it is done we shall have to continue the holding of elections at a time when a great proportion of the people - for whom, in view of the natural disabilities under which they labour, the electoral machinery should be stretched if* possible - will be unable to record their votes. They are under natural disabilities in this regard, arising from their remoteness from the polling booths and centres of population, and from the general conditions under which they live, and we should endeavour to modify and remedy those disabilities as far as possible bv means of our electoral machinery. Every one knows that some of our farmers must go from 10 to 20 miles to record their votes. </para>

A geographical hindrance does not materially differ in its effect from a legislative hindrance, and we might just as well disfranchise these people or give electors in towns two votes to- their one, unless they are given some facilities for recording their votes in the easiest, earliest and quickest way. Considered in all its ramifications, the matter is a very important one. It is said that an ounce of fact is worth a ton of theory, and I remember that at the last election I went to address a meeting of farmers in my own electorate. ; When I reached the place of meeting, although the meeting had been advertised, I found that there were only two assembled to listen to my eloquence.

Many of them told me on the way to the place" of meeting that they would not be present, as they could not afford to lose the day; it meant so much to them. </para>

                        <para>- I did not hold a meeting, but I will tell honorable gentlemen the sequel of the visit. When the polling-day came I got all the votes in the neighbourhood but two. It is difficult in their busy_ seasons to get farmers to give attention to political matters, and I suppose it is the more difficult where they have confidence in their representative. One of the men who attended the meeting to which I have referred told me that the small attendance was a vote of confidence in me rather than otherwise, and so it turned out on the polling-day. I have mentioned this matter to show that natural difficulties are always dogging the farmer's life, subject as he is to seasons and climatic conditions. It is not fair that, in addition to natural disabilities, we should impose disabilities upon country voters arising from defects of our legislative machinery. It is just the same as if we imposed legislative disabilities upon them. Under the Constitution as it stands, a legislative restriction is necessarily imposed upon these electors, and the sooner we can remove or modify it the better for the country as a whole. There is, I think, a consensus of opinion at the present time that the sooner an appeal to the people is made the better. We have the authority of the Prime Minister for saying, that this House, as at present constituted, cannot do useful work. </para>

                        <para>- Because the Prime Minister has not the material with which to work. I should have thought that that had been made clear to the honorable member last night. The Prime Minister is quite impotent to do anything except by the grace and favour of men who do not believe in him, and who are prepared to put him to the sword at the earliest possible moment. That is the condition of affairs to-day. In other words, there is no such thins as responsible government set up. The Prime Minister says that there are three parties in the House, and that we cannot have responsible government with three parties. " Two is company and three is none," is the waypracticallly in which the honorable and learned gentleman describes the present state of parties in this House. </para>

                        <para>- I should think that the working of this. House is vitally connected with the matter of elections. I can conceive of ;no more vital consideration than the conditions existing in this House, and the possibility of remedying them by constitutional and legislative means. T say that the Prime Minister has himself furnished the best of all reasons why there should be an early appeal to the people, but no matter how great the urgency, we are told that we cannot do it, because the electoral machinery is not read\. That condition of affairs should be remedied, and the electoral machinery should be .ready whenever we wish to use it - within reason, of course, because we cannot expect the necessary adjustments to be made in a moment. I suggest that between now and October or November is a reasonable time within which to make the necessary arrangements. If the compilation of the rolls is in question, seeing that there are now no revision courts to trouble us, that should be merely a matter of the employment of labour for the purpose. The delimitation of the boundaries, and the fixing of polling- places are again merely matters of the employment of labour, and I submit that they should! not stand in the way of getting the electoral machinery ready at the earliest possible moment, in order that we may have those great issues settled which both sides of the House are professedly so anxious to have settled, and none more than honorable members opposite, who have declared this House to be an unworkable House, and who seek to dissolve existing parties into two, so that responsible government may be carried on, and  good and useful work, such as will lead to the building up and prosperity and stability of Australia may take the place of our present inefficient and unsatisfactory methods'. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member who moved this motion stated that he desired to introduce it in an inoffensive form, that he desired to obtain an expression of the opinion of the House, and not in any way to take up the attitude of dictating to the Government the exercise of His Majesty's prerogative. After all is said and done, what is aimed at is an early dissolution of the House, involving the exercise of the* Royal prerogative, which, as a rule, is exercised on the advice of His Majesty's Ministers. On the face of it the motion is certainly inoffensive, and should not necessarily introduce party politics; but under cover of it the honorable member has made a few remarks which seem to indicate that it has been introduced from his own political stand-point. He suggested, for instance, that if the elections were not held at the time he desired certain persons in the community would not have an opportunity to express their opinions on important questions, anil that, as a result, the judgment of the electors might be different. </para>

Under cover of this innocent motion the honorable member also indicated that the Government were not expressing their opinions upon the absolute facts before them, but were under the control of a certain political party in this House. I think that that statement was made clearly enough, and I can inform the honorable member that no single member on this side has approached me as Minister of Home Affairs with any suggestion as to the date on which the elections shall be held. When the Electoral Bill was being considered last year, I made the statement and I think that the Prime Minister made a similar one - in reference to a motion brought before the House bv the honorable member for Echuca - that all that could be done would be done to expedite the holding of the general elections at the earliest date practicable. That promise has been kept in view ever since. It is the desire of the Government that the general elections shall take place at the earliest date practicable, and the fixing of the polling day will not be determined by political considerations of any kind. </para>

                        <para>- It is a fact. Of course, the honorable member is entitled to his ' opinions ; but we considered the measure necessary to remove all doubts, and to put matters on a clear, definite, legal basis. Our object was to give to each State the representation to which it is entitled, and, while the honorable member may disagree with me as to the need for the measure, I am sure that he is of opinion that its object was a good one. The Act was assented to on the 23rd November, 1.905 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> but before that we had taken steps to bring its provisions into operation, and, on the nth December, proclaimed the date for an enumeration. Immediately that had been done, copies of the Act were sent to the States Premiers, inviting their cooperation, and, on the 23rd December, letters had been forwarded to the Statisticians of the States, asking them to get in readiness all necessary figures and information. The enumeration of all the States was completed .in time to allow of the issue of the necessary certificates on the 12th January of the present year. </para>

                        <para>- That is another matter, with, which I shall deal later. When we knew what the representation of each State should be, we communicated with the Commissioners whom it was proposed to appoint to make the necessary redistributions, got their consent to act, and supplied! them with all necessary data, so that, before the end of February, their commissions had been issued, and they were at work. We received the report from Western Australia on the 1 8th, and that from Queensland on the 20th April, white the New South, Wales report was received on the 3rd, and the Victorian report on the 16th May. In the meantime, acting on the assumption that Parliament would accept the redistributions without- alteration. we had communicated with the Governments of the States, asking for the services of the police in connexion with the readjustment of the rolls by the assignment of electors to the new polling places. It has been said that the electoral distributions went through this House because of a collapse ; but it was not due to a collapse that we put them through the Senate in the same week. </para>

                        <para>- No; because we have not yet received from the police the information that must be obtained before any printing can be done. In Victoria, the report was made only quite recently, in fact a couple of months or so ago. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Of course, a number of alterations hare had to be made in Victoria because of the reduction of the number of divisions from twenty-three to twenty-two. The police are engaged in assigning electors to the most suitable polling places in the new divisions. Some of the old polling places have been absolutely cut in two. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. This is not work which could be clone in a day or two, and it is impossible to say, when so many contingencies have to be taken into account, on what date, three or four months ahead, the elections can be held. We have about 5,000 registrars throughout Australia, some of them acting in the suburbs of Melbourne and the adjacent country, and others as far away as the northern parts of Queensland, Port Darwin, and the remote places in Western Australia. In the Grey division of South Australia, the chief centre is Petersburg, and if the divisional returning officer wishes to correspond with the registrars in the Northern Territory, which forms part of that division, his letters have to be sent half way round the Continent by sea, and the replies returned over the same enormous distance. Maranoa is an immense division of which the boundaries have been changed, and the police are now in its outlying districts in search of information. Even where divisional boundaries have not been altered, we are irvine to get the most up-to-date information before reprinting the rolls. </para>

                        <para>- The registrars have been asked to send in, as soon as possible, all information available; but the Chief Electoral Officer cannot yet say when the registrars of a State like Western Australia will be able to comply with that instruction. After this information has been sent to the Commonwealth electoral officers of each State, true copies of the rolls will have to be prepared, and these will be sent to the various Government printing offices. Thus it will be seen that the preparation of the rolls cannot be materially hastened bv the employment of extra assistance, though instructions have been given to employ additional hands wherever that may be necessary to secure expedition. When once the copies of the rolls are in the hands of the various Government Printers, it will be possible to make an estimate of the time which will be required to print them, though experience shows that these estimates will not be accurate to within a week. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and all the necessary instructions have been given. In Queensland a collection has recently been made, and we find that many additional names can be placed upon our rolls. We find that in Tasmania there are many additional names on the State rolls, and we have asked the assistance of the -police in the compilation of our rolls, in order that they may be rendered as complete as possible. In every State we are endeavouring to make the rolls as perfect as possible. All this is causing a very heavy strain on the Department, and extra work beyond anything that was contemplated. We hope that when we arrive at electoral uniformity, and the State and Commonwealth authorities are able to co-operate, there will be an annual collection throughout the Commonwealth, as is now the case in New South Wales. I am merely mentioning these facts to enable honorable members to realize the enormous difficulties in the compilation of the rolls, and in the readjustment due to the desire on the part of the Government to give each State the representation to which it is entitled. The officers of the Department have had to work extremely hard, and the Acting Chief Electoral Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bingie,</inline> who has been doing the electoral work, in addition to discharging his duties as chief clerk, has laboured so assiduously that he has injured his health. I think that it is only due to that officer, who has been working admirably, and w.hose reputation may be affected if the Electoral Department has not accomplished all that has been expected of it, to mention what has been done. I have only, so far, reached the stage of printing the rolls. After the rolls have been printed they will have to be distributed throughout the length and breadth of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In connexion with the publication pf the reports of the Electoral Commissioners, I gave instructions that wherever the Commissioners required assistance it was to be at once granted to them. Therefore, there was no excuse for unnecessary delay in that direction. When the rolls are printed, they will have to be distributed all over Australia. If, for instance, we printed the Western Australian rolls here, they would" have to be despatched to that State, and some of them would have to be sent along the northern coast as far as Wyndham. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest.- Why should they be printed here? </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. My predecessor authorized the printing of the rolls in Melbourne, and I think that be acted quite properly under the circumstances. The printing could not be done in Western Australia. I am merely relating a few facts which are inconsistent with the statements made bv the honorable member. The distribution of the rolls will occupy a considerable time; but if the elections can be held on or about the date mentioned in the motion - the question as to whether it is practicable will, of course, have to be decided by the Governor in Council - every effort will be made in that direction. I have here a complete table showing exactly what has been done. The Commonwealth electoral officers have been working day and night, including Saturday nights, in order to push on with the work. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. I think that the permanent appointments should have taken place before I took office. When I assumed control, I found that all the most important offices were filled by gentlemen who had been temporarily appointed. In Queensland we had an excellent official, who was borrowed from the Postal Department. He was carrying out the work efficiently, but he was unable to continue to do so without interfering seriously with his ordinary duties. It was, therefore, necessary to appoint a man who could' devote the whole of his time to the work. I found it necessary to have a Chief Electoral Officer, and to appoint in three of the States Commonwealth permanent electoral officers. These appointments would have been necessary even if the Electoral Office had been administered through the Postal Department. We still hope that the States Governments will come into line with us, and do away with the necessity for two sets of officers to perform practically the same work. We have been in communication with the States Governments, and a Conference of the States and Commonwealth electoral officials has been held, with a view to ascertaining if we cannot harmonise our arrangements ;and save a large sum of money. If we succeed in this direction, we shall have a more efficient system of registration, and better rolls, and also effect considerable economies. I mention these facts in order to show honorable members the difficulties which would beset the Chief Electoral Officer if he were told that the election must take place by a certain date. </para>

                        <para>- That was done on the assumption that the action was constitutional, but doubts were subsequently raised. I think that the representatives of Victoria fully appreciate the value of the opinion given bv no less a person than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> who advised that the then proceeding was unconstitutional. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so; he questions the unconstitutionality of acting upon the figures that were published. Since then the necessary legal basis has been sup- . plied. Last year the honorable member for Echuca asked that we should arrange to hold the election at the earliest possible date. I promised the honorable member that I would endeavour to do so, and I think that I have given sufficient evidence to show that that promise has been kept, and that it will be honoured. As we move forward we shall endeavour to arrange for the holding of the election at the earliest possible date. In fixing the date, we shall1 have to look at the matter from an Australian stand-point, and must not be unduly influenced by consideration for Victoria, for New South Wales, or for any other State. If it is found that owing to the harvest in Victoria it ,is impossible for the farmers to go to the poll upon the date of election, it will be a matter for consideration whether some system should not be devised to enable them to record their votes by the machinery of the ballot. The honorable member for Echuca is not the only champion of the farmers. There are honorable members on this side of the House who are direct representatives of the farming section of the community, and who have studied their interests perhaps even more closely than the honorable member has done. It would be well for the honorable member to consider whether his present course of political action is likely to conduce to the interests of those whom he is desirous to serve. We have always borne in mind the interests of the farmers, and will continue to do so, because we recognise that they form one of the most deserving sections of the community. We have, however, to consider the interests of the whole of the electors, and have to fix a date that will be best for all concerned. That matter is now receiving consideration. If honorable members express the opinion that the election should be held at the earliest possible date, they will merely be declaring themselves in favour of that which has already been done, and is still being carried out bv the officials administering the Department, both at the head office and at every branch throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- - I am very glad to hear that, because every honorable member who has had any experience must know that it is quite practicable to hold the elections within that time. We are all familiar with the formal matters to which the Minister has referred, and we know that they can be attended to simultaneously in all the States, and that the great distances to which reference has been made do not impose insuperable barriers to reasonable expedition. When I was at the head of the Customs Department, I used to receive telegrams, from the most remote parts of the Continent, and I must confess that I never experienced the slightest difficulty in replying, to them by wire upon the same day. Surely the same expedition can be observed in giving instructions - by wire or otherwise - to officers in different parts of the Commonwealth. If the Government desire to hold the general elections before the middle of November, we all know that it is quite possible for them to do so, and I think the necessity for doing so has been pretty well emphasized already. I have given a good deal of consideration to this matter. I am not one who would advocate the granting of facilities to farmers which are denied to any other section of the community. I merely wish, as far as it is practicable, to place the farmers upon an equality with other sections of the community. We know that in spite of anything that we may do we cannot place them upon exactly the same footing. They have to contend with many difficulties which are not experienced by any other class. A good deal has been said in reference to the shearers-. I am as much interested in extending to the shearers facilities to vote as I am in granting them to the farmers. But the obstacles in their case are of an altogether different character. If a shearer leaves his own State, and goes to another to pursue his avocation, there is no practical difficulty in the way of him availing himself either of the "Q" form or of the postal vote. </para>

                        <para>- I have had a good deal of experience in connexion with these matters, and I have never known a. single instance of an employer . preventing; a man whose services could be spared, from recording his vote. The difficulty with the farmer is that when his grain is ripe, he cannot incur the risk of leaving it, in order to attend the polling booth. The loss of time that would be thus occasioned is a mere trifle. His chief difficulty is the loss that he might incur by reason of the grain falling out of the ears of his crop. As a practical farmer, the honorable member for Moira knows that. He knows that the loss to which the farmer is liable is infinitely greater than that to which any other section of the community is exposed. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member for Echuca that at the next election there may be the gravest issues involved - issues affecting the interests of the farmer in particular. For instance, if I may be permitted to refer to it, one question which is almost sure to be a prominent feature in the campaign, and one which affects the interests of the farmers vitally, is the proposal to impose an additional land tax. It appears to me that very few honorable members realize the present condition of taxation as between country and city. I will give a very simple illustration of my meaning, and one which will serve to convey to honorable members an accurate idea of what exists at the present time in Victoria. Let us assume that two brothers start life, each being worth£10,000. Let us further suppose that one embarks upon a business in the city, and that the other purchases 1 0,000 acres of land at <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> an acre. The outside rental value of that land, at 5 per cent., is £500 annually, but it would probably be much nearer 4 per cent. Assuming that the brother in the city earned <inline font-style="italic">£500</inline> gross from his business, he would be called upon to pay an income tax of <inline font-style="italic">£5.</inline> That is the rate ruling in Victoria. But what would the country man have to pay? Out of his 10,000 acres, which are worth£1 an acre, there would be 2,500 acres exempt from taxation. The balance of 7,500 acres would bear a tax of 3d. in the£1, or 3d. per acre, which would amount to £93 15s. The local rate for making roads, not exclusively for his own use, but for that of the general public - I am taking the lowest rate prevailing in Victoria - would be , £25. His income tax on a rental of £500 would be just double that levied upon the business man in the city. In other words, it would be <inline font-style="italic">£10.</inline> He would thus have to pay a total of £128 15s. in taxation, as against his brother's £5. Yet, what are the questions which are likely to be submitted for decision at the next election? From all that we can judge at the present time, one of the proposals will be more land taxation for the country yokel and more protection for the city man. I have always been an advocate of protection, but I believe in a little modicum of justice. We have been told by the Minister that there are a number of farmers' representatives upon the other side of the House. I do not doubt his statement for a moment, and I do not doubt that they will vote for this motion. I am not particular whether the motion be carried or not, so long as the Government will agree to hold the elections at the earliest possible moment. They can do it, as we all know, and I sincerely hope that they will. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I go further and say that there is a good deal of land in Victoria which is classified at 10s. and 5s. per acre, and which, also bears the same rate of taxation. One pound per acre for taxation purposes is the minimum, and lands which are classified at 15s, 10s., and 5s. per acre contribute at the same rate. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that any one will. The speech of the Minister of Home Affairs encourages the belief that the Government intend that the elections shall be held at the earliest possible date. A1J I wish to emphasize is the necessity for that step being taken. I wish also to emphasize that there are no practical obstacles to prevent that being done. If the Minister will give peremptory instructions that the elections must not be held later than the middle of November, I am perfectly satisfied that his officers will carry them out. </para>

                        <para>- I should very much like to see them held1 in October; but I am. afraid that there are some constitutional difficulties which prevent that. But certainly they should be held before the middle of November. If they take place at any later period, harvesting operations will be in full swing, and a very large proportion of the farming community, including their employes, who are equally entitled to consideration, will be disfranchised1. Where it is manifest to the workers that they cannot leave their emplover's crop without involving him in serious loss, my experience is that they refuse to inflict that loss upon him. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not know why honorable members should laugh at my proposal. If they do not desire to embarrass the Government, and to make this question a party one, they will accept the amendment. It is quite impossible to fix a date for the holding of the forthcoming elections, and my only regret is that in discussing a question of this kind, upon which there should be no party feeling, references to Socialism and. land taxation have been dragged in. All parties! agree that it is desirable that the elections should be held at the time which is most suitable to the largest number of voters. I am sure that the Government are just as anxious that the elections should be held at .as early a date as possible, as any honorable member of the Opposition can be. It is within my own knowledge that officers of the Electoral Department are working night after night till 10 o'clock at the present time, and it will be necessary to subject them to even greater pressure. I trust that the amendment will be carried'. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have the least objection to give way to the honorable member for Corio, but for the fact that I must catch the express, and I shall lose my opportunity if I do not speak now. I should not have spoken were it not for a remark made by the Minister. The honorable gentleman said that, in his opinion, the re-organization of the Electoral Department should have been taken in hand before his entry into office. The reorganization that is spoken of is not a very serious matter. The honorable gentleman has appointed an officer as Chief Electoral Officer, and otherwise, I believe, he has practically the same staff as comprised the Department before his acceptance pf office. </para>

                        <para>- A Chief Electoral Officer has been appointed, but, speaking generally, the same staff is conducting the operations of the Electoral Department which conducted them in the past. I informed the House, when I had an opportunity of speaking on the proposals submitted by the Minister in connexion with the Electoral Bill - which proposals were largely amendments which I had previously adopted - that I was satisfied that no reorganization on the present lines will achieve what is necessary, in the case of an electorate so large as all Australia, to secure the efficient, speedy, and successful carrying out of elections. I was then convinced, and I am still more convinced by what we know to-day, and bv the remarks of the Minister, that when we have to reach the remote confines of Australia with our electoral administration, and must control such an enormous area from one centre, the Department operating over all that area must be handling the electoral administration, not merely at the time of an election, or suddenly when the rush of an' election comes on, but day by day and hour by hour during the whole period between elections. That can only be accomplished by a staff so large and so permanent in character as that represented by the staff of the Commonwealth Post Office Department, assisted - and that could be arranged - by the States police forces and bv States school teachers in remote districts. With a reorganization of the Electoral Department on those lines, we should have the strongest electoral staff in the world. In conducting the business, on the lines at present adopted, there will always be weaknesses, because we are depending upon men in remote districts who are not permanent officers of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- These officers form a number of weak links in what ought to be a very strong chain extending throughout he Commonwealth'. I had come to the conclusion, in which I have been confirmed by the remarks of the Minister to-day, that if the work of the Electoral Department is to be done thoroughly, it must be in hand all the time. Honorable members will see that if a returning officer is removed from his position, there is an electoral chaos in his district for a time, because his successor will know nothing of the work. If it were the work practically of a permanent Department, every boy and youth in it would come in contact with that work day by day, just as they do with the money order business of the Post Office Department at the present time, and in the event of vacancies arising there would be an enormous staff of persons competent to undertake the conduct of the business, from which they could be filled. I repeat that there is no reorganization attempted now. There has been merely the placing of one officer, who in his position in Tasmania was a very good officer, and who, I hope, will prove to be a good officer in the position to which he has now been appointed. In the coming elections other officers in the Department will naturally, from their previous connexion with the work, be more useful for the time being. I have no desire to unduly criticise the Department or the Minister. I am aware that the officers in the Department work their very hardest, and, indeed, overwork themselves in their endeavours to carry on the necessary electoral work. I have every sympathy with them. I know that the Minister will also have to overwork himself in connexion with the coming elections. But I do say that there has not been that anticipation of difficulties which might be expected. For instance, I may refer to the measure which created a difficulty in the first instance, and to which the Minister has alluded. It fixed the occasions for the redistribution o'f State representation. The result attained1 by that measure was just the same as that -which would .have been obtained by the process which the previous Ministry desired to adopt, and which was ' the very process which had already been adopted by the Barton Government, of which the present Prime Minister was the Attorney-General. It seemed to me that that measure was brought in by the present Government to save its face, or to save the face of some of its members. Some of them having said in the press, before they became Ministers, that the process proposed by the late Government was not right, they had to do something, or it would have been an admission that they had been incorrect in their statements. That delayed matters ; but we have passed that, and have come now to the position after the last redistribution. I quite agree that an enormous amount of work had to be clone after that. In some cases the whole of the voters in certain polling areas had to be transferred from the old electorate into a new electorate. That is not a very difficult task where there is no division of a polling area by the alteration of a border line. </para>

                        <para>- I think there was no necessity to have waited for them. The information might have been obtained from the central polling places, comprising the bulk of the electors. If the registrars were asked to send in the latest information as soon as the Commissioners' reports were received, that information should be in now for many of the city and suburban electorates, and for the nearer country districts. If they have sent that information in, the necessary alterations can be made, and all the rolls except those for the border line polling areas for- warded to the printing offices. A great deal of time is always taken in printing the rolls, and a hitch of some kind or other may happen at any time; but if a great many of the rolls are dealt with now, there will be .an opportunity to rush the others through later on. I am in sympathy with the object of the honorable member for Echuca, though, knowing the difficulties with which the Department has to contend, I think, after what the Minister has said, that the officers will have great trouble in getting everything ready for elections even so late ais the 31st December. It will be only by adopting the best methods that the elections can be held at an earlier date, though in saying that I am. not criticising the Minister, or questioning his sincerity. Every week by which the time between now and the date fixed for the elections is diminished will serve to prove the increased) activity of the officers of the Department, who are now, I know, working very hard. We have not yet faced the problem of organizing a Commonwealth electoral staff, but I feel that at some future time Parliament will be compelled! to do so. I hope that when that is' done means will be taken to keep the rolls complete from day to day by the assistance of the letter-carriers throughout the various States, instead of, as now, getting them as complete as possible for an election - they are often even then very incomplete; - and then allowing them to fall back until they can be got ready again. for a new election, not in a month or two, but after a frantic rush during five or six months. I agree with the honorable member for Echuca that, in fixing the date for a general election, the convenience of the electors should be studied, and that, whenever possible, loss should not be entailed upon them, by requiring them to record their votes at a busy period of the year. But we have no right to consider how one political party or another will benefit by the fixing of the date of the elections in a particular month. The honorable member for Echuca may have suggested that it would be to the disadvantage of the Labour Party to hold the elections on the date he proposes, while the leader of that party may have said that it would be io its advantage to hold them then, because it would give the employes of the farmers an opportunity to vote. The real, question, is, what is the best date to fix to prevent interference with the occupations and avocations of the electors. I trust that the Government will expedite the holding of the coming elections. The later in the year that the elections are held, the greater will be the number of persons penalized. I agree with the honorable member for Bland that it might be a good thing to hold the elections in the first half of the year, but the forthcoming elections must, of course, be held before the end of this year, and as soon as possible. If, by extra exertion - and a great deal of extra exertion will be needed - the elections can be held on the date named by the honorable member for Echuca, that date should be fixed. </para>

                    <para>.- Although I seconded the amendment, I did so chiefly to secure an opportunity to speak at once, because it seems to me to matter little whether the motion be carried as it stands, or as it is proposed to amend it. In any case, the elections will be held as soon as practicable, because on the 15th November Parliament will be in recess, and possibly this! House will have been dissolved, so that the Government will then have a free hand, and will, of course, do only what is practicable in the matter. I regret, however, that a tendency has been shown by some members of the Opposition to make political capital out of the motion. With the exception of one or two representatives! of metropolitan divisions, practically all of us represent rural as well as urban voters. Even the Melbourne Ports division is big enough to contain a certain number of farmers. </para>

                        <para>- I regret, therefore, that the honorable member for Gippsland suggested that the question is that of' town <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> country. We have had a good many indications of the fact that at the next general elections the Opposition 'intend to raise the flag of anti-Socialism, but there have been a good many false issues raised, and it was interesting to hear the honorable member compare the difficulties under which the farming population labour with the position of the manufacturing population of the towns. According to him. the issue at the next elections will be whether, to use his own words, the country yokel should be taxed to give more protection to the manufacturing population in the towns. We may take it that that branch of the Opposition which consists of so many in"gredients, and now. places itself under the leadership of the honorable member for Gippsland, who repudiates for the time that of the right honorable member for East Sydney, is going to tight against further protection to the manufacturers of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that this matter has been brought in, and the issue of town <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> country raised ; but, as the honorable member for Gippsland has raised it, I felt it necessary to refer to it. The Minister has told us that delay must occur, because the police in Queensland and New South Wales have not yet sent in complete lists. I think it a very great pity that the collection and' revision of the rolls is not conducted on a uniform system throughout the States, and that the police are not similarly employed in Victoria. It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth depends for the correctness of its rolls upon States machinery. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that we should depend' on the machinery of the States. It is an unfortunate thing that we have not a uniform Commonwealth method. There has been a special effort made by members of the Opposition to place in the wrong the representatives of farming constituencies who sit on the Ministerial side of the Chamber. As in my division there are 16,000 rural electors, and only 12,000 urban electors, I am naturally desirous of doing all that I can for the protection of the farmers, and therefore resent the attempts which have been made ito show that we on this side are not their friends. </para>

At any rate, the farmers will not be deceived by the protestations of those who say that they are anxious that the general elections shall be held on the 15th November, when, possibly, they could be held a month earlier. I do not wish to deal with the constitutional point which has been raised'. It may be, if the members of the Senate are required to attend in their places within thirty days of the general elections, that senators will be summoned to attend a meeting of a Parliament in which they may ha.ve only a few days to sit, and, possibly, if the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives are to be held on the one day, it will be necessary under the Constitution to hold them on some day in December. Of course, if that is so, we must bow to the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>. - I fully expected that when the question as to the date upon which the elections should be held was raised, consideration would be given to the interests of all classes of electors. Instead of that, it appears that a certain number of farmers in Victoria - a small percentage of them - desire that a date shall be fixed that will be suitable to them, without paying consideration to any other class. I wish to enter my emphatic protest against this attempt to show favour to one class over another. We are here to represent, not any particular section of the community, but the whole of the humanity of Australia. We represent the electors, not as they are associated with the possession of property of one kind or another, but merely as men and women, and every elector is entitled to equal consideration. The first suggestion that the elections should be held in October, to meet the convenience of the farmers, was made bv the Farmers and Property Owners' Defence League. In the interests of a much more numerous class, whom I thought were entitled to equal consideration. I addressed a letter to the Prime Minister objecting to the elections being held in October. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing has been said by any member of our party in advocacy of a tax upon farmers. In dealing with this question, we should consider what date will prove most suitable for all parties. Unfortunately, any date in the latter half of the year is unsuitable for a certain proportion of the electors. I believe March would be the best month to select. I have no objection to the fixing of a date that would be convenient for the farmers, but I claim that the interests of other classes must also be considered. If the_elections were held at harvest time, many more farm labourers than farmers would be disfranchised, and, if in October or November, many thousands of shearers who could not take advantage of the postal vote, would be unable to go to the poll. The farmer, who has a home, and a postal address, is in a much better position to avail himself of the facilities for voting by post than is the nomadic shearer or shed hand, who does not know when he will have to change his address. A shearer cannot tell definitely when the shed! in which he is engaged will cut out, or the shed to which he will next proceed, so that there are practical difficulties in the way of shearers availing themselves of the postal vote. In New South Wales shearing begins <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> July or August, and is in progress in some parts of that State at the end of the year. The great bulk of the shearing, however, is done in September and October, whilst shearing in Victoria practically begins in October. In New South Wales and Queensland the shearing sheds are great distances apart, and in many cases three weeks are occupied1 before a reply can be obtained to a letter despatched from one of the shearing sheds to the metropolis. We find that there is something behind this movement ostensibly in&gt; the interests of the farmer. What is now being proposed is merely a means to an end. The honorable member for Echuca began his address by referring to the influence exercised by the Labour Party, and to the desirability of bringing about a radical change in this Parliament. I should like to know why this reference should be made to party politics in connexion with the subject now under discussion. It is apparent to me that an effort is being made to fix such a date that a large number of those who vote for labour representatives will be disfranchised. It seems to me that it would be disgraceful if such a result were brought about. </para>

                        <para>- The idea underlying this movement for the holding of the elections at an earlier date than previously is to, if possible, weaken the Labour Party, and I strongly protest against any assistance being lent to those who desire to bring about that result. I do not wish to see the supporters of any party disfranchised. I think that equal opportunities should be given to all classes. The farmer may be put to some slight inconvenience in proceeding to the poll at harvest time ; but, unless the weather conditions are quite exceptional, he runs very little risk of loss. The farm labourer, who has to stop work in order to record his vote, loses his pay, and that is an important matter to him. In these days of improved machinery the farmer runs little or no risk. Then, again, we know very well that a comparatively small number of crops ripen simultaneously, and therefore only a small percentage of farmers would be harvesting on election day. In fact, if the Government could arrange for the election to take place on a wet day, the farmers would have no right to complain. The Government, in dealing with this matter, must consider the whole of the Commonwealth, and not take into account the conditions which prevail in any particular district. The harvesting season varies in different parts of the Commonwealth, and a date that would be convenient for the Victorian farmers might be extremely unsuitable for those located in other places. If the elections are held at an early date, as has been suggested, thousands of shearers - there are 16,000 shearers in the New South Wales union alone; - will be disfranchised. </para>

                        <para>- There are not. The honorable member knows that what I say is perfectly correct. There is, a percentage of farmers only who are interested in the holding of the elections at a certain period of the year. I need scarcely point out that all the shearing sheds do not start operations upon the same d'are, neither do all the farmers commence reaping their crops simultaneously. I maintain that the agriculturists who engage in harvesting at a particular period of the year comprise but a limited number of the farming class. The latter need not lose a single vote if they choose to exercise it. Upon more than one occasion we have heard the leader of the Opposition use strong language in speaking of those who were careless, and apathetic enough not to record their votes. It 'is quite a new thing to learn that the farmers were prevented from voting at the last election. </para>

                <para class="block">In my own electorate there is a very large number of shearers. These men are not apathetic. They would drive 50,' 60, or even 100 miles to exercise the franchise. They are live men and intelligent citizens of the Commonwealth. The farmers have buggies and horses, and every facility to enable them to attend the polling-booth, and I repeat that the percentage of those whose operations would prevent them from recording their votes! in November or December is verv small. I was rather suspicious when I learned that the leader of the Opposition was eagerly jumping at the chance of holding the elections in October. But this afternoon, the honorable member for Echuca has given the show away. He has told us that the object of the move is to strike a blow at the Labour Party, with a view to restoring the two-party system in this House. Is not that practically a confirmation of my statement that if the elections are held in October or November a large body of men who .are notoriously labour supporters will be disfranchised? </para>

                        <para>- -I do not mind if the Labour Party sweeps the polls and becomes the dominant party in this Parliament. But what has that to do with the date of holding the next general elections? I say that no party considerations should be allowed to obtrude themselves in the discussion of a motion of this character. I never anticipated that ideas of that character would find expression in the National Legislature. Whilst we must consider the occupations of the people to the extent of seeing that the general elections are held at the time which is suitable to the majority, we should go no further. I am quite prepared to leave the fixing of the date of the elections in the hands of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is sometimes very suspicious without good cause. I maintain that any time between July and the end of the year is an inconvenient one at which to hold the elections, because it is at that period that the industrial activities of country residents are the greatest. Of the classes that are inconvenienced under the existing arrangement, the farmers have the greatest opportunity of taking advantage of the electoral provisions for voting by post. For that reason the later in the year that the elections are held the better. I have no doubt that the Minister will procure information from various farming districts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>Mr.SPENCE.-The honorable member for Gippsland seems to entertain the idea that somebody else is always anxious to secure concessions for a particular class. I am sorry that I should be called upon to act: as a missionary in any endeavours to enlighten him. T. say that if the elections are held in October, more persons will be disfranchised than if they are held later in the year. I have not heard that any large number of farmers were prevented from voting at the last election, although I am aware that some of them were very apathetic about the exercise of the franchise. I trust that the motion will be rejected. The honorable member who brought it forward should be content with having had the matter ventilated. I quite admit that the most suitable period for all parties at which to hold the elections would be about March. Taking the Commonwealth as a whole, it will be found that a considerable number of electors will be disfranchised, no matter when the elections are held. I hope that this matter will be left entirely in the hands of the Government. Assuming that the motion be carried, what effect can it have? It seems to me that, having ventilated the 'matter, the honorable member for Echuca might well withdraw his proposal. He must know that the Government will select the most suitable date upon which to hold the elections. The brunt of the attack made by members of the Opposition this afternoon has been directed, not against the Ministry, but against the Labour Party. If the Opposition wish to see only two parties in this House, why do they not join the Labour Party and wipe out the Government? We have heard of such things having been done in connexion with the States Parliaments in the past, but I hope that in the higher and purer atmosphere of Federal politics, of which we heard so much in pre-Federation days, no such suggestion will be made. Hence my protest against these references to party views. We should, I think, make ready for some change in the Constitution, fixing the election at an earlier period. I shall not go info that matter, which involves very much more than the mere alteration of the date of the election. Honorable members will agree that it would be necessary to alter the time when a senator should be assumed to have taken his seat. It would be manifestly unfair that a senator elected in March should be unable to take his seat until the following January and that in the meantime, the State concerned should be represented by a man who might have been rejected by the electors. There are bigger questions involved than the mere date of election, but the matter is one which we must face, if we do not desire that the elections shall continue to be held at a most unsuitable time. Honorable members know that at one time we gave up nearly six months of our legitimate term of office, and it is now agreed that we were rather foolish to do so. The elections were first of all held in March, and that practice should have been continued. We took the course we did in order to save the money of the people of the Commonwealth, but we have never had any thanks for doing so. On the contrary, complaints are frequently made that our expenditure is extravagant. It would be wise, I think, for us to revert to the previous position, and the necessity for some alteration should not be lost sight of by the Government. I have suggested what I believe would be a remedy for a condition of things which is admittedly unsatisfactory, and which would enable the elections to be held at a time which would be convenient for the majority of the electors. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that advantage should have been taken of an apparently harmless motion to endeavour to make political capital for one political party. It would appear, from the speeches made by some honorable members, that they alone are the persons who take a particular interest in the welfare of the farmer, and are the only members of the House who give any attention to his wants. I absolutely disagree that those honorable members are the only persons who look after the interests of the farmers, and I also repudiate the suggestion that in the past the farmer has not received a fair share of consideration. Looking, over the figures supplied in connexion with the last Federal elections, I find that in Corangamite, the first country division on the list, a higher percentage of votes was polled than in any other electorate in Victoria. </para>

In the country division of Corio, the percentage recorded was 57-99 In the division of Wannon,, represented by that typical farmers' representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson,</inline> the percentage of votes recorded was 53.97. </para>

                        <para>- I shall combat the honorable and learned member's argument by quoting some of the percentages from town electorates when I have dealt with the country electorates. In the Wimmera electorate, which is almost a purely farming and pastoral division, the percentage of votes recorded was 51. 11. I now come to some of the city electorates of Victoria, and I find that in Southern Melbourne the percentage of votes recorded was 53.59, or the same as the percentage recorded in the Wannon electorate. Iri Northern Melbourne, 48.16 per cent, of the votes on the rolls was recorded. In the Ballarat electorate, represented' by the Prime Minister, and a purely city constituency, the percent age of votes recorded was 46.92, a lower percentage than that recorded' in any of the country constituencies to which I have referred. Still honorable members claim that the farmer is the only person who does not get an opportunity to record his vote. The returns show that in the country divisions a greater number of electors go to the poll than in the city divisions. </para>

                        <para>- Assuming that the honorable and learned member's statement will stand investigation, I ask how it is that so many more votes were recorded in towns outside the metropolitan area than, in electorates within the metropolitan area? In the Grampians division, the percentage of votes recorded was 49.67, which, judging by a rough glance at the figures, is well up to, if not beyond, the average. I have every consideration for the farmer. I believe that, in common with other people, he should be able to have his opinions voiced in this Chamber, and impressed upon the legislation that is passed ; but the choice of representatives by the farming constituencies is scarcely consistent with the arguments we have heard this afternoon. We are told that the farmer clamours for certain consideration, and' when he is given the opportunity he selects a city lawyer as his representative. I have not the slightest objection to that. If the farmers of Wannon prefer the present hon- ~orable and learned member for that constituency to a practical farmer, that is their look out. I notice from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that it is proposed in Flinders now to displace the present purely farming representative of that electorate by another city lawyer in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine.</inline></para>

                        <para>- If they select as their representative a man who is thoroughly conversant with their particular interests, I have nothing to say, but it is a marvellous thine that we should have the iniquitous conditions from which the farmer suffers voiced by men who seldom get outside of Collins-street and the law courts of Melbourne. In the interests of a section of the community composed of men who are doing as much for the advancement of the country as are the farmers, I object to this motion. I refer to the people who go into the interior of Australia in search of mineral deposits. The low percentage of voters on the rolls who cast their votes at the last Federal elections in Western Australia is notorious. In many of the outposts of Western Australia a few. people were gathered together, but, as in such places, men do not remain for any very considerable time, very many electors were disfranchised at the last elections. Instead of being able to record a vote of over 60 per cent, of the electors on the rolls, as was done in the Corangamite division of Victoria, the number of voters recording their votes at the elections in Western Australia was not more than 26 per cent, of the number on the rolls. This shows that the farmer has received twice the consideration in the matter of representation that has been received by the gold-mining section of the community. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that it would be difficult to do so, but I object to the fixing of an arbitrary date at this time without any consideration for the people of the outposts of Australia. In my electorate which, I may casually mention, is as big as the State of Victoria, I may inform honorable members that there is mail communication with Eucla bv subsidized steamer only once every three months. The people there get their supplies under the same conditions. That is from the Western Australian side, and their means of communication from the South Australian side is no better. If we fix an arbitrary date for the elections at the present time, should a steam-boat leave for Eucla in the near future, it is just possible that there would not be another leaving for that place before the elections took place. The right honorable member for Swan will be able to bear me out when I say that it may taka months for the Electoral Department to get into communication with places like Derby and Onslow. The fixing of a definite date . for the next Federal elections, whilst it might assist a few farmers, might do serious injustice to other sections of the community. The height of summer, when the farmer is gathering his grain, is not the most convenient time at which to hold the Federal elections, but, whilst I have no desire to do anything which would1 be unfair to the farmer, or which might prevent him from recording his vote, I repudiate what I consider an attempt by a certain political party to make capital out of this proposal, and I desire to see consideration given to the interests of people in the more remote portions of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall not occupy many minutes of the time of the House, because, in my opinion, the disabilities under which the farmers labour when they have to record their votes in the last month of the year have already been well pointed out by a number of honorable members. I do not agree with the honorable member for Darling that it would make much difference to the shearers if the elections were held on the 15th instead of the end of November. The Minister, I understand, has promised that the next elections shall be held with the least possible delay, and probably before the 15th November. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Bland and the honorable member for Darling both dwelt on the advisableness of holding the elections in March or April, and, although it had not occurred! to me before, it seems to me now that, we have ourselves to blame to a great extent for having changed the time of the holding of the elections from the earlier to the later months of the year. There has been a good deal of talk on this point this afternoon, and I hope that it will not be without a good practical result. I feel that it would be a very simple matter, after the expression of opinion which we have had, to secure an- alteration of the Constitution which would bring about what is desired. But the matter should be taken in hand1 at once, because such an alteration requires, not only that majorities in the two Chambers of the Legislature shall vote for it, but that it shall be before the electors for at least two months before they are called upon to express their opinion in regard to it. If the people are not asked to express their opinion on this matter at the next general elections, they cannot, unless a special referendum is taken, be asked to do so before 1909, so that it wiLl be impossible to effect before 1912 the change which we wish to bring about. The honorable member for Darling somewhat overstated the case when he said that some shearers have more difficulties to face in going to the poll than have the farmers. It is easy to say that the farmers may vote by post, but that can be done only when electors live seven miles away from a polling-place, and, if a farmer requires all his time for the harvesting of a valuable crop, he will not go to a polling-place which is only three or four miles away. I remember that, during the last elections, I heard of, not one, but several, electors who would! not take the trouble to vote, although they were within sight of a polling-place. However, as I said at the commencement, the disabilities of the farmers have been fully placed before the House, and I rose only to ask the Minister to consider seriously whether steps cannot be taken at once to provide for the alteration of the Constitution which has been suggested. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to point out, in connexion with, the suggestions of the honorable members for Bland and Darling, that, although there seems to be an unanimous opinion that the latter months are more unsuitable than the earlier months of the year for an election, the worst month of all is December. Our experience in 1903 showed that to be the case. It is impossible, of course, to fix a date for the holding of the elections which will inconvenience no elector ; but it is our business, so far as we can, to ascertain, and to fix that date which will be least inconvenient to the majority. So far as those engaged in agriculture, whether they be employers or employes, are concerned, the nearer the date of the general election to the end of the year the more marked will be the inconvenience to which they will be put if they wish to vote, because at that time climatic conditions are often unfavorable, and there is consequent risk of great loss from the cessation of work for even a few hours. Although a certain number of electors would be inconvenienced by the holding of the elections in November, most of them are electors who could vote by post. The cases in which three weeks would be taken for electors to send and get an answer to letters are, of course, abnormal, and by the middle of November the shearing iti the more northern parts of the Commonwealth has been finished, and those who have been engaged in it are back in their homes, or living again within comparatively easy reach of postal facilities. When the choice is between those who can, with nothing more than a little inconvenience, record1 their votes through the post-office, and those who cannot record it at all without risk of material financial loss, the latter should Le considered first. To hold, the elections not later than the middle of November would inconvenience fewer persons than to hold them in December, when, in some cases, electors would be altogether prevented from voting. This is an instance in which, as we cannot find a course of action altogether free from inconvenience, it is our business to choose that which is least open- to criticism. The experience of 1903 shows that December is the worst month for the holding of an election, because at that time of the year many electors are prevented from voting, not by reason of their negligence, carelessness, or indifference, but because of the risk to their financial well-being in ceasing from work to go to the poll. I am very glad that the Minister has instructed! his officials to have in mind the middle of November as the date for the holding of the elections. It is not merely the farmers, but their employes as well, who have to be considered. Every adult elector should, if possible, be afforded an opportunity to vote, and no elector should be prevented, by the risk of loss, from recording his vote. In view of the statement of the Minister, I cannot understand why the Government will not accept the motion, because all it declares is that, in the opinion of the House, the general elections should be held not later than the 15th November, and. if possible, earlier. Of course, if it is impossible to hold them earlier, it is useless: to discuss the matter. After what the Minister has said, I see no reason why the arrangements for the holding of the elections should not be completed1 by the date mentioned. The motion is couched in language to which no exception can be taken on the ground that it is an attack upon or a challenge to the Government, and as both the Ministry and the Labour Party have expressed concurrence with the proposal that the elections should, if possible, be held at the date fixed, I shall not hesitate to vote for the motion if it is pressed to a division. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily, but, given equal conditions, there is a strong probability that that happened. The honorable member for Darling sought to show that the farmers were not deprived of the opportunity to vote, and that they were too apathetic to go to the polls. No doubt the charge of apathy as applied to some farmers is to some extent, perhaps to a large extent, true, just as it is true as applied to many other electors, but we know that there were other reasons why such an enormous number of those who were on the rolls failed at the last general elections to exercise the franchise. It is, I think, the duty of those responsible for our electoral administration to see that every facility for voting is given to electors, irrespective of their occupations. It is hardly fair to charge the farmers with apathy, when we fix a date upon which it is practically impossible for them to leave their homesteads. A farmer may, by going to the poll a long distance away, in harvesting time, risk the loss of his crop, and, however strong his political views may be, he cannot afford to take that chance. I do not think that there is a tittle of evidence to support the view put forward by the honorable member for Darling that the motion has been brought forward with a view of disfranchising another section of voters. I have not heard the slightest suggestion of any such desire on the part of members of the Opposition., nor do I believe that such an idea was ever entertained. I can honestly say for myself that my, sole object is to enable as many electors as possible to record their votes, and that I am not swayed. in any way by the political views they hold. I desire to remove the slur which now rests upon the electors of being so apathetic that they will not take the trouble to record their votes. At present we are placing obstacles in the way of a large section of the electors, and are then charging them with indifference. No such charge can be fully sustained until we have afforded the electors the fullest facilities, and have fixed a date upon which they can vote .without serious inconvenience or risk of loss. I was gratified to learn of the measures which are being taken by the Minister and his officers to expedite the work of the Electoral Department, with a view to holding the elections as early as possible. All that the Minister said! as to the completeness of the organization of the Department furnished an argument in favour of the motion. I hope that the arrangements will be pushed forward so that the elections mav be held, if not prior to the date mentioned in the motion, before the harvest is at its height. The honorable members for Kalgoorlie and Darling charged members of the Opposition with seeking to have the elections held at an earlier date than usual, with a view to placing the Labour Party at a disadvantage. I think they made it verv clear that their own desire to have the elections postponed until a later date was due to their impression that the purposes of their own party would be better served at the expense of the farming community </para>

                    <para>- - The discussion that has taken place indicates that the honorable member for Echuca was fully warranted in bringing forward his motion. It appears to be generally desired th'at the elections shall take place as soon as possible. A most unworthy charge has been levelled at members of the Opposition By the honorable member for Darling, who has stated that it is desired to fix the elections at an earlier date than usual, so that a large number of shearers may be prevented from voting. The honorable member prefaced his remarks by stating that the shearers always voted for Labour candidates. I am <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> prepared to admit the truth of that statement, because a large proportion of the shearers are small farmers, who vote for democrats belonging to the party of which I am a member. The honorable member for Echuca made it clear tEat he desires that the elections should be held at a time when every elector would be in a position to record his vote. The honorable member referred to the large percentage of men and women who fail to record their votes, and I think that if we continue to hold our elections at an inconvenient time of the year, it will be impossible to poll a satisfactory percentage of votes. The Minister promised that he would do his utmost to arrange for the holding of the election at the earliest possible 'date, and according to his statement, it should not be held" later than the 15th November. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports apparently moved his amendment at the instance of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question. All that is desired is that full expression shall be given to the undoubted opinion of honorable members that the elections shall be held at the earliest possible moment. The honorable member for Hume tried to whip the Labour Party into order by suggesting that this was a no-confidence motion. The Labour Party responded by coming to his assistance, and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has also stepped into the breach. Notwithstanding all that has been said, it  is clear that the election must be held at the earliest practicable date. No reference has been made to the difficult position in which many of our farmers are placed during harvest time. In the western parts of New South Wales and in South Australia there is constant dread on the part of the farmers that their ripening crops will be swept away by bush fires. It is quite a common thing, upon visiting a township, during the month of December, to find that all the men are absent fire-fighting. The farmers are afraid to leave their holdings when there is so much at stake, and I think it is incumbent on our part to make more convenient arrangements than those which have been previously carried out. If it were practicable to allow the election to stand over until 31st December, I should feel it my duty to support such a proposal. Honorable members are elected for three years, and that period is short enough, especially if an honorable member has to travel through an electorate with an area of 20,000 square miles in order to address his constituents. I trust that if the Constitution is altered, the period will be extended to five years. I have no desire to cross swords with honorable members of the Labour Party, because I think that they must desire that as many electors as possible shall go to the poll. If they do .not represent the people they cannot wish to occupy the seats that should foe filled by members of the party to which I belong. We know that only a small percentage of the electors in New South Wales, and in fact throughout Australia, now support the Labour Party as a, party. A number of influences operate to bring about the return of honorable members to this House. For instance, I have no doubt that the honorable member for Grey would be elected, no m'atter how he described himself. I think that the honorable member for Echuca was fully warranted' in bringing forward his motion, and I hope that, after having secured a full and satisfactory discussion, he will withdraw it. </para>

                    <para>.- I can hardly understand why such a small percentage of votes is recorded in the Victorian electorates. I represent a division which has an area three times as large as that of the State of Victoria. Some of nw constituents have to travel 50, 60. and even 100 miles to a polling place, and vet 57 per cent, of those on the roll recorded their votes at the last election. It is quite inexplicable to me that a larger percentage of votes is not recorded in divisions where the electors are, except in rare instances, within ha.]fanhour's walk of a polling place. I do not think that the poor results are entirely due to the fact that the elections are held at an inconvenient time, because the smallest percentage of votes has been recorded, not in the country districts, but in the towns. It has been suggested by the honorable member for Bland, and several other speakers, that the early part of - the year - about March, for example - would !be a most suitable period at which to hold the general elections. I most strenuously object to any such arrangement, but I have nothing to urge against the polling-day being fixed for some time in May. I need scarcely point out that in Queensland the wet season extends from January to Mardi, and, during those months it, is almost impossible for one to get over the country at all. In the northwest and portions of the south-west of Queensland, at that particular time of the year, I have seen the water stretching across the country for thirty or forty miles. The rivers are flooded in all directions: Under such circumstances, the great bulk of the voters, would be disfranchised if the elections were held at that particular period. As a matter of fact, whilst I was engaged in electioneering, I had an experience of being kept four days in one place, without being able to obtain anything to eat. At the first general election for this Parliament, my opponent, in following me round my constituency, got stuck up between two rivers, and was unable to 'get back to the big centres of population before polling day. I understand that he delivered his final address to the coachman who was driving him, o.ni the banks of the Flinders River. In my opinion, either April or May would be the most suitable period of the year at which to hold the elections. </para>

                    <para>. - A good deal of talk has already been indulged in upon this motion. So far as South Australia is concerned, I do not think that it makes any difference to the voters when the elections are held. The honorable member for Dalley has asked a question in reference to the percentage of votes polled in that State at the last general election. I admit that, so far as the elections for the Senate were concerned, the percentage' of votes recorded was bad, for the simple reason that most: of the South Australian representatives were returned unopposed, as I believe they will be in future. But I would' point out that at the elections for the State Parliament, despite the fact that some of the constituencies are very compact, we have never secured a better average than 50 per cent., and I find that in several constituencies at: the last elections in Victoria more than 50 per cent, of the electors recorded their votes. In the divisions of Corangamite and Wannon, the percentage was very high indeed. Whatever date may be fixed for the holding of the elections will not make very much difference to South Australia. At the same time, if bv altering that date we can induce more electors to record their votes, I am thoroughly in sympathy with the alteration. The honorable member for Kennedy has suggested that if any change be made, the elections should be held in May. What does that mean? It means that if in Queensland, March is too wet to permit of the elections taking place then, May is certainly too wet in South Australia. In the latter State, many voters have to travel long distances to exercise the franchise. In the electorate of Grey, for example, many voters have to travel twenty or thirty miles to the polling, booth. If the elections were held in wet weather, these persons would be disfranchised. However, there seems to be a consensus of opinion that it  is inadvisable to hold the elections in December, and I am quite prepared to fall in with the wish of the majority that) they shall take place in November. I am quite prepared to give the people every opportunity to record their votes. Indeed, I should like to see every elector exercising the franchise. This desirable result can be brought about. I am sorry that the right honorable member for Adelaide is not now able to take the active part in our legislation that he did in State politics, or I am sure he would have moved in this direction. The way to bring about the desired result is to impose a small penalty on those who will not take the trouble to record their votes. I hope that the time is close at hand when we shall take some step of that character. I have no fear of ever being asked to represent a minority, but I should not like to do so, and I am confident that no other honorable member would. If the matter were taken in hand by the Government, we could soon insure that no honorable member would be returned bv a minority vote. </para>

                    <para>.- Like the last speaker, I desire to see a date fixed for the holding of the general elections which will meet the convenience of a large majority of the voters. The debate which has taken place this afternoon demonstrates that whatever date is fixed some in convenience will be experienced. But we have to regard this matter, not from, the stand-point of a State, but from that of the Commonwealth. There is a good deal in the contention of the honorable member for Bland that from the present time till the end of the year is  a very unsuitable period for the conduct of a general election. In the first instance, we should inconvenience those who are engaged in the sugar-producing industry ; in the next, we should affect those who follow the avocation of shearers, and finally, we should interfere with those who will be taking part in harvesting operations, towards the end of the year. I think that Parliament would be well advised if it made some alteration in the direction indicated by the honorable member for Bland, and determined that in future the general elections should take place at the beginning of the year. So far as New South Wales is concerned, I think that March or April would be a very suitable period at which to appeal to the country. There would be difficulties in giving effect to his suggestion, but these would not be nearly so insurmountable as are those which are experienced at the present time. Undoubtedly the last elections were delayed till the very worst period of the year, so far as the farming interests were concerned. In my own electorate the fact that there wa's not a contest for a seat in this House helped to minimize the vote which was cast on that occasion. The farmers' were in the very midst of their harvesting operations, and the period was one at which the greatest amount of damage could be done to the crops by windstorms. About a day or two Prior to the polling-day a severe windstorm passed over a portion of my own constituency, with the result that the standing crops were practically threshed out. The storm did not cover an extensive area, but the country which it affected was severely injured in the matter of its wheat return. This alarmed the farmers in the district who were not touched by the disturbance. They worked all hours in order to get their crops harvested. The result was that a large number of them did not trouble to record their votes, notwithstanding that some of them were working within sight of the polling booth. Upon the other hand, it has been suggested by farmers' representatives in Victoria, supported by the leader of the Opposition;, that the general elections should be held in October. So far as New South Wales is concerned, difficulties would be experienced in October, only in another direction. In December the farming community is, to a large extent, disfranchised, but in October the shearers and those engaged in the pastoral industry would share the same fate. Early in October shearing operations are in full swing, and towards the end of that month the grass seeds begin to ripen, so that one day's! seeding may mean a very, heavy loss in a man's wool returns. Consequently it is the great desire of the pastoralist to get his wool off the sheep's back within that period. What we should aim at is a mean between the period of the completion of the shearing and the heavy time of the harvesting - between, say, the 15th November and the first week of December. After the first week in December the difficulties in connexion with harvesting are accentuated every day till the end of the year. It has been suggested that the Labour Party desire the elections to be held as late in the year as possible, because they fear the farmer's vote. Personally I do not fear that vote. I am a farmer myself, and I have done something to make the farming movement in New South Wales a substantial success. I do not think that the party to which I belong has any cause to fear the farmers' vote. I hold that the elections should be held at a period of the year when the largest number of voters will be able to exercise the franchise, and consequently I urge the Government to fix a date between' the 15th November and the first week in December. Otherwise the difficulties experienced at the last election will be repeated. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that any attempt to fix upon any party the responsibility for the holding of the forthcoming elections at the latter end of the year will succeed. A similar attempt was made in the last Parliament. Owing to the provisions of the Constitution, and notwithstanding that honorable members sacrificed three or four months of their full tenure of office, an attempt w.as made in some of the States to thrust the responsibility for holding the elections at the wrong time of the year upon the Labour Party. But honorable members are aware that they had no more to do with it than had the members of the Opposition. No party and no Government in this Parliament, has had anything to do with it, because, as a matter of fact, the difficulty could not, under the terms of the Constitution, have been avoided. Any attempt to fix the responsibility upon a particular party on this occasion must fail for the same reason. I am sure that every member of the House desires that as full a vote of the electors as possible shall be recorded. The only question is which is the best time of the year to secure it. If an attempt were made to alter the Constitution so that the Federal elections could be held in March, I think that it would be successful, and I have no doubt it would be a desirable course. I intend to vote for the motion, and I have been somewhat surprised that any honorable member should oppose it. I quite expected that the Government would accept it. Its terms are not mandatory. It would be absurd to fix a definite date, and say that the elections shall be held before that date, because circumstances might arise which would render that impossible. But the carrying of this motion would be merely an expression of opinion bv the House that the next elections should be held not later than the 15th November. I believe that the members of the Government and of the Opposition, of the Country Party, and of the Labour Party, are alike anxious that, if possible, the next elections should be held not later than that date. That is not by any means an ideal time of the year for the purpose, but, in the circumstances, it seems about the best we can do. So far as South Australia is concerned, any time from October up to January would be about equally inconvenient for the farmers. From the beginning of November to the end of December would be the most inconvenient time for the fruit-growers. So that the latter end of the year is inconvenient for horticulturists as well as for agriculturists, as the harvesting of the fruit crops, as well as of the grain crops, takes place at that time. I suggest to Ministers that they should accept the motion. Personally, I can see no possible objection to it. The main consideration is that we should endeavour to secure an alteration of the Constitution, so that such a state of things should not happen again. </para>

                    <para>- An immense percentage. If the votes recorded in Darwin be not considered, it will be found that there was not a vote of 25 per cent, recorded in the rest of the State of Tasmania. Although the Darwin electorate was the smallest in point of population, I am the senior member of the State of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter what my majority was - I got there. This only shows that if the electors find that proper candidates are seeking election, they will be out to vote. If the representatives of Victorian constituencies who come here complaining, hooting, howling, and screeching like wood-chucks in a bush, went out and talked intellectually to the people, they would interest them as we do in Tasmania, and there would' be no necessity for them to come howling, screeching, and hooting here in an endeavour to make the whole of the Commonwealth submit to the dictation of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and some of the farmers in that electorate had to travel 20 miles to vote. Here in Victoria, where you could almost expectorate over any of the electorates, the electors will not turn out to vote because they have no confidence in the candidates. My electorate in Tasmania is a long electorate, and I have to travel in it over 100 miles. An honorable member whose electorate has been annihilated may wish to run against another. That is his own business ; but as senior member for the State of Tasmania I shall not submit to Victoria dictating to the whole population of the Commonwealth. , </para>

                        <para>- I agree that this is a diversion, but the discussion has been upon everything but the question before the House. The electors of Franklin did not put up a very big vote, because there was no excitement on. There was no excitement in the electorate of Wilmot, and the electors there did not put up a big vote, though I wrote a letter which put the present member in. There was no excitement in the electorate of Bass, and therefore a big vote was not put up there. There was excitement in the electorate of Denison, because the present honorable member for Wilmot went down to fight the honorable member for Denison, and if I had not gone to Hobart after him he would have defeated the honorable member who now occupies that seat. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree. Why should we force the Ministry, who desire as much as does any member of the House to have the elections right away, because they are sure of a majority ? Honorable members of the Opposition, who are forcing on this motion, are the last people who desire to face the electors, and to go before the high tribunal of public opinion. The honorable member for Boothby, who approves of the motion, represents a city constituency, and can see the whole of his electors by looking out of the door of his house. Then the honorable member for Hindmarsh finds the whole of his electors within a stone's throw of his residence. Here in Victoria the honorable member for Wannon put up a big vote, as did the honorable member for Corangamite. </para>

                    <para>.- I, too, wish to make a personal explanation. The Minister of Home Affairs was in error in stating this afternoon that I had said that the Government are under the domination of the Labour Party. My opinions about the conduct of certain Ministers is my own, but I have no quarrel with the Government, and made no such remark as that attributed to me. What I said was that possibly the honorable member, in view of the peculiar circumstances existing in his constituency, may be under the domination of the Labour Party, but I did not say that the Government are. I have not said a word against the Government, either inside or outside the House, and I am continually endeavouring, as I go through the country, to refute what I consider to be aspersions on the character of the Prime Minister. I am here as an independent member, desirous of helping the Government to push through what I consider to be good legislation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It may, of course, be truly said that we do not require Supply until the beginning of next month : but there seems to be no good reason why we should not meet the wishes of the Senate in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make it as soon as possible; but it is difficult to make much progress before the financial year has ended; and while the Estimates may be ready within a fortnight or three weeks after the commencement of the new year, the Treasury officials will require at least another ten days in order to have the Budget papers prepared and printed in readiness for presentation with the Estimates to honorable members. I hope to be able to present the Estimates about the end of July or early in August, though I cannot give the exact date when I shall be able to do so. There are very few items in the Bill which I am about to introduce to which I need draw attention. Of these the first is an amount of £30,000, which is being asked for to cover the loss on the working of the Pacific cable. The exact sum required is not known, but, as the money must be paid in London, we wish to have it voted at the earliest moment possible, in order to make the best arrangements possible for exchange. £30,000 is also asked for as an instalment of the subsidy payable to the Orient Royal Mail Company on the 30th October next for the conveyance of mails between England and Australia. That money has to be remitted to London, and the longer the time we have in which to make arrangements the better the terms we can make for exchange. Then £6,660 is required to pay for the conveyance of Members of Parliament, and £12,000 is required for refunds to the Pacific and Eastern Extension Telegraph companies in connexion with the cable services. </para>

                        <para>- No. That trip did not entail any extraordinary expense on the Commonwealth. The sum of £80,000 is asked for as an advance to the Treasurer to enable him to pay wages, and other incidental expenses, and also payments in connexion with works authorized by Parliament last year, and now in progress. If there is any other item in regard to which honorable members desire information, I shall be only too glad to give it; but I can assure the Committee that the Bill provides only for expenditure similar to that which was approved of by Parliament last session. </para>

                    <para>. - It may be that the Bill contains no item of an objectionable character, but it appears to me that the procedure which we are now asked to sanction is a very strange way of transacting the business of the country. Ministers had a long recess in which to prepare Bills for submission to the two Houses, and the Governor-General's speech announced that an immense number of measures were ready to be dealt with. Yet we fmd the Senate now without business to go on with, and are asked to pass a Supply Bill to enable senators to get back to their homes, and take a holiday. </para>

                        <para>- I am replying to the speech of the Treasurer. Having come to Melbourne to do business, and not to talk, I was very glad when the debate on that motion concluded. I shall, however, take advantage of this opportunity, seeing that the regulations under the Commerce Act are to be gazetted within a few days, to draw attention to the manner in which a very large and important industry will be affected thereby. When that Bill was before the House the Minister of Trade and Customs made certain statements from time to time which indicated that he had no intention of introducing a system of grading in connexion with butter. For the information of honorable members, I should like to quote one or two passages from the speech of the Minister to show that those interested in the dairying industry were quite justified in forming the impression that no Federal compulsory grading would be introduced. At page <inline font-style="italic">631</inline> of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> vol. xxv., the Minister stated - </para>

                <para class="block">The honorable and  learned member for Parkes interjected that, in order to carry out such a system a whole army of inspectors would be required. There is no doubt that if a system such as is indicated by the regulations published in the press a short time ago is to be carried out, it will be necessary to employ an army of inspectors, not only in Sydney and Melbourne, but also at Byron Bay and other butter-exporting centres. The Minister said, further - </para>

The Minister knows that not one butter factory in New South Wales is turning out an article unfit for consumption. On the contrary, he is fully aware that the product of the New South. Wales factories is fit to occupy the highest place in the markets! of the world. If Government supervision were to be exercised only in regard to products unfit for human consumption, no exception could be taken to the attitude of the Minister. The Minister further remarked in the course of the speech to which I have referred - </para>

                <para>These statements naturally led those inter'ested in the dairying industry to believe that the Minister had no intention of bringing into operation a system of grading as applied to butter. The Minister stated, further, in the course of his second-reading speech - </para>

                <para class="block">No one could disagree with any regulations that were brought into operation with a view to preventing the adulteration of food, either for home consumption, or for export. It is important that our own people, and particularly our children, should! have pure food, and it would be a serious matter for our producing industries if adulterated goods were to find their way into the markets of the world under such conditions as. would injure our reputation.

                    <para>In regard to exports, we desire to obtain some control over goods of short weight and impure foods, which are probably sent away to other countries. Honorable members, no doubt, are familiar with the statements made before the. Royal Commission, which is at present investigating the condition of the supplies which were forwarded to the troops in South Africa during the recent war. It is necessary that we should be able to check anything of that kind. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">No one could cavil at such a statement, but the supervision indicated by the Minister in that case would be entirely different from that contemplated in connexion' with the butter industry. Apparently it is proposed to appoint Government officials to exercise supervision over the butter fac-' tories, at which butter is being produced under the strictest supervision, and under the management of the best men obtainable. The Minister called a Conference in Sydney, to which he invited representatives of the dairying, fruit, and meat industries of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. The Minister made a very lengthy speech in opening the Conference, and explained that his object in calling the delegates together was to seek their assistance in arriving at means by which he could administer the Commerce Act with as little friction as possible. He could have had no more laudable object than he then indicated. He also pointed out that if butter were graded, and marked under regulations as first class, a guarantee would be afforded to buyers which they could accept with full confidence. I need only refer to the evidence which was given before the Victorian Butter Commission to show that, so far as butter is concerned, the Victorian Government brand affords no guarantee as to the quality of the product. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sinclair,</inline> the Victorian Government expert, told the Commission that, so far, the Victorian Government brand had proved absolutely useless in the London market. Most honorable members who represent constituencies in which dairying is carried on, have received similar information from gentlemen who have visited the old country. The buyers in the London market have their own experts, and pay for the butter according to their judgment as to its quality. It is only natural that this should be so. It is well known that after transit from the Commonwealth to London, which extends over a period of seven or eight weeks, butter branded as second class frequently brings a higher price than that marked first class. This is due to chemical changes which take place during the voyage. The Minister also referred to the fact that butter branded as first class in one State would probably not be equal in quality to butter branded as" first class in another State. Take Queensland and Victoria - two States in which the climatic conditions are very different. The quotations in London indicate plainly that the Queensland butter is not entitled to be placed in the same class as the Victorian product. This difference in quality between the products of the various States will lead to great difficulties in the application of any uniform system of grading. It would be unjust to Queensland to prejudice her products bv marking them as inferior to those of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I am not able to express any opinion upon that matter. Perhaps tha Minister of Trade and Customs will be able to inform us upon the point. The Minister further stated that he failed to understand the arguments of those who were opposed to the grading of butter. He quoted largely from a report upon the New Zealand dairying industry, and also from a report of a Conference which was held at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College. He also read a letter that he had received from the Albury Co-operative Butter Company. That company does not occupy a very prominent position in connexion with the butter industry in New South Wales, and one of the delegates at the Conference interjected that the Albury factory did not turn out more than one ton of butter per week. Yet the Minister quoted a letter from that company as representing the views of a large body of farmers, in favour of grading. The whole of the great cooperative butter companies of New South Wales are entirely against a system of compulsory grading. After several questions had been asked by delegates, the Minister said - </para>

                    <para>It was necessary to have certain brands to separate the first from the second quality, and the suggestion of one of the delegates,, he thought, was a good one; that was, to recognise the 1 and A 1 qualities. Thus, Queensland butter would be classed as i, and Victorian best, recognised to be of superior quality, would be branded Al. These, however, were only suggestions. </para>

                <para>But the point I wish "to make is that; these suggestions constituted a distinct departure from the statement which was made by the Minister upon the floor of this House. When the honorable gentleman left the Conference, an attempt was made by the representatives of the Co-operative Company of New South Wales, to discuss the question of grading,, but the acting <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Campbell,</inline> at once said, " Oh, this grading business is as dead as a door nail, and cannot be debated." </para>

As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has made this little interruption, I should like to draw his attention to the fact thai a large meeting to consider the matter was held in Lismore, which is in the constituency so well and honorably represented by himself. At that meeting there were present representatives from Alstonville, Ballina, Kyogle, Brooklet, Coraki, Lismore, Tweed, the North Coast Co-operative Butter Companies, and Foley Bros. The Vice-President of the Executive Council will agree that the meeting fairly represented the dairying industry in that part of New South Wales.

                    <para>We, as delegates appointed by and representing co-operative butter factories in the Richmond River district, hereby protest against the compulsory grading and branding of butter proposed' to be carried out under the Commerce Act, as an undue interference with an important and growing industry, which has been built up by the producers themselves. It has been proved beyond question that any Government grade mark is useless on the London market, and that the grading of the cream at the factory is the only menus of maintaining and designating the quality and standard of butter. Such legislation has never been asked for by producers of the State, and it will entail a heavy additional expenditure, without any corresponding advantage to the industry. </para>

                <para>It was further resolved that the resolutions agreed to should be forwarded to the Minister of Trade and Customs by the honorable member for the district, and I have .no doubt that the honorable gentle man has acceeded to the wishes of his constituents. Further, I may say that the Queensland Government have taken action in this matter, and instructed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scriventhe</inline> Under-Secretary of the Stock and Agriculture Department, and one of the Queensland delegates to the Conference, to write a letter to the Comptroller-General of Customs in Svdney, objecting to what had been done. A request was made that the letter should be placed before the Minister, and I. have no doubt, that that request has been complied with. In view of the protests made by representatives of this great industry in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, and their request for a full and fair opportunity to be heard in connexion with this matter, I respectfully ask the Minister of Trade and Customs even now to consider the protests of these people, and to refrain from imperiously dictating to the men engaged in this industry what they are to do. If it were suggested that the persons engaged in this industry were manufacturing for local consumption or for export, an article unfit for human consumption, I would agree to interference by the Government. However, nothing of the sort is suggested, and it would appear to be the intention merely to place a host of officials upon the backs of the producers of Australia. The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs and the honorable member for Richmond, as members of the Ministry representing constituencies deeply interested, should get the Minister of Trade and Customs to give the representatives of the great dairying industry of Australia an opportunity of being heard in so important a matter. It is said that a system of compulsory grading is to be carried out, because it will be of advantage to the industry. There is to be no such thing as voluntary grading, which has, so far, been carried out in Victoria and South Australia. Some time ago I remember that the honorable member for Boothby, who had considerable experience in South Australia, told the House that voluntary grading in that State had worked very well, and that it had been found to be an advantage to the industry that producers should have the right to export their products without inspection, because that had kept the Government grading officials up to the mark. On behalf of the producers of South Australia, the honorable member strongly resented interference by the Federal Government in the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I am not conversant with what was done in America, but certainly the inspection of meat carried out by Government officials in the United States has been of a very unsatisfactory character. Officials were appointed by the United States Government to inspect meat intended for local consumption and for export, and yet shameful frauds and iniquitous practices have prevailed in connexion with the meat business there. That experience does not make us hopeful of the labours of Government officials in the grading and inspection of produce in the Commonwealth. The Lord knows what sort of officials we shall get, and they will be brought into direct opposition with the responsible men connected with the dairies throughout the country. Any one who is cognizant of the history of the dairying industry in New South Wales must be aware that since the co-operative companies came into existence their one object has been to secure the production of a good article. Where the product of any factory, when placed on the market, is found to be not up to the mark, a representative is sent to the factory to find out what is the matter. The result of the system df inspection by the co-operative companies is that in New South Wales to-day, in the dairying industry, we are producing an article which is second to none, and we need not fear the competition of any other country. Another point is that, if we are to have this system of compulsory grading, it is likely that the business will have to be carried on in future in accordance with the Government stroke. We have had enough of the Government stroke in the political history of the States in years gone by, and it is very inadvisable to attempt to introduce it into our Federal system. The old saying that " distant hills are green " applies particularly in this connexion, because every one who desires to support the system of compulsory grading at once quotes New Zealand as an example. It is forgotten that New Zealand is peculiarly situated for the production of this article. With a good climate, a magnificent rainfall, and fresh grasses, those engaged in the dairying industry in New Zealand are able to produce an article of first-class quality, and a comparison of a country like New Zealand with Queensland, for instance, with her dry climate, is unworthy of attention. The success of the industry in New Zealand has been due, not to the adoption of a system of compulsory grading, but to the fact that the New Zealand Government, while favouring protective duties, impose no such duties upon implements and articles required by the man on the land. The farmers are able to get the agricultural implements, and everything else they require, at the cheapest possible rate, and with the additional advantage of their climate and rainfall those engaged in the dairying industry have been successful. </para>

                <para class="block">Any one who has had any experience of the London market for dairy produce must know that experts take no notice of the New Zealand grading of butter, and that it is on the quality of the article that buyers make their purchases. We are told that the New Zealand butter which is graded brings the highest prices in the English market. That is quite true, but butter which is not graded brings just as high a price. I had the pleasure recently of inspecting the Grassmere factory, in the Warrnambool district, which is one of the finest butter factories I have ever seen, and I am aware that the product of that factory, and of other factories in Victoria, has brought as high prices in the London market as has the best New Zealand butter. It is, therefore, perfectly ridiculous to contend that the high prices received for New Zealand butter in the London market are due to the adoption of the system of compulsory grading, when we know that it is the quality of the article, and not the grading marks on it, which is of interest to the buyer. </para>

The Minister has received the protests which were sent through me. I do not know whether other protests have been sent to him from other parts of Australia; but I would point out to him that the representations made through me are worthy of consideration, as embodying the experience of men who have been connected with the industry for years, not only in Australia, but also in London, and in other parts of the world. Representatives were sent home to ascertain the exact position of affairs in the London market, and they reported that the existing systems of grading are valueless. Therefore those engaged in the industry protest against a meddlesome interference with their business, which has been built up by their efforts, without Government help in any shape or form. All they ask is to be left alone. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable and learned member for Illawarra has referred to a matter affecting the administration of the Customs Department; I wish to refer to one connected with the Postal Department, which during the absence of the Postmaster-General, is being administered by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Many experiments have been tried in connexion with the postal service of Western Australia, and though they may have rewarded the Department with the maximum amount of information and knowledge, they have often been accompanied with the minimum amount of convenience to the public using the telegraphs and telephones of that State. I wish however, to refer particularly to a matter which was brought under the attention of the Postmaster-General in Melbourne some months ago. He was informed that the state of the Postal Department in Western Australia was not what it should foe, and I think the representatives of that State are agreed that such was the case. As a result, a Board of three members, two of whom were officers in the New South Wales branch of the Postal Department, were appointed to make inquiries. I do not say that these officers are not thoroughly competent! and trustworthy. All I know is that, as the result of their report, the head's of the Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone Departments in Western Australia were removed from their positions, two of them permanently, the Deputy Postmaster-General being given six months' leave of absence. So far everything may have been satisfactory. The investigation may have demonstrated beyond doubt the unfitness of these officers for the positions which they held. The point which I wish to make is that the Chairman of the Board on whose report they were removed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young,</inline> and a member of the Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dirks</inline> were chosen to fill two of the vacancies thus created. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the case has not been properly considered, and proper regard was not paid to the representations of the Western Australian members, who knew the exact position of affairs, and suggested that the heads of the Departments in Western Australia should be transferred to similar positions in the other States. I myself suggested to the Postmaster-General that it would be wise to make <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hardman Deputy</inline> Postmaster-General of Queensland, South Australia, or Tasmania. These changes might involve slight alterations of salary ; but I think that in all the branches of the Service it is advisable to occasionally transfer both heads of Departments and officers from one State to another - to divorce them from their old associations. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and I think that such changes must result in improving the service given to the public. It is notorious that in every walk of life men are affected by their environment, and when men who have spent thirty or thirty-five years in one branch of the Public Service, as Messrs. Hardman, Snooks, and Stevens have done, their associations with others make it impossible for them to exercise the same free and independent judgment in the discharge of their duties as they would otherwise exercise. I am not able to say whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hardman</inline> should have been temporarily removed. </para>

In my opinion, it will be a mistake to reinstate him in Western Australia to continue the work of the man who reported that the condition of affairs in the Postal Department there was not satisfactory. I hope that the Acting Postmaster-General will give the matter his serious consideration, and will see that, in future, officers of the Public Service are not appointed to vacancies which they themselves have virtually created. </para>

He asks whether men who have sat in judgment upon certain officers should subsequently be appointed to their positions. That is a serious matter, but can no doubt be fully explained. Probably I shall be in a position to make a further statement at a later stage. Honorable members must, however, remember thai the Public Service Commissioner is placed in a certain position by law, and that, unless the law be altered, it is not competent for the Minister, or for the House, to interfere with him. </para>

                    <para>- That is a different matter. I know something of the two officers who were sent over to Western Australia, and they are both competent men, of the highest integrity. I have heard that they undertook the inquiry very reluctantly, and only at the urgent request of the authorities. With regard to the Bill before us, I would only remark that the Treasurer is taking an unusual course in pushing a Supply Bill through the House so early in the month. I understand that he is anxious to accommodate honorable senators, who have not very much to do, and want to go away for a short holiday. So far as I can see there is nothing in the Bill to which exception need be taken, and I am perfectly willing to accept the assurance of the Treasurer that nothing beyond the ordinary current expenses of the month are provided for. I asked the Treasurer during his speech whether there was any item in the Bill to cover his expenses to London. Scarcely had the House gone into recess after a long and strenuous session than it was announced that the Minister of Trade and Customs - I mean the Treasurer - was off to London. </para>

                        <para>- No one knows better than the Minister how to be friendly when he finds himself in a tight corner. It was predicted that the Minister would not be able to administer the Commerce Act, and that forecast has proved to be a perfectly accurate one. The Minister has had to set aside the Act as unworkable, and has occupied the whole of the recess in framing a set of regulations applying to one article of export. </para>

                <para>Mr.JOSEPH COOK.- I do not mind a few interjections from the dumb member from Gwydir. He never ceased talking when he sat on this side of the House and has never been able to open his mouth since he has been sitting on the Government side. Therefore, we must make every allowance for him. He must have been bursting at times, as he has sat silent. As I said before, the Minister told us that the Commerce Bill did not provide for grading, but the moment it was passed into law, he stated that it' was intended to grade butter. That is what I complain of. The Act was passed by the employment of political trickery and chicanery. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. Those are made up by the officers of the Department. When you describe what is to be in the goods, and examine them as to whether they attain a certain standard, and mark the boxes accordingly, what is that but grading and branding? No one would object to the Government certifying that articles were of good quality, but we say that the Government are not competent to certify as to the quality of the butter eight weeks before it is placed on the market. It is well known that the character of butter undergoes a change during the voyage. Very often it is improved in quality owing to the elimination of certain flavours. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is. What else could it be? Has a man whose business is at stake, no right to agitate? Is it not a great pity that a man who has his whole capital and livelihood at stake should be permitted to make a complaint with regard to something that is interfering vitally with his business? It is probably a good thing that we have a socialistic Minister who believes so much in private liberty that he resents agitations of any kind. Of course, these people are interested. They have a right to be interested Their interests, as they say, are vitally affected. </para>

A whole recess has passed away, and he has not yet been able to frame the regulations under this precious Bill. When he came to administer it, he found that it was impossible to administer it in the form in which it was put through this Parliament. Consequently, his whole recess has been spent in endeavouring to make it a workable measure. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has great discretionary powers vested in him under the Act, so that, while he cannot interfere with the Statute itself, he can make the greatest possible variation in its administration. The honorable gentleman believes thoroughly in taking unto himself all the power that he possibly can. More than any of his colleagues, he is a kind of administrative Czar, who would support the passing of a Bill, consisting of one clause, which would confer upon him absolute power to do whatever he chose in all the ramifications of trade and commerce, and which would leave its administration to Ministerial regulations. I hope that his statement that grading is not provided for in the regulations- </para>

                        <para>- Of course I shall. In the meantime, I suppose that I must be content. I am not in the Minister's secrets, and if members of the Opposition wish to obtain the information for which I have asked, they must employ as their agents some of the honorable members opposite, who could secure it in two minutes if they desired to do so. I do not intend to deal with this matter at any further length. It has been discussed exhaustively by the honorable and learned member for Illawarra, who has really made most of the points that I intended to make. He has covered them with an intimate knowledge of the question. I was remarking, when I was led off into this line of argument, that the Treasurer, when he hurriedly left upon a mysterious mission to London, was careful to explain that he was going at his own expense. His last words wafted over the waters from Western Australia were - " I am going upon semi-public business, but at my own expense. " </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is likely that he will climb down, and it is just possible that he may yet stiffen the back of the Prime Minister. It is quite certain that the latter requires a little stiffening in the backbone. I say that advisedly, in view of his recent utterances upon this very important question. He cannot be induced to say in the same frank and fearless fashion as his Treasurer that he does not believe direct taxation is necessary under existing circumstances', and that we can provide for an old-age pension scheme without it. In view of the statements of the Treasurer, and of the publicity given' to the Labour Party's proposal by the Minister of Trade and Customs, we have a right to know where the Prime Minister is between these two strong minded men, who have great courage so far as their own opinions are concerned. We have a right to learn where the Prime Minister is between these two strong personalties. He has one Minister tugging at him in one way and another pulling at him in a contrary direction. I trust that he will not be injured in the tug-of-war. But it is really time that the Prime Minister told this country what he is going to do in connexion with the land tax proposals of the Labour Party. </para>

                        <para>- What I told the electors I should do. In making these observations, I am simply following the example of the Labour Party. I think that the honorable member for Bland was perfectly justified in asking for a statement from the Prime Minister upon this great question of prime policy. I notice that a verv persevering effort is being made by the leader of the Labour Party and his colleagues to smooth the way for the Prime Minister and for his direct followers. Only the other day the honorable member for Bland told us that already he had the rest of the States regimented behind the Government for the next election. He said that he was already certain that the other States would offer no objection to the return of Ministers and members who entered into such an alliance. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman admits that he has expressed such an opinion. That is precisely the attitude of the honorable member for Bland, and the Minister was therefore wrong in saying that I had made a misstatement. I say that if the honorable gentleman believes in all that the Labour Party is doing he might as well sign their pledge. The same thing applies1 to him as applies to the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- This is very strange, after the brutal attack made upon me by the Minister, and the brutal interjections to which I have been subjected from the Labour corner. However, I should like to be allowed to proceed. I was about to say that the honorable member for Bland had made these insistent demands of the Prime Minister upon public platforms. He has recently been demanding of the Prime Minister that before there can be any talk of alliance the honorable and learned gentleman should make some definite statement. Here is what the honorable member for Bland said at Crow's Nest in the North Sydney electorate: - </para>

                        <para>- I know of more than two. This statement contains the answer to the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. On several occasions he has been trying to emphasize the point that we have no constitutional power to nationalize industries. Well, here is a demand from the Labour leader to the Prime Minister for an alteration of the Constitution which will make it possible to begin this nationalizing process. </para>

                        <para>- I am perfectly aware of that. The Prime Minister has declined to1 make any .reply to the demand of the honorable member for Bland. He told us the other day that, neither personally nor on behalf of the Government, would he commit himself to any such course. But a great change has come over the scene since those words were uttered. The leader of the Labour Party is now doing his best to perfect his alliance with the Prime Minister, although the latter will not make any public declaration in regard to the proposed Federal land tax for the bursting up of large estates. The question may, therefore, be asked, " Has the Prime Minister given the honorable member for Bland private assurances in the matter?" That seems to me a most probable explanation. </para>

                        <para>- No ; I am merely pointing out the difference between the attitude of the labour leader at North Sydney a few weeks ago, and his present attitude of complaisance towards the Prime Minister. He seems now to be ready to accept the Prime Minister, land tax or no land tax, and nationalization of monopolies or no nationalization of monopolies. He is doing his best to assist the Prime Minister through the coming elections. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sorry about it j but the members of the Labour Party are sorry that they cannot get the officials outside to take the view which they take. Their leader's appeal the other day was an almost piteous one. He said that he hoped that Victoria would honour the bargain as the other States had done, and not leave them in the lurch. The honorable member has stated the conditions of the bond, but the public have a right to say that they will not accept the Prime Minister until he has made a public declaration concerning his opinions on the Federal land tax and the nationalization of industries. No one has made it half so clear as the Prime Minister has made it that we have no constitutional power to nationalize industries. A couple of years ago, when he was Attorney-General in the Barton Government, he was asked a question on the subject, and he replied that this Parliament has no power to nationalize industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> who succeeded him as Attorney-General, gave a similar opinion. Yet, when Parliament had gone into recess last year, he appointed Royal Commissions to inquire into the feasibility of nationalizing the shipping and tobacco industries, and the members of those Commissions have travelled' throughout Australia, spending public money in the effort to discover whether a case could be made out for nationalization. If the Prime Minister thinks that we have no power to nationalize industries, he should not authorize the expenditure of public money on fruitless inquiries. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. He converted a Select Committee of the House into a Royal Commission. The Chairman of the Shipping Commission told us, when he asked for the appointment of a Select Committee, that he would have nothing to do with the matter if he were not bent upon Socialism, and the whole object of this inquiry was to ascertain if the nationalization of the shipping industry of Australia was feasible. Of course, the power to nationalize could be obtained by an amendment of the Constitution, and the leader of the Labour Party has challenged the Prime Minister to propose such an amendment. But, apparently, these challenges are merely so much platform rhetoric. As soon as he comes near the Prime Minister, he becomes a consistent, faithful, and complaisant ally. The . honorable member for Bland on the political rampage is a different dan from the honorable member for Bland whom we know in this Chamber as the ally of the Prime Minister, so that there' almost seem to be two personalities. However, the matter is one for the Labour League of Victoria and the public to decide. It seems to me that the Victorian Labour Leagues have a right to take up the attitude that they have assumed in requiring pledges from the Prime Minister before undertaking to enter into an alliance with him. </para>

                        <para>- For every foul epithet applied to me, ten have been hurled at the Prime Minister, but, although he has been called by adherents of the Labour Party a " bally " rat, a Judas, and other unpleasant names, he swallows the insults, and does their work. That is how we differ. I wish to say one or two words with regard to another matter. </para>

                <para class="block">There seems to be a disposition to spend a little more public money in making additional appointments before the Government goes to the country. I see that one of the members of the Labour Party has a motion on the business-paper which indicates an anxiety on his part to have a Lieutenant-Governor appointed for Papua. I do not quite understand this, except it is desired to create another appointment for Papua. It is very strange that, after all the great haste that was displayed in passing the Papua Bill through this Chamber, the Government should not have brought the new constitution into operation. We were told last session that it was necessary to pass the Bill in order to provide a system of government for Papua. It was reported that all sorts of clangers were menacing the community there, and on that ground the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, and the honorable member for Cowper, and others who held' very strong opinions with regard to a certain matter, were induced to give way in order that provision might be made for a constitution without further delay. Seven month's have been allowed to pass without any action having been taken to give Papua the constitution for which provision is made bv Statute, and we have a right to some explanation. I venture to say that the Act would not have been passed in its present form had it not been for the appeal made by the Prime Minister upon the ground of urgency. Now, it appears that the Government do not want the constitution for Papua. I should like to know why. There is a vague statement in the Governor-General's speech with reference to the matter, and that is all that we know about it. Now, a private member suggests, even before the constitution is set up, that a Lieutenant-Governor should be appointed. How does that honorable member know that the Government have not already provided "for a Lieutenant-Governor ? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister will know if he waits for two minutes. It is stated that the Judiciary Act is to be amended, with a view to the appointment of more Judges to the High Court Bench. In my opinion, these appointments have waited so long that they might well be delayed until after the general election. The Government has already been described by the Prime Minister as consisting of twenty-four blackbirds out of the i j i. members in both Houses, and, under these circumstances, I think "that they should have some constitutional warrant behind them before they exercise their executive power in relation to high appointments of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that it is Australia's trouble at the present time. The Vice-President of the Executive Council need not laugh so inordinately. No one has recognised the present constitutional anomaly more than he has done, and he, of all persons, should sit quiet when matters relating to the alliance of the Government with the Labour Party are referred to. It is not so long since that he described the policy of the Labour Party as made up of 15 per cent, of practical politics arid 75 per cent, of bird-lime. Now, within a short twelve months, he and twenty-three other blackbirds are sitting there with their feathers covered with socialistic bird-lime. </para>

It may be that the Prime Minister declines to express himself clearly with regard to the imposition of a Federal land tax and other socialistic proposals, in order that, before the election, he may be able to bolt away from the party with which he is at present allied. </para>

                        <para>- They are retaining their seats. They have not been dragged in by means of socialistic birdlime like honorable members on the Government benches, whose feathers are covered with it. The Vice-President of the Executive Council described the Socialistic Party as having two faces, one, the mild reasonable face of the honorable member for Bland, and the other, the face of an anarchist. This is the man who laughs now at the slightest criticism from this side of the chamber. One wonders which of the two parties to the Government alliance has the more capacious swallow - the Prime Minister, who has been denounced as perhaps no other man in Australia has been, bv the Labour Party outside, or the Labour Party inside, which has been criticised in such merciless and scathing terms by the Prime Minister. As I have said, the Government might very well allow these high constitutional appointments to stand over until they obtain a constitutional warrant from the electors. Such appointments ought to be made by a Ministry with a strong party, and the authority of the Commonwealth behind it. </para>

I had intended to refer to the question of the Federal Capital Site, but as it is now growing late, I shall defer my remarks. I should like to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the sweating; that appears to be going on in the Post Office at Sydney. I think it is time that this matter was inquired into. I find that recently an instruction was issued by the central administration, that men who remain at work in the Post Office until half-past six must no longer be paid tea money. If a man works for two hours beyond the usual time, half-past four o'clock, he is not to get any tea money. </para>

The instruction is that where work frequently necessitates an official's attendance after the .regulation hours, he shall be required to work till 9 or 10 p.m. in order to be entitled to tea money. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the Government know 'anything about it. These are matters of internal administration, and I do not suspect that the Minister has any knowledge of it. I submit that that direction ought to be withdrawn at the earliest possible moment. If the officials of the State work overtime they have a right to be paid for it. Of course, one does not expect that they shall be paid overtime if they are required to stay five minutes after the ordinary hour, but when they are compelled' to work at night they are perfectly entitled to be paid overtime. I am sure that the Minister will look into this matter, with a view to ascertaining if a remedy cannot be applied. Although I am constantly accused of favouring sweaters, I do not believe in that kind of sweating. I am just as much opposed to sweating as is any member of this Chamber, 'and I think that a direction of that kind is neither more awr less than an intimation to the high officials in Sydney to sweat their subordinates. This House does not expect anything of that kind, and I trust that it will see that the evil is speedily remedied. </para>

                    <para>. - If the deputy leader of the Opposition will band me the memorandum from which he quoted, I will cause inquiries to be made into the matter which he has mentioned. We all entertain the highest opinion of the Secretary of the Postal Department, and we all know that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Public Service Commissioner does his work as well as it can be done. This evening I have been scolded in almost every language and by people of every description. The honorable member for Parramatta has again scolded me. Perhaps it would be just as well if I gave one or two reminiscences, with a view to showing how consistent the honorable member himself has been to every party and to every cause. As to my past utterances respecting Continental Socialism, I still maintain my views with regard to those principles, and have nothing whatever to withdraw. But I still hold that when a number of men, concerning whose character and truthfulness there can exist no doubt, inform us that the end which they have in view is not corruption and infamy and degradation - when they declare time after time that these are not their objective - it ceases to be politics, but becomes a personal affront to make such charges against them. When honorable members affirm that there is a misapprehension in regard to their position, their statement in an assembly of gentlemen. I use the term in its highest sense, should be accepted as a fact, and the accusations levelled against them should not be repeated. I have heard honorable members upon the other side of the Chamber make charges against men concerning whose personal honesty there lias never existed any doubt. The accuracy of these charges has been denied, but, nevertheless, they have beer* repeated. Under these circumstances, I say that their repetition becomes nothing but a personal affront in which I refuse to participate. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member talks about me having changed my opinions. Anybody who believes in electrobiology, who knows the effect of brain upon brain, must know that if, in the past, T erred a little, I did so Because it was not possible for me to remain respectable in the company in which I found myself. If I needed any excuse for what I have done, I should state that I felt then like a lotus in the mud of the Nile. Why, if honorable members socialised me, they would gee more than could be extracted from the whole front bench of the Opposition. Some persons who talk so wildly about Socialism could afford to regard Australia merely as a boardinghouse. They could walk out of it to-morrow, and leave nothing behind them but a dirty shirt. I was a member of the coalition party and I did the best that I could' for it. I was loyal to it, and did as much for it as any honorable member opposite. But when I found myself abandoned. I retained my principles and my electoral obligations. I have heard the leader of the Opposition repeatedly ask the question, " How can I have been unfair ? You see that <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> am out of office." Need I remind honorable members that they have seen many a man reach for the bridle and fall off over the horse's crupper. When I was a member of the alliance, two Conservative members of the present Opposition came to me - the honorable member for Kooyong and the honorable member for Grampians will know who they were - and said1, "Look at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline> They are now aristocrats - they are leading the Conservatives. Cannot you rub the dandy brush over the honorable member for. Parramatta and take a few of the labour burrs off him ?" Both the present leader of the Opposition and his deputy were covered with burr and straw and cobweb from head to heel - burr and cobweb which had been accumulated in passing along the sinuous and sombre passages that form the back-stairs entrance to the Labour room. Everything which they could offer to the members of the Labour Party to secure their support was offered bv them. Failing to secure an alliance with that Party, they approached the Protectionist Party. The honorable member for Kooyong and the honorable member for Grampians will know .who asked me if I could not put the currycomb over the honorable member for Parramatta, and' make him look a bit conservative. I said that I would do my best if they would deal with the right honorable member for East Sydney. I do not know what happened to the present leader of the Opposition but I saw the honorable member for Grampians and the honorable member for Kooyong walking out on to the lawn taking with them a hay rake and a harvester. I do not know what they wanted with those implements, but I saw them a little later on with a chaffcutter. I wish to show how consistent, how genuine, and how honorable is the deputy leader of the Opposition in his political views, and how trustworthy he is. I am not speaking personally. These political debates should have no individual aspect. I said that I would do my best with him, but did not take anything with me but a piece of chamois and a corn-cob. I found that he shed bts coat very easily. This occurred upon a Sunday. I saw him upon the following morning. He was looking like a Vermont ram - all wrinkles. I took him down to the basement again, and took a skin off him - a fiscal sinker's skin. On Tuesday morning I saw that he still presented a wrinkled appearance, so I set to work upon him, and took a free-trade skin off him. I could! smell the opium on it. Upon Wednesday he was again wrinkled, and accordingly I set to work and got a labour skin off him. I knew that it was a labour skin, because he said he objected specially to it, and the honorable member asked me to take it away quickly. </para>

Upon Thursday the honorable member for Parramatta was still wrinkled, and I got a protectionist skin off him.- On Friday he shed a single-tax skin, and on the Saturday, as he was still wrinkled, I took a Socialist's skin off him. Although. I tell this to honorable members in an allegorical way, my statement is theoretically true. I have known the honorable member as a fiscal sinker, as a free-trader, as a labour member, as a protectionist, as a single taxer, and as a, Socialist, all within a few years. After I had finished with him on the Sunday morning he looked about as amiable as a snake does in spring time. All this only proves the honorable member's powers of adaptability, and shows that he is able to feed out of any nose-bag.

He has informed us now of his " abandonment" by the leader whom he deserted without a moment's warning to land himself in the honorary and honorable position in which he now finds himself. It is a most pitiable thing that a Minister of the Crown should get up in his place in this Chamber and make statements of that kind, knowing, as he must, what proof we have in the public prints of the falsity of his statements. The honorable gentleman held a meeting in his own constituency only a few weeks before the betrayal which has landed him in his present position, and that meeting was held in conjunction with the leader by whom he has been so curiously "abandoned." At that time, the honorable gentleman said that the fiscal question was sunk, and he hoped for ever, and further that the only menace the country had to fear were the honorable members who have just cheered him to the echo. At that meeting at Lismore, the then Prime Minister, and leader of the party to which I have the honour to belong, said - </para>

It is somewhat difficult nowadays to get any answer from members of the Ministry, but I have to-night only a few questions to ask The deputy-leader of the Opposition referred to the trip made by the Treasurer to England, and I 'desire to express my sense of gratification at the right honorable gentleman's action. He was able to go to England for a considerable period, and it reflects great credit upon the officers of his Department that his absence should not have been felt. The right honorable gentleman proceeded to England to gain information in connexion with the consolidation of the States debts. Although the ground may to some extent have been cut from under his feet by the report prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> on the subject, I still think he did much good while in England in advertising Australia, and in correcting many of the false impressions of the Commonwealth that were prevalent there. He had not been a month in the mother country before every one knew that somewhere in these Southern Seas there was a land flowing with milk and honey, and the works of the right honorable gentleman. In advertising Australia the right honorable gentleman did signal service during the recess. Two things which he did in England reflect verv great credit upon him. In the first place the right honorable gentleman delivered an outspoken address against the Commonwealth policy of borrowing. No one has spoken in England so openly ora that subject as did the Treasurer. </para>

Another matter upon which I must congratulate the right honorable gentleman- was his steadfast advocacy of the principle underlying the Naval Agreement. A considerable amount of intriguing was going on for the purpose of representing the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia as being anxious to create an Australian Navy The right honorable gentleman, who was known to every one in England as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and one of our leading public men, threw himself into the fray in a most courageous spirit, and did such work that the Navy League elected him a vice-president.

With, this slight token of my appreciation, I pass from the Treasurer to the Postal Department. Although Federation has been in existence for six years, verv little indeed has been done to co-ordinate the various postal services of the States. We still have in each of the States different stamps and a different system of postage in every way. In addition to that, the postages are not uniform. There are different denominations of stamps in different States. I suggest to the Department that all its efforts should be directed towards co-ordinating these State services and arranging for uniform denominations of stamps so that wherever one goes in Australia one may be able to obtain the stamps that one requires. </para>

Let me give an instance of the present lack of method. Honorable members are well aware that a 1½d. stamp is in some States extensively used. But in other States of Australia there is no i|d. stamp. In New South Wales we have denominations which Victoria has not, and Victoria has denominations which we have not. I think that the same denominations of stamps should be obtainable in all the States. I must refer to one other point in connexion with the Post Office. We learn from this evening's newspaper that a combination of shipping companies has tendered for the Commonwealth mail contract. I understand that that contract is to be laid on the table of the House at an early date. But a combination of any kind' is penalized under the Anti-Trust Act. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend gives quite a different reading to the Australian Industries Preservation Bill from that which a number' of people in Australia, who are fortified by legal opinions, give to it. .They believe that the Bill, as framed, penalizes every combination, good or bad, and for whatever purpose it is formed, providing that it is concerned with trade and' commerce. I wish to deal with one or two other matters concerning which I hope to have the support of the honorable member for Corio, and of the Minister representing the Defence Department Owing to the action of Parliament in regard to pensions in the Defence service, a number of hardships have arisen. I will give an example. Here is the case of a driver who was seriously injured whilst in the exercise of his duty. This driver is a young man, who will never foe fit for work again. In my opinion he ought to obtain adequate monetary compensation. </para>

They are open to consideration by my constituents, as well as to any one else who cares to look at them. When I 'discussed the case of this cripple with the Minister yesterday, he suggested that when the money paid to him had run out the Department should again be approached, when he hoped that something would be done. The Minister was willing to stretch a point as far as he could. But the view which I put to honorable members is that here is an injured man who is practically eating up day by day his life's substance. He knows that when the sum of money granted to him is exhausted he must starve. No one who has served a public department well deserves such treatment as that. I suggest that an alteration; of the regulations is necessary to meet exceptional cases of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- It is a disgraceful state of things. Here is a poor man, without any one to help him, and he cannot get adequate recognition from the Department. But if a retired soldier happens to be a colonel, instead of a man from the ranks, this Government takes a great interest - in his welfare. I am referring to the case of Colonel Price. I say without the slightest fear of contradiction, that, as shown in that case, a colonel can manage to get a Government to introduce a Bill for his special benefit. </para>

                        <para>- But the Government took up his case, and brought in a special measure to meet it. I do not want a special Act of Parliament to deal with individual cases of this kind. What I ask is that there shall not be charity doles, but that there shall be a right for a man who has been injured whilst engaged in public service to receive proper compensation. I ask for that on behalf of alt grades of the service. I have to mention another case, that is not on all fours with the one that I have just dealt with. There are several men in the same position as this latter. I have before me the case of a man who has served 33 years and 275 d'ays. He is in the possession of exemplary discharges, a meritorious medal, and every recommendation a man could have, and yet, after having served his State, nearly thirty-four years, he is now, in the evening of his life, turned out to starve. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt about that. It is my strong conviction that we should, as far as possible, arrange for an automatic system of pensions, if Parliament will not grant a. pension on the ordinary Imperial scale. There are one or two further points I propose to deal with in reference to the Defence Department - matters of administration solely, for I would not, of course, touch now on questions of policy. During recess, I understand that one of the days which should have been occupied in training by the field artillery, was occupied in giving a sort of display at a show in Sydney ; and I do not think that is right. Artillery work is a highly technical art ; and it is our laudable ambition to train up a citizen soldiery to be an absolutely serviceable field artillery. Every day of service should be used in service, and not in mere display. I merely ask the Minister to see that this sort of thing does not occur again, because it is not right, and will undermine the efficiency of the service if it is allowed to go on. I make these suggestions in all friendliness, because - I do not care which Government is in power - I am sure our only desire is to see the Department properly managed; and we hope that this, at any rate, will be one Department free from party influences. Every one who has studied the question knows that, for some reason or other, there is the gravest lack of confidence right through every rank. Everywhere we see a spirit of unrest among officers and men alike. We have seen officers resigning and giving up the sword for the ploughshare. </para>

                        <para>- This matter is well worth the serious attention of the Department, and the state of affairs ought to be remedied. I suggest that the best way is for. the Department to act absolutely loyally in regard to the regulations. Make liberal regulations, if you like, but let officers and men know that the administration will be as loyally carried on under those regulations as is the civil service under its regulations. Having made the regulations, let the Department administer them in spirit as well as in letter. There are only two other matters to which I wish to refer. Quite recently a number of " kites " have been flown, especially in the Melbourne press, in reference to a change in the Defence administration. I hope these are only "kites," as I believe them to be. One newspaper, at any rate, has been pretty confidently stating that it is proposed, in appointing a new Inspector-General, to give him a seat on the Board. </para>

                        <para>- If the statement is right, the change will undermine the very principle of the Defence Act, which is that the Inspector-General shall be an independent man reporting to other independent men. If the Inspector-General is going to report to himself, what chance have we of knowing that his inspection has been honestly made, seeing that we have no means to check him? I sincerely hope that no such action will be taken as that which is foreshadowed in certain quarters. I regret that the gentleman who so brilliantly entertained us a few moments ago is not in his place ; but I should like to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, why it is that we have not had reports, as it was intended' we should, from the members of the Military Board? </para>

                        <para>- Both Boards are on exactly the same footing. Has the Minister written his own report, or has he merely signed the report of the officers? That is a very pertinent and fair question. The Minister should take this matter into consideration, and even if he does not think the reports of the Military Board are worth printing, he might well allow them to be placed on the table of the library in the near future. I do not wish to take further advantage of the opportunity to discuss these questions this evening. I regret that I have had to occupy the attention of the Committee for some time in bringing them forward, but feel sure that those who take an intelligent interest in them will recognise that there is considerable force in the points I have raised. </para>

                    <para>.- I should not have attempted to detain the Committee at this stage, but for certain statements made by the deputy leader of the Opposition as to the possibility of Australia going, so to speak, to perdition under the present Administration. The honorable member took up some time in explaining the differences between himself and the Labour Party, and treated the Committee to an electioneering address. His speech was permeated with the fear of the Opposition that there is a possibility of a straight-out fight taking place between them and the supporters of the Government at the next general election. It is all very well for the deputy leader of the Opposition to endeavour to arouse jealousy and friction, but I shall not attempt to read ancient history, nor to indulge in recrimination. The honorable gentleman made accusations against Ministers, and asserted that they had done that for which they had no warrant from the country. He declared that they were not in a position to remain in possession of the Treasury benches. We may well ask ourselves whether the Opposition would allow the Government to remain in office another day if they had the numbers necessary to oust them; It was only yesterday that a former colleague of the leader of the Opposition publicly denied that he was under his leadership, and that being so, it ill becomes the deputy leader to accuse the Government of having two parties behind them. It is evident that honorable members opposite fear that at the next general election we shall have a straight-out fight between the Government and the Opposition, instead' of a triangular duel such as we have witnessed in the past. </para>

The honorable member for Parramatta condemned the Government for having failed to announce their policy for the next Parliament. It is only a few days since the leader of the Opposition complained that the programme announced by the Ministry was altogether too elaborate, and I should like honorable members to say whether we could have had a plainer statement of the intentions of the Ministry than was made by the Prime Minister on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply.

                        <para>- The leader of the Opposition and those sitting behind him are always seeking to start a fresh hare. In view of the fact that they have told us repeatedly that the trade and commerce of Australia are going to perdition, I should like to point to a return published yesterday by the Customs Department, in relation to the State of Victoria. Unfortunately I have been unable to secure the statistics for the other States in time to quote them this evening, but it is interesting to learn that the exports of Victoria, during the first five months of this year, show an increase, as compared with those for the corresponding period of 1905, of no less than £3,700,000. Does that suggest that we are going to ruin. It has also been urged by the Opposition that the Commerce Act will have a serious effect upon our trade. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, and no doubt the Opposition will have a full statement of the <inline font-style="italic">intentions of</inline> the Ministry at the approaching general election. We know, however, that the Prime Minister has no intention of introducing land tax proposals during the present session. We have been told that it is impossible to administer the Commerce Act - that it will seriously damage the trade of Australia- and reference has been made on more than one occasion to the likelihood of its having a very damaging effect upon the butter industry. During the last ten days I have been attending a conference of the Cooperative Dairymen's Society of Victoria, which exports a considerable quantity of butter. We have a State law relating to the conditions under which butter may be exported from Victoria, and the conference to which I refer was called to discuss the draft regulations under the Commerce Act, and to interview the Minister. I think that the honorable member for Echuca will bear out my statement that the discussion showed that there was very little difference between the representatives of the butter industry of Victoria and the Minister. In Victoria we have made an attempt to market our butter on cooperative principles, and I hope that that system will soon prevail throughout Australia. Producers' are marketing their butter without the intervention of middle men. </para>

                        <para>- lt will not affect them. It is idle for the honorable member to attempt to scare me. I am in the business, and have no fear in that regard. A Victorian Act compels the inspection of butter before it can be put on board ship for export, and under that Act butter is graded in two classes. </para>

                        <para>- No. It has been stated that there is a possibility of the Customs Department taking certain action, under the Commerce Act, and, as the Bill makes provision for the administration of that Department, I hold that I am entitled to discuss the matter. It has been said by some that it is undesirable to place a grade stamp on butter exported from Australia. But, strangely enough, although there has been no compulsory branding under the Victorian Act, during the past year a grade stamp has been placed on 90 per cent, of the butter exported from the State, and no complaint has arisen therefrom. At the same time, it is only fair to those engaged in the trade to say that the consent to use the grade stamp was obtained under a misunderstanding. Apparently, the Customs Department do not ask that any mark be placed on the butter-boxes other than that required to be placed there by the laws of the State, though it requires to be informed of the quality of the butter proposed to be exported. </para>

                        <para>- That .is an evil which can . be remedied. The honorable member, no doubt, is aware that legislation is now being passed in Great Britain to regulate the importation of food stuffs, and especially of butter. As I understood the reply of the Minister to those engaged in this business, all *he requires is that a stamp shall be placed on their produce, showing what it is; and he' is prepared to allow a certificate, testifying to the quality of the butter, to be supplied to the Department, and to be available for inspection if asked for where the butter is sold. I feel sure that the Minister has had too much experience to neglect the representations made to him, and that he will not do anything to damage this industry. It has been continually stated in this Chamber that the legislation of this Parliament has been directed towards the injury of the trade and commerce of Australia ; but we have actual proof that such is not the case, and I trust that those statements will not be repeated. In mv opinion, if the Acts placed on the statute-book are administered reasonably, and according to the dictates of common sense, the producers of Australia will have nothing to fear from them. , </para>

These increments were for officers receiving over £160 a year, the greatest percentage of those who have not been paid being in the fourth class. I have risen to ask the Treasurer to see that, in regard to future payments, all officers will be treated alike, so that none may be called upon to suffer any particular injustice, and no anomalies shall be treated </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Militarism is a progressive science. As I have mentioned before, I spent fifteen months at Shoeburyness, twenty-two or twenty-three years ago, in going through a course "of gunnery instruction, and', although, my education cost the British Government something like £1:60, I found, on visiting the forts at Queenscliff recently, that I knew as little about the manning of the guns' there as the rawest recruit. The honorable member for Wentworth pointed out to-night that the artillery arm is the scientific branch of the service, and I suggest that, in exchanging officers with other parts of the British Dominions, we should insist upon getting artillery and engineer officers. The Australian cavalryman is second to none in the British Dominions. I make that statement on the strength of some notes of a Conference of cavalry officers held in Great Britain, which were lent to me by the Inspector-General. Those officers declared that our cavalryman is perfect, and that they are sorry that the Imperial cavalryman is not equally effective and satisfactory. Then, with regard to the infantry, their evolutions and mode of attack are easily learned in books, or from special service officers. It is, however, useless to appropriate only £600 a year for the training of our officers abroad. However anxious an officer might be to learn, it would be impossible for him to obtain, in the course of a few months, any knowledge likely to be of service to Australia. In place of voting £600, I would vote £6,000 to secure the efficiency of our officers, because therein lies the secret of the successful organization of our forces. As regards the appointment of an Inspector-General, there is no one who values an Australian officer more than I do. I believe in having Australian officers for the Australian Army, because they possess the Australian sentiment; but I am not going to allow that feeling to run away with' my good sense. If we are going to have a Defence Force, we should have the best man possible as Commanding Officer, and pay him a good salary. There is no man in the Commonwealth today occupying a high position in the service who is fit to command the Australian Army. If it were to be called out, we should have to import an Imperial officer from either the old country or India. What officers in high positions here to-day have had the benefit of the experience which Imperial officers have had in India? I would point out to the Minister of Defence that it is of no use to pitch a feather-bed soldier into a position, where we want a man, to whom </para>

                        <para>- No; it is too thin. When the day comes to put our Army in the field, we should have a man fit to command. Let me give an instance. In Queensland, two ot three months ago, they had the Forces out to give them general service conditions. There were about 2,000 men, and although they were only a few miles from Brisbane, they were not fit to organize the commissariat. During one-half of the time the men were without food and blankets. Is that a satisfactory state of affairs ? Our defence vote amounts to £700,000 or £800,000 a year, but in a sham affair, only a few miles from Brisbane, they not only had' to borrow the grocer's cart to bring in provisions, but to commandeer his store. And this in peace time ! </para>

                        <para>- I thought that we were going to get some good out of the system when it was introduced' bv the honorable member for Corinella, but the more I see and know of it the more rotten I think it is. It casts authority from one person to another, and it is almost impossible, in some cases, to fix responsibility. If we have made a mistake what is the best means of remedying it? My advice is to abolish the Board and make the Commanding Officers responsible, getting, of course, the very best man we can possibly get. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe in bringing before Parliament every grievance that a man has, because I know that it interferes with discipline. In many instances I have refrained from ventilating personal grievances here, and in each case the Minister has remedied the trouble. On the other hand, if a grievance cannot be remedied in that quarter, Parliament is the proper body to appeal to as the last resort. In the interests of good order and discipline, however, we should keep these grievances out of Parliament as much as possible. I have no more to say about the Defence Force to-night- But I wish to sound this warning note to the Government - that, unless they are careful in the selection of their Inspector-General, they will find that they have raised a house of cards which will fall down, with possibly disastrous results. I wish to say a few words with regard to the pensioning of the gunner or driver mentioned by the honorable member for Wentworth. It is the essence of meanness on the part of the Government if a man is, in the course of duty, disabled for life that they do not look after him. The British Government would not so act to the worst men or the lowest-paid men in the service. If a man gets injured iti the Imperial service, whether in peace time or active service, he gets a pension according to schedule. I believe that there should be drawn up a schedule of pensions to be paid to officers and men in the service who have been maimed or injured. Every one would then know what he was going to get if injured. The idea of turning out a young man with £272 to the mercy nf the world is preposterous. Sixteen years ago, when I was a sub-contractor, one of my men was hurt, and to-day I am keeping him, simply because he got injured in my service. Should not the Government do the same as a private employer is willing to do? I think it should. If no provision is made for this gunner to be pensioned, the regulations should be altered so that a pension may be granted to him. I wish now to speak on the question of trunk telephones, and I hope to have the support of every country member. We heard a great deal the other night about this Government, and I interjected that it was the only Government in Australia which had given the country the square deal that the towns and suburbs got. I am now going to put it to a practical test. In western Queensland many stations are connected with the telephone exchange in the town by some hundreds of miles of telephone. When the regulations were drawn out I had no idea that a line was going to cost the sum which the engineers computed, that is to say, a copper line for telephone use, with return metallic circuit. I have no doubt that the charges are all right. But what I want the Postmaster-General to do is to give the lines which are worked by the condenser system a chance of yielding a fair return. Take, for instance, the line from Gympie to Brisbane. The trunk rates were computed on the assumption that it would cost ^£4,000. Instead of the line costing £4,000, the expenditure amounted to only about £200 or £300. Yet the charges have been based upon the estimate of higher cost. I think that that is unfair. My constituents do not ask to be let off altogether, but they ask for a reduction of the rates. They do not ask that the charges should be reduced on the direct line, but that they should be relieved to an extent corresponding with the low cost of the service. I shall be satisfied if the Minister will give his consideration to this matter, and make some announcement in regard' to it when the Estimates are under consideration. Many of my constituents have written to me, and I have been in communication with the Department for several months on the subject. I should like the Prime Minister to furnish an answer to the question I asked on Friday last in regard to that memorable speech that was made by Colonel Riccardo, in December last. </para>

The Minister of Defence informs me that having seen the report of Colonel Riccardo's remarks, he asked for an explanation. Colonel Riccardo stated in general terms that he never intended to say anything of the kind, and that he must have been misunderstood. The Minister was not satisfied with this, and asked Colonel Riccardo to definitely state whether or not he made the statements attributed to him. He then received from Colonel Riccardo a definite denial that he had made the statements. </para>

                        <para>- It is of no use writing to the Minister. It is about time that Parliament paid some attention to the wants of rifle clubs. In various places there are men who desire to band themselves together as members of rifle clubs, in order to practice rifle shooting, but no effort is made to provide them with a range. In two or three places in my electorate the riflemen cannot obtain a range, because the Department will do nothing in the matter. An inspector was sent round the country, and sites were pointed out to him, but nothing further was done. I should like to read a letter which bears on the subject. It reads as follows : - </para>

                    <para>- There is just one matter that I should like to emphasize. It has reference to the overtime worked by officials in the General Post Office, Sydney." I hope that the instruction which has recently been issued, to the effect that they shall not be allowed tea money unless they work until 10 p.m., will be withdrawn. Another question to which I wish to direct attention relates to the payment of increments to officers in that Department Upon the Estimates of last year a certain sum was provided for this purpose. That sum has been distributed, but its distribution has caused considerable dissatisfaction. It has practically been allocated to the highly-paid officers. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that a great injustice has consequently been done to the lower-paid officers of the Department. I also understand that some trouble is being experienced in connexion with the payment of gratuities. I have been informed that the difficulty has been occasioned by certain objections which have been urged by a State Government. I hope, that this matter will receive early consideration, and' that the gratuities, so far as any proper claims are concerned, will be promptly paid. I regret that the lateness of the hour prevents the question from being adequately discussed, but I trust that the causes of the complaints to which I have referred will be speedily removed. </para>

                    <para>. - I" reply to the honorable member for Yarra, I find that the Public Service Commissioner has recommended that the sum of £550 shall be provided for the payment of increments to postal officials in Victoria, and ^170 in Tasmania. There, has been a difficulty in satisfying these claims, and I am afraid that I have been the chief obstacle to their settlement, inasmuch as I have refused to use the Treasurer's advance for the payment of salaries. In other words, I have declined to acknowledge the Public Service Act as an Appropriation Act. The provision relating to the minimum wage which was inserted in that measure I regard as one to which the Parliament has specially agreed, and have therefore made the necessary payments on the Commissioner's recommendation, from Treasurer's advance. I refuse, however, to use that fund generally for any other increments under the Commonwealth Public Service. Section 78 of the Public Service Act provides - </para>

                <para class="block">It is perfectly clear that it was never intended that that -Act should be an Appropriation Act. In the case referred to by the honorable member for Yarra, I have, however, been able to overcome the difficulty. The Commissioner has informed me that he was under a misapprehension, owing to something that the previous Treasurer had told him. I have agreed to the recommendation of the Commissioner, and, upon his assurance that the increments were unintentionally omitted from the Estimates of last year, I have agreed to pay the money at once. In regard to the other matters to which reference has been made, I think that the best plan for me to follow in dealing with them is to obtain a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and send it to the different Departments concerned. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Maranoa has brought under notice a matter relating to our telephone system. The whole trouble seems to be that the Department seeks to apply hard-and-fast regulations, without the slightest consideration for the varying circumstances of different localities. There does seem to have been in the framing of these regulations, an utter want of commonsense and business knowledge. In my own electorate, as the result of the operation of the regulations, an application made for a telephone exchange in terms which would have given the Department 30 per cent, profit in advance, could not be accepted. The Acting Postmaster- General has kindly consented to go through the papers with me, and I hope that it will be possible to carry out the arrangement. Any attempt to apply to outlying districts a hard-and-fast regulation applicable to cities, must fail absolutely, and a regulation which prevents the Government accepting a proposal from which they would derive a profit of 30 per cent, in advance, should be rescinded. </para>
