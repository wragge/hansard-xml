                    <para>.--I desire to make a personal explanation. It has been stated in the press and elsewhere, during the last few days, that before the honorable member for Bourke, the Government Whip, left the House last Friday morning, he made ah arrangement with me which would have precluded me from taking the steps which led to the exposure of the inability of the Government to keep a quorum. In an interview with a representative of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> published on Friday afternoon, the Government Whip is reported to have said - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>I had to address one of the mid-day protectionist meetings. Before leaving the House, I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman,</inline> the Postmaster-General, and asked him to look after matters in the House for me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> said - &#34; You had better see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> (the acting whip on the other side) and arrange for pairs and other matters.&#34; It is always a matter of honour with the whips during the absence of one of them, that the&#39; other will not take any unfair advantage. </para>
                    <para>I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> and told him that I would be away until two o&#39;clock, and that I had arranged with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> the details of pairs and other matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> said &#34; All right.&#34; I returned before I had expected, but by that time a number of members had left, and there was no quorum. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">On Friday the honorable member saw me in the Opposition room, where I was writing letters, and told me that he was going away, but that in his absence the Postmaster-General would act as Whip, and would arrange for pairs in connexion with any divisions which might occur. He did not speak of any other matter. The possibility of a quorum not being present was. not mentioned, and no arrangement was made with me in regard to the keeping of a quorum. Evidence of the correctness of what I say exists in the fact that he told me that the Postmaster-General would, in his absence, look after divisions, and, if there bad been a division, how could the Government have prevented a count-out in the absence of a quorum? The honorable member made no arrangement with me in regard to the keeping of a quorum ; he did not suggest that the Opposition should connive at the evasion by the Government of its constitutional responsibility to keep a quorum for the transaction of public business. I am therefore inclined to think that he must have been misunderstood or misreported by the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> interviewer. Nothing transpired during the conversation with me which could have inspired the honorable member with the belief that an arrangement had been entered into between us for the keeping of a quorum. There was no such arrangement. Furthermore, when the count-out occurred, of the five Ministerialists in the Chamber, the only private member present was the honorable member himself. As he was here to see what was happening, that disposes of the ridiculous contention that I was guilty of a practically dishonorable act in calling for a quorum while he was away. A blackguardly attack Was made upon me yesterday by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in connexion with this matter. It is not my custom to take notice of newspaper criticism, especially not of libels emanating from a journal which daily prostitutes its talents in the services of Sapphira; but I cannot allow the virulently mendacious attack to which I refer to pass without comment, even though appropriately enough this newspaper has erected over its portico a statue of Mercury, the patron of thieves and liars. The article to which I refer is as follows: - </para>
                <para>There is a code of honour, it is said, even among thieves, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> says there is one amongst politicians, and particularly amongst the Whips who marshal them. Men have to play the game or be ostracised..... </para>
                <para class="block">It is certain that on Friday the Opposition broke al&#93; recognised rules in bringing the sitting to an end with a &#34; count out.&#34; This it was that caused the. Government to cry &#34;A foul!&#34; A &#34;count out&#34; is a part of the game, too; but it has to be brought about according to the code. Friday&#39;s &#34; count out &#34; was a breach of political honour, and hence the Ministerial indignation. The standing orders fix a quorum of the Chamber at twenty-five. Any member may object to going on with business if there are fewer members present. Very often there are not half that number, and no notice is taken, because it is known that they are in the precincts of the House and available on call. But if from any cause those in Opposition can seize a time when there are not twenty-five Government supporters within hail, they can leave the Chamber with only two or three of their number to demand a count out. And that is a quite legitimate part of the game as it is played. To guard against such a thing, it is the duty of the Ministerial Whip, when Government supporters desire to leave the Chamber in any unusual numbers, to make an agreement with the Opposition, and such agreements constitute a code of honour. On Friday that was done. </para>
                <para class="block">I have shown that it was not done. The article continues - </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hume&#39;</inline>Cook told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> that he and some other members desired to be absent for a couple of hours during the adjournment for dinner. The latter acquiesced, and that bound him. But no sooner were these members absent, together with a few others who left early for lunch, than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> drew the Speaker&#39;s attention to the want of a quorum, with the necessary effect that, as none could be obtained within a few minutes, Parliament had to rise for the week, and the business before the House had to be sacrificed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> characterized this in his Maryborough speech as &#34; watching men off to their lunch, and then counting out the House before they could get back.&#34; </para>
                <para>In palliation &#39; of this dishonorable trick it may be urged by its impish perpetrator that the Opposition had more members in the House than the Government had. And that is true. But the time was 12.45 P-m-&#62; only a few minutes before adjournment, when members leave for lunch with a sense of security, relying upon each other to at least abstain from the tactics of a political welsher. However, there are some natures which no honour binds when expediency seems to perceive advantage in a dodge. There was no party gain in the spiteful little piece of cunning, and there was, of course, no public purpose to serve, but only a loss of valuable public time. There was the petty gratification that a Quilp might feel in pinching his wife&#39;s arm or in belabouring his wooden figure with the blows of his waddy. It was an act that brands the Opposition Whip as contemptible amongst his fellows, but as that does not alter his previous status, the people are the only sufferers. It might be well, however, if Ministers, to mark their sense of the meanness of the deception that was practiced on their own Whip, should refuse to hold any further intercourse with the offender for the rest of the present Parliament. </para>
                <para class="block">The remainder of the article is not relevant to myself. Those statements- can, I think, best be shown to be false by comparing the present attitude of the newspaper with that which it took up on a similar occasion a couple of years ago. By such a comparison I shall prove, out of the mouth of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> that its mendacious attack upon me was absolutely without justification. The House was counted out on Friday, the 9th September, 1904, a few minutes after the resumption of proceedings following the luncheon adjournment, when a luncheon party was being held within the precincts of the Chamber. This is what the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said of that occurrence: - </para>

                    <para>This extraordinary contretemps created not a little dismay in the Ministerial ranks, and some degree of humour at the expense of the Government. Almost at the very inception of its term of office, and of an important debate, the Government had failed in its responsibility to keep a House. The two Ministers in the Chamber appeared to be panic-stricken. Here was evidence of a fine capacity to conduct the business of the country ! <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was entertaining the Prime Minister and others upstairs at a luncheon, but where was the newly appointed Government Whip, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilks</inline> ? Why did he not keep a House? The episode was regarded as a further conclusive proof of the demoralization of the House under its present leadership. </para>
                    <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>Lyne, who was speaking at the time of the count-out, was by no means displeased at the turn of events. He had several strong criticisms to level against the Prime Minister, he said, and he was not going to continue with them while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> persisted in running away. According to all precedent the Government is responsible for the transaction of public business, and must bear the responsibility of keeping a quorum. </para>
                    <para>Apart &#39;from the member for Hume, members strongly expressed the opinion that a Govern-^&#39;;&#39; ment which neglected its duty in this fashion, which deserted its post to allow public affairs to look after themselves, and which in a craven way refused to face criticism, must be brought to account with promptitude. The &#34; count out &#34; probably did more than anything else could have done to hurry up a no-confidence motion. </para>

                    <para>While the Opposition is not fulfilling the threat of some of its members to give the Government no quarter, it can be depended upon to embrace opportunities for embarrassing Ministers when those opportunities prominently present themselves. On two occasions the Government has neglected to keep a House. On Wednesday night there was a &#34; count out &#34; almost at the usual hour of adjourning, and the Treasurer yesterday wanted to evade the penalty for this neglect by replacing the lapsed estimates on the notice paper, going on as if nothing had happened. Oppositionists were not inclined to be so lenient. They might be as anxious to get into recess as the Government, but like all true oppositionists, they must support the standing orders. </para>

                <para class="block">Having quoted those statements, I have done with this newspaper. It has shown itself so unworthy in all its political criticism, from whatever stand-point directed, that I thought I could not do better than answer its lies out of its own mouth. The Prime Minister and others sitting on the Ministerial side of the Chamber, have said that I deliberately counted heads before calling attention to the state of the Committee. To that charge my reply is that on Friday morning I did not enter either the Labour room or the Ministerial room, and I therefore leave it to the Government to explain how I could have counted heads. The best evidence of the falsity of the charges which have_been made by the Government in its extraordinary indignation at this exposure of its inability to maintain a quorum, lies in the fact that of the three parties represented in the Chamber when attention was called to the state of the Committee, the members of the Opposition, who were in no way responsible for the keeping of a quorum, were proportionate! v a larger representation than were the members of the other parties present. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HUME</inline>COOK (Bourke) &#91;2.45I.- T also wish to make a personal explanation with respect to what occurred on last Friday. The statement of the honorable member for Wentworth is correct to a certain degree, but I think&#39; that it is necessary that I should give my version of what took place. What happened was this : I found it necessary tq leave the House for about two hours, and. in the ordinary course of business, I communicated with the Postmaster-General, to whom I usually refer upon such occasions of the kind - I think that I had been under the necessity of doing so only three times since I have held my present position. The Minister said - &#34;You had better see the Acting Whip of the Opposition, the honorable member for Wentworth, tell him how things are, and put him on his honour as to the state of the House.&#34; I think that the Postmaster-General added : &#34; If you do that, things will be as safe as a church.&#34; My answer was that I did not think it necessary to put the honorable member for Wentworth upon his honour, but that I would inform him of the circumstances, and that it would then be all right. I saw the honorable member for Wentworth and told him that I would be away until two o&#39;clock, and asked him to see the Postmaster-General if it were found necessary to arrange for any pairs. I did not ask him not to count out the House. I did not make any particular or special arrangement with him as to that or anything else. If one had to make a special arrangement of that kind in every such case, it would be necessary to enter into a solemn compact half-a-dozen times a day. </para>

I have always arranged the business with the view to meeting, as far as practicable, the wishes of honorable members of the Opposition, and I am sure that not a single honorable member can say that he has been inconvenienced by any act of mine. I did not think it necessary to enter into any special arrangement upon the occasion referred to. because I naturally expected that the business would be allowed to proceed in the ordinary way. As proof that there was an understanding in this respect, I desire to point to the fact that the honorable member for Lang, who now significantly objects to the restoration of the &#34;Bounties Bill to the business-paper, arranged with the honorable member for Yarra that there should be no count-out. </para>

The honorable member for Lang told nae that he had agreed that the debate should be kept going until1 o&#39;clock, which I understood to mean that there would be no count-out, but that business would be permitted to proceed in the ordinary way. If the honorable member for Lang states that what I now say is incorrect, all I can add is that I misunderstood him. What I have stated tends to prove that there was an understanding on Loth sides of the House that the business was to be allowed to proceed in the ordinary wav. It is well known that at noon on Fridays honorable members who have to leave Melbourne are busy making arrangements for their departure, and no advantage has, so far, been taken of that fact. I admit that it is the duty of the Government to keep a quorum, but I would point out that the circumstances connected with the previous count out were entirely different from those which surrounded the proceedings <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> last Friday. Upon the previous occasion no arrangement was entered into, nor was any undertaking given. </para>

I know that the previous) count out took place on a Friday, and I am further aware that the statements made with regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the dinner that took place on that occasion are true. It is also quite possible that the bells may not have been heard by some honorable members who were within sufficiently easy reach of the Chamber to attend and help to make a quorum. The circumstances, however, were entirely different from those on Friday last, when a number of honorable members went away in the full belief, that no tricks would be played. They felt satisfied that the honorable understanding would be observed, and that there was no danger of their being deprived of an opportunity to vote, or of any business lapsing. </para>

                    <para>- It is always a matter for deep regret when honorable members indulge in very long explanations. . I do not think that such explanations do so much service as those who offer them may think. At the same time, it has always been the custom of this, and of every other Parliament of which I have any knowledge, to allow very considerable latitude to an honorable member who feels aggrieved, even though the grievance may appear trifling to other honorable members. I should be very sorry to restrict the rights and liberties of honorable members in this respect, but I hope that they will refrain from making explanations at length, and especially from making them in such a form as to provoke other explanations, and practically give rise to a prolonged debate. </para>

                <para class="block">That is absolutely incorrect. The person who wrote that statement endeavoured to convey the impression that whilst the Watson Government were in office the House was counted out. As I happened to be the Government whip at that time, I should take it as a reflection on myself &#34;if a count out had taken place. If the writer of the article will take the trouble to examine the records of the House for the three and a half months during which the Watson Government were in office, he will find that no count out occurred. I have a distinct recollection of the two count-outs, which occurred during the time the half-and-half Ministry occupied the Treasury bench. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which backed up that Ministry, however, forgot to mention the events referred to. I would recommend the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to exercise a little more care, and to confine itself to accurate statements. With regard to the events of last Friday, I may mention that as I was about to go to lunch I saw the honorable member for Lang, and asked him if there was any likelihood of a division taking place before lunch. He said he thought not, and that, if necessary, he would keep the business going. </para>

                    <para>. - I had not intended to trouble the House with a personal explanation, but as my name has been mentioned, it is only fair to myself that I should make some explanation as to my connexion with the events under review. So far as I am concerned, what happened was this: At about twenty minutes to 1 o&#39;clock I was on my way to the library, when I met the honorable member for Yarra, accompanied by several others, who were about to go to lunch. The honorable member for Yarra said, &#34;I suppose there will not be any division before lunch.&#34; I said that I could not answer for that absolutely, but that I did not think so, because the honorable member for New England had just risen, and I thought that he would in all probability cut out the time until 1 o&#39;clock. I added that I did not think that there would be any division, because, if necessary, I would keep the debate going until the adjournment for lunch. </para>

                        <para>- No. When I returned to the Chamber, I was surprised to find that the honorable member for New England had concluded his speech, and that the honorable member for Kooyong was addressing the Committee. As soon as the latter honorable member had concluded, at about a quarter to 1 o&#39;clock, I rose with the object of continuing the debate, but simultaneously the Minister in charge of the Bill, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, also rose, and suggested that the adjournment for lunch might at once take pl&#39;ace. I was thus prevented from speaking, and then the honorable member for Wentworth suggested that it would be desirable to have a quorum before an &#39; adjournment was made for lunch. </para>

                    <para>&#91;2.59}. - As my name has been brought into this matter, and it lias been stated in the press that I was mainly responsible for what happened on Friday last, I wish to say a few words in explanation. I was attending to some business in the Ministerial room when the honorable member for Bourke came to me and stated that he desired to leave the House until 2 o&#39;clock. I asked him before doing so to see the Opposition Whip .and to put him on his honour as regards the business of the House. That is the usual practice, and it is the one which was followed during the whole time that I occupied the position of Government Whip. It was the only arrangement which it was necessary to make. For example, when I was about to visit England, I merely informed the honorable member for Macquarie of the fact, and his reply was, &#34; I will see that everything is all right.&#34; There was never any occasion to bind him down to an agreement of that sort. That is why I said to the honorable member for Bourke, &#34; Put the honorable member for Wentworth upon his honour.&#34; Of course, I do not know what the honorable member for Bourke said to the honorable member. I was not aware whether there was a quorum within the precincts of the building at the time of which I am speaking, but I was informed in the Ministerial room that the honorable member for Wentworth was arranging for a count-out. </para>

If the honorable member for Wentworth is sincere in his statement that the charge levelled against him .is absolutely false, I should like him to definitely say. that he did not arrange in any way to secure a count-out. Let him say that. When I entered the Chamber the honorable member was in close consultation with honorable members of the Opposition. It was about fourteen or fifteen minutes to 1 o&#39;clock, and, as we have often risen before the ordinary hour for luncheon, in order to allow of amendments to Bills being framed, I suggested to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that hie should consent to an adjournment. I did so, believing that my information was good, and that it was the intention of the honorable member for Wentworth, if possible, to count-out the House. It transpired that my anticipation was correct, because immediately the Vice-President of the Executive Council rose, the honorable member - who had not had time to arrange with some other honorable member to act for him - himself called attention to the State of the Committee.

                    <para>The Mossman canegrowers are experiencing considerable delay in obtaining payment of bounty claims, which amount to between &#163;300 and &#163;400 weekly. The head office, it is stated, only remits a comparatively small amount, and then awaits the return of the farmers&#39;&#34; vouchers before further remitting. The funds available are only sufficient to meet half, the claims. Unless the present arrangements are altered, the payments at the end of the crushing will be at least &#163;10,000 in arrears, and at the rate of &#163;400 per fortnight the final payment on the present season&#39;s cane will not be made till late in 1907 - a prospect which the farmers never contemplated when registering. The mill directors have wired a protest to the Collector of Customs in Brisbane. </para>

                    <para>- I heard, only this morning, that some dissatisfaction existed with regard to the payment of the bounties, but upon inquiry I found that the officers in my Department knew nothing about the matter. The bounties are paid over by the Treasury, and perhaps, the Treasurer can afford the honorable member some information upon the question. </para>

                        <para>- The principal rolls for all the States will be printed on or about the date mentioned, but they will contain more than the names of electors who were enrolled prior to the 16th of July. In New South Wales and Victoria, for example, they will contain the names of persons who have been enrolled upon specific claims, and of others who have been enrolled upon the information collected by the police. In fact, in all States they will include the names of all electors whom the electoral officers are satisfied are entitled to enrolment. In some of the States these rolls will be printed earlier than they are in others. Then the supplemental rolls will contain all the names of electors who are qualified to vote, and have applied for enrolment up to the time of the issue of the writs. The desire of the Department has been to include upon the principal rolls the names of as many delec- tors as possible, so that the supplemental lists may be as small as possible. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit this motion in lieu of the resolution which I moved some time ago, and which embodied the recommendations made by the Tariff Commission upon these particular items. The present proposal differs from the former resolution only in this respect : that it is considered by the Department and by myself much more satisfactory to impose a specific duty upon harvesters and strippers than to levy an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. Honorable members will recollect that in the past a good deal of trouble has been experienced on account of the impossibility of ascertaining the correct <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty which should be collected upon these goods. Any further trouble in that connexion will be obviated if, upon these two classes of machinery, resort be had to specific duties. </para>

As I explained just now, our proposal will, if adopted, save the Department a great deal of trouble - it will avoid the necessity of communicating with the States and with Canada. If we had had in the first instance a specific duty much of the difficulty that has arisen would have been obviated. </para>

                            <para>- It is unnecessary to embody in the motion the conditions as to price, but I shall lay upon the table a short memorandum showing what the Government propose to embody in the Bill to prevent a combination charging more than a certain price for these machines without losing the advantage of a portion, if not the whole, of the duty. The Bill, which I shall not prepare until the motion has been dealt with, will provide that the cash price of 5-feet stripper harvesters must be reduced by the end of 1906 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;70.</inline> I wish to emphasize the point that the Tariff Commission recommended that the price should not exceed &#163;81. That, to my mind, would be an outrageous charge. </para>

Failing such reductions, power will be taken to reduce the import duties, by proclamation, or resolution of the House, to an amount to be determined by such proclamation or resolution, not to be less than one-half of the new duties imposed.

                            <para>- I hope that the honorable member will allow me to deal with one matter at a time. I cannot go into every detail in submitting this bald motion which is intended really for the information of the Committee, and is not part and parcel of the Bill to be hereafter submitted. I recently met a member of the firm of Hugh Lennon and Co., who directed my attention to a statement which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 22nd and 24th instant, to the effect that, in consequence of the motion submitted by me, in .accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, the price of harvesters had been increased. The gentleman in question gave me his business card, showing that the prices charged for these machines are ^75 for the smaller size and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;&#38;o</inline> for the larger size, and that these prices have prevailed ever since the ring that was in existence was partly, if not wholly, dissolved. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. I am very glad that the honorable member for Maranoa referred by interjection to that phase of the question. If there is one thing I desire more than another it is that the weaker section of the community shall be fairly paid. I desire that the workers shall be protected just as strongly as I wish to secure protection for the manufacturer. If honorable members require further information as to the number of machines imported, I shall be prepared to supply it at the proper time. I may mention that the proposal to pLace on the free-list certain- articles which are at present dutiable will not come into force until the Bill has been passed. At the present moment hand-worked rakes- and ploughs combined, maize harvesters, maize binders, maize planters, moulding boards in the rough and not cut into shape, and potato raisers or diggers are on the free-list, and it is proposed to add hay tedders and potato sorters to the list, for the reason that it seems that they are not manufactured here, and that probably* if they were not made free, as recommended by the Commission, the price would be unduly increased. I shall be glad at the proper time to give honorable members all the information that is required in regard to this matter, but I do not think that it is necessary at present to do so. </para>

                    <para class="block">The object of the Bill is to give effect to the resolution&#39; agreed to by the Committee <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> Ways and Means for the imposition <inline font-style="italic">o?</inline> duties of import on spirits, and to carry into effect the recommendations of the Tariff Commission on the subject. This is done in greater detail than it has hitherto been the practice to adopt. In one or two respects, however1, die measure requires amendment. For instance, medicines are to be interpreted to include &#34; medicines for internal or external application.&#34; It has been pointed out to me that if that interpretation ,were &#39;left as i&#39;t stands, injustice would be done, and unnecessary expense would have to be incurred. I therefore propose to add the words,&#39; &#34; other than liniments and veterinary medicines.&#34; I also propose to amend the provisions relating to &#34;methylated spirit,&#34; because I have been informed that, for some time past, the law has been abused, owing to the practice of illegally treating the spirit so that it can be sold for human consumption. This, of course, is an evasion of the Tariff, with which I propose to deal very stringently. Scents are interpreted to include &#34; all liquid preparations of perfumery and liquid preparations for toilet purposes.&#34; That interpretation and the definition of Australian standard brandy. which has already gained a high reputation, carry out the recommendations of the Tariff Commission.

                            <para>- Yes. But I shall have no power to extend the time if the provision remains as it is. The term &#34;two years&#34; has been inserted in the Bill because that is the period recommended by the Tariff Commission. It is provided that gin shall be matured in wood, which, judging by samples which have been sent to me, tends to make it brown. I understand that chemists say that to mature gin in wood is to improve it, but those in the trade complain that the drinkers of gin and schnapps are so accustomed to a clear spirit that their business will fall off if a discoloured spirit is placed on the market. Moreover, I have been told that a large quantity of gin which has not been matured in wood has been ordered, and is on its way here. In dealing with the subject, the Committee will have to determine whether gin shall be matured in wood, and, if so, for what length of time it must be kept before being used. I have received so much information lately on the subject of wines and spirits that I arn almost in a position to lecture in regard to them. I have been informed that pot distilled spirit is received into iron* tanks which have been bricked and cemented, and is as good on the day of distillation as it ever will be. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member was with me when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seppelt</inline> explained the matter to us, on our visit to the distillery, where we saw the whole process. If spirit is put into wood, it may be discoloured, but it improves, although there is a considerable loss through absorption and evaporation. No loss occurs when the spirit is kept in iron tanks, bricked and cemented, and my information is that such spirit can be used at once, because keeping does not improve it. I discovered, in going through three distilleries I have visited, that the patent still eliminates the ethers, while the pot still allows them to pass over, and consequently makes a better spirit. That, no doubt, is why the Tariff Commission is so strongly in favour of pot stills. In the process of distillation, four tanks are used, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. The best spirit is that which goes into the tanks numbered 2 and 3, and the spirit in the tanks numbered 1 and 4, being equally good, is put through the still again, to bring it up to the same standard as that in tanks 2 and 3. I agree with the Tariff Commission that, where it is possible to use the pot still, it should, in the interests of the public, be used. I should, however, like to know what is the exact meaning attached to the words &#34; pot still or other such method.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I have gone to some trouble with a view to understanding this subject, having visited several of the distilleries - one twice in one week - and having studied the reports of the Commission, and read some of the evidence given before it. It cannot reasonably be held that the Commission made no mistakes. The treatment which the Government have meted out to the recommendations of the Commissioners constitute a reflection upon their work. Either the Government are wantonly disregarding sound recommendations, or the reports furnished by the Commission are at fault. My point is that some of the grape spirit does not require to be kept for two years in wood in order to secure the degree of purity desired. The remarks of the Minister might apply to pot-still spirit, but not to rectified spirit produced from grape wine. When distillation takes place by means of pot stills the results arrived at are very different from those which are brought about when spirits are rectified by means of patent stills. The process of high rectification has the effect of removing from the spirit all the impurities that can possibly be eliminated. The Bill provides that the blended brandy shall contain 25 per cent. of pot-still grape spirit and 75 per cent. of pure rectified grape spirit. </para>

                            <para>- That has nothing whatever to do with the point with which I am dealing. What I say is that spirit made from pure grape wine is pure brandy. It is provided in the Bill that blended brandy shall consist altogether of pure wine spirit, and that 25 per cent. shall be made by the pot-still process. Now, experts tell me that pot-still brandy should be kept in the wood for a period of two years, in order to eliminate from the spirit some volatile oils which are passed over in the process of distillation. By maturing the spirit in wood for two years these oils become eliminated or of less strength. The same remarks would not apply to the 75 per cent, of rectified wine spirit which is proposed to be used in making up blended brandy. By keeping that spirit for two years you would not attain an appreciably higher degree of purity, because the process of rectification eliminates the volatile oils which are to be found in the pot-still products. I have taken the trouble to visit some distilleries and obtain accurate information on this point, and the view which I have expressed is supported, not only by distillers, but by Excise officers. Therefore, I cannot be so much mistaken as the honorable member for Perth seems to think. The Bill provides that the whole of the blended brandy, including the rectified grape wine spirit, shall be matured in wood for two years, and I contend that, according to the information supplied, that provision is not necessary in regard to the rectified spirit, which cannot reach any higher degree of purity by the process of maturing, although. it may approach a little more closely to the standard of alcoholic purity known to chemists. There is not sufficient rectified spirit in store - nor could it be obtained within six or eight months - to enable the manufacture of brandy to be Carried on. Plenty of molasses spirit can be obtained, but rectified grape spirit cannot be made until the next vintage takes place. Therefore, the two-year period specified in the Bill would not commence until after the next vintage. I would suggest that in the case of rectified spirit, a period of two years should be allowed to elapse before the provision to which I have referred is brought into force. Of course. I know that, according to the views held by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission and by the honorable member for Perth, what I am now saying is all fudge, but it is the judgment of science. </para>

                            <para>- Are we to remain silent because certain information has not been given to the Commission? Cannot we bring forward any new points that may be brought under our notice? A number of reports have been presented by Commissions since the first Commonwealth Parliament was opened, and, I think, only two have been acted upon. This tends to show that honorable members have not attached any very great importance to the evidence which has been taken at such great expense, or to the conclusions which have been based upon it. Now we are told that in the case of the Tariff Commission we must accept the evidence as incontrovertible, and their conclusions as beyond all possibility of error. I am endeavouring to supplement the evidence given before the Commission with information&#39; which may fairly be regarded as reliable, seeing that it is the testimony of expert witnesses- My. contention is that we should provide that the use of rectified spirit that has not been kept for two years shall be allowed until after the next two vintages have taken place. Until March next there will not be sufficient wine spirit available to permit of the manufacture of what is described in the Bill as blended brandy. Molasses spirit can. however, be procured at once, because the raw material is available. I hope that when we reach the Committee stage an amendment will be carried in the direction I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill is intended to give effect to the general recommendations of the Commission, which could not have been included in the Excise Tariff Bill. I am glad to see that Ministers have seen their way clear to accept the recommendations of the Commission with regard to the spirit and wine industry generally. I hope that this Bill, in conjunction with the new Excise duties, will have the effect of placing the distillation industry of Australia upon a sure, satisfactory, and scientific basis, and that the industry will receive a great impetus. I trust that the manufacturers will welcome the opportunity to carry on their industry upon proper lines, and that the consumers will be able to feel assured that they are obtaining a good article. I should like to draw attention to some of the features of the Bill with which I think the general public are not fully acquainted. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">I refer more particularly to the provisions relating to what may be described as the standardization of spirits. Distillers will no longer be granted a concession by way of Excise duty without having to give something in return. As a compensation for the Excise advantages that are conferred upon distillers, they will be required to produce a good article, whether it be brandy, or whisky, or rum. Upon complying with the statutory requirements, they will te entitled to affix to their goods a Commonwealth certificate and trade name. Therefore, it seems to me that they will have every inducement to comply with the law in order that they mav enjoy the advantage of. the standardized name whether it be &#34; Australian standard brandy,&#34; .&#34;Australian blended wine brandy,&#34; &#34;Australian standard malt whisky,&#34; &#34;Australian blended whisky,&#34; or &#34;Australian standard rum.&#34;, I think that these provisions will give rise to a spirit of emulation as between distillers, and that they will take a pride in turning out a. good article. In the course of the evidence given before the Commission, very great stress was laid bv a number of witnesses, comprising manufacturers, Excise officers, and wholesale merchants, upon the absolute necessity of strong spirits being preserved in wood for a certain length of time before they were permitted to pass into consumption. There was a general consensus of opinion that spirits matured by being kept in wood - I believe that only one witness was doubtful upon this point - were much improved in character. It was pointed out that, owing to the process of oxidation of the secondary products., or, in other words, the evaporation of the strong volatile elements, the spirit became verv much purified. It was stated that one of the causes of the failure of Australian, and particularly of &#34;Victorian, spirits, was that they were placed upon the market when they were immature. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> admitted that age matured spirits, and agreed that, perhaps, there should be a limit placed upon the introduction of immature spirits to the market. It was also urged that that time limit should apply not only to imported, but also to locally-produced spirits - in other words, that it should operate all round. To that proposition there was a general chorus of approval. The point upon which I have brought into conflict with the honorable and learned member for Angas 7- for whose opinion I entertain the very greatest respect - is that whilst throughout the whole of the evidence tendered to the Tariff Com mission it was laid down as a general proposition that young and immature spirits should not be allowed to pass into general consumption, not a single word was uttered in reference to differentiating between spirits which are distilled at a low strength and spirits which are distilled at a high strength. The general opinion was that the advantage to be derived from oxidation applied not only to spirits produced at a low strength by means of the pot still, but also to highly rectified spirits. There was no suggestion that highly rectified spirits did not require time for maturing. It was distinctly laid clown that all spirits should be kept in bond or &#34; quarantine,&#34; as I might term it, for a certain term before they were allowed to pass into general consumption. What I complain of is that the point which has been raised by the honorable and learned member for Angas is a new one, which was never suggested by the wine-growers,by the distillers, themselves, or by the departmental experts who were called upon to advise the Commission. There may be something in the point, but I am guided only by the evidence. I know nothing whatever about what has transpired in private conversation. The recommendations of the Commission are based upon the sworn evidence of witnesses, and if certain gentlemen desired us to differentiate between spirits distilled at a low strength by means of a pot still and highly rectified spirits produced by the patent still, they ought to have brought that fact under our notice. I submit that the information presented by the honorable and learned member for Angas should not carry the same weight as should attach to the general views which are embodied in the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. As a member of that body, I am guided only by the evidence and not by the <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> statements which have been communicated  to  the honorable member and  to  others who have had no opportunity of cross examining their informants. Probably had the point been brought under the attention of the Commission, that body would have investigated it. I repeat that no distinction was drawn between spirits produced at a low strength and spirits distilled at a high strength, and, consequently, our recommendation is that  no  spirits intended for general consumption - irrespective of whether they are produced by means of the pot still or by  any  other method - should be allowed to be taken out of bond, unless they have undergone a certain period of probation. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable . and learned member and myself have arrived at an agreement upon the proposed suspension of the limitation, we need not continue the controversy. I believe that the remaining clauses of the Bill relating to methylated spirits will, upon investigation, be found to be highly beneficial to Australian industries. In the spirits which are derived from molasses there will be found an almost inexhaustible reservoir of power which can be utilized for industrial purposes, and the Commission have suggested a scheme under which those spirits may be made available for such purposes, whilst, at the same time, providing every safeguard for the protection of the revenue. I think that the House will have accomplished good work when it passes the Bill, coupled with the Excise resolutions, and that the work of &#39;the Commission will not have been altogether fruitless. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not wish for a moment to discount the work performed by the Tariff Commission. But I have been at considerable trouble to investigate this question of spirits, and I wish to point out to the Chairman of the Commission that the only spirits which require to be kept in wood for two years are whisky, rum, and brandy. According to the testimony, not only of expert distillers, but of expert officers of the Customs Department, a highly rectified spirit is no better after it has been stored in wood for two years than it would be after it had been stored there for only two weeks. </para>

This highly rectified spirit is used for the purpose of blending with pot still spirits which contain these ethers. Take the case of gin as an illustration.

                            <para>- Gin is always kept in iron&#39; vessels. It is not necessary to harass the trade at all, unless the Commission can bring indisputable evidence that a highly rectified spirit will improve with age or that its consumption, when newly distilled, is injurious. The honorable and learned member for Angas was perfectly right in his contention, and I am aware that he has taken a good deal more trouble to investigate this matter than I have. The Minister, however, can soon settle the point. He has experts in his Department, whose opinions could be easily obtained. </para>

                            <para>- But the Minister will require to see that much more effective supervision is exercised than has been exercised hitherto. Although it has been against the law to denature spirits, we know that they have been denatured. Whilst we are affording a fair measure of protection to the distillers, we ought to see that the revenue is thoroughly protected. In this connexion I would call the attention of the Minister to the fact that a large amount of revenue is being lost to the Department through what is known as the &#34;grogging &#34; of casks. In dealing with this matter, I find that the Imperial Parliament has provided an elaborate set of regulations which&#39; prevent distillers, when they are refilling their casks, from extracting spirits from the wood and from selling them, thus evading the payment of duty. A very large amount of spirit can be extracted in that way, and the Minister should see that something is done to prevent it. I should like to quote some regulations upon this subject which are in force in Great Britain. Regulation . 289 reads - </para>

When this is not desirable or convenient, as far as the proprietor is concerned, they may, at his option, be removed to a distillery or bonded warehouse, or they may be exported ; the casks in either case being first properly drained, and bungs, which should be of hard wood, firmly driven in. </para>

Casks may be washed out instead. - Spirit casks, not belonging to a distiller, or which it may be inconvenient to send to a distillery or warehouse for refilling, or which, from unsoundness or unsuitableness the proprietor mav not wish to refill at the warehouse, may be delivered therefrom, provided that at the&#39; expense of such proprietor they be effectually washed out with water, so as to remove the spirit from the wood prior to delivery. For this purpose each cask should be partially filled with water to the extent of a sixth part of its &#34;content,&#34; be retained in warehouse at least six days, be rolled round at least once daily, and be left at rest after being rolled with a fresh surface in contact with water each day. The rinsings from the casks thus treated are to be destroyed in the presence of the officers, unless, at the&#39; option *f the proprietor, duty be paid on the quantity of spirit at proof which they contain. </para>

On certain conditions a similar quantity may be used. - Should the proprietor give notice of his wish to pay duty on the rinsings of casks, and express a desire to obtain the spirit in a more concentrated form, a similar quantity of water, not less than 10 per cent, of the &#34; content,&#34; may be used, the cask being retained a longer time in warehouse, the essential principle being that each part of the internal surface of the cask shall remain in contact with water for about forty-eight hours before the cask is removed from the warehouse. </para>

The officer must examine the casks when filled, and see the contents destroyed at any time after twenty-four hours from his examination, certifying to this effect in the register. 295. Examination and destruction of contents. - The officer must examine the casks when filled and see the contents destroyed at any time after twenty-four hours from his examination, certifying to this effect in the .register. 296. Casks emptied for methylating spirits. - When spirits are removed from the distillery or from the warehouse after methylation the empty casks are to be removed to a distillery or warehouse, subject to the foregoing regulations, or at the option of the methylator they may be washed in a locked compartment at the place of methylation in the same manner as casks washed in warehouse, the rinsings being, at the option of the methylator, destroyed or added to the spirits in the next methylation, on condition that the spirits to which the rinsings are added be not thereby reduced below the legal strength at which methylated spirit may be sent out. In case the washings are added to the methylated spirit the stock should be adjusted accordingly. </para>

Whilst we are effectively protecting the manufacturer, we should take steps to effectively protect the revenue. I am glad that the members of the Tariff Commission are prepared to consider the amendment of clauses 10 and 11, and I think that after giving the matter further attention they will come to the conclusion that those clauses are unnecessary, except in so far as they deal with purely pot-still spirit. Whilst I am pleased that no delay has occurred in taking steps to protect a trade which was all too rapidly falling into the hands of foreign manufacturers who have been introducing into the Commonwealth the worst kind of spirits- </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to congratulate the honorable and learned member for Angas and the honorable member for Hindmarsh upon the way in which they have blossomed forth as experts in the spirit trade. I heartily admit that the House may learn much on this question from those who are not members of the Tariff Commission. At the same time I would respectfully urge that the recommendations of the Commission have been based on very careful and painstaking research, and that, while in some respects the evidence submitted to it has not been of that all-embracing character that we could have desired, the Commission has endeavoured to supplement any shortcomings in that direction bv official information available from other sources. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that, although I have listened very carefully- to the remarks of the honorable and learned member for Angas and the honorable member for Hindmarsh, I am still unable to adopt their view with regard to the non-necessity for ageing rectified spirit. So far as I can remember, they have not adduced any particularly expert evidence to support their contention. The honorable and learned member for Angas has spoken of the knowledge of the experts of the Department. I admit that they are, as a rule, highly capable and efficient, so far as the particular work with which they have to do is concerned ; but I do not admit that they have that special knowledge which would enable them to decide what are the true classes of spirit, the higher classes of spirit, and what constitute the essential elements of good and bad spirit. Those matters are wholly beyond their province. Whilst they have given the Commission much useful information, they have been careful, as a rule, to deal only with those details upon which their experience enables them to give information of value. In most cases, they have frankly indicated their limitations in this respect. I have been at considerable pains to read up, not one), but several authorities <inline font-style="italic">an.</inline> rectified spirits, and, in addition to what is the universal experience, I find an overwhelming mass of evidence to support the contention of the Commission that even highly rectified spirit, if new, is not nearly so wholesome as that which has been matured for a number of years. </para>

                            <para>- I have already said, but for the benefit of the honorable member I shall repeat the statement, that chemistry is very much at a loss to explain the particular constituents of alcohols - their qualities and the operations that take place in the changing of the various constituents from one chemical form to another. That has beep admitted by the ablest chemists who have come before the Commission. In dealing with questions about which the ablest men know the least, witnesses, as a rule, have been most dogmatic in proportion to their lack of knowledge. We have overwhelming evidence to the effect that raw rectified spirit is highly injurious when taken into the human system. That is undoubtedly the experience of those countries in which alcohol is used as a common beverage by the mass of the people. In Scotland, &#34; Ireland, and of late years, on the Continent of Europe - in Germany and France, where highly rectified spirits have, unfortunately, largely been coming into consumption - the testimony is almost unanimous that a process of deterioration physical, mental, and moral takes place in those who swallow raw, and highly rectified spirit: </para>

                            <para>- The subject is a big one, but I do not wish to discuss it now, as I must keep to my text. If rectified spirit is used in Australia, in the manufacture of brandy, I regret it, and hope that the practice will be discouraged by this Legislature. A great deal of the evidence put before us shows that the best brandy is produced by means of the pot still, and pot stills only are used in those countries which manufacture the brandy bearing the best reputation. Rectified spirit may be used in compounding a so-called brandy, but the concoction is not a true brandy. </para>

                            <para>- Although of recent years&#39; the whisky sold has possessed an amber tint, I remember when in Scotland all the whisky was as colourless as the gin now on the market, notwithstanding that it had been matured in wood. The colouring to which the honorable member for Hindmarsh refers is due, not to maturing in wood, but to maturing in sherry casks, and it has not. been proved that casks or other wooden vessels could not be made in which gin could be stored for a number of years without being coloured. A great deal of the whisky sold nowadays is almost identical in its component parts with gin, though flavoured differently. </para>

I am informed by the Minister&#39;s colleagues, and by the official who is watching the Bill, that it will not be necessary to reinsert these words in clause 15; but I ask the honorable gentleman to see that they are inserted, if it is at all doubtful that they are not covered by the amended interpretation of the word &#34;medicine.&#34; </para>

                        <para>.- I believe &#39;that if the community would forego the use of alcoholic beverages1 it would be all the better for doing so. Indeed, if people generally were persuaded that spirits are injurious, instead of beneficial, when used as a beverage, there would be no need for legislation of this character; but until the happy time comes when that truth is recognised we should do our best to secure that only spirits of the highest purity get into consumption. This measure however, pays special consideration to the interests of the Victorian distillers, at the expense of the industries of the other States. It is well known, so I am credibly informed by persons whose opinion is entitled to respect, that Victorian distilleries do not possess up-to-date appliances, being fitted up with the old-fashioned pot stills, which have long since gone out of date. However much it may be desirable to provide for the maturing of spirit distilled by pot stills, because of the large quantity of impurities contained in it, it is not so necessary in the case of the highly rectified spirit distilled by the patent stills. In any case, I understand that the effect of keeping spirits in wood for a long period is not to get rid of the impurities, but to disguise their presence. As a matter of fact, these impurities still exist, although the spirit becomes so mellowed that the impurities are less noticeable. This applies to spirits distilled in pot stills, but not to spirits produced in patent stills, such as are used by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The spirits produced in pot stills contain a very large proportion of impurities, whereas the product of the patent stills is much purer, because in the process of rectification all deleterious substances are eliminated, and the spirit is as pure as it is possible to make it. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. Wilkinson</inline>says that it is a scientific fact that, no matter how long spirits are kept, the poison in them remains, and, therefore, the advantage to the consumer to which he refers must be merely a matter of palatability. In other words the spirit, by being kept in wood, will become more palatable. His testimony in that respect is supported by men who are entitled to be regarded as experts. It seems to me that if any reason can be advanced in favour of maturing in wood for a period of two years spirits which are produced by means of the pot-still, it does not apply to spirits which are produced by means of the patent still. I understand that if the proposal of the Government be enforced, some distillers will be required to expend a vast sum in acquiring land, and in providing immense storage accommodation for their spirits. Whilst I do not appear as a special pleader for any distiller, I do say that, if the Minister desires to place the manufacturers of all the States upon an equality, due regard should be given to these considerations. Unless it is absolutely necessary - upon the ground of health - to compel the distillers to incur an immense outlay to provide storage accommodation for their spirits, the Minister ought to consider whether it is desirable to enforce a provision of this kind. Personally I should be very glad to see an end put to the distillation of spirits, so far as they are intended for consumption as a beverage. If it is necessary - as I suppose it is - to distil spirits for medical purposes, I have no objection to urge. But if we could only persuade the community that the less they indulged in spirits the better it would be for them, we should soon arrive at that period when it would be no longer necessary to enact special legislation for the preservation of the public health. </para>

                        <para>. - As the Minister has paid some attention to one or two points upon which I intended to offer some criticism, and on account of other personal reasons, I do not intend to occupy the time of the House at any length. There is still another reason which deters me from speaking in any but the most deferential way upon this question, and that is the presence in the House of members of the Commission. They have paid more months of attention te this matter than ordinary members have, been able to devote hours to it, and they must be presumed to have discussed its <inline font-style="italic">pros</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">cons</inline> very fully and deliberately. But, notwithstanding that they have given all this attention to the subject, there may be points which have been left unconsidered - points as to which the evidence has not been so full and complete as to enable them to arrive at the real facts of the situation. Of course, it is very easy for honorable members who have not been through the process of sifting and inquiry to know all about the subject. I confess that I have not read the evidence taken by the Commission as carefully as the honorable member for Lang appears to have done. Not having read that evidence, I suppose that I am in a much better position to record an intelligent vote upon this proposal. I speak, therefore, only of information which has been conveyed to me by persons who know all about the subject, and who are interested in it from a commercial standpoint. All that information is in agreement upon the point of the standard which should be set up in connexion with the distillation of, say, rum, which is made from molasses. All&#39; the evidence which I have gathered goes to show that that rum cannot be cleared of its impurities at so low a degree as 35. In fact - to use the expression employed by the persons who spoke to me upon the subject - rum so distilled simply &#34;stinks,&#34; and the stink cannot be overcome. </para>

                            <para>- That is a very considerable difference, I admit, and to some extent it meets the objection which I have been urging. The fact that a higher degree eliminates impurities from the spirit is not questioned, and it is only the degree of rectification which is concerned in the argument. If we can eliminate these impurities by rectifying the spirits at a higher degree, it seems to me that we should do so. Then I am informed that rum is rarely more than six months old when it is sold in the markets of London. It is never kept longer than that period, and rarely so long. The argument is advanced that if in one of the great markets of the world a standard of. six months or under is observed in the sale and consumption of these liquors, it should afford some guide to us in prescribing the period during which they should be bonded here. Concerning the importation of this stuff, I am told that it would be almost impossible to ascertain the duration of the storage of rum. For instance, I am assured that no certificates are issued by the Excise Department in London, or at any of the other places oversea. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that. There seems to be something lacking which would permit of an easy identification of the age of spirit. I take it that the Minister only requires to be assured that spirit has been stored for the prescribed term. If he can be made aware of that fact in a way which will not unduly interfere with business, so much the better. At present there does not seem to be any facile means of ascertaining how long spirit has been actually stored. In the absence of any certificate from the Excise Department at Home the only other course for the Minister to adopt would be to accept a certificate from the distillers. Whether that could be done under a system of proper supervision, I do not know. I do not know how supervision can be applied to spirit which is produced in another part of the world. That is the difficulty in regard to the importation of these spirits under any circumstances, and under any system of classification. We want to be able to check the certificates which accompany them, and how that is to be done, seeing that there are no checks kept by the Excise Department at Home, is a problem which requires to be solved before we can determine the facts of the case as they apply to the period during which rum should be stored. However, these are matters of administration, and no doubt the Minister will look into them. I am glad to hear that he is in communication with the authorities at Home, with a view to ascertaining whether they have any better means for determining the age of spirits than we have. No doubt he will avail himself of the experience of the world if any such experience be available in the official quarters in which he is apparently seeking it. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable and learned member for Bendigo and the honorable member for Perth were of opinion, when I was speaking a few minutes ago, that I intended to propose an amendment to exclude rectified spirits from the provisions regarding maturity. The honorable member for Hindmarsh and I endeavoured to point out that those provisions were not required, but, at the same time, we do not object to their application. What we do wish is that their operation may be postponed for, say, two vintages. At present, there is not sufficient rectified spirit in stock to enable the law to be complied with, and the result would be that the making of blended brandy, composed partly of pure grape spirit, would cease. We desire a period of grace to enable manufacturers to comply with the Act. The vignerons have first to obtain a vintage, and then to keep the wine in stock for two years, so that the immediate application of the maturity conditions would be harsh in view of the fact that, as I have said, there is not sufficient wine in stock to enable blending to be carried on. The definition clause ought to be amended. We ought to exempt from the operation of the second paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 3 Australian wine brandy which, before some date to be prescribed, is cleared from the Customs or entered for home consumption as .provided in clause 1 1 . Clause 1 1 prescribes the 1st March, 1907, as the date from which the maturity condition shall apply. I should like the date in the case of Australian blended wine brandy to be extended for two years after March, 1907; but as there might be some objection to such a long postponement, I suggest that we should fix upon 1 st March, 1908, as the date from which this provision shall apply. I am in doubt as to whether we should also amend the definition of &#34;Australian standard brandy.&#34; I believe that in South Australia, at all events, the pot-still brandy is kept until it has matured for two years and upwards, and that there may Be in stock sufficient of that spirit to enable this provision to at once come into operation, so far as Australian standard brandy is concerned. We ought to amend the provision in regard to Australian blended wine brand v, and if it be found that a mistake has been made in not amending the definition &#34;clause in regard to Australian standard brandy, we may later on amend it in a similar way. It has not been clearly stated, but I believe that there is no objection to &#34;the provision as to maturity applying at once to the Australian standard brandy. All the distillers, whom I have met, desire that every condition considered necessary by the Government to insure the proper maturing of brandy shall be applied, but that a reasonable date on which the .maturity conditions shall come into force should be fixed. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the amendment will be rejected. The name embodied in the Bill is a typically suggestive and comprehensive one. It was well considered, and conveys an idea as to what a true brandy is. On the other hand, the words proposed to be substituted would suggest that there might be a brandy other than grape wine brandy. </para>

                        <para>- There is a possibility that the amendment, if adopted, might give rise to misapprehension. All consumers of brandy do not know what are its constituents, and T dare say .that the average user is not aware that it is distilled from the grape. I do not think that it is very material whether we retain the clause as it stands or agree to the amendment, but it is just possible that the use of the term proposed on behalf of the honorable member for Grampians might lead to confusion. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not object to the amendment, which will postpone the application of the two years&#39; maturity condition to Australian blended wine brandy until 1st March, 1908 ; but in view of the previous discussion I would object to the postponement of the condition in regard to Australian standard brandy. That brandy is composed of pot-still spirit containing volatile elements that can only be worked off by the maturing of the spirit. The point, however, must be raised as to whether, if this amendment be made with reference to Australian blended wine brandy, we ought not also to grant a similar postponement of the maturity condition in respect to Australian blended whisky. I give notice that at the proper stage I shall move such an amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to put before the Committee an expert opinion in regard to the advantage of maturing spirits of all classes which I had intended to quote when speaking on the second reading ; but the volume was not then available. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Nettleton, F.C.S., an authority of very considerable weight, at page 236 of a work which is, I believe, regarded as the principal exposition of the methods of manufacturing spirits in the United Kingdom, the processes of maturing, and the general regulations connected with Excise and Customs, says - </para>

                        <para>In pot still whiskies the by-products range from 40 to 80 grains per proof gallon, the variations in quantity and quality within these narrow limits, vary considerably affecting their flavour. In patent-still spirit or whisky, scarcely any by-product other than propyl alcohol is collected. Both descriptions of spirit, however, are, so far as the consumer&#39;s practical tests are applied, decidedly improved by storage in good wine casks. </para>

                    <para>He proceeds to explain what I have already tried to impress upon honorable members, that although the chemical processes and changes which take place are not very well understood, practical experience shows that it is of advantage to mature spirits by storage in wood. Like the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, I have no objection to the modification proposed by the honorable and learned member for Angas, in view of the custom existing in some of the States which has been recognised as legal and proper, on the understanding that the concession is to apply only for a limited period. </para>

                        <para>It has been found during the process of maturing spirits that some of the obnoxious constituents diminished in quantity. With brandy the proportion of furfural diminished with age, and the proportion of esters, and of higher alcohols increased. This was supposed to be due to the formation of esters of a peculiar kind, from which old spirit obtained its aroma. From a scientific point of view, the ageing of spirits improved them by removing some of the deleterious constituents, but it was difficult to say to which of the esters or of the higher alcohols the beneficial effects of spirit were due. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like the Committee to take into consideration the question whether it is advisable to require the maturing of all spirits for a period of two years, or whether extra time should not be given. I have already issued instructions that the provision with regard to spirits being matured in wood for two years shall be suspended until 28th February, 1907. Perhaps we can deal with the matter to which I have referred by inserting a proviso to the effect that the clause shall not apply until the 1st January, 1908, to gin, Geneva, Hollands, schnapps or liqueurs. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think it very much matters whether or not the suggested proviso is inserted in this clause in order to bring the provisions with regard to imported spirits into line with those relating to locally-manufactured spirits. This clause relates to the spirits of the whole world, and surely there cannot be any such dearth of two-year old spirits as to lead to a suspension of importations. With our own manufacturers, the case is different, because they have not the material upon which to operate. It is already provided that the clause shall not come into operation until the 28th February, 1907, and that seems to me to get over the difficulty with regard to shipments on the way to Australia. The notice to shippers and others should surely be sufficient, and I do not see why we should go beyond what we have already done. It is provided that clause 11 shall not apply to spirits which were subject to the control of the Customs on the 17 th August last, and which are entered for home consumption before the 1st March, 1907. It was not considered necessary to make a similar provision with regard to imported spirits, and it seems to me to be unnecessary to insert the amendment proposed by the Minister. The only question is as to whether we should make any provision for spirits now in bond which have not been matured in wood for two years. Personally, I do not think there is any necessity to amend the clause. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to know whether the Minister has considered the representations made during the debate on the spirit duties that gin is a spirit which deteriorates rather than improves with age. It is said that whatever medicinal properties it possesses are due to the juniper berries from which the spirit is popularly supposed to be distilled. But I understand that the juice of the juniper is added to the spirit after distillation. It has been stated that the sooner gin goes into consumption the better it is for medicinal purposes. It is well that this matter should be considered so that we may avoid making a blunder. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to correct the misapprehension under which the honorable member for Lang appears to be labouring. I would point out to him that gin is not distilled from juniper berries, but is merely a highly-rectified spirit produced largely from potatoes, and very bad potatoes at that, and flavoured with juniper. I should be very pleased to learn the name of the authority from whom the honorable member for Lang learnt that the immediate consumption of the article is to be recommended. Immediate consumption might be necessary to prevent the identification of the spirit. </para>

                            <para>- I propose an extension of time only in the case of Australian blended wine brandy and Australian blended whisky. My proposal would have the effect of bringing the enacting clause into line with the definition. In its present form, the clause refers to spirits which are subject to the control of the Customs Department. That portion of it must be eliminated, because - as I have already pointed out - some of the wine in relation to which the exemption is proposed will be the wine of the next vintage, which cannot possibly yet be subject to the control of the Customs. </para>

I am of opinion that there is a considerable future in Australia for the production of liqueurs. If we are going, to relax the condition relating to the maturing of spirits, I see no reason why it should not be relaxed all round. In my judgment, it is a distinctly retrograde step, but I like to be <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> logical as possible, and if we grant an extension in the case of two classes of spirits, I think that other spirits which are upon the same footing as regards their manufacture should be treated in a similarway. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not quite follow the honorable and learned member for Angas in his proposal. I think the clear intention of the provisions of the Excise Act is that spirits shall not be allowed to pass into consumption until they have been matured in wood for a period of two years. I can quite understand the provision which is embodied in clause 10, that some little extension of time should be allowed for the clearance of imported spirits, and that Australian spirits, which have already been distilled, should be permitted to pass into consumption under similar conditions. But to allow spirits which have not yet been distilled to pass into consumption in less than two years was never contemplated by honorable members. </para>

I would point out to him that the amendment would not apply to Australian standard brandy. but simply to the rectified spirits, which enter into blends, and which it is urged do not improve with age. </para>

                        <para>.- I would prefer to grant an extension of time rather than agree to the abolition of the condition relating to the maturing of spirits. The Minister might,&#39; therefore, consider whether, in the case of grape spirit, he will extend the provision relating to the maturity of spirit till March, 1908, as suggested by the honorable and learned member for Angas. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that this clause contains a provision which is not altogether in harmony with the Commerce Act. It provides that if, after examining a sample of any spirits which are under the control of the Customs, a Commonwealth analyst certifies that they are of an inferior quality, and unsuitable for human consumption, the Minister &#34; may &#34; permit them to be exported. It seems to me that under the clause as it stands, a firm might import a quantity of unsuitable spirit, and export it as an Australian production. </para>

I referred to the matter on moving the second reading of the Bill, and mentioned that not long ago a process was discovered by which the methylation may be removed, and that spirits , so treated can then be sold as being pure. The object of this clause is to safeguard the revenue to a greater extent than it has been, and it will be difficult to evade the regulations under it. </para>

                        <para>. - I am glad that the Minister has inserted in the Bill a provision which imposes a penalty on any person who may sell or has in his possession illicit methylated spirits, or any article of food or drink, or any scent, essence, tincture, or medicine, containing methylated spirits; but I should like to know whether such a provision can be enforced if enacted by Parliament. If it can, we have power to pass similar enactments in regard to other spirit.

                        <para>Messrs. W. P. Auld and Sons forwarded sample of whisky which had been purchased by them at the Agricultural Show ground. The whisky was in a bottle labelled &#34; Buchanan&#39;s House of Commons whisky.&#34; The writers had no hesitation in pronouncing the spirit to be South Australian spirit made from grapes. It was pointed out that there was a great deal of this false trading being carried on in and around Adelaide, and the board&#39;s co-operation was asked for in endeavouring to put an end to such a &#34; disgraceful practice.&#34; To be informed that the board had for some )&#39;ears been cognizant of the practice of selling colonial spirit as imported, but on account of the importation of bulk spirit, capsules, corks, and labels, by some importers, and the legal difficulties that had arisen in connexion with prosecutions by this board, under present legislation, the board felt unable to take any useful action in the matter. </para>

                    <para class="block">I referred to this matter here about three years ago, suggesting that the Minister should, under section 51 of the Customs Act, prohibit the importation of capsules and labels. It was objected that if their importation was prohibited, they would be made and printed here; but I pointed out that if that were made an offence, the fear of detection would act -as a deterrent, and suggested that it might be made compulsory to bottle imported spirit in bond. If that were done, it would prevent good spirit from being blended with cheap spirit, on which a lesser duty had been paid. I could not, however, persuade the Government to do anything in the matter, and, therefore, bring it under the attention of the Minister once more. Again and again in the South Australian Courts have cases been brought for the sale of spirit under proof; but it has been held that once spirit has passed through the Customs, the Commonwealth Government cannot interfere with its sale. The question has been raised before the Full Court of South Australia, whose judgment is given in the following report : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In the Full Court judgment was delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Homburg in <inline font-style="italic">Robinson</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Hall,</inline> which was a special case reserved by the Police Court of Adelaide with respect to the sale of liquors under a certain degree of proof strength The results of the judgments suggest that the law is in an unsatisfactory state, from the public point of view. There are at present two statutes in existence which deal with the question of the sale of liquor under proof. Both judges held that the State law could not be enforced because the only person who could lay informations under it was the State Collector of Customs, whose office had been abolished by the establishment of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Homburg, however, went further than this, and gave expression to the startling decision that in legislating with regard to the sale of spirits within the State, the Commonwealth had exceeded its powers under the Constitution, and therefore that part of the Commonwealth Act which dealt with this matter is invalid. The effect of the decision of the Full Court is that the State law cannot be enforced, and that the Commonwealth law dealing with this matter is invalid. In these circumstances, it appears that there are no provisions of any Distillation Act which govern and regulate the strength at which spirits are to be sold to the public in South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- In many cases, there is no control once spirit has passed through the Customs House. Consequently good spirit is often adulterated with poor spirit, on which less duty has been paid, so that the Commonwealth loses revenue, and the public is supplied with an article which is not much better than poison. I should like the Minister to explain how he intends to enforce his provision. </para>

                        <para>.- In my opinion the clause should be amended. It provides that any person selling, or having in his possession, illicit methylated spirit or any article of food or drink, or any scent, essence, tincture, or medicine containing methylated spirit shall be liable to a fine of &#163;100. It seems to me that this provision, if not&#39; amended, might operate harshly and unjustly. A young lady who buys or is given a bottle of scent cannot reasonably be expected to know what it contains. But, if it contained methylated spirit, she would be liable,, under the clause, to a penalty, of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> I suggest the insertion of the word &#34;knowingly &#34; in the first line of the clause, so that it shall read &#34; a person shall not knowingly sell or have in his possession.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- That amendment may open a very wide door. We must be very strict, as otherwise we cannot prevent the illicit use of methylated spirit. It seems to me that the person proceeded against should at least have to prove that he did not know that he was selling, or that he had in his possession, methylated spirit. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that there are provisions in the Customs Act, and also in the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, to much the same effect as that which the honorable member for Lang desires to insert. The honorable member for Hindmarsh raised a question as to our power to pass this legislation. When the Distillation Act was under discussion, two or three years ago, I and other honorable members expressed doubt as to our power to prescribe certain standards of purity and strength for wine .and spirits, except for the purpose of checking the collection of duties. Although we have power to prescribe certain standards of purity, as we have done in the Excise Act, I doubt very much whether we &#34;can go beyond that. This Bill contains provisions that have nothing to do with the collection of duties, and the same remark applies to the Distillation Act. In one case, in South Australia, our power to prescribe certain standards that were not required for the collection of duties was questioned. I do not think that that point was absolutely decided, because another question was raised. The information had to be laid by the State Collector of Customs under the State Act, and the question was whether the State Act had not been abrogated by the Commonwealth Distillation Act. It was decided that there was no Collector of Customs appointed by the State, inasmuch as the State Collector had been superseded by the Commonwealth officer. I argued on, a previous occasion that our legislation was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> in so far as it exceeded our power to prescribe standards required to enable us to protect the revenue. I _ think that the Attorney-General, as a private member, then took a similar view. The difficulty could best be overcome by the States stepping in and passing an Act under which information could be laid by someone else, or by the Common- wealth laying an information under some Commonwealth Act. I think that our legislation is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> to the extent I have indicated, and no doubt the question will be raised at the very first opportunity. </para>

                            <para>- I was pointing out that at the two Federal elections which have taken place, although I was engaged in three-cornered fights, I defeated both the protectionist candidate and the official Labour candidate by one of the largest majorities obtained in the Commonwealth. It cannot, therefore, be urged that my action on the present occasion is prompted by personal considerations, I could quite understand the action of the Government in fighting for majority rule if they forced a majority of the electors to vote. If they submitted a scheme of compulsory voting I could quite appreciate their action in bringing forward this measure. Personally, I believe that in the very near future the citizens of Australia will be compelled to respect the Electoral Act just as they are obliged to respect any other Statute. The Minister of Home Affairs &#34;does not propose that the Bill under consideration shall apply to the elections for the Senate. He is content to prescribe one form of ballot paper for the election of representatives to this House, and another form for the election of members to the Senate. I am not one of those who believe that the electors would be likely to be &#34; fogged &#39; &#39; at the poll by the adoption of a system of preferential voting, but I do say that the use of two different systems will unquestionably cause confusion, and perhaps arouse their suspicion. The Minister of Home Affairs, in moving the second reading of the measure, stated that the present system of voting had failed, so far as majority representation is concerned, only in thirteen constituencies throughout the Commonwealth - that two of these electorates were to be found in Tasmania, two in Queensland, and nine in Victoria. The existing system has not resulted in the return of any representative to this House upon a minority vote, either from New South Wales, South Australia, or Western Australia. Consequently this Bill has been drafted in the interests of Victoria alone. </para>

                            <para>- It is all very well for the Minister to say that. I hold that by the introduction of the optional system of preferential voting the Ministry are considering only the interests of Victoria. At the last general election, I find that of the persons who were entitled to vote, only 47 per cent. exercised the franchise in New South Wales, only 51 per cent. in Victoria, only 54 per cent, in Queensland, only 32 per cent. in South Australia, only 28 per cent. in Western Australia, and only 45 per cent. in, Tasmania. That is a pitiful picture to put before the country. Any political party is materially benefited by organization, and we all recognise that the best organized political force in Australia is the Labour Party. I am firmly of opinion that in the very near future measures will have to be taken to compel the electors to act up to their citizen responsibilities. At the general election, which was held in 1901, there were only four constituencies, in New South Wales which returned representatives to this Parliament upon minority votes. In Victoria, however, there were nine such constituencies - the same mystical nine that were referred to by the Minister of Home Affairs. In those days we heard nothing from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper or from the leader of the present Government upon the defects of the existing system. If it be wrong to-day, it was wrong then. In Queensland and South Australia a system of single electorates has prevailed, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> were among those who secured an absolute majority. A similar condition existed in Tasmania, but in the return before me no particulars are supplied with respect to the position in Western Australia. I wish to emphasize the fact that this Bill does not provide for compulsory voting, and that the exercise of the contingent vote will be purely optional. If the Government consider that the contingent vote would lead to majority rule, surely they should have proposed that it should be compulsory. The weak spot in this Bill is that, if it were passed, a well-organized force, such as the Labour Party, would advise its supporters not to exercise their right to cast a contingent vote. </para>

                            <para>- But under this Bill it will not be compulsory. A well-organized, well-disciplined force, like the Labour Party, would simply direct its supporters to exercise only their primary votes. In this way, the Bill would lead to what the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which strongly supports it, has described as clique or fancy voting. The honorable member for Kennedy has told us that the contingent voting system is not availed of in Queensland. In December, 1902. the Barton Government introduced an Electoral Bill providing for a system of proportional or contingent voting,- which was to be compulsory, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> a representative of Queensland, when discussing that Bill, said that the Queensland contingent voting system had been an absolute failure. On the 17 th June, 1902, the honorable member for Bland, in dealing with the same measure, said the contingent vote would prove confusing to the electors. The honorable member for Hume, who was then Minister of Home Affairs, urged, on his own initiative, that the proposal in regard to the contingent or proportional vote should be negatived. He said that he had made a calculation, and as he found that the proposed system was most confusing, he recommended the Committee to reject it. </para>

                            <para>- Compulsory voting. The Minister of Home Affairs must be aware that many schemes have been propounded to secure effective voting power. When the Electoral Bill providing for the proportional or contingent vote was before the Senate in 1902, the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which to-day is the most powerful press advocate of this measure, and is publishing articles by Professor Nanson in support of it, held his scheme up to opprobrium. To-day it is employing Professor Nanson to write articles in support of a system which only a few years ago it violently opposed. I propose now to quote from an article published in that journal in February, 1902. On that occasion it referred in complimentary terms to the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who opposed the contingent voting system and the proportional system generally. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> pointed out the weakness of the Government proposal, and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> applauded his action.. It also referred to the opinion expressed by John Bright in the following terms: - </para>

                        <para>John Bright denounced the Hare system as one that &#34; shows mistrust of the people,&#34; and as a fad which seeks to make Parliament &#34; a political photograph &#34; of the nation in order that fads, fancies, and follies may have their representation in the House of Parliament. </para>
                        <para>Bright may have been exaggerating a little when he said that proportional representation is designed to call into being Parliaments of political lunatics, but it cannot be denied that in making electorates &#34; constituencies of opinion,&#34; instead of persons, the system encourages the formation of Legislatures fit only to debate and argue abstract theories and not to make laws on subjects which are ripe in the popular intelligence. </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe that statement focuses the present position. Parliament is not only a deliberative, but a legislative and governing, body. We come here not only to debate fads, theories, schemes, or principles, but to carry legislation and to control the public affairs of the Commonwealth. I can well understand any far-seeing man asserting that, if this work is to be properly carried out, we must have majority representation. The Right Honorable Richard Seddon was always an advocate of compulsory voting, and I believe that it was on his initiative that the New Zealand Legislature passed a law under which the names of electors who fail to record their votes at an election are struck off the roll. Their failure to exercise their right is construed as showing that they are either dead or have left the district. Their names are struck off the rolls &#39;Unless the returning officer is presented with a medical&#39; certificate showing that they were unable to vote. </para>

                            <para>- Neither the police nor any other officials take steps to immediately place them on the rolls, unless they make personal application. The citizens themselves must take action. I have often thought that if, instead of requiring the police to prepare voters&#39; lists, we made it compulsory for the electors to register their names within a certain period, we should secure more complete rolls, and avoid much expenditure. The honorable member for Yarra may shake has head, but I feel; confident that that system would prove most effective. </para>

                            <para>- Whenever I refer to proportional representation the Minister mentions the names of Clark, Droop, or Gregory. He forgets to tell the House that the schemes of those men were all based on the contingent voting system, and that it was said that contingent voting would lead to great difficulty and confusion. I am not here to demonstrate a problem in higher mathematics - I am not here to explain either the Hare-Spence, Gregory, or Nanson system. If I were I should require a blackboard and a piece of chalk. It would be easier for me to present the Treasurer with a treatise on the differential calculus than it would be for me to give him a clear exposition of these several schemes. We cannot deal with electors as we can with a formula in mathematics. Every candidate has a personal as well as a political influence. My first reason for moving this amendment is that a general election is imminent, and that there is consequently not sufficient time for the consideration of the measure, or <inline font-style="italic">to make the</inline> necessary electoral arrangements if it becomes law. I do not say that the people would be unable to understand this system if it were used at the next general election. I should not cast such a reflection on electors who went to the poll. If I did I could not hold that the electors were competent to deal with the many complex problems of legislation. I do say. however, that since they have been accustomed in most of the States for years to cast only a primary vote, the system proposed under this Bill would be somewhat novel to them. The electors are to be presented with two different ballot-papers, one for the election of senators, framed according to a system which they understand, and the other for the election of members of the House of Representatives, which must be marked with the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on according to the order of preference. This will create confusion, and, moreover, will give an advantage to organized voters. In Queensland, we are told, the preferential system is rarely used, even the Minister of Home Affairs having admitted that it has affected only five elections in fourteen years. The Labour members who represent that State say that the people do not use the preferential system, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has spoken of it as confusing. In Tasmania, a more definite system of proportional voting, embodying the contingent principle, and making it compulsory, was tried, but, after a trial extending over two State elections and one Federal election, they went back to a simpler arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable gentleman was moving the second reading, the honorable member for North Sydney asked him why he did not propose to apply the principle to the election of senators, and his reply was that he would be glad to do so if the Senate could find time to consider and agree to such an arrangement. But surely the concurrence of the S&#39;enate will be asked in reference to the proposal now before us, and that will take time. I read the Minister&#39;s speech very closely, and it seemed to me that it contained the tacit admission that we have not time to deal properly with the measure this session. Another reason why we should not pass the second reading is that there is not sufficient time within which&#39; to make the arrangements necessary to bring its &#39;provisions into operation. Some honorable members are feigning a burning desire to go before their constituents, and are asking every day when is the election to be. I have been in Parliament for many years, but I have never known honorable members to be really desirous of going before their constituents. It seems to me that those who had the narrowest majorities at the last election are apparently the most eager to submit themselves for re-election. </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly how I feel. In reply to these inquiries, the Minister of Home Affairs has said that the elections cannot take place before the 21st November, because his officers cannot have everything in readiness at an earlier date. The returning officers are amateurs, who are most anxious not to violate our complicated electoral law bv any oversight or any misunderstanding of its provisions, and if they are asked to make themselves acquainted with an entirely new system, and to carry out the preparations and to give the instructions necessary for bringing it into operation, the elections will have to be put off until a later time. My next objection to the Bill is that its provisions are crude and incomplete. &#39; They must be incomplete so long as they remain optional. If contingent voting would prevent minority rule, and bring about majority rule, it must be made compulsory. Is this measure to be dealt with by the Government as they have dealt with all their other measures? They have not yet submitted a Bill which they have not had to seriously amend; in many cases to such an extent as to entirely alter its complexion. After the members of the Opposition have pointed out blemishes in and objections to a measure, we have had the Attorney-General or some other Minister, as in the case of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, bringing down sheaves of amendments, completely altering its structure. Is that course to be taken in regard to this Bill? Although the Government appear now to be so much in favour&#93; of majority rule, and assert that their proposals are made in order to secure it, they brought forward no measure of this kind in 1902, when they were in power. Dotes the Minister intend now to make the contingent system compulsory? If he does not, leaving it optional, the measure will be incomplete, while, if he does, the Opposition will have the right to any credit that may exist in connexion with it, although its provisions will still be as crude as any which could well be presented to a legislative body. All the able political thinkers who have dealt with this subject favour the compulsory and not the optional adoption of the system. Another objection I have to the Bill is, that it makes no provision for increasing the number of votes polled, or for securing effective voting. Any Government honestly wishing to secure majority rule should make provision for increasing the total number of votes polled. </para>

                    <para class="block">Bill, and to fight for them on the motion for the second reading, although all constitutional authorities say that the principles of a measure should be stood by at this stage. The real desire of the Ministry is to secure an advantage for their party in connexion with the Victorian elections. They ask us not to strike a hard blow at this stage ; tout are they really studying the interests of the electors&#39;? I should be willing to assist in bringing; about the polling- of a larger number of votes, and in securing effective voting, because it is the duty of every public man to do so, but the Government are taking no steps in that direction. Their proposals will not get rid of minority representation, because organizations will direct their members not to use the contingent vote. That will at once provide for plumping, a system which was deliberately rejected when the electoral laws were under consideration before. I cannot believe that even those who have fathered this measure desire that it shall remain in force after the next general election. It is intended to be used upon that occasion alone. It is all very well for the Minister of Home Affairs to tell me that I am suspicious, but, under the circumstances, I cannot be otherwise. Three years ago the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> expressed itself very strongly against the adoption of a much superior system of voting, and now they are enlisting the assistance of Professor Nanson in, advocating the present faulty scheme. The scheme submitted to us is an abortion- I am sure that the Labour Party do not want to introduce compulsory voting. They would not adopt any system which would compel the Deakinites or the Reidites to go to the poll and bring about their discomfiture, whilst I could not support an optional system of preferential voting which would place undue power in the hands of the organized forces of labour. I feel perfectly sure that the measure is not expected to operate in New .South Wales, but that the Ministry have their eyes upon nine seats in Victoria, two in Tasmania, and two in Queensland, which will be affected by the adoption of the preferential voting system. This cannot be called a Commonwealth measure, because it would be only partial in its operation. On a former occasion the Minister of Trade and Customs advised the House to throw out a similar proposal, because he could not understand it. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which, like al&#93; the other principal papers of Australia, is verv. creditably conducted - I do not speak of it from a party point of view, but as a literary production - recently took the trouble to give illustrations of the manner in which the proposed new system would work out. It published several sets of figures, which, in the main, were correct ; but in the second or third illustration a mistake of 100 votes was made. When the system is so complex that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> becomes fogged, how can we expect the average returning officer or  deputy  returning officer to understand it? It would not be fair to call upon our electoral officers to introduce a new system of voting upon such very short notice. If they were called upon to undertake such an unreasonably heavy task, grievous, blunders would be inevitable, and the public would be bewildered. At the first Federal election the electors were invited to vote by striking out the names of the candidates for whom they did not desire to vote. At the next election they were told that they must put a cross against the name of the candidate they preferred, and now they are told that they are to put a figure against the name of each candidate to indicate the order of their preference. There are thousands of persons who, with a view to protect their own privileges, and with other objects in view, will fail to indicate the order of their preference, and the conditions under which the polling is carried on will be rendered more irritating than ever. The more trouble that is involved so far as the electors are concerned, the smaller our polls will become, whereas it should be our endeavour to make our arrangements for recording votes as simple as possible. We should also aim at announcing the results of the elections without undue delay. I do not, therefore, believe in the adoption of complicated systems of voting. The Minister of Home Affairs tells us that the proposed new system cannot be applied to the Senate, but I contend that there is more) reason why it should be applied to the Senate elections than to those for the return of members to this House. In New South Wales, there will be at least fifteen candidates for three vacancies iri the Senate, and electors should, in that case, if in any, have an opportunity to express their preference. Under the present system, they have either to cast a block vote for those who are nominated by the party to which they belong, or have to select one or two men whom they like, and others whom they do not like. </para>

                            <para>- A man should vote for principles and not upon personal grounds. The honorable member for Maranoa is not known all over Queensland. People know his name, however, and they vote for him as a representative of the party to which he belongs. It is the same in New South Wales. I do not pretend that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who had 189,000 votes recorded in his favour, at the last Federal election, obtained that very large record on the strength of his own personality and his own merits. He- was on the party ticket, and it was the power of the party that secured him such large support. I have no doubt that similar results will be brought about in Victoria if the newspapers arrange to support any particular group of candidates, or the Protectionist Association take a similar step. There is much more reason why we should adopt the preferential voting system in connexion with the Senate elections, because in that case it would have a distinct tendency towards the destruction of minority rule. If the electors are to express their preference, it should be made compulsory for them to do so. I believe that the Government have introduced this measure for the protection of their own political lives, and I blame them for thinking that we are such fools as not to see through their manoeuvre. They are struggling for their political existence. </para>

                            <para>- I have shown that none of the seats in that State would be affected, but that the measure would be effective mainly in Victoria. If the Government would only admit that their object was as I have indicated, we &#39;could more, readily understand the change of front on the part of .their principal press supporter, which, upon a former occasion, whipped with scorpions a much better proposal. I have endeavoured to show that the new system would play into the hands of well organised political bodies, and although I hope to see the day when the polls at election time will be larger than at present, and when majority; rule will obtain, I cannot support the measure now before us. I have no desire, as has been suggested, to sand-bag the Bill, but I have given unreasons, which, I think, are sufficiently cogent, for desiring that it should be set aside, and that a thoroughly scientific and up-to-date proposal should be submitted next session. </para>

                        <para>.- The chief force of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Dalley appears to lie in paragraph 1 of his proposal. Personally, I am never much impressed by a series of amendments upon the motion for the second reading of a Bill, because they introduce so many matters which may lead to discussion, and thus induce honorable members to be led away from the consideration of the main question. There is, however, some force in paragraph 1 of the amendment, because it is an extraordinary circumstance that, although we passed an Electoral Act in 1905, when the question of the amendment of our electoral law was raised on a somewhat elaborate scale, not a word was then said regarding the imperfect working of the present system. That was less than a year ago. At that time, we passed a fairly comprehensive Electoral Act, the scope of which was almost as great as the principal Act itself, but not a single word was uttered concerning the necessity for an amendment of the law in the direction which is now indicated, and no hint was given that the single electorate system was working so badly that it was deemed necessary to apply a corrective to its acknowledged evils. So fair as one can say so without a breach of the respect due to our statutory laws, I certainly think that that system is unsatisfactory. Under our Constitution, we are required to undertake a periodical rearrangement of our electoral districts.- To provide for the shifting of population, we are required to have a shuffling of the constituencies, which, according to one of the reports presented to the United States S&#39;enate, &#34; reduces electorates to a mere fortuitous concourse of atoms.&#34; We cannot overcome that difficulty, because it is one of the results of that section of our Constitution which provides for a periodic re-apportionment of political representation as population changes. But the other evil, that attaching to the single electorate members, can be overcome. It is as 01 corrective of that evil that this Bill has been introduced. That it would work all right, I have no doubt whatever. In Germany, and also in Sweden, the same system was introduced, and, notwithstanding the vaticinations that it would break down, it has worked excellently. It has also been tried in Tasmania, where, so far as my reading goes, it was very popular. Why it has not been continued I cannot explain ; only recently I have heard representatives of Tasmania speak well of it. I read the results of two elections which were held in that State under the contingent-voting system, and I know that they were favorable to it. There were very few informal votes cast - in fact, I do rot think that the percentage of such votes was greater than that cast under our existing system. </para>

                            <para>- I think that ih; honorable member is correct. Moreover, the result of the elections was quickly known. In Belgium the elector is allowed to make use of a pre-arranged system of preference ; the system works excellently there, and it has produced a fair approximation to a proper proportion between the number of representatives returned to Parliament and the state of parties in the country - a far greater approximation to that ideal than had ever been obtained in Belgium, and which we all desire to achieve. Though the scrutiny of the votes runs into tremendous numbers, the work has been done expeditiously. In France, the Chamber of Deputies has asked that the system of proportional representation which was in vogue in Belgium shall be adopted. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that. If the &#39;honorable member will be patient, I shall have a few words to say against the Bill presently. The theory that the system of preferential voting would break down in practice has not been supported by experience. What the Government propose is merely a corrective to the acknowledged evils of the single member system. The true cure, however, is to be found in the abolition of that system, and the adoption of a system of proportional representation. My objection to this Bill is that at the end of the session, and when we are within two months of a general election, we ought not to introduce a new method of voting without even proceeding upon radical lines - -without doing more than patching up a bad system. Undoubtedly the adoption of the system outlined in this Bill would lead to confusion in the Electoral Department. It would also to some extent confuse the electors, who are no more the embodiment of human wisdom than are members of Parliament. The single member system is a bad one, because to a large extent the result of an election is left to chance, inasmuch as it is dependent upon the apportionment of parties throughout the electoral districts, and upon the cohesion of parties within those districts. It is possible for parties to be so distributed throughout the State that there may be a very small majority of a particular party in a majority or all of the districts. We mav thus achieve one of the most vicious ends at which we could aim, namely, pure majority representation. So far as honorable members aim at that result, they are aiming at the very opposite of a democracy. Democratic government does not consist in the representation only of a majority, but in the representation of parties in accordance with their strength. It does seek, however, to give effect to majority rule after the voice of all fairly large parties has been heard. It is a prostitution of the ideal of democratic government to say that it must secure absolute majority rule in every constituency throughout the Commonwealth. In order to get rid of the possibility of minority rule, outside bodies - and I am not speaking of one political party only - are obliged to select candidates to represent them. What is the result ? Undoubtedly the effect is to narrow political life, and to bring the expression of political opinion from the glare of publicity v, where men are checked by opinions not altogether assumed for party purposes, to small committees or parties, these committees to a certain extent being worked, perhaps, by still smaller committees. The biggest electorates in America are ruled by small committees, which select the candidates to be nominated. In many cases the final nomination depends upon the &#34;boss&#34; of these committees. The result is a parody of representative government. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. That is what we are coming to under the caucus system ; and I am not using that term in the restrictive sense in whch it is usually applied to the Labour Party. Under it men are compelled to degrade their moral fibre, and to kow-tow to small committees, in order to secure the privilege of appearing upon the hustings with some prospect of success. That is one of the acknowledged evils of the single member system. The indirect result is to compel&#39; men to do that class of political touting which, even in the case of Ministries, is too often successful, in order to obtain permission to state their honest convictions upon the public platforms of the country. That is the position which obtains in America. In a report which was presented to the American Senate upon the working of the single member system, it is declared that men who were not willing to sacrifice their own judgment and conscience to the behest of party. and to become the servile echo of those who are their inferiors in knowledge, do not allow their names to be submitted as candidates for Congress or the Legislature, as it is certain that they -would be defeated. John Stuart Mill puts the true ideal thus - </para>

                            <para>- He desired to introduce the system of proportional representation as it was advocated by Leonard Courtney and bv various parties in Australia, and which was so clearly expounded by a woman of very great brains and patriotism in South Australia - I refer to Miss Spence. When we find men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Fawcett strongly advocating it, and talking of the fetish of majority rule as being diametrically opposed to the first principle of democracy, which is representation in .proportion to numbers, we ought to feel called upon to fairly examine the merits of that system. I may add that in America there was one man who attempted to break down this caucus system - a man for whose memory we should entertain the greatest respect, because he was an individual of great ability and splendid patriotic instinct - I refer to the late Henry George. He stood for the Presidency of the United States as an independent candidate, who did not seek the support of any political party or caucus, and he polled a very large number of votes. A man of his popularity and great intellectual fibre, notwithstanding the splendid loyalty of his following, was unable to obtain the support of more than a fairly large minority of the electors. This shows how hopeless is the task of a man of independence who endeavours to break down the effect of the one-member system, and that of the caucus. The last election in Great Britain afforded conclusive evidence of the fact that the one-member system works badly. I remember reading two articles in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> - one of which I noted, and which I have looked up this afternoon - on the question of electoral methods. In one of these articles the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> reviewed the morality of the system of canvassing, and dealt with the necessity of placing a check on the evils arising from the working of the one-member system. It also dealt with the question of the second ballot and transfer vote, proposals for which are now embodied in this Bill. The point I wish to make is that the solution of the difficulty lies not in either of these systems, but in the introduction of a system of proportional representation. On the 27th of January last the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> wrote - </para>

                    <para>If I remember rightly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leonard</inline> Courtney, in 1884 or 1885, when the Gladstone </para>
                    <para class="block">Electoral Representation Bill and the Redistribution Bill were under discussion, gave a very fine exposition of the principle of this system. Gladstone then threw cold water on it, but his objection was levelled at the fact that it was an invasion of a longstanding, system which had, in effect, grown round the hearts and prejudices of the people of England. The <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> points out that at the last election, under the one member system, there were 529 contests in counties and boroughs, and that the. Ministerialists polled 2,818,878 votes, and secured the return of 396 members. The Unionists, on the other hand, polled 2,233,685. and secured a representation of only 129 members. In other words, the Liberals represent an average of 7,118 electors per member, whereas the Opposition represent an average of 17,315 per member. In Wales the Opposition, polled four-ninths of the electors. They secured a total of 52,637 votes, bud did not get a seat; whereas 90,000 Ministerialists won thirty seats. In Manchester ten Ministerialists were returned by 51,000 votes, as against 34,000 polled in opposition to them, whilst in Birmingham only eight Oppositionists were returned by 51,000 votes to 23,000 votes. This shows that, under the one-member system, we do not obtain ideal results. It is said by some that the irregularities in one district will counterbalance those of another; but that is not a proper system. Under it, large minorities are silenced in, the, one district, and their only consolation is that in another district a minority, holding the same views as they do, have secured representation. That is not such a result as justifies the continuance of the one-member system. My objections to this Bill are that it has been introduced when the general election is very near; that it is simply a proposal to patch up a bad system ; that it evades a question, which, ought to be thoroughly threshed out in this House ; and that we should have an amendment of the electoral law in a different direction. We should have an amendment providing for a system of proportional representation on the lines - subject, of course, to some changes to make it applicable to local conditions - that have been adopted in Belgium, the Swiss cantons, and also in Tasmania, where it seems to have been successful. For these reasons, if a division be taken, I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill, although I cannot allege as one of the grounds of my opposition that I think that the proposed machinery would not work effectually. I do not think that the actual calculations would not be properly made by the returning officers, or that there is a possibility of a great number of informal votes being cast. The experience of Tasmania shows that the number of informal votes would not be likely to be large, and we have no reason to assume that the remaining electors of the Commonwealth would display less intelligence. </para>

                            <para>- The proportional system of voting means the representation of minorities - it does not mean that minority representation shall prevail. I believe just as firmly as do the Government in majority representation ; but I hold that we shall not secure it bv passing this Bill. I wish to test the feeling of the House by moving am amendment. I should be very pleased if I were sent here as the representative of the majority of the electors in my constituency, and I think it is time we took action to bring about such a desirable state of affairs in relation to all the electorates of the Commonwealth. For reasons that I shall briefly give, I am opposed to the Bill ; but should the second reading be agreed to I shall move in Committee the insertion, of a new clause, to the effect that any elector who fails without just cause or excuse to vote at an election shall be fined 5s. It is unnecessary to provide a severe penalty ; but I do think that it is the duty of every citizen to take an interest in the candidature of those who, if successful, will have to make the laws under which he lives. A very small penalty would be sufficient to insure a large vote at every election. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, and I think I shall be able to show that the illustrations given by those newspapers correctly indicate what is likely to be the effect of the system. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> stated that there would be a possibility of a tie in some cases, and that the candidates in that event would draw lots ; but I notice that, even in such circumstances, the labour candidates, in the illustration, lost. To my mind, this shows precisely how the system would work. What would be the result of an election in which we had a labour candidate, a liberal-protectionist candidate, and a free-trade candidate? Under the contingent voting system, the supporters of the protectionist candidate would vote anti-Socialism, and would exercise their second choice in favour of the freetrade candidate. Although the labour candidate might be leading on the first count, and his supporters might have exercised their contingent vote, the supporters of the other two would not give a contingent vote for him, so that, if he failed to secure an absolute majority on the first count, he would necessarily be superseded by one of the other candidates. Is it reasonable to assume that if the system were optional I should cast my second vote for one of the other candidates in the circumstances to which I have referred? I do not wish to record a vote for any one with whose views I am not in sympathy. If the system is to be adopted, it certainly must be  compulsory  in order to be effective. In Queensland it has not been compulsory. The Minister said that in only five cases during the last fourteen years had it affected any election. I wish that the honor able and learned gentleman had mentioned them specifically, for I was under the impression that it had affected only two electorates. </para>

                            <para>- It would be most interesting to look up the cases in question, and to ascertain the effect of the voting. The illustration which the Minister drew from the Queensland system was not a happy one. There is another point worthy of consideration. Under the. Bill contingent voting is not to be compulsory, and I should like to know what will be the position if in any electorate very few contingent votes are polled, and no candidate secures an absolute majority? </para>

                            <para>- We are approaching this proposed vital change in our electoral system far too hurriedly. It is, moreover, in my opinion, a mistake to make it partial by applying it to the elections for one House only. We should, above all things, try to secure uniformity in our electoral methods, and apply the same system to the election of the two Houses. The statements which have been made as to what would happen if the provisions of the Bill were in force are very misleading. In today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> an attempt is made to show that a Labour representative would have been elected for Corangamite had the proposed system been in force at the time of the last election. But its illustration is, however, incomplete. There were four candidates for Corangamite. The successful candidate, who now represents the electorate here, was returned because of the support of 4,600 votes. The next candidate, Dunne, who, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> says, was a Labour candidate- </para>

                            <para>- I will assume, for the purposes of my argument, that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is right for once. Dunne polled 4,036 votes, Woods, the third candidate, who was said to be running on practically the same ticket as Dunne, 1,484 votes; and Wynne, the fourth candidate, 2,968 votes. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> comes to the conclusion that Dunne would have been returned under the preferential system, because Woods&#39; votes would have been added to his. Nothing, however, is said of Wynne&#39;s votes, which would probably have gone to the candidate at the head of the poll, giving him a large majority-over the combined second and third votes. In my opinion, the measure does not provide for majority representation, though it is possible to secure it, or something nearly approaching it, by the adoption of my amendment, if the Ministry are in earnest in regard to this matter, and will apply the same system to the elections for both; the Senate and the House of Representatives. I cannot support the amendment of the honorable member for Dalley, because it affirms that it is not expedient to proceed further with the Bill during the present session, while, in my opinion, it is not expedient to proceed with it at all. I wish to see a straight-out vote taken on the proposal of the Government. If I were a Ministerialist I should support the Bill, because that party has everything to gain from it, while the Labour Party has everything to lose where a Government and a Labour candidate are running for the same constituency. But, while I do not blame the Ministry for doing what they can in the interests of their, party, I should blame the Labour Party if they did not do all they could in their own interests. Before makin up my mind definitely as to my action regarding the second and third reading, I shall listen further to the discussion which may be expected to take place on the motion. , . </para>

                        <para>. I am opposed to the Bill. I cannot conceive why, if Ministers think that its provisions should be embodied in our electoral law, they did not make an attempt to embody them when an amending Bill was before us last session. Whatever the motive, it seems to me that the measure has been introduced as an afterthought. The Prime Minister, the other day, said, very unfairly, that the leader of the Opposition, now that he has been given an opportunity to provide for majority rule, runs away from it. That statement was not correct, to say the least of it. The right honorable gentleman has been travelling all over Australia, not to advocate the preferential system of voting now proposed, but to urge the electors to go to the polls of their own free will, and vote for the candidates whom they think will best represent them. Moreover, the Bil&#93; will not do what it professes to do. It by no means insures majority voting, and, if passed as it stands, most of the voting will be similar to that) which takes place now. If the measure becomes law as it stands, I shall ask those who will vote for me to place the figure, 1 against my name, and not to use their remaining preferential votes, and no doubt other candidates will give the same instruction. Therefore, the Prime Minister was altogether unfair in the reference which he made to the attitude of the leader of the Opposition. Even if the exercise of the preferential vote were made compulsory, the Bill would not insure majority representation. What would take place would be that the preferential votes would be cast, not in the real order of preference, but for the men whom the electors thought had the least chance of success, and we should not encourage that kind of voting. Under the compulsory contingent voting system, the friends of candidates .will try to get the electors to place the number 1 opposite the name of the man whom they support, and to allot their remaining preference to the weakest men, and the result may be, in some cases, the return, not of the man whom the majority think best fitted to represent them, but of the weakest man, whom probably a majority of the electors would not like to see elected. That sort of thing has occurred already. When voters are not allowed to plump, they sometimes vote first for the candidate whom they particularly wish to elect, and give their other votes to candidates whom they think have the least chance of success. While the Prime Minister, when speaking at Maryborough, denounced the Opposition for having wasted time, the charge is one which might justly be brought against the Government. I was willing to destroy the Bounties Bill because I do not believe in the bounty system, and therefore cannot rightly be accused of wasting time in the action which I took to secure my object; but the Government are deliberately wasting time in introducing a Bill which cannot effect its avowed purpose. Of course, the Government may try to get the Opposition to amend the measure so as to make it serviceable. The honorable member for Dalley says that he will vote for the preferential system if it is made compulsory. I, however, am opposed to the Bill, lock, stock, and barrel. There is a good deal to be said for proportionate voting, but it is useless to think of radically altering our electoral system at this stage in the life of the Parliament. Proportionate voting is, in my opinion, theoretically sound. I do not know why the Tasmanian system failed; but if the proportionate system can be carried into effect, it should have our support, as being likely to give every elector his proper share in determining the legislation of the country. The Minister of Home Affairs must know that the Bill will not achieve the object which he professes to have in view, namely, majority rule. It will be an absolute failure. We have heard some reference made to the fact that in Victoria the fewest number of voters returned the largest number of candidates to the Senate at the last election. If that be so, the evil which it is sought to cure exists in a still greater degree in connexion! with the Senate elections than with those of the House of Representatives. If preferential voting is to be permitted in connexion with the election of members to this Chamber, the same system should be followed in connexion with the Senate elections. If it is right in one case, it is right in the other. Ministers say that they wish to bring about majority rule, but they do not propose to apply to both Houses the system of voting which is expected to achieve that end. I realize that it would be difficult to educate the ejectors to the point of enabling them to understand the preferential voting system by the time that the general elections come on. If preferential voting were made compulsory, a large number of informal votes would be recorded. If it is not intended to make it compulsory for the electors to express their preference, the present system should not be interfered with. I shall vote for the amendment, and, if that is defeated. I shall oppose the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to vote against the amendment, because it is intended to kill the Bill. At the same time, I am absolutely opposed to the contingent voting system. Some fourteen or fifteen years ago that system was introduced into Queensland by the Honorable A. H. Barlow, the present Minister of Education in that State. The object was to &#34;dish&#34; the Labour Party; but the Act failed to achieve its purpose. The Labour Party in Queensland urged the voters not to have anything to do with the system, and that advice has been religiously followed. I see no reason why the ballot should be complicated in the manner proposed. It seems to me that the Bill is intended to add to the bewilderment of the electors. The contingent voting system was used in Queensland for the first time in 1893. The Honorable </para>

                            <para>H. Barlow, who was then a member of the Mcllwraith Ministry, urged his supporters to avail themselves of the preferential vote, but they did not do so. In one or two instances the new system operated to bring about the defeat of the Government candidate. The honorable member for Oxley, who for the first time submitted himself for election in South Brisbane, was, through the operation of the contingent voting system, defeated by a labour candidate. Therefore, instead of operating to the disadvantage of the Labour Party, as it was intended to do, the system, in that particular case, conferred an advantage upon them. I believe in majority rule in connexion with this Parliament and everywhere else. I see no reason why we should not follow the example of France, and have a second ballot. The system adopted in that country appears to me to be the simplest in the world. </para>

                            <para>- I do not! see anything in that to object to. Under the contingent voting system, it would be possible for one man who registered 500 votes out of 1,000 to be defeated upon the second or third count by one of three other candidates who had polled only 500 first votes between them. Therefore, the will of the majority would not be asserted. The man who polled 500 primary votes might, upon the third or fourth count, be rejected because no contingent votes were recorded in his favour. That has happened in some cases. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The honorable member for Hindmarsh put the matter very clearly. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> worked the whole thing out very nicely, but their calculations reminded me of the Irishman who insisted that he was still 5s. short in his wages, although he was assured that he had received a rise in his salary. I notice that, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> calculations, the Labour Party are defeated every time. That, in itself, would have been sufficient to show me that the whole scheme was .wrong. I will put another case. Suppose that in my electorate there were three candidates - myself, a free-trader, and a protectionist. I should certainly poll every labour vote, but I should not receive the support of any boodler or squatter in the electorate. </para>

The honorable members for Macquarie, Parramatta, Lang, and Hunter, when they attend tea-and-bun fights, and address the women electors, urge them that, whatever they do, whether they are free-traders or protectionists, to vote against the Labour Party. They tell them that it is the Labour Party of whom they have to be afraid. I do not blame them for that, because I tell the electors to do their best to down the George Reid faction and the Deakin faction, and to vote for the labour man every time. </para>

So far as my fiscal views are con.cerned, I candidly say that I should prefer to see the right honorable member for East Sydney in the position of Prime Minister. My opinions, so far as that is concerned,, have not changed in the slightest degree, but under present conditions, I must support the present Government. Members of the Opposition are travelling about the country fighting us as hard as they can. They are after our blood. They talk about cutting the claws of the tiger. I am sure that the claws of the tiger would be cut, if the contingent vote were introduced. </para>

                            <para>- The Government affirm that it will secure majority rule, and honorable members. I suppose, must trust the Government. At every meeting which I have heard honorable members opposite address, they have clamoured for majority rule. Personally, I am of opinion that, instead of the Bill safeguarding majority rule, it would have the effect of complicating the conduct of elections. If it would benefit the electors of Australia, I would support it, but my experience as an electioneering agent - and I have done a little bit of work in that capacity in my time - leads me to believe that it would not. I engineered things well enough to secure a seat in this House- </para>

Indeed, I should like to see all the present . members of the House re-elected. The main reason why I cannot support the Bill is that it would have the effect of complicating, instead of simplifying, the conduct of elections. </para>

                        <para>.- I must confess that I am opposed&#39; to this Bill, and I. cannot understand why it has teen sprung upon us at the eleventh hour of the session. No mention was made of it in the Governor-General&#39;s speech at the opening of Parliament, but with the general election close at hand, it has .been suddenly launched upon the House. In this measure, I recognise the malign influence of the press. With the advent of Federation, it was hoped that the power of the press would to a certain extent be curtailed. It has been curtailed, but there is still strong evidence that this Parliament is dominated to a large extent by the Melbourne press. I firmly believe that the measure under consideration has been brought forward as the result of the influence exercised by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> -newspaper. I am also of opinion that the average elector will experience some difficulty in comprehending the contingent-voting system which is proposed by the Government. I confess that I had great difficulty in following the explanation of that system, which has been given by the Minister. I further maintain that it would be almost impossible for the electoral officers to give effect to the provisions of the Bill on such extremely short notice. At the last general election, I polled 6,300 votes, my protectionist opponent, 6,100 votes; and the labour candidate, 900 votes. There were also 113 informal votes registered. Consequently, I was not returned by a majority of the electors, but yet I flatter myself that I represent the opinions of the people throughout that electorate. </para>

                            <para>- I am certain that I do, and, although my constituency has been horribly mutilated, I still hope - as does the honorable member for Maranoa - that I shall continue to represent ray constituents. I arn not in favour of compulsory voting, and I do not believe that under that system we should be any better off than we are to-day. After all, no arrangement that we can make will absolutely insure the return of parliamentary representatives by the votes of a majority. I was not aware until the honorable member for Maranoa spoke that it was possible to &#34;dish&#34; the Labour Party in Queensland, but now that I know that it is possible I feel more assured than ever that the Bill has been brought forward by the Ministry for the purpose of bolstering up their own cause. I intend to vote against it. </para>

                        <para>. - Many charges have been levelled against the Government in regard to the motive which has actuated them in bringing forward this Bill, and I should like to explain my reasons for supporting it. For many years I have been in favour of the preferential system of voting, or of the Hare system, which was formerly in operation in Tasmania. The Government are evidently gaining wisdom by experience, and they have introduced this measure to insure that honorable members shall represent a majority of the electors who choose to exercise the franchise. </para>

                            <para>- I do. I certainly think that the representation of Tasmania in the Senate during the first Parliament was the best that it was possible to secure. The first election, it will be remembered, was conducted under the Hare system, and as a result the protectionists secured the return of their representative, the freetraders elected their candidate, the Labour Party secured the return of one of its members, the commercial community elected another, and those who took a great interest in defence matters were also represented. </para>

                        <para>.- The first thing that strikes me in connexion with this Bill is that it bears a remarkable resemblance to other measures which have been introduced by the Government, in that it professes to do something which its provisions are designed to defeat. It is ostensibly brought forward for the purpose of establishing the principle of majority rule. But when we come to examine its provisions we can easily see that it will fail to accomplish that object. The result of passing it will not be to secure majority rule, but in certain contingencies to effectively insure minority rule. To that extent it is a denial of that broad democratic principle in which so many honorable members believe - the principle of majority representation. The honorable member for Maranoa made an assertion which was tantamount to an accusation that the Opposition is opposed to this Bill because it provides for the giving of effect to that principle. In the immediately succeeding sentence he proceeded to show that it does not provide for anything of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to say that it is a Victorian Bill, engineered and prompted by the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> If the Government were really anxious to so amend our electoral laws as to give effect to the democratic principle of majority rule, why did they not indicate in the Governor-General&#39;s speech their intention to do so? If the omission from that speech of any reference to such an intention was accidental, why did they not avail themselves of the opportunity to bring in these proposals when the amending Electoral Bill was under consideration? At that time, however, no thing was said by them as to the necessity for altering our voting system in this direction. We have recently seen in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> articles- </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the articles to which I refer were prompted, if not written, by Professor Nanson, and that the germ of the present idea is traceable to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> office. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is responsible for much of the mischievous legislation that has been introduced by the Government. It seems to me that it is not the Government which frames the Bills submitted to us, but that, they have their birth in a certain newspaper office in Collins street. A most enthusiastic effort is invariably made by the Government to give effect to legislation suggested from that quarter. These proposals, instigated from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> office, and of an intensely mischievous character, are an insult to the House. Few of the measures introduced by the Government are as mild as is the one now before us ; but I contend that even this Bill will be mischievous in its effect. As showing that it is merely an <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> measure, prompted by the belief that it will give Victoria an advantage which she would not enjoy under the present system, I would point out that Victoria is at present the great shocking example of minority representation. The returns show that at the last general election seventeen seats were uncontested, and that of the remaining fifty-eight constituencies forty-five returned representatives by majority votes. Only thirteen out of the fifty-eight returned representatives on minority votes. Of these thirteen, nine were in Victoria, two in Queensland, none in New South Wales, two in Tasmania, none in South Australia or Western Australia. It will thus be seen that Victoria embraces the largest number of constituencies that have returned representatives on minority votes. The polling in these constituencies was as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">These figures show that the number of electorates which returned representatives on minority votes form only a small proportion of the whole; the overwhelming majority pf the constituencies returned representatives by majority votes. In these circumstances, the question of urgency has no weight, and may be at once dismissed. We are entitled to inquire what is the reason for the sudden anxiety displayed by the Government to give effect to a principle which was certainly just as urgent six years ago as it is to-day. This Bill has been brought forward on the eve of a general election, when there is no time to give the constituencies reasonable notice of the contemplated change, and certainly insufficient time to educate the electors as to the operation of the new system. There is no justification for the charge that the Opposition are seeking to prevent the Government from bringing about legislation by majority rule. The Prime Minister and his colleagues know that there is not the slightest foundation for such an accusation. I U0 not know that I should be in order in describing such an attack as a very cowardly one, but honorable men certainly cannot consider it to be justifiable even from the stand-point of political tactics. .On referring to the speech recently delivered by the Prime Minister at Maryborough, I find that he is reported to have said - </para>

He has bewailed the fact that there is so much apathy among the public, and has pointed out that those who blame Parliament for its legislation are themselves responsible for the present state of affairs, because they have not taken the trouble to go to the poll to secure the return of candidates representing the views of the majority. He has always eulogised the organization of the Labour Party, so far as it has resulted in having the names of electors placed on the rolls and in bringing the electors to the polls, and he has pointed out to those who complain of such legislation, as is naturally to be expected in the circumstances, that if they did their duty, and recorded their votes, different results might be looked for. Those are the lines on which the leader of the Opposition has conducted his meetings, and yet the Prime Minister, with a full knowledge of the facts, deliberately conveyed to the public an incorrect idea as to his attitude. f am surprised that the honorable and learned gentleman resorted to .such tactics.

I am prepared to say that I would be in favour of making it compulsory for every elector to indicate his preference on the voting paper, and I am prepared to extend the same system to the Senate. But, recognising the period of our session, we brought it forward in a more mild form, and leave it to the Senate to come in. Now, men that talked against minority rule till they should have been a different colour in the face, are opposed to this. And why? Because Parliament is near its close. Because there was other business to be done. Any reason but the real one - that they like minority representation, because they hope they can score more out of it than we can. That shows what you have to expect when you trust other declarations from the same men. </para>

                        <para>For every contest will be between three parties, and in very few cases will any party run two candidates. Thus the result of the first count will show the strength of each party, say, free-traders 500, Labour 400, protectionists 300. So soon as these figures are announced the merest tyro can foresee the result of the election. When the protectionist candidate at the foot of the poll is rejected, all the protectionist votes will go&#39; to the Labour candidate, who will thereby secure election. But if the preferential vote is not used, if the safety valve is not applied to the body politic, the free-trader will be elected by a minority vote. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">This sudden interest in the welfare of the Labour Party is hardly calculated to deceive the members of that party, especially if the article from which I have just quoted is compared with other articles which have appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on the same subject. Now, if it is assumed that the Labour candidate polls the lowest number of votes, and the votes cast for him have to be&#39; redistributed, they should then, according to this, be allotted to the protectionist candidate. But it is as likely that the majority of those voting for the Labour candidate, irrespective of fiscal considerations, will be free-traders as that they will be protectionists, and to give their votes to a protectionist, would, therefore, be to do what they were actually opposed to. In my opinion, the illustrations are altogether worthless. But I now come to the most fatal defect in the Bill. The Government professes to be anxious to establish majority rule. Yet the Bill makes it optional oh the part of the voter whether he will exercise the preferential vote or not. If there is to be_ any value in the system it can only arise from its compulsory use, and from uniformity in its application. If it is to be optional, a candidate would be a born ass who did not advise his supporters to plump for him, and absolutely to disregard any preference for every other candidate. On the face of it, therefore, the Bill is a fraud and a sham. In my opinion, it was never intended to be anything else. When the preferential system was tried in Queensland it did not bring about the result that its promoters desired. Something like it was also in operation in Tasmania, but as it has been abandoned there it is reasonable to suppose that it was found to be ineffective. The honorable member for Maranoa has shown that in Queensland labour candidates advised their supporters not to adopt the preferential system. </para>

In any case, however admirable it might be, the time at our disposal is insufficient to let the public know what changes it would make in the present voting system. If it were passed it would bring about the greatest confusion, and so far from securing effective voting, would lead to quite the opposite result.
