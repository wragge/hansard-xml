                        <para>- There is not much free-trade about the Labour Party now, since last night even the honorable members for Barrier and Maranoa voted for the purely fiscal conditions of the Bill. The possessor of a patent right would, in almost every particular, correspond with the persons described in the clause. He &#34;monopolizes,&#34; and &#34;attempts to monopolize,&#34; and may &#34; combine and conspire with others to monopolize &#34; part of the trade among the States or with other countries. A patent right may be world-wide in its effects. In Australia we grant rights which, under certain conditions, protect the. patentee in eveny part of the world, and thus enable him to monopolize, or to art with intent to control the business of the world, so far as the manufacture and sale of the article patented is concerned. But, having provided for the issue of patents, we now propose by the Bill to indict any who may exercise his patent rights. I am, of course, well aware that the effect of a patent, although inevitably, at the first, monopolistic, is eventually diffusive, tending to the invention of devices for increasing human comfort and advancement. Indeed, it seems as if we have concluded- in our minds that we cannot bring new forces into play in connexion with any material concern, which are not at first of a monopolistic character. In the initial stages they tend to concentration and to monopoly, but afterwards their benefits become diffused throughout the length and breadth of the community. In the Commonwealth, a patent right may exist for fourteen years, though it may be of a character so revolutionary as actually to hold back the advancement of the community in many ways during its currency. This is not a fanciful statement, but one which everybody who has had any connexion with business knows to be true. I recollect a case in point having reference to the telephone switchboards in use in the General Post Office, Sydney. Years ago when we wished to install a new switchboard there, two firms tendered for the work. One of them claimed to possess a patent right in Australia df certain things which were material to both switchboards. The result was that we had to pay that firm for the switchboard, ^2,000 more than the price at which we could have obtained a very much better switchboard had there been no patent right in existence, and as a result, a very great deal of heart-burning was occasioned to the officers of the Department. At that time there was nothing in our New South Wales patent laws binding the Government in any way whatever with regard to patents. There &#39;was, I believe, some provision of the kind in the Statutes operating in the other States, but in New South Wales there was no such provision. But, notwithstanding the fact that there was nothing in the legislation of New South Wales to bind the Government. I took up the position that since the Legislature had conferred patent rights upon individuals, the Government ought not to set an example in the violation &#39; of those rights. Upon these moral grounds the Ministry came to the conclusion that we ought to observe the same rule in regard to patents as applied to private individuals. Then I remember that some of the officers in the Postal Department invented a jack for use in connexion with the telephone switchboard, but again we were met by this claim on the part of the patentees. They affirmed that the difference which we made in the jack was only a minor one, but it was covered by the patent right which they already possessed. In our ignorance we had entered into a contract for the supply of this particular jack before we were aware of the existence of this patent right. The firm took the matter to the Equity Court, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Owen, who has recently been investigating the land scandals in New South Wales, made an order for the impounding of the jacks. He would not allow them to be landed at all, although they came from a firm in Sydney, which was making them at the time. He would not allow them to be landed upon the ground that they were covered by a patent right which had -been taken out in Australia by a firm at Home. The difference was not sufficiently material, he ruled, to evade the monopoly which the firm in question possessed. As a result we were held up for the time being by the lack of these jacks- </para>

                        <para>- They were supplied by a Melbourne firm, but they contravened a patent held by a foreign company - that is to say, a British, company. The latter took action in the Equity Court, and restrained them from being landed, and the Postal Department was held up until it made a contract with the individual who held the patent right. That is an illustration of a monopoly actually keeping back, for seven or eight years at least, the installation of an improved switchboard in the. Post Office. That is a common experience. But on the whole the public are deemed to be best served by the enactment of .Statutes of that kind. We have deliberately set up these patent rights. We have done so in this Parliament, and, according to an interjection by the honorable member for Bland, we have not attached to them certain stipulations which&#39; attach to them in other countries of the world. Why I do not know. I do not understand how anybody who believes in Socialism can concur in the issue of these patent rights for a number of years, seeing that they mean the granting of a monopoly to an individual as against the whole community. However, that is by the way. The fact remains that we do set up these monopolistic enterprises with a certain currency, and that we shield them by the processes of law in every way. Yet they come within the meaning of this clause im almost every particular. There is another expression in the provision under discussion to which I desire to direct attention. It is the phrase &#34;the detriment of the public.&#34; What is the real meaning of it? What do we mean when we refer to &#34; the detriment of the public &#34; ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think&#39; that the word &#34; public &#34; in this instance means traders. I should rather think that it means the great body of the public, who use and purchase these goods. If it means the consumer, why not say so? But if the clause read &#34; to the detriment of the consumer &#34; we should again open up a long vista of possibilities. What is &#34;to the detriment of the consumer&#34;? Clearly the increase in the price of any article, no matter how slight it may be, is to his detriment. The difference between tea at is. per lb. and tea at is. 0 1/2d. per lb. is to the detriment of those who consume that article, looked at from their stand-point. So it is in the case of the goods referred to in this clause. Yet the cheapening of an article is the &#39; very thing that we indict under this Bill. We say that unless these things can be supplied at a certain standard price, they shall not be supplied at all. Under this clause we absolutely force people to put up their prices before they can enter upon our competitive plane at all. It seems to me to be contradictory to set up a standard which is prohibitive of everything which is &#34; to the detriment of the public.&#34; and, at the same time, to require people to enter into such arrangements as must lead to an increase in price in relation to the articles sought to be purchased and consumed. </para>

The whole question of the relations of trade to the community is certainly involved in the term &#34;detriment of the public.&#34; It seems to me that the first and the main principle of all these regulative provisions, as applied to trusts, must necessarily entail the fixing of the fair price of .goods. That is involved in any regulative action which may be taken. No doubt the Judge who hears any case brought before him under the provisions of this Bill will fix that price in a negative way. That consideration raises the whole question as to what is a fair price from the standpoint of the great bulk of the public. What, for instance, might be a fair price for a harvester to the farmer when the machine is supplied by any trust might be deemed a &#34; cut &#34; price by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> That appears to be the case, indeed1, if we can judge by our recent experience. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> in fixing the price of his machines, does not contemplate extending consideration to the farmer.

When we set out to interfere with these competitive enterprises, we do not know what will be for the ultimate good of the public at large. We may believe that this and that section of the public will benefit, and yet it may be that the interference with the whole network of our competitive concerns will result in a larger aggregate loss to the public than is compensated for by any temporary or sectional gain. When we set out upon broad inquiries of this description it is not to be wondered at that the end and purpose of such legislation should be defeated by the machinations of men of skill and ingenuity interested in the defeat of its provisions.

                        <para>- I am not turning on the honorable member. I should not say a word on the subject, but for the fact that, feeling himself secure in the solid support behind him, the honorable member&#39;s leader is becoming impudent. Honorable members are aware that one of the troubles of those engaged in the fruit-growing industry in New South Wales, and I suppose also in most of the other States, is that a great proportion of the fruit crop ripens at about the same time. As a consequence, the market is immediately glutted, prices fall to zero, and the whole industry is disorganized. It is one of the constant aims and ideals of the fruit-grower to so control his market as to secure a fair price for his crop, and from time to time co-operative enterprises are entered into for that purpose. Does not this constitute a monopoly in restraint of trade? Possibly the purchaser of fruit would say that it is to the detriment of the public also. Here we have a product, the market for which is regulated by a process of combination or monopolization, if honorable members please, for what I consider a very wise and proper purpose. Unless some such course is adopted, much of the fruit must go to the rubbish tip, or be sold without any profitable return. Though the action taken may be held to be to the detriment of the public, as a matter of fact, it is not ultimately detrimental, because, if the supply of fruit were at once exhausted, a demand would be set up for fruit which must be supplied from other quarters, and it is then that the detriment to the public would come in as exemplified by the increased price which they would be called upon to pay, by reason of scarcity. I hold that the regulation and control of the fruit industry in the way I have described is quite legitimate, but it corresponds in every particular to what is indictable under this provision, when it takes place on any large scale, and might be dealt with accordingly. The. clause reads - </para>

                <para class="block">All this shows the need for exempting the primary industries from the operation of a Bill of this kind, as was proposed by the honorable member for Echuca. It is not intended to deal with small matters of voluntary co-operation, and the Committee made a great mistake when it declined&#39; to exclude from its operation these innocent fair and legitimate enterprises of the country, as to which there can be no monopoly in the large sense of the word, but which might, nevertheless, be brought under this Bill, by reason of the width of its provisions, and the scope of its intent. What I have described might happen in the apple industry in Tasmania, and wherever there is a glutted market for fruit or produce of any kind, and the attempt is made upon reasonable and fair co-operative lines to control the market, so as to procure a fair return for the enterprise expended in the industry. I say that as to all these matters of voluntary concern, this Bill should leave them free and unrestricted, particularly where corners of the kind cannot be established to the lasting detriment of the public. I, therefore, hope the Attorney-General, before the consideration of the measure is completed, will place some limitation upon the scope of its operations, and will try to make its provisions more fair. There is another matter connected with the penalties attaching to offences under this clause. Sub-clause 2 provides that - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Every contract made or entered into in contravention of this section shall be absolutely illegal and void. &#34;This question was raised the other night, and I do not intend to pursue it now, but I do think that even here the Attorney-General might consider an amendment which would prevent ordinary legitimate practices entered into by innocent persons from being penalized under this provision, to the detriment of their businesses and enterprises. If a contract is to be cut into at harvest time in connexion with the supply v of some agricultural implements the innocent are going to be made to suffer as well as the guilty. I do not think that is the intention of honorable members, or of those who introduced this legislation, but that must be the effect of the measure unless it is altered. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not quite sure how this clause is going to apply. Its form differs from that of the similar provision in the Bill of last year. It is wider in its scope than the clause in that Bill. If honorable members will turn to clause 11 of the Bill of 1905 they will find that the combinations dealt with under the provisions of the clause similar to this were combinations between trusts or between a person and a trust. The reference to the trust is omitted from the clause in this Bill, so that the combination might be a combination of. any two persons as well as a combination of corporations or trusts. Again, from the. way in which this clause is drafted, it is quite open to this interpretation : That you .must prove the intent to do the act to the detriment of the public. In other words, that there must be in the mind of the* person doing the act the idea that he was to injure the public by doing it. I am speaking merely of the criminal effect of the clause. If so, it would be very hard to get a conviction. What the draftsman may have meant was that, so long as the act does result in detriment to the public, assuming that the other conditions of the clause are complied&#39; with, the guilt of the person charged is established. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt about it. I do not desire that any man should be branded a criminal unless he has a criminal intent. Later on, in some modifications of the Bill which I have circulated, I show that I think there should be a power to grant an injunction, irrespective of intent, where there is shown to be anything detrimental to the public ; but so far as criminal liability is concerned, there should be none, in my opinion, unless criminal intent is proved. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-Genera* now admits that my reading of this clause is correct, and that it does not mean that a monopoly must be proved to be to the detriment of the public, but that the accused, in entering into combination, intended the detriment of the public. It does? not matter what the character of the combination is so long as there was no wilful design to acquire such a monopoly) as would result in the detriment of the public. If that design is not proved the fact that the monopoly does result in the detriment cf the public has no bearing on the question of guilt or innocence. If that is what is meant by the Government, it only goes to show that they do not believe in their own clause, because such a reading of the provision would in almost every case destroy all possibility of getting a conviction. This was not in the Sherman Act, and I do not think that it was in the Bill submitted here last year. In America the guilt is established by showing that the operations of the contractors or of a combination will injure the public. Under this clause it must be proved that there was intent to do so. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me then that very few cases will come under the operation of the measure. It must really relate to the actual transit of goods. The Attorney-General says that a mere sale is 1112 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Industries</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Preservation Bill.</inline> sufficient, but I have not yet seen a case deciding that. It is significant that the object of the law is to put down competition between carriers or shippers in the Inter-State trade to the detriment of other shippers or carriers, and that almost all the cases, certainly all that I have seen, are cases turning upon the question of freights. That being so, it is obvious to honorable members that this clause is particularly limited in its operation. However, as I said, it is difficult to amend it, so that I suppose it must go for what it is worth. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that this clause is practically the mainspring of the Bill. Had it not been for the harvester matters receiving so very much prominence, very probably we should not have seen a Bill of this kind &#39;for a good many years. I feel that I can speak with a certain amount of freedom, because when the question of harvesters was before the House, I took considerable interest in the discussion, and did all I could to assist the local manufacturers in receiving a larger amount of protection than was proposed in the Tariff. I did so for two reasons. In the first place, the harvester was an Australian invention, and the inventor had not been able to receive anything like a comprehensive patent. In the second place, I foresaw the difficulty which has arisen in regard to the matter of invoicing. At that time my proposal was that there should be a fixed duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10.</inline> It would have been carried here, I believe, but for the fact that at the last moment some one converted the honorable member for Maranoa. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it would protect the harvester amply. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who is not a constituent of mine, and whom I only knew as having introduced this machinery, came to me, and asked for a fixed duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15.</inline> I pointed out to him that he was asking for too much, and the reason why I had fixed upon a duty of&#163;10. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo had moved to have a fixed duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15.</inline> I could not support that duty, because it seemed to me to be too high. I thought that if the manufacturers of harvesters received a fixed duty equal to 12&#189; per cent. upon the selling price, they would get a very fair protection indeed, and, accordingly, I moved in that direction. The position was that the duty was to have the effect of steadying the market here; at any rate, for our local harvesters. But we had no sooner passed the Tariff in that respect than they joined the combine. I suppose that they would have taken that step even if they had got the higher duty. IT the Minister can say that by raising the duty to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> 2s. 6d. he has broken down the combine, of what use is this Bill? I believe that a great deal could be done in that particular way. I wish to refer to some remarks made by the honorable and learned member for Angas the other night with regard to a conference of farmers, held in Melbourne, some time ago. He referred to some evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Osborne,</inline> the secretary. I saw that gentleman on the subject at the time of the meeting. He simply gave evidence to show that he was secretary to a conference, which represented so many agricultural bodies. The meeting did not receive the attention which it would otherwise have got, for the reason that practically two meetings had been called for that evening in the same room - a meeting of dairy people as well as the meeting of the conference. There were also persons sent there who were interested in the harvester combine, and who did their best ina quiet way to render the meeting of very little value. The value of that meeting to me. however, was that it was presided over by a gentleman from my electorate, Councillor Reseigh, of St. Arnaud Shire Council, who is one of the most consistent protectionists whom I know. He and I are very intimate personal friends, but I do not suppose that I received his vote. Both there and before he said that the agitation was being carried to such an extent that he had not only spoken against it in the district, but had come down to preside over that meeting. That was enough to show me that a reaction had taken place. Those connected with the harvesters had </para>

                    Some of us were willing to give a fixed duty of

                    and we almost succeeded in our purpose. But then they reverted to the original proposal, or rather improved upon it. When I left the room some of the harvester men came to me and began to explain the matter. I told them that there was hardly a farmer in the country who was not under the impression that they were getting a fixed duty of&#163;25. Several farmers said that the harvester people had done themselves great harm throughout the country, so much so that a farmer told me the other day that he would never buy art implement of the kind from them. What has been the result of this harvester disturbance - for it has disturbed the position amongst the farmers very strongly?

                        <para>- I am very much surprised at the pertinacity with which the Government are pushing on with the Bill. It is not as if arguments had come from only this side. We have had arguments against the Bill from the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the honorable member for Perth, and the honorable member for Grey, who have shown Ministers what a very dangerous position we may drift into, and how little consideration has been given to this legislation. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne seemed to lay very great stress upon the fact that criminal proceedings may be taken and people landed . in gaol. The terrors of gaol would very soon, I think, cease to exist, because people are not imprisoned merely to punish, but also in order to deter others! from offending. If we treat people as has very often been done in this country in connexion with false statutory declarations, and so forth, the imprisonment will have no effect at all, because gaol will become what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> has called a club. The argument of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports seems to have fallen very flat. The honorable member, we know, is very strong and pertinacious in his opinions, but he ought to pause in the face of the facts laid before us by the honorable member for Mernda and others. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney- General may be quite right. If I did not say so, I meant to say &#34; in cases.&#34; I have not seen the report of the Royal Commission for about a fortnight, but I propose to read some extracts from it. It is true that I did not use the words &#34;in cases,&#34;&#39; just as the Attorney-General says he meant to use the words &#34; goes up to,&#34; but did not use them. The Attorney-General said that the tobacco monopoly has 99 per cent. of the tobacco trade of Australia, and he refused to withdraw the statement. He did not say that the monopoly &#34; went up to 99 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- What is the meaning of the Attorney-General&#39;s interjection if not 1116 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Industries</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Preservation Bill.</inline> that? There were originally on this Royal Commission certain honorable members who resigned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> resigned when he became a Minister of the Crown, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> resigned for some other reason, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was away when the report was signed. I am told, though I have not substantiated my authority, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> wired saying he could not sign the majority report. The only member of the Royal Commission who took it upon himself to issue a minority report was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> ; but the singular fact is, that none of the members of the Government party to whom I referred - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford, Senator Styles,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> - could indorse the findings of the members of the Labour Party on the Commission. In considering this clause, I should like to ask the Attorney -General what is meant by the phrase, &#34; any part of the trade or commerce with other countries.&#34; Does that mean any fraction of our trade and commerce, or any particular line of trade and commerce? </para>

The Attorney-General would penalize it under this clause if it operated to the detriment of the public, and so operated &#34; with intent.&#34; May I ask for the attention of the Attorney-General to this argument ? </para>

But when we hear, in reference to the tobacco trust, unqualified interjections that that trust has only 50 per cent, of a monopoly </para>

                        <para>- Whether the honorable member said it or not, I feel confident that I am right. The point is that he said that the trust had only 50 per cent, of a monopoly. We know perfectly well that the main trade of the tobacco company in question is in plug tobacco. The principal thing in tobacco that concerns this country is plug tobacco. Cigarettes and cigars are not the commodities which the bulk of the smokers of this community like to consume. When we talk about a monopoly in tobacco we mean practically plug tobacco. I shall read, in order that we may have it on record, the testimony of the Tobacco Commission, so that it may never again be said in this House that no harm is done by the trust, and that there is no need to regulate it, and in order that there may be no suggestion here that there is not a trust that requires attention at the hands of Parliament. I am going to &#39; read the report of the Commission as to the operations of the trust, its constitution, its ramifications, and its effect upon the public, upon the employes, and upon the tobacco growers of this country. I shall omit the references to the numbers of questions in the evidence. The Commission says : - </para>

                    <para>Your Commissioners find - That a Combine or Trust does exist in the industry of the manufacture &#91;see statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline><inline font-style="italic">V.</inline> Jacobs, statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> R. Dixson, and statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Cameron&#93; that it extends to the business of importation <inline font-weight="bold">&#91;Mr.</inline> Jacobs, also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> P. Benjamin&#93;; that it also extends to the wholesale distribution both of locally manufactured and imported tobaccoes. We find (hat this Combine originated in 1900, so far as its Australian branch is concerned, among certain manufacturing firms, by their securing joint interests in companies previously in competition with them. On the establishment of Inter-State free-trade consequent on the coming into operation of the Commonwealth Tariff, these interests were still further consolidated. The Australian Tobacco firms were brought- into conflict by the establishment of Inter-State free-trade, and tha competition became more acute, owing to a section of the lmneri.il Tobacco Company, or British Tobacco Trust, having commenced to manufacture in Sydney. The prospect of this competition had the effect of driving the principal Australian firms into closer combination, eventually culminating in an arrangement which embraces not only the chief Australian tobacco, cigar, and cigarette manufacturers, but is also connected with the British-American Tobacco Company of the United Kingdom and America. Each of such manufacturing businesses hold&#39;s a proprietary interest in every other such business, and also in the distributing firm of Kronheimer Limited. The Australian firms completed their combination in 1903, and the final arrangement was completed in February, 1904, see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> R. Dixson&#39;s statement. We find that the Combine is a partial, but not a complete monopoly. In plug tobaccoes (local and imported) expert witnesses gave the proportion of the Combine&#39;s business compared to the total business from 73 per cent, to 99 per cent. </para>

                    <para class="block">And practically all agreed that the majority of the most popular of both local and imported lines were controlled by the Combine. To such an extent does this exist that, so far as plug tobaccoes are concerned, the Combine is a virtual monopoly. As regards the making of cigars, the Combine appear to have a monopoly right of very valuable labour-saving machinery, which gives them an immense advantage over their competitors, and is apparently rapidly eliminating competition. In cigarettes the Combine has a practical monopoly, so far as machine-made cigarettes are concerned. </para>

                <para>As regards Question Number 2 - </para>
                <para>Your Commissioners find that the amalgamation of interests, the centralizing of factories, and concentration&#39; of distributing agencies has resulted in great economy of production, and must have consequently largely increased profits to those firms comprising the Combine. There was generally a decided objection on the part of the witnesses interested in the Combine to disclose its profits. Returns supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fergusson,</inline> Chief Inspector of Excise, Melbourne, show in 1903 t2 tobacco, 75 cigar, and 16 cigarette factories ; in 1904 return shows that these had decreased to 11 tobacco, 68 cigar, and 14 cigarette factories, a decrease of 10 factories in one year. That this decrease was not due to any falling off in demand or production is shown by the fact that the local manufacture of all forms of tobaccoes increased from 6,601,015 lbs. in 1901 to 7,556,416 lbs. in 1903, and to 7,790,157 lbs. in 1904; and the number of employes increased from 2,662 in 1903 to 2,816 in ^04. Fifty per cent, of the leaf used in New South Wales in 1904 was worked in one factory ; in Victoria nearly 80 per cent, of total leaf was worked in one factory ; in Queensland 60 per cent., and in South Australia 80 per cent, was so worked, showing that the figures in the return as to the number of factories in existence are largely illusory, the great majority of them being small cigar manufacturers, and the output of their factories being insignificant when compared with the factories controlled by the Combine. The return alluded to shows that one other substantial factory has been closed in the year 1905, whilst six small manufacturers have used no leaf for that year. </para>

                    <para>As to the effect of the combination on the operatives, four representatives of those engaged in the making of plug and twist tobaccoes who gave evidence were in agreement that conditions generally were worse now than before the combination. These complaints refer to inadequate and reduced wages, the substitution of female labour for male labour at lower rates of pay than male labour, humidity of atmosphere of factories, and power of Combine to dictate terms and conditions owing to the absence of competitors. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>We find that the effect of the combination on the grower of tobacco leaf has been disastrous; that better prices ruled when the factories were more numerous. Evidence has been given of co-operation among the manufacturers in fixing the price of Australian leaf prior to the formation of the Combine ; the gradual decrease in the number of factories giving greater facilities for such co-operation. The culminating combination of all the large buyers in the Commonwealth has practically placed the growers absolutely at the mercy of the Combine. The establishment of Inter-State free-trade should have been of immense benefit to the growers, but the evidence shows that not only has there been no improvement, but their position is worse than formerly. The growers complain that they are practically restricted to one buyer ; and much of the evidence given tends to prove that the Combine has used this advantage to give less than a fair value for the leaf. </para>

                    <para>As to the effect on the consumer we find that prices have been raised to the retailer, and by a reduction in the size and weight of the plugs or sticks this increase has wholly or partially been passed, on to consumer. The Combine attributes the rise to the alteration effected by the Federal Tariff. We find, however, that the result of that Tariff was generally to improve their position by (a) giving them free access to all the States in the purchase of Australian leaf ; (i) giving them access to all the States in the sale of their manufactured products with substantial protection against imported tobaccoes. In addition to this one brand of nl ug tobacco was raised in price in May, 1903, obviously not by the operation of the Federal Tariff. We also find that, whilst there have been slight increases in some lines of imported cigars, controlled by the Combine, there has been great cutting of prices by them in cigars locally made, and controlled by them. We find that in some States there has been a deterioration in the quality of the tobacco manufactured. Conclusive evidence was given showing that the Combine has laid down a rule that </para>

                        <para>- Not the whole of the evidence attached to the report, but I have glanced at it casually as it has appeared from day to day. I have read the finding of the Commission, and whether the actual figures are right or wrong, that finding ought to be respected by the Committee. It shows that there is strong reason to believe that there is in our midst - I am stating the case very mildly indeed - a great aggregation of commercial power, which is being used for the benefit of individuals, utterly regardless of the effect upon the people of Australia, as consumers, producers, workers, or traders. It would be a lamentable thing for the country if we did not attempt to cope with this evil, and I am very proud to be associated with a measure which makes the attempt. I have been asked to say what I understand by the term monopoly. </para>

                        <para>- I will deal first with monopoly alone. Monopoly has been defined as an attempt to secure or acquire an exclusive right in trade or commerce by means which prevent or restrain others from engaging therein. It was said this morning by the honorable member for Parramatta that a patent is a monopoly, and, in one sense, it is; but it is not a monopoly in that sense. A man is given a patent because he has discovered something which would not have been invented or discovered but for his efforts, and, in return for the patent, he gives to the community the benefits accruing from his discovery or his ingenuity - the work of his brains. He gives in return for his patent something which the public would not be able to enjoy if they did not get it from him. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The law says, to encourage persons to seek out inventions for the benefit of the public, that those who, by exercising their brains, evolve some new thing for the benefit of their countrymen and of the world at large, shall have the exclusive right to use it for a certain period. It must be remembered that an invention is the inventor&#39;s own property ; but a monopoly occurs when some one says to his fellows, not &#34; I will give you something,&#34; but &#34; I will take away , &#39;from you something which you possess.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and he takes from others something which they have a right to possess. That is the distinction. A patent is a monopolistic right, given to an inventor as a reward for a valuable discovery, which he must, eventually at all events, share with the public, to whom the arrangement is beneficial. </para>

                        <para>- There is a radical distinction between the granting of a patent and allowing a man to usurp the field where others&#39; rights are concerned. It is the monopoly with which we wish to deal. When we speak of a part of the trade, we say, in effect, that we shall not wait until a man has declared that he is going to grasp the whole of the trade of the Commonwealth, but that, if he takes any part of it belonging to other persons, and endeavours to exclude them to the detriment of the public, he will come within the scope of the Bill. I do not know that there is any other question to which my attention has been directed, and, under the circumstances, I ask that the matter may be decided as soon as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General&#39;s reply to the remarks of the honorable member &#39;for Wentworth was characteristic. He at first denied that he had said that the tobacco combine controls 99 per cent, of the trade ; then he quoted from the majority report of the Royal Commission on the tobacco industry, and he wound up by declaring that it is true that the combine controls 99 per cent, of the tobacco trade. Thus, in a short speech, he went from &#34;yes&#34; to &#34;no,&#34; and back to &#34;yes.&#34; Let us&#39; consider! what he referred to as the evidence upon which he based his statement. He had the effrontery to say that the majority report of the Commission is evidence df the facts which he alleged to exist. All that it is evidence of is the opinion of those who signed it. If we refer to the evidence attached to the report, to which he has not paid the slightest attention&#39;, we shall see that the facts are not as he has stated them to be. He knows that the four gentlemen who signed the majority report were pledged to the nationalization of the. tobacco industry before they accepted their commissions. </para>

                        <para>- That is the evidence relied upon by those who signed the majority report. There i3 substantial evidence for the conclusion that 75 per cent, or thereabouts of a particular trade is in the hands of the combine ; but in saying that 99 per cent, of the whole trade is in their hands the Attorney-Genera&#93; was making a statement which is without justification. When pressed he said that the trade in cigars and cigarettes is trivial, and such as no one would take notice of; but if he had read the evidence, or even the report, he would know that the manufacturing cost of the tobacco made is .^384,000. of the cigars .&#163;66,000, and of the cigarettes ^171,000, so that the manufacturing cost of cigars and cigarettes is about 40 per cent, of the total manufacturing cost, and their production cannot be deemed an unimportant branch of the industry, because the manufacturing cost is a rough guide to the proportions of the various manufactures to the whole trade. If he had read the report, instead of merely glancing at paragraphs picked out for him, he would know that 425,000,000 cigarettes and over 18,000,000 cigars are annually made in Australia. </para>

Let us now <inline font-style="italic">, deal</inline> with the alleged iniquitous operations of the combine, which have been put forward as a justification for the Bill. I say without hesitation, having read more of the evidence than has been read foy any other honorable member, that the statements in the majority report are not borne out by the testimony of the witnesses. In justification of that assertion, I will refer, first, to what is said on the subject of wages and the conditions of labour. The majority report on this question is an absolute travesty of the evidence. </para>

                        <para>- I have read the judgment very -carefully, and I say that the unanimous decision of the Court was that the operatives, both male and female, enjoyed better conditions of labour and more holidays than almost any other body of employes in Australia. Coming to Victoria, both the evidence given before the Commission, and the records taken &#34;from the wages books of the various factories, showed a steady increase in the remuneration of the operatives. It is a fa:t that, although the employers in the industry have recently said to their men, &#34; Ask the Government to appoint a Wages Board, and we will back up your request; you have our written consent to the appointment of a Wages Board,&#34; the latter have refused to take action. </para>

It points out that in .New South Wales the duty on imported manufactured tobacco was increased by 3d. per lb., and the duty and excise on tobacco locally manufactured from imported leaf by a similar amount. In Victoria the duty on imported manufactured tobacco was increased by 3d. per lb., and the duty and excise on tobacco locally manufactured from imported leaf by 9d. per lb. In South Australia the duty of imported manufactured tobacco was increased by 6d. per lb., and the duty and excise on tobacco locally manufactured from imported leaf by 10 1/2d. per lb. These figures show a very heavy all-round increase in the duties levied upon tobacco. The report continues -  </para>

                    <para>These increases of duty far outweigh the benefits conferred by Inter-State free-trade. An essential fact in this regard has also been ignored, and that is the rise in the price of American leaf which would undoubtedly have caused a further rise in price to the consumer, but for the economies which combination enabled the manufacturers to effect. </para>

                <para> The report goes on to show. that the independent manufacturers themselves, including Messrs. Dudgeon and Arnell; and the Tobacco- Company of South Australia,, raised the prices. Why? They were not in the combine, but they were compelled to raise their prices because the cost of their raw material had been increased, and because of the extra duty which they were required to pay. Yet the Attorney-General would have us believe that the reason underlying the increased price of tobacco was that the combine was extorting more money from the public. I say that a perusal of the evidence of the independent manufacturers who are hostile to the combine, shows that the increase in price was due to circumstances entirely beyond the control of the manufacturers, irrespective of whether they were inside or outside the combine. Then we have been told that the effect df the existence of the combine is disastrous to the grower. The Minister of Trade and Customs made the same </para>

                        <para>- There is no statement which has been more frequently repeated, and I venture to say that there is none which has been made with less justification. To assume that the combine is doing its best to kill the local growers of tobacco is to assume that it is voluntarily paying&#163;480,000 per annum for the sole purpose of destroying a few individuals, and of forcing them into dairying or other pursuits. Does any man with an ordinary grain of common sense believe that the combine would pay away such an enormous sum each year if it were not compelled to do so? The tobacco growers in Australia number only some 200 or 300 at the most. Surely the proposition is the most absurd one that has ever been advanced ! IT the evidence tendered to the Tobacco Commission be scrutinized, it will be found that a number of growers declare that they are at present getting a better price from the combine than they have received for many years past. I do not assert for one moment that the combine is composed of saints and angels, but I do say that the statements made by the Attorney-General, and by others, to the effect that, by reason of its existence, the conditions of the operatives in the industry have been made worse, that wages have been lowered, that the growers have been driven off the land, and that prices have been raised to the consumer, are not borne out by the evidence. I tell the Attorney-General that he would not dare to bring the combine before any Court for a breach of the law upon the evidence tendered to the Tobacco Commission. When we analyze that testimony, we find that most of the allegations made against the combine are either based upon hearsay evidence, or relate to something which took place many years prior to the formation of the combine. I say unhesitatingly that no evidence was forthcoming which would lead any Justice of the High Court, or of the Supreme Court, or of the County Court- indeed, I might include even the most newly-appointed justice of the peace- to regard the combination as being hostile to the growers. To assume that it is hostile to them is to assume that the combine does not know upon which side its bread is buttered, and that it is not in the business for the purpose of making money. There was absolutely no evidence forthcoming that any in crease in the price of tobacco has been due to the action of the combine, but there was overwhelming testimony to the contrary. Consequently the allegations of the Attorney-General do not justify the inclusion in this Bill of the clause under consideration. The honorable and learned gentleman, having raised the discussion, is himself to blame for the fact that time has been occupied in exposing his inaccurate statements. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to make a personal explanation. The Attorney -General this morning interjected, while the honorable member for Grampians was speaking, that one of the reasons which had prompted the introduction of this Bill was that 99 per cent. of the tobacco trade of the Commonwealth was in the hands of the tobacco combine. In reply, I went to the other extreme, and said that the combine did not control more than 50 per cent. of that trade. The Attorney-General now says that my statement preceded his. Through the courtesy of the leader of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, I have obtained a copy of the interjections bearing upon this portion of the debate, which were recorded by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporter.

                <para>I was partly wrong in saying that the combine controlled only 50 per cent. of the tobacco trade of the Commonwealth, and I withdraw the statement.

                    <para>.- Now that this little dispute 1 124 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Industries</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Preservation Bill.</inline> between the honorable member for Wentworth and the Attorney-General has been satisfactorily settled, perhaps I may direct a few remarks to the clause itself. It seems to me that the provision differs from previous clauses with which we have dealt, in that unfair competition is not required to establish the fact that a monopoly is detrimental to the public or to an Australian industry. The simple circumstance that a monopoly exists with the intent of controlling, to the detriment of the public, the supply or price of any wares or commodity makes an indictable offence. It has already been pointed out that the portion of the clause which refers to &#34; a part of a trade,&#34; is very vague indeed, and the Attorney-General, in his replies, did not throw much light on the matter. For instance, the honorable and learned gentleman was asked whether if a particular portion of the boot trade was monopolized by one manufacturer, that would bring him under the penalties of the clause. His reply was that it would if the manufacture of workmen&#39;s boots was entirely monopolized by one maker, and he committed the offence of controlling the supply or price to the public. </para>

                        <para>-Just so, to the detriment of the public. I will submit a further illustration. Parts of a trade are often controlled by brands. The tobacco monopoly, to which the honorable and learned member has alluded, is largely one of brands. Because of the superiority of the article, better advertising or greater enterprise in pushing of the goods, certain brands obtain a hold on the market, and the manufacturers who hold those brands become monopolists, not by any direct action of their own, but as the result, it may be, of superior business qualifications. They may raise the price of these goods, and the public may be prepared to pay the increased price, but the question is whether under this clause that would be considered a monopoly detrimental to the public. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. But if a brand obtains a reputation it does so because its quality suits the taste of those who use the goods, and if, owing to that reputation, it monopolizes a considerable share of the business, which is largely the case in the tobacco trade, that is not a monopoly, unless it is shown that&#39; some action is taken by the trust or firm handling the article which prevents the competition of other brands, or which prevents the sellers of a particular brand giving the public an opportunity to obtain similar goods bearing that brand. </para>

                        <para>- All I can say is that you get the facts and apply the section. If there is a monopoly or an attempt to monopolize, or a combination to monopolize &#34; any part of the trade on commerce,&#34; and so on with the intent to control &#34; to the detriment of the public the supply or price,&#34; and so forth4 it comes within the section. I cannot say any more. We must apply the section to the facts. I should like to add that if the honorable member will look at the corresponding section of the Sherman Act, he will find that our clause is much milder. There is no reference to intent in the Sherman Act. There is a reference to a part of a trade, and. to attempts to monopolize, but our clause is much milder, because, I believe, as I said before, that there should be no criminal consequences without criminal intent. </para>

                        <para>- From the opportunities I have had to look through their report, I think that some of their findings are absolutely contrary to the evidence. I am not defending the operations of the tobacco firms. As a. matter of fact, when the Tariff was before us, I voted against the Attorney-General and others, and in favour of reducing the advantages proposed to be given them, and which largely enabled them to establish a partial monopoly. Had the duty been reduced as I desired, the combine would not have had the same opportunities to establish their partial monopoly, that they had in the high preference given to them under the Tariff. But if we are to have many Commissions like the Tobacco Commission, which, from one cause or another, dwindled down to four members- </para>

                        <para>- Four committed to a certain view, and one only who was not committed to that view before the inquiry was started. Such Commissions must be not only expensive, but also valueless for the purpose for which they are appointed. There is another point to which I direct the attention of the Attorney-General. It seems to me that the clause as it stands might interfere with the rights of a patentee under a patent. This will be the later legislation, and it distinctly provides that a person shall not monopolize or endeavour to control the supply or price of merchandise to the detriment of the public. Patentees, or those selling under patent rights, usually obtain large profits on the articles which they sell. That, of course, is, in one way, to the detriment of the public, and a reduction of those profits would be to their benefit. Is that to be considered wrong under this clause? </para>

                        <para>- It does not come under it. The honorable member must see that to monopolize in the sense implied by the use of the word in this clause, means to take away from somebody else what he has. If I have a patent and have the exclusive right to use it from the beginning, nobody can suffer loss who has never had that right. I cannot monopolize from any one else what he never had. </para>

                        <para>- But it would be possible to monopolize a trade or part of a trade in consequence of the possession of a patent right. As a safeguard against the difficulty I have pointed out. I suggest to the honorable member that it might be desirable to make it clear on the face of the clause, that operations under a patent right cannot come under it. </para>

                    <para>. - I find that the Minister is still persevering in his endeavour to pass this legislation, notwithstanding the arguments used last night against its enactment. I did hope that he would! come down to-day with amendments different from those which he has brought forward, although certainly there is an improvement in what he has proposed this morning. I have gone through the amendments very carefully, and I can see that he has yielded a little. </para>

                        <para>- I wish the Minister could see his way to carry out the wishes of the Opposition, who he must admit are in earnest, and make the Bill to suit them, because their object is the same as his own, I take it - that is, to stamp out destructive monopoly. He is an astute lawyer, but he cannot possibly have had the same experience as honorable members on this side, who have devoted a lifetime to commercial affairs, who know the intricacies of business, and the value of trade secrets which are used in connexion with all kinds of . manufacture, and who are well aware that if he persists in carrying the Bill as here drafted it must end in the destruction of manufactures and industries rather than the development of them. When a man starts in business, is it not his object at first to make a living? In the making of that living there is an increasing demand for his goods, until at last he can employ a great many more men than he did at first. But in the beginning the product of his labour is his wages. A man will work for what he can earn;. If by competition from outside his earnings are small, it may be said by the Minister that the man is not getting a living wage, but because he works so much longer and gets a smaller yield than formerly he was able to obtain, any competitor - for instance, a keener man of business, with wider experience- </para>

                        <para>- By that term I take the honorable member to mean a man who is sparing in the use of everything, so as not to give to his goods quite the quality which another man is able to give bv his more primitive process. Very often the product of a primitive process of manufacture is a superior article, but it evokes no demand, because it is so much more expensive to produce. Take the primitive process of making boots, bricks, pottery, or any other article. The products may be much superior in quality, but they could not possibly be produced in competition with the yields of up-to-date machinery. It is possible for the maker of a high- class cigar to command a trade for his brand. It is quite possible for a man in a small way of business to acquire a  monopoly in the manufacture of certain cigars. It is also possible &#39;for a man to have a monopoly in the curing of the leaf, which is an important element in giving flavour to the cigar. Under this Bill, the Minister would stamp out these industries, which are in fair competition, because a man has a monopoly in the curing of the leaf - the very thing which is required in the tobacco industry of Australia. I have been all through Australia where tobacco leaf is grown. An imported Chinese is able to produce the tobacco plant much more effectively and successfully than a European. But the latter can cure the leaf much more advantageously and satisfactorily than can the former. One would have a monopoly in producing the plant, and the other in curing the leaf. . Again, one man might have a monopoly in the production of cigars, and another in the production of plug tobacco. Under the provisions of this Bill, a fine of ^500 would be inflicted &#39; upon a man who was perfect in the manufacture of plug tobacco or superior cigars. Take a mild cigar, for which there might be a large demand. If a brand became known as the brand of a mild cigar, it would be asked for by persons who could not smoke strong tobacco. But the producers would be indictable, and under this particular provision liable to a fine of ^500. The effect might be to stamp out the small producer, because he had a monopoly on a particular part of the industry. A scientist has discovered a most interesting process by which white lead can be produced at an infinitesimal cost. By mere accident he discovered that by putting pig-lead into a vat with certain chemicals, the lead would come out, and that after a process of grinding it was fit for use as white lead. I had the opportunity of sending samples of this white lead to England, where expert chemists testified to the fact that in quality it is equal to the best Champion&#39;s white lead, which is worth from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1%</inline> to  &#163;20  a ton. But under this Bill the discovery could not possibly be put into use in Australia without laying the chemist open to a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500,</inline> and if he persisted, the whole of his plant, and the output of his factory would be seized, and he would be charged as a criminal, or, as the Attorney-General put it last night, he would be classed with, the garroter. As a trader he would be called a traitor, or, as the deputation pointed out to his colleague, he would be regarded as a rogue and vagabond. </para>

                        <para>- In twenty-four hours this man could produce as much white lead as 100 men can produce in a year. The Bill is offering a premium to ignorance; it is keeping back the process of industrial development in Australia. I can quote other instances. At one time in Victoria there was a secret process by which white leather could be produced, and which gave a certain manufacturer a monoD01\ of the whole of the Australian trade, and threw out of work hundreds of men who had been employed at the older process. He secured a monopoly of the trade; but at length the nature of the process became known, and to-day the consumer is benefited from the fact that the monopoly has ceased to exist. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. On the last clause the Minister admitted that, because he accepted an amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney to get over a difficulty. That amendment was the best which could be introduced into a &#34;crude measure. There is only one way in which the Bill can he properly amended, and that is by striking out this clause. There are other processes of producing leather which are trade secrets. </para>

                        <para>- This clause is directed against wilfully monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, industries as between the States. Would it apply to the quarrying industry carried on at Pyrmont, in New South Wales? No stone like that quarried at Pyrmont is to be found in any other part of Australia, so that there is a monopoly which enables the proprietors to command their own price. This stone is exported to the other States bv financial and other institutions for the erection of important buildings in the principal cities, and, if this provision does apply, the effect cannot fail to be to throw hundreds of quarrymen, carters, and others out of employment in those States. The Pyrmont stone is of various qualities, one quality, which is obtained from a place called &#34;Hell-hole,&#34; being known as &#34; Hard-as-Hell &#34; ; and, as I have said, nowhere else in any part of the world can such stone be found. It is being used in the erection of the magnificent buildings for the Australian Mutual Provident Society, at the corner of William and Collins streets, Melbourne, and also for the beautiful banking establishment now raised at the corner o&#39;f North-terrace and King William-street, Adelaide. It may here be said that wherever the stone is used it beautifies. In this industry we have a real monopoly, and I ask whether it will be prohibited under the Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Mernda knows a good deal about starch, and he is aware that the importation of rice has the effect&#39; of supplanting the trade in various meals now produced in Australia. This rice is also used in the manufacture of starch; and in the latter commodity we have a monopoly which may be said to be detrimental to the public. The monopoly raises the price of starch, and already has&#39; had the effect of throwing out of employment scores of women formerly occupied in laundries. Persons who at one time could afford to send their garments to a laundry, have now, owing to the excessive price charged for colonial starch by the monopoly in Sydney and Melbourne, to wear their linen roughly washed. Is the starch monopoly to be prohibited under the provisions of the Bill ? In my opinion, the starch industry will have to &#34; go under,&#34; although it has been bolstered . up for so many years by high protective duties in Victoria. The honorable member for Northern Melbourne has told us that there is. a monopoly in the production of beer. I am aware that beer brewed at the Waverley Brewery, Sydney, and known as Resch&#39;s Lager, is taking the place, not only . of a great deal of the imported article, but also of locally-brewed beer in the various States. The effect is that men who formerly drank, in many cases, cheap, disagreeable beer, are now supplied with a better quality, but in smaller quantities. There is no doubt that the production of this lager beer will throw out of employment many men now engaged in the brewing industry throughout Australia ; and here, again, we have a clear monopoly. The beer is produced in Sydney by a firm possessed of plant that no other brewery yet commands, and experts in every branch of the business are employed. No doubt this monopoly is to the detriment of somebody, and I ask whether it will be safe under&#39; the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The very introduction of this particular beer must do an injury to somebody. It is beer which formerly could be produced only in Germany, where, I may say, it could not have attained its present excellence, but for the assistance of Pasteur. At the present moment, there is a representative of Pasteur in Australia, and the promoters of the monopoly to which I refer might invoke his assistance in order to further strengthen their position. It appears to me that under the Bill this monopoly is not safe, although it is most desirable to have a beer which is not made of glucose or other disagreeable ingredients, detrimental to health. Then, again, a process has been discovered by which, with the aid of electricity, new wine can be converted into what is commonly called old wine, with all the qualities, medicinal and otherwise, of the latter. If what is practically old wine of good quality can be supplied at a lower figure than is the commodity at present produced, tens of thousands of people must be thrown out of employment, and the effects felt by tens of thousands of others who have invested their money in the wine industry, to say nothing of the results to the growers of grapes. This process is admitted by the <inline font-style="italic">Lancet,</inline> and other authorities, to produce an article equal to good old invalid port, and that can be done in twenty-four hours. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edison</inline> has recently made a discovery that, by making a holder for electricity of certain light, tough, metal, higher force can be concentrated in the chamber, and he expects by this means to revolutionize electrical processes throughout the world. By these and similar inventions and discoveries, present machinery and methods may be rendered obsolete; and it would be interesting to know how monopolies created by such means will fare under the provisions of this Bill. The Attorney-General has accepted amendments which would not have been made except for the criticism of honorable members on this side of the chamber. </para>

How can you have a producer who is not a worker ? Is the Attorney-General always thinking of a producer as wearing a black frock-coat and a belltopper?. In drafting the Bill the honorable gentleman has gone out of his way to mention the artisan classes and I cannot see how it can be contended that a section of them would not be injured by a patented article which threw them out of employment. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable members will see at once what this extension implies. So far, we have been dealing with commodities, and have not touched a monopoly in the carriage of goods. But the carriage of goods by sea in Australia is at present in the hands of a . shipping monopoly. Complaints have been loud and bitter as to the practices of this combine. The Bill would not be complete - in fact, we should have omitted to do an act of justice to the commercial classes- - if, while seeking to restrict monopolies in respect of certain practices, we allowed another body of men who are intrusted with the carriage of goods by sea, and control about 98 per cent, of our coastwise trade, to operate injuriously to our producers. I;f we failed to legislate against such a monopoly, we should not have put our finger upon what is acknowledged to be one of the most dangerous monopolies in Australia to-day. </para>

                        <para>- If it is proved that the shipping combine is a monopoly acting in restraint of trade, we should strike at it. Under the American legislation - the Elkin Act, I think it is - provision is specifically made against the granting of deferred rebates. A few days ago a cablegram was published showing that some of the persons connected with a trust in the United States had been either lined or imprisoned for breaking the law in that regard. In case come honorable members have not familiarized themselves with this subject, I should like to refer to the report of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill in support of the amendment which I am asking the Committee to adopt. I will quote from a letter which was sent from the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce to the Prime Minister on the 9th November, 1904. Amongst other things, the following statements are made : - </para>

                    <para>I am also directed by my Council to bring under your notice a most pernicious system that has of late years grown up in shipping circles, under the name of &#34; Freight Rebates.&#34; These rebates, in fair and honest trading, are absolutely unnecessary, and in many instances are a gross injustice to consignees. Where goods are sent by a producer who is some distance from the seaboard, to be shipped by an agent at the shipping port, these rebates too often take the form of a secret commission ; and where the rebate is allowed to a shipper direct, it is granted only on the understanding that he confines his business to certain companies within his shipping ring or trust. The conditions under which this rebate is allowed are that the company, whilst collecting the freight on a <inline font-style="italic">cash</inline> basis when the goods are shipped, will only return the percentage of the freight after twelve months has elapsed, and, during which time, the shipper, as pointed out, must confine his shipments to the ring. Tn this way the shipper is not able to avail himself of any opportunity of a lower rate of freight offering by any outside company, for the reason that he is not able to afford to lose his rebate, as he would then be placed at a disadvantage as compared with his competitor. Competition in the freight market is therefore stifled. </para>

                        <para>- I think it applies to the whole of Australia. I know that it has been a burning question among the merchants of Fremantle. The letter which I have quoted sums up the position very well. Whilst this is a matter of complaint, so far as the. merchant is concerned, I question whether he suffers as much as the general public do. I believe I am correct in saying that when goods are shipped and received in this manner, the merchant disposes of-them on what is called a c.i.f. basis. Whatever it has cost him to ship the goods, is added to the price, and an equivalent amount is taken from the pockets of the general public when the goods are sold. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so. it is the consumer who really pays the re- bates; the shipping company merely making use of the power which the system gives it, as a lever to compel shippers not to ship by any competing line. So that this is not merely a matter of wrong and injustice to the commercial classes, but to the whole of our people who have to pay this surcharge - an extra 10 per cent., or whatever the amount may be - that goes to give the shipping combine its power over the shipper. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McPherson,  the representative of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce before the Commission,, illustrated by the following evidence the manner in which the rebate is worked : - 3964. Will you be good enough to explain the system ? - In 1903, when I had 300 tons of iron to ship to Fremantle, I went to the shipping people to learn the rate of freight. They held a meeting, and then they gave me a quotation. They said, &#34; You will have to pay 18s. a ton now, but in twelve months&#39; time if you confine all your shipments to the ports on the north and .the west t j the companies within the ring we shall grant you a rebate of 20 per cent.&#34; In other words, I had to leave with them a hostage of 3s. 6d. a ton on the 300 tons, and let it stay in their hands for twelve months. Had I not agreed to confine all my shipments to the association, I should have had to charge 18s. a ton for the freight of the iron, and probably I should have lost the business. Of course I said, &#34; Very well, if those are your terms I shall accept them. I shall pay thy 1 8s. per ton now.&#34; But when I quoted a price to my customer I quoted on what is known as the c.i.f. basis. I paid the freight to Fremantle, and last month I got from the shipping people a cheque for ^75. </para>

Why ? - Otherwise the bonuses, which amount to 10 per cent, on the freight of all cargo that had been shipped during the previous twelve months, would be forfeited. 24344.

I do not object to the action of the shipowners in combining. I have no wish to be unjust to them, and am prepared to give them all necessary protection. Within certain limits, combination on the part of our. shipowners may be beneficial, not only to themselves, but to shippers&#39; as well, because of its results in steadying rates and! preventing cut-throat competition. But the abuse which has taken place by reason of the adoption of a system of rebates must be ended in the interests of those who, indie long run, have to pay the piper. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLennan</inline> was asked why shippers will not use the steamers of Messrs.

                <para class="block">Although we do not wish to interfere unnecessarily with the business of the shipowners, we must protect shippers and the general public from the abuses of the rebate system. It has been argued that if we prevent ship-owners from using this means of stopping competition, there will be a repetition of the cut-throat competition of some years ago, which is said to have led to a heavy reduction in wages, and to have been the cause of most of our maritime troubles. The present rates of wages were being paid for a considerable length of time before the bonus or rebate system became what it is to-day, and, as there are, moreover, in some of the States, Arbitration Courts, which can fix rates of wages, I do not think that free competition would justify the lowering of the present rates. We cannot, however, afford to protect either wages or profits by allowing a small body of men to control the coastal shipping trade, which is a large part of the whole of the shipping trade of Australia. I hope that the Committee will prevent that, by agreeing to the amendment which I have moved. </para>

                        <para>- It will bring within the Bill other services in addition to shipping services, but I do not see that its effect will be injurious. The service rendered to the community by the carriage of commodities, though not technically an act of commerce, is substantially so, and the American Courts have universally held that transportation services form part of the trade and commerce of the country. They have, indeed, declared telegraphic services to be an instrumentality, and therefore part of its trade and commerce. The amendment has been clearly explained by the honor able member for Fremantle, to whom we are much indebted for drawing attention to the matter. The report of the Commission is very direct, and I can perceive no reason for omitting these services from the operation of the measure. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot go beyond our constitutional powers. The clause is limited in its operation to trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States, and cannot interfere with internal means of transport. It is as important to provide fair play for the transportation of goods as to secure freedom of entry for the goods into the States. It seems to me very unjust that these secret rebates should be granted. It is very hard indeed if power is used by a combine to fix a certain rate of freight, and to declare that not only the party who sends goods by other than its own vessels will be refused a rebate, but also the person who receives goods by other ships, notwithstanding that such goods may have been so forwarded without his consent or concurrence. That is a very severe penalty to impose, and one which shows the intent of the combine, which is to crush out competition. I thoroughly agree with the honorable member for Fremantle that we ought to deal with such cases, and I am very glad to have this opportunity of giving effect to the recommendation of the Shipping Commission. </para>

So far as the shipping ring is concerned, I believe a separate Act of Parliament will be required to bring it down to its proper level. At the same time I think that in this Bill we ought to indicate to the public that that combination is one which is injurious to them. So far as Western Australia is concerned there is not the least doubt that the combination in connexion with the Inter-State sea-borne traffic is exceedingly, disadvantageous to the interests of consumers.

                    11 33 ther, I say - after having listened to the testimony of a great many business men who have appeared before the Tariff Commission - that the effect of this shipping combination upon Australian industries - and especially upon those industries which are endeavouring to obtain an Inter-State trade - has been much more injurious than has any foreign competition which has been brought against them. Time and again witnesses who have appeared before the Commission with a request for the imposition of higher duties, have urged, as their justification, the fact that more is charged by way of freight between two Australian ports than is charged for bringing cargo from the other side of the world. Under these circumstances, something requires to be done, and that as early as possible. So far as the rates of freight are concerned, there is no doubt that this Bill cannot touch them. In that respect it would absolutely fail, even assuming that it were brought into play against the shipping combine in other respects. But as the Government intend to press on with the Bill, by all means let us make it as effective an indication of the need for stringent legislation upon the subject as we possibly can. For that reason I hope the Committee will agree to the amendment.

                <para class="block">This proposal forms part of a new set of amendments which I have circulated, some of which are intended to &#39;be inserted in clauses 4 and 5, with which we have already dealt. In his speech the other evening, the honorable member for Bland suggested that, inasmuch as the Government had circulated an amendment to the effect that the penalty of imprisonment should not attach to a first offence under this Bill, and that in case a conviction was recorded, power should be vested in the Court to grant an injunction to restrain the defendant from continuing to offend, the decision of any offence, in the first instance, should rest with a Justice of the High Court alone. He urged as a reason in support of his suggestion that its adoption would secure uniformity of decision. He further argued that the determination of cases would not then depend upon the particular State in which they were tried. Although I was not able to entirely agree with his argument, the necessity for considering it will be prevented by the adoption of this amendment. Apart altogether from the question of whether a jury is likely to be influenced by the locality in which it sits, there is something in the argument that we can obtain uniformity of decision by having these matters determined - in the first instance, at all events - by the High Court. Where the penalty of imprisonment is not attached, we need not make an offence an indictable one. Consequently, if we omit the word &#34; indictable,&#34; a Justice of the High Court will have power either to acquit the defendant altogether or to fine him up to &#163;500. He may further grant an injunction restraining him from continuing his offence. If subsequently the defendant commits the same offence, the case will, of course, go before a jury-. The penalty of imprisonment is retained for a second offence. I do not think that anybody will object to that. In the list of new amendments which have been circulated, it will be noticed that, as we are increasing the penalty wich may be imposed upon an individual for a second offence, we also increase it in the case of a corporation. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to direct the attention of honorable members to this very important provision. Up to the present we have very carefully provided that no man shall be attacked as a criminal unless he has a guilty mind. In other words, we say that there must be the intent to do wrong. But the honorable member for Hindmarsh pointed out that great injury might be done by allowing&#39; the operations of combinations and contracts detrimental to the public to continue. I think the dividing line should be that, if a wrong is being done, it ought to be stopped, but no man ought to be attacked as a criminal unless he has a guilty mind. So far we have protected the individual from criminal attack unless he has a guilty mind. Under clause 10, as it now stands, it might be impossible for the Court to stop the operations of the most devastating trust unless proof could be given of guilty intent. Considering the whole position, the view we have taken of the matter is that, while adhering strongly to the principle that no man ought to be attacked as a criminal unless criminal intent on his part is shown, still if there is a combination which, in fact, is in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, the Court should be able to prevent its further continuance, and to say to the parties concerned : &#34; You must not proceed, in the public interest.&#34; To that extent, we think that the Sherman Law should be adopted for civil proceedings. To give an analogy, suppose any one of us has a landed property, and some one enters upon it <inline font-style="italic">bona</inline></para>

                    and takes possession, the owner can go to Court, and, if it is found that the property is not his, the Court will restrain the trespasser merely because he is wrong. But the Court would never think of putting the man in gaol, so long as it was clear that he was an honest man. If a man appropriates property knowing that it is not his own, he is a thief ; if he takes it honestly believing it to be his, he is not, and his action is a mere civil matter. That is the principle we desire to apply in this clause. If the operations of a combination proceeding honestly, and formed without intent to do detriment to the public, are still found to be detrimental to the public, and to be breaking down industries by unfair competition, the Court should have power to stop those operations.

If the honorable gentleman owned a mine, and some one else claimed it, the Court, on hearing the whole of the facts, would grant an injunction preventing the defendant trespassing upon the mine. If the defendant, without any claim or right at all, and actuated by mere felonious intention, were to take gold from the mine, he should be convicted. All the difference between civil and criminal procedure consists in the honesty of purpose, but if the action taken results in damage to the public, and has an injurious effect, there should be a power to restrain and stop it. </para>

                        <para>- Under the American Act, it is not necessary to get a conviction. This provision, if amended as proposed, will, I think, be to the advantage of the combinations. We do not say to the public that before they can get any protection they must prosecute these people. It is an alternative method of securing the necessary protection of the public without dragging the defendant into a criminal court at all. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Court cannot do so before it decides. - The application under the clause would be to stop the combination, and the Court might say, &#34; We will not stop the combination until you convince us that it ought to be stopped.&#34; It will not be stopped until the Court has heard evidence, and has come to a conclusion that it should be, because the combination is, for instance, in the terms&#39; of the first paragraph of the proposed amendment - &#34; in restraint of trade or commerce to the detriment of the public.&#34; Until that decision is come to, the Court will do nothing, the business will go on, and there will be no power in the Attorney-General to stop any part of it. 1136 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Industries</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Preservation Bill.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I think we should not, confuse this clause with the part of the Bill dealing with dumping, with which it has nothing to do. I am speaking now of legal proceedings, and I desire to make the matter as clear as I can. If there is a combination which, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, is working: wrong, he can, without instituting any criminal proceedings at all, apply to the Court, and prove, if he is able, that the combination is operating in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, and thus he may, without entering upon any criminal proceedings, ask the Court to stop its operations. </para>

                        <para>-It might, but he could ask the Court to restrain similar proceedings in future. That would not be to the detriment of the defendant in any way. It is necessary, I think, to protect the public. The Attorney-General may not desire to prove intent to the detriment of the public, but merely to prove that there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> a certain combination in restraint of trade, and the Court might then grant an injunction. Here we desire to provide that if there is a restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, the Court may exercise the same power as is exercised in America in similar circumstances. I think that that is the proper course to pursue. I forgot to mention that the proposed amendment includes a proviso, the meaning of which is simply that in order to keep within our constitutional powers we distinctly say what they are.

                    1137 all that he is doing here is to make it possible for him to also deal with a man in a criminal way. That punishment is to be meted out to individuals in connexion with the whole of these operations is a small circumstance as compared with the restraints on these nefarious businesses. It is conceivable that they might apply to two different classes of cases. It is possible, I should say very probable, that unless an alteration be made in the dumping clauses they would be made to apply to the same class of cases. No matter how wrong the importation might be, still it would be an importation which operated in an unfair competitive way to the dislocation of our industries, and all the rest of it.

                        <para>- It ought to be made absolutely clear that an injunction could not be obtained to restrain parties from continuing the operations complained of until judgment had been given. Otherwise, absolutely guiltless persons might have restraints put upon them in the conduct of their business, and that might mean serious loss, in some cases- ruin. I am sure 1 138 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Industries</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Preservation Bill.</inline> that the Attorney-General will see the desirability of avoiding a danger of that sort. He will have a successor, however long he may occupy his office ; and he should make provision to prevent a successor from doing what, in his view, would be improper. At any rate, if he does not make that provision now, I think that he might give the Committee the opportunity of again considering the clause, and in the meantime draft a provision which would be a safeguard in that respect, and yet would place no restriction upon the proper operation of the Act. It would be a very serious position if an injunction could be granted before judgment. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that there is no limitation as to when an injunction could be applied for and granted. It should be made quite clear that it could only foe granted after judgment had been declared. It would be a very serious thing if, in addition to the interference which the Bill naturally &#34; created, there should be destruction of business where a man was found afterwards not to be guilty at all. </para>

If there has been no conviction, one will have to start proceedings, and have the whole thing heard and determined. But if there has been a conviction, an injunction may be applied for at once, without going through the formality of new proceedings. </para>
