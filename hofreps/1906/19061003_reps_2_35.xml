            <para>- I wish to refer the Minister of Home Affairs to replies published in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to questions asked last night by Mr.Prendergast in reference to the carriage of coal on the Victorian railways. Apparently, between Jumbunna and Melbourne, the charges are 1s. 7d. per ton less for Victorian coal than for New South Wales coal, while between Melbourne and Ballarat or Bendigo the consignor or consignee is charged 8s.5d. for Newcastle coal, but only 7s. 8d. for Victorian coal, the balance being made up by the Victorian Government. Does he consider these rates a breach of the provisions of the Constitution, seeing that the Government of Victoria is practically paying a bounty to the State coal industry ? </para>

The subject of railway charges was brought up by the honorable member for Angas, who referred certain instances to us ; and although we have been informed by the Railways Commissioners of the States that there is nothing in their charges contrary to the Constitution, the Department is looking into the whole question. </para>

          <para>.- I think that it is a great mistake to insert such provisions in Bills dealing with only one or two items in the Tariff. When the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was under consideration, I moved in the direction of inserting a provision similar to this, because that measure professed to protect labour engaged in Australian industries generally. It was appropriate that we should make express provision of this kind when we were passing a. law of general application, but now we are dealing with one or two special lines in the Tariff. If it is found that protection fails to secure proper labour conditions for the workers, and it is necessaryto make special provision in that direction, we should pass a law which would be applicable to all industries enjoying the advantage of protective duties. Ministers have not initiated any of the provisions for the protection of labour that have found their way into our legislation. I made one proposal in that direction, and in other cases the initiative was taken by members of the Tariff Commission. Instead of adopting, as one of the necessary concomitants of a protectionist policy, a general provision for the protection of all labour, Ministers are dabbling with the Tariff and inserting special provisions, which, owing to their restricted application, will become ridiculous. If this provision is, inserted, a staff of inspectors will have to be employed to insure that proper wages are paid and proper conditions are observed in particular manufacturing industries. I think that it is a mistake to lay upon the Administration the necessity of employing a special class of officers whose duties will be restricted to one or two industries. Although I do not object to the spirit of the amendment,I think that the Minister, when he found how the wind was blowing, should have introduced a Bill declaring that whenever protection is given to an industry fair rates of wages shall obtain. </para>

          <para>. -I agree with the honorable and learned member for Angas. No one objects to the employes having assured to them fair rates of wages and good conditions of employment. But the question is whether we are adopting the proper means to bring about that result. It is now proposed to set up two different classes of conditions for employment throughout the length and breadth of Australia. One set of employers, whilst obtaining every advantage that the Tariff can give them, will be under no obligation to pay fair wages, and to otherwise treat their employes with reasonable consideration, whilst other employers will be required to subscribe to such conditions. We should endeavour to make our Commonwealth legislation apply fairly all round. In spite of the fundamental principle of the Constitution that there shall be no distinction such as that now proposed to be made, we are busily engaged in the closing hours of this Parliament in making fish of one set of industrials and flesh of another. This proposal involves a very grave departure from anything that has been done in Australia before, and I do not think that it should be brought forward in the dying hours of this Parliament. The Government have apparently made up their minds that all this kind of legislation must be pushed through without consideration and without discussion. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the honorable member does not care twopence how the provision applies. I am pointing out that it ought to be made to apply all round. The honorable member for Yarra has not proposed anything of that kind. He is content to allow anomalous conditions to continue. We are embodying in every measure of this kind provision for a minature tribunal for the determination of wages and the conditions under which certain industries are carried on. I think that some intelligent plan should be adopted for placing all the industries of the Commonwealth on the same footing. </para>

            <para>- I am afraid that the honorable member for Yarra cannot appreciate the advantage of providing for the general application of a principle. He seizes hold of that which is uppermost at the moment, and is only careful to see that the principle is applied to the extent to which he is personally interested. I contend that this Parliament has a higher duty to discharge. However, I can do no more than point out that this is a piecemeal way of legislating, and the manner in which these measures are being rushed through without fair and full consideration. Nothing could be more important than this proposal, to the principle of which I have no objection. I am merely concerned as to its application. We have no right to impose conditions of this kind, having a partial application. I shall not vote against the amendment. </para>

            <para>- That is ancient history. The Minister will have to work for many years along present lines before he will be able to make amends for all his former bitter, keen, and unrelenting opposition to every proposal for the benefit of labour. I say again that I do not think this proposal ought to be rushed through the House without honorable members being afforded time to consider it. My point is that the conditions embodied in the amendment ought to have a very much wider application, if they are to be applied. They ought not to apply only to industries upon which we are supposed to be conferring a special advantage. </para>

        <para>Mr.FISHER.- If it had not, there would be no complaint. The honorable member for Parramatta admits that the proposal is a good one, but says that, from the stand-point of the Government, it is only good in a particular instance. That is the attitude which is taken up by every Conservative in every Parliament. They say. &#34; This is a good thing, but it does not go far enough.&#34; That attitude represents the first string to every Conservative bow. </para>

All we say is, &#34; Here are manufacturers carrying on operations under certain favoured conditions which have been prescribed by Parliament, and every one of their workmen shall receive a share of the benefit which they enjoy.&#34; We are not so bigoted as to say that, because all the employes are not unionists, they shall not participate in the same advantages. What we say is that fair conditions shall obtain in those industries which are protected. That is a position which, from my point of view, is incontrovertible. It is sound in every particular. That it does not go far enough, I regret equally with members of the Opposition, but I will not reject a good proposal simply upon that ground. </para>

          <para>. - I accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Wide Bay that we should view this proposal from the standpoint of its merits. I am inclined to think that if we look at it closely we shall see that it is absolutely unworkable. Under its operation, if the distillers do not employ sufficient men, or if they employ too many boys, they will be denied the concession proposed to be conferred upon them in the form of a lower rate of Excise. Let us suppose that at some future time the fact is brought under the attention of Parliament that distillers A, B, C, and D have failed to pay a reasonable wage to their employes, or have employed too many boys, whilst distiller F has complied with all the conditions prescribed by us. Under the operation of the amendment, distiller F would be prevented from paying only the lighter rate of Excise. </para>

        <para class="block">Obviously that refers to all those who are engaged in distilling. If the Minister desires that those who comply with the conditions shall receive a benefit, he will certainly need to alter the language of the amendment. Otherwise, if one distiller complied with all the conditions prescribed, and the vast majority of the manufacturers did not, the heavier rate of Excise would have to be imposed upon the whole of them. Upon a previous occasion I addressed myself to the question of the expediency of adopting what is known as the &#34;new protection.&#34; I say at once that, if we are to adopt a new form of protection, under which concessions are to be given to the manufacturers only upon condition that the operatives employed by them participate in the advantages conferred, it is open to free-traders to consider whether there is not some merit in the proposal. I am perfectly free to approach such a proposal with an open mind. At the same time there is a good deal of force in the contention of the honorable member for Parramatta, that it is not just to enact laws to improve the social conditions of only a section of the workers. But I ask the Minister whether the language of the amendment - if it be adopted - will not create a very serious difficulty? If a large majority of the distillers fail to comply with the Act, and in all its details, and a minority do comply with it, it seems to me that the latter will be prevented from enjoying the benefit which it is intended to confer upon them. Its effect will be quite contrary to what is anticipated. It will penalize the individual who does extend good conditions of labour to his employes. I ask the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne to consider whether the language of the proposal will not make the whole principle underlying it inoperative? Does it not require to be amended in order to make the intention of the Legislature clearer, and to enable effect to be given to that intention? </para>

          <para>.- I trust that the Minister will look into the objection which has been urged by the honorable member for South Sydney, because I am one of those who desire to see the amendment made workable. For years past I have opposed the imposition of protective duties, because in their incidence they benefit only a few individuals at the expense of the rest of the community.

            <para>- I have not. I am quite able to answer to my constituents for any of my political actions. My great objection to protective duties has always been that they benefit the employers, whilst they confer no advantage upon the workers. I recognise that the object of the amendment is to insure good conditions of labour for employes in the distilling industry. That represents an instalment of a good principle. As I understood him, the complaint of the deputy leader of the Opposition was that similar treatment was not extended to all workers. The proposal represents what is called the &#34; new &#34; protection. That term, however, is in the nature of a mere afterthought. I can well remember the days when protectionists advocated pure, unadulterated protection. , Subsequently they pleaded for a discriminating protection, and now, in the dying hours of this Parliament, we are faced with what is called the &#34;new&#34; protection. I heartily support the amendment. Although I am a member of the Opposition, I do not forget that a man can be a free-trader and a radical. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that it is to be regretted that the application of this principle is not universal. He must remember, however, that industrial legislation is by no means universal. We have industrial protection in Victoria, and, to some extent, in New South Wales, and one or two other States, but there are some States in which no such protection exists. This amendment will place on a level the manufacturers of spirits throughout the States, and, in that respect, will certainly be an improvement on the existing state of affairs. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that it is the best way of securing that which we desire. If we are to have a thorough, complete, and satisfactory system of industrial protection, the Parliament which grants protection to the employer must have power to extend industrial protection to the worker. I am supporting this proposal largely because I think it will impel that change. </para>

            <para>- By the fact that the proposed system will prove cumbersome and difficult to apply. I am so anxious to protect the worker that I am prepared to avail myself of even an expedient of this kind to bring about a thorough reform. I regret that in many respects this amendment is not the most desirable means of securing the end we have in view, but it is certainly better than nothing at all, and should be supported. I am not a distillery man. My attitude towards the drink traffic is well known; but I do not think the distillers will complain about this provision. I have not heard a whisper of complaint, and since this condition will apply to distillers all over the Commonwealth, it should, in that respect, prove advantageous. It is also to be remembered that employers cannot be expected to observe the eight hours principle, and give what are called fair wages unless they have something like adequate protection. A very striking feature of this proposal is that whilst under it the conditions which we all favour will be applied to the industry, the protection which the Tariff. Commission deems adequate will be reduced. It is nonsense to talk about securing protection for the workers unless we can first find work for them. Adequate and effective protection must be a preliminary to protecting the employe. I hope that, notwithstanding the difficulties to which attention has been directed, this principle will be affirmed; that we shall apply it whenever the opportunity offers, and that our action to-day will be the forerunner of provision being made to enable this Parliament to regulate industrial conditions as well as to grant protection to the emplover. </para>

          <para>.- I thoroughly believe in the principle that when we grant adequate protection to the manufacturer, we should provide that a proper proportion of that protection shall go to the workers; but I think that fragmentary legislation of the description now under consideration is highly objectionable. I am not going to vote against any principle in which I believe; but I would point out to the Minister that we are at present engaged, not in framing, a new Tariff, but in endeavouring to redress grievances existing under the present Tariff. It seems to me highly objectionable that in raising the protection granted to a few manufacturers to the level of that enjoyed by other industries, we should seek to impose upon them conditions that are not applied to the others. </para>

            <para>- We are now dealing with only a few exceptional cases. We were engaged for more than twelve months in framing a protective Tariff to apply to the great bulk of our industries, and I hold that any provision we make to secure to labour its fair share of the protection accorded these industries should have a general application. I am in thorough accord with the spirit of the amendment, but think it is a mistake that the principle should be applied to these few individual cases, lt will be found difficult to administer, and we shall have to appoint officers to superintend its application to a few cases, when we might as well apply it to the whole of the protected industries of Australia. </para>

          <para>. - I am free to admit that if I were in charge of the Bill I should think this a wrong way of instituting a system of protection in favour of the employes. I quite admit that the proposed application of a principle to only one industry is generally inexpedient, but, at the same time, I think that the mere insertion of a provision of this sort in the Bill, as a condition precedent to granting protection to the distillers, will&#34; have a very wholesome effect upon all industries. I feel as strongly as does any honorable member that no industry should be protected unless the workers in it are fairly used. I well recollect what happened in connexion with an analogous case in the Victorian Parliament. In dealing with a Bill providing for the construction of certain railways we inserted a clause declaring that the lines should not be constructed unless a minimum wage were paid to those engaged upon the work. When the clause was submitted to the House, it was urged then, as it is to-3ay, that it was wrong to apply to the construction of one railway a principle that had not been applied to others. We insisted, however, in making this provision, and the result was that a similar clause was inserted in all succeeding Railways Bills. This had an effect upon the wages paid generally by the Railway Department, and in turn had an effect on outside industries. I take it that it is well for a Parliament to say, when giving protection to any industry, exactly what it desires. The honorable member for South Sydney appealed to me to express my opinion of his criticism of the amendment. I think his view is correct that the effect of it is that the order made bv the GovernorGeneral in Council must apply generally to those who pay fair wages, and those who do not. That, I am sure, is not the object of another place, nor the end we have in view. If. as the honorable member for South Sydney has said, six out of seven distillers observed these conditions, I do not think we should desire to deprive the six of this protection because of the action of the seventh. I have, therefore, suggested to the Minister a slight variation of the amendment, which I trust he will agree to. It would have the effect of enabling the Governor-General in Council to take away the protection only from those distillers who failed to comply with what Parliament deems to be fair conditions of labour. There will be no difficulty in regard to the verbiage. The matter is one for the Committee to decide, but if the Minister has accepted, as I understand he has, the principle of the amendment, I think the way I have suggested is the only one by which if can be properly applied. If six distillers comply with the fair conditions of labour, and the seventh does not, then the latter only should be deprived of the benefits of the protection granted the industry. At this stage of the session, I do not think it is worth while for us to consider the question of whether this will have any direct effect upon industries. It certainly will do no harm, and, as I have already said, it will have the effect of indicating what is the strong wish of the Parliament, that where protection is granted to an industry, the workers in that industry should also be protected. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HENRY</inline>WILLIS (Robertson) &#163;3-3&#176;&#93;- - It is to be regretted that we are unable to complete the work commenced by the Government. It shows that free-trade writers are not far wrong when they say that it is because we cannot protect every one that protection is a bad thing. The speeches which have been made by those who have preceded me go to show that, while many persons will be protected in their industry others will not. The manufacturers in the particular industry immediately concerned by the amendment make a profit of ^18,000 a year, and it borders on absurdity to propose to protect them further. It is admitted that they have not a reputation for paying adequate wages, or for being satisfied with a reasonable number of hours&#39; work a day, while they have not been brought under the operation of the Wages Board system, which, in my opinion, is better for the protection of the workers than the Arbitration Acts which have been tried elsewhere. We are asked to give protection to an industry in which possibly 500 workers are employed; but it is forgotten that probably 200,000 persons in and around Melbourne are entirely unprotected. The masses are to be taxed excessively to provide increased protection for so-called languishing industries, which return handsome profits, and which the evidence of the Tariff Commission shows require no protection. The facts are that spirit can be obtained for 6d. per gallon, and sold for 24s. a gallon, though the distillers say that it costs them 9d. </para>

            <para>-I do not think so. If every one were protected we should soon have universal free-trade, though I am afraid that attempts to secure the protection of&#34; all classes are doomed to failure. But as Parliament has decided upon protecting certain industries, it is our duty to see that legislation is passed which will enable the employes engaged in those industries, as well as the manufacturers to share in its benefits. We ought to see that the highest rates of wages are paid to workmen in protected industries. To properly carry out the protective policy we must protect, not only the manufacturers who reap the profits, but their workmen as well. </para>

          <para>. - I recognisethat if conditions like this under discussion are attached to all Tariff proposals, the complications and difficulties which will arise will make the demands for protection much fewer than they have been up to the present time, and manufacturers will be less ready to ask for assistance from the public purse. For that reason, as a free-trader, I am rather favorably disposed towards the amendment. But looking at the matter from a broader aspect. I feel that Tariff and Excise Bills should not be used for this enactment of industrial laws. Not only is this proposal foreign to the main intention of the measure, but it does not provide an effective way of dealing with the subject,  if  it is intended to treat all industries in the States alike. It may not be ineffective in respect to the comparatively small industry dealt with by the Bill, but the great bulk of our industries cannot be dealt with in a similar manner. Therefore it should be omitted, unless honorable members are ready to affirm that they are in favour of unequal legislation. How can industries which are not protected be affected by legislation of this kind? They cannot be dealt with, and thus this legislation is unequal. Therefore I object to the provision. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has made a suggestion to the Minister, of which I doubt the constitutionality. </para>

            <para>- As the point is almost certain to be tested, the Minister should hold a clear opinion  on  the subject before adopting the suggestion. The honorable and learned member was quite right in urging that all the distillers should not be mulcted by the imposition of special rates of Excise because one of their number is not complying with this provision. He has therefore proposed that the Ministry should take power to impose special Excise in regard only to the productions of any offender. Such a provision, it seems to me, would be at variance with the spirit and the letter of the Constitution. We should be imposing taxation discriminating between one taxpayer and another to effect a purpose beyond our constitutional sphere - an interference in industrial matters, with the object of regulating the rates of wages paid ina certain industry. We are not given by the Constitution the power to interfere in industrial matters, except in regard to Inter-State disputes. We are endeavouring to exercise a power which has not been granted to us by the Constitution. We are attempting to differentiate between the amount of duty which should be paid by one man and that for which another should be liable. I feel satisfied that the High Court would never sustain our position. It would hold that we might deal with a trade, or production, as a whole, or might impose certain conditions in connexion with duties, but that we could not charge one rate of duty&#39; to one man, and an entirely different rate to another. I cannot conceive that the proposal is constitutional. I trust that the .Minister will consider this point very carefully. In none but our recent proposals relating to Customs or Excise duties have any differential rates of duty been suggested, and I think that Ministers would do well to hesitate before accepting the proposal now before us. We are acting in an almost hysterical manner. We have no right to deal with this important question in connexion with any stray measure which may be thrown upon the table in the last hours of this Parliament. The whole question should be faced in its relation to all our industries. Our powers should be careful I v examined, the best methods of attaining our ends should be considered, and action should be taken, not in an isolated instance, such as this, but according to some general plan which would equalize conditions all round. It has been stated that we are making a beginning. But is it right that we should begin by establishing an inequality ? We should examine the whole sphere of our legislation, and pass a measure covering the whole ground, and providing for equality of treatment. No wonder that reflections are passed upon us, when we lightly consent to the introduction of important provisions in such a haphazard fashion. Viewing the matter from one aspect, I am pleased that those persons who have declared that the necessity for granting them more protection is due to the fact that they have to pay high wages - although very often when they obtain assistance, they do not pay high wages, but reduce the rates previously prevailing - are going to carry some of the burden themselves. I trust that if this policy is pushed sufficiently far, a reaction will set in, and that those who are now so anxious for protection will say, &#34; Save us from your favours, because they are anything but beneficial to us.&#34; That would be a desirable result. I protest against our legislating in a way to bring about inequality and injustice. </para>

          <para>. - Honorable members have objected to the proposed amendment on the ground that its application would be partial. It has been pointed out that similar provision has been made in regard to only a few items which. have been dealt with by legislation this session. I should like to know how this question could otherwise be introduced at this period. Should we, so far as the matters with which we have already dealt are concerned, fail to provide for that protection of the workers, which honorable members opposite profess to be so anxious to secure? They say that this is not the time to take action. I contend that such action should be taken whenever opportunity offers, and that provision of this kind must be made in a piecemeal fashion when it cannot be done in a wholesale way. When the general question of Tariff revision engages our attention, as it probably will, in the new Parliament, I shall do my best to see thatsimilar conditions are applied to all industries. </para>

            <para>- I shall be here, and very much alive too, although some honorable members are doing their best to prevent me coming back here. I propose to accept the provision, because I look upon the principle embodied in it as a good one. I do not think that any difficulty will be experienced in the work of administration. I thoroughly approve of the suggestion made by the honorable member for South Sydney. I have consulted the AttorneyGeneral, the Prime Minister, and the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who are of opinion that it would be absolutely constitutional. I propose, therefore, to leave out the word &#34;the&#34; in the first line, and to insert the word &#34; any.&#34; The first words of the proviso will then read, &#34; Provided further, that if any distiller.&#34; Then I propose to add to the proviso the words, &#34; as regards such distiller.&#34;. This will enable us to avoid inflicting injury upon distillers who may be disposed to comply with the conditions set forth when others may not be so disposed. That will meet the objection of the honorable member for South Sydney, and will make the amendment work much more equitably than it would have done in its original form. </para>

          <para>.- It has been urged by some honorable members opposite that the amendment would work injustice, and would apply unequally. That seems to me to be a most remarkable contention. I would point out to the honorable member for North Sydney that, in this Bill, we are not dealing with the whole of the manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth. Parliament has not dealt unjustly with any industry, because, wherever an increased measure of protection has been granted, this provision, or a similar one, has accompanied it. Therefore, it is absurd to talk about injustice having been done. If a dozen needy men applied to the honorable member for assistance, and he helped two of them, his action would not be an unjust one. </para>

            <para>- It certainly would not be unjust to the remainder. The fact that conditions are unequal does not constitute an injustice. All manufacturers derive some advantage from protective duties, and in the proposal under consideration we are merely Taying down the principle that their employes shall share in the benefits which they enjoy. The injustice of which the honorable member complains would apply to the different measure of protection which has been extended to various industries. According to his dictum, the same rates of duty should be applicable all round. </para>

            <para>- Certainly. It is the way in which every bit of legislation has been enacted. A beginning must be made somewhere. To argue that the amendment is unfair, because it cannot be extended to everybody, is ridiculous. The party with which the honorable member for North Sydney is allied were most pronounced in their desire to exempt agriculturists from the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>

            <para>- In these matters the Minister generally rings pretty true. When the Tariff is revised during the next Parliament, I am of opinion that the principle which we are now laying down ought to be extended to other industries. The objection of the honorable member for South Sydnev that, under the amendment, a number of distillers might be injured bv the action of one or two was a reasonable one, and the proposal in, its present form is a great improvement upon the amendment as it reached us from the Senate. I am sure that the distillers of Australia will not raise the slightest objection to it. It is only those who refuse to pay reasonable wages, or who favour the employment of boy labour, who will be required to pay the higher rates of Excise. There can be no injustice done to those who comply with what may be called standard conditions. We may be quite certain that the additional Excise of is. per gallon will not be collected at all* because the manufacturers will comply with the prescribed conditions as a matter of course. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KNOX</inline>(Kooyong &#91;4.13&#93;. - I do not take exception to the amendment of the Senate upon the ground that it is objectionable because it is not to have a general application. I am free to admit that I personally favour the principle which is embodied in the amendment, and hope to see it justly applied hereafter. But if it is intended in this piecemeal fashion to incorporate great principles in our legislation, I think that we shall be doing an injustice to the whole of the Commonwealth. This great question might have been dealt with at a more opportune period, namely, when the whole Tariff is under review. At that time it could be dealt with in a broad way. Had that course been adopted, the whole merits of the question .would have received consideration, and, judging by the temper of the Committee, I think that the principle would be generally supported. I * enter my protest against the slipping into this Bill of an important principle which was never dreamt of by the Government when they introduced the Bill. The probability is that the power on  which the Government rely at the present time insisted &#39;upon its insertion, and that, consequently, they are prepared to support it. </para>

          <para>- Unfortunately, our legislation is of a patchwork character, and there is no consistency of principle underlying it. The principle that the worker, as well as the manufacturer, shall receive a, share of the protection granted to the industry is one that I favour, and it has caused me to alter my attitude in connexion with the general question of protection. I feel, however, that, in this case, influence has been brought to bear upon the Government, and that they are lending themselves to an irregular proposal, which they ought to resist. We should deal with a principle of this kind when an opportunity is given for its general application in an equitable way. I do not attach as much weight as the honorable member for North Sydney has done to the objection which he raised ; but I do think that this is a patchwork proposal. The people will have to search from one end of the statute-book to the other in order to ascertain the extent of the restrictions placed upon them in their daily life and business. I repeat that I favour the principle underlying the amendment, but think it unfortunate that the Government did not embody it in the Bill as introduced. Had that course been followed, the question, instead of being dealt with by this House that is rapidly becoming moribund, on an amendment made by another place, would have received full and proper consideration. </para>

            <para>- Free-traders have always insisted that when protection is granted in response to the cry of manufacturers that it is necessary to enable them to pay fair wages and observe reasonable conditions of labour,, the employes should receive a legitimate share of the benefit of that protection. Hitherto, however, protectionists have been opposed to anything of the kind, and it is only within the last two or three months that protectionist politicians have begun to espouse the principle. We now find them, so far as this matter is concerned, stealing the clothes of the free-trade party. I do not begrudge them this new-born zeal, because I recognise that if we make provision for the payment of proper wages and the observance of reasonable conditions of labour in protected industries, we shall hear less and less of the cry of the manufacturers for protection, and shall see less and less of that lobbying which has always been conspicuous in connexion with the passing of Tariff legislation by this and other Legislatures. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is reported to be feeling very dissatisfied -because of the conditions that we imposed in the Tariff, Bill relating to stripper-harvesters. </para>

The honorable gentleman took up a characteristic attitude when he claimed credit for the insertion of an amendment with which he had really nothing to do. If honorable members opposite thought so highly of this principle, why did they not seek to embody it in the Bid before it was sent up to another place? The Minister and his enthusiastic supporters are seeking to cover themselves with glory, and to secure praise and credit to which they are not entitled. </para>

            <para>- Again the Minister is wrong, and is taking credit to himself for what was done by the House at the instance of another honorable member. The principle is to be applied to two industries. I do not suppose that more than 100 hands will be affected by this amendment. There are only twelve men employed in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s distilllery, which has the largest output of any distillery in the Commonwealth, and in some of the Victorian distilleries not more than halfadozen hands are employed. In these circumstances, therefore, only a handful of workers will be affected. So all this blowing of trumpets and great parade of interest in the welfare of the workers is purest humbug on the Minister&#39;s part. What is to be done to secure compliance with these conditions? Notwithstanding that the labour conditions are not complied with in the protected industry, the duties cannot be interfered with except on action taken by the Governor-General, who, only ! after the tedious and cumbersome process of a joint address from the Senate and House of Representatives, may impose an additional Excise duty of is. per gallon. The whole matter must first be threshed out in both Houses. If the Minister is reallyanxious that <inline font-style="italic">effect</inline> shall be given to this principle, why does he propose that complicated machinery must be put into operation to enforce it? Is the Parliament to become a wages board to inquire into the conditions of labour, and wages paid in the industry ? How is the Parliament to be made cognisant of the fact that fair wages are not paid? </para>

            <para>-*-If the Ministry were sincere in this matter, they would bring in a Bill applying a principle of this sort to all the industries which enjoy the benefit of protection; but I shall be very much surprised if they do so. The proposal is merely another electioneering placard, such as has been put before the public so frequently of late. It is farcical only to apply this principle to the very small number of employes in the industry under discussion - who, I am informed, do not number more than 100 - and leave hundreds of thousands unaffected. I have no fault to find with the principle itself. . In my opinion, it should be applied to all industries, so that the workers may receive higher wages and enjoy better conditions, and thus get some return for the immense load of taxation now imposed on them for the benefit of the manufacturers. If t&#39;he principle is extended, and made to apply to industries employing thousands of hands, the Joshuas, McKays, and other hungry manufacturers who now are continually, like Oliver Twist, but without the same excuse, &#34; asking for more,&#34; will be seen in the lobbies very rarely; the cry for higher protection will gradually cease, and there will be a general healthy demand for free-trade. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but there are other members of the Commission. We understood, in the first instance, that we were accepting the whole of the recommendations of the Commission, but only some of them were adopted. Some of the conditions suggested have a very important bearing upon the incidence of the proposed duty. Under present circumstances, and at this stage of the session, it is impossible to get fair consideration, but in view of the fact that the Bill may be jeopardized if we do not accede to this request, I suggest that the alteration should be agreed to. Personally, I do not think that the local distillers need any more than the allowance provided for. I feel sure that the Senate will persist in its request. </para>

          <para>. - I recognise the political force of the argument used by the honorable member, but find that, by increasing the duty as proposed to 12s., we should place blended whisky upon exactly the same level as rum. The latter spirit is distilled from a by-product, which costs nothing, whereas whisky is made from grain, which is an expensive material. In addition to that, there is the condition in connexion with blended whisky that 25 per cent. shall be pure barley malt spirit. If the duty is raised, an undue advantage will be given to rum distillers over those who make blended whisky. I think that there is good ground for keeping the distinction first proposed by the Tariff Commission. </para>

          <para>. - If honorable members will turn to the fourth volume of the Statutes, they will find, at page 81, an &#34; Act to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1902.&#34; Section 2 contains the following proviso :  - </para>

          <para>Provided that this Act shall not apply to or affect the duty imposed by the Excise Tariff 1902 upon sugar produced from cane grown and delivered for manufacture before the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and seven. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">According to the proviso quoted, cane produced in 1906, but not converted into sugar until 1907, would have to pay Excise duty at the rate of &#163;4, instead of  &#163;5  per ton. That was not the intention of honorable  members at the time that the Act was passed, and we therefore propose to make the position perfectly clear by substituting the following new proviso: - &#34; Provided that the duty of excise payable on sugar produced from cane delivered for manufacture before the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and seven, shall be three-fourths of the aforesaid rate.&#34; </para>

          <para>- By way of personal ex planation, I must admit that to-day I failed to consult the  deputy  leader of the Opposition - as I should have done - before making any alteration in the order of business. The change was made to meet the wish of my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs. It was only after I entered the Chamber that he informed me of his special desire to deal with the measure which we have been discussing. Now that the  deputy  leader of the Opposition is in his place, it is due to him that I should make this acknowledgment, and that I should add that he was perfectly justified in making his complaint. That change in the order of business was proposed just as we met at the urgent request of my colleague, who believed that the consideration of the Senate&#39;s amendments in the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Bill would occupy only a few minutes. </para>

          <para>I wish to say that it represents another addition to an existing law. Honorable members will recollect that under the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1 901 the deportation of those labourers will commence after the 31st December of this year, after which date they cannot be employed in the Commonwealth under any agreement. Inasmuch as they cannot be employed at any time without an agreement, it follows that as the law at present stands they cannot be employed at all while awaiting deportation immediately after the 31st December next. Any delay which may occur in providing them with the means of transportation would mean their enforced idleness. They would not be able to maintain themselves, and unless they were maintained by us would require to consume whatever savings they may have made in Australia. Consequently, we propose to ask the House to pass this measure, which makes two alterations in the existing law. After section 8 of the principal Act, we propose to insert a provision enabling the Minister to grant a certificate to any Pacific Island labourer, exempting him from all or any of the provisions of that Act. To that general provision are attached two sub-clauses providing two classes of certificates. The first is intended to aid in the identification of Pacific Island labourers who, under the Queensland or any other law, are entitled to remain in the Commonwealth. We propose to issue to them what may be called a &#34;permanent&#34; certificate. That certificate will prove their title to remain should their presence here ever be questioned. The intention, therefore, is to enable every kanaka entitled to reside in Australia to establish the fact by production of his permanent certificate. </para>

              <para>- The uncontested cases are under the Queensland Act of 1884, which required a five years residence, making now twenty-seven years. But it is generally recognised that where a kanaka has been in Queensland for more than twenty years, and has settled down, it is undesirable to remove him. The Islanders will be dealt with individually upon the report of the officers, which will fully set out the grounds upon which any one of them obtains his certificate. </para>

              <para>- No kanaka who marries hereafter will be exempt from the provisions of the principal Act. The permanent certificate is intended to identify those who are entitled to remain in Queensland as long as they please. Then we provide for the issue of special certificates, which will enable kanakas to be employed under an agreement between the 31st December next and 30th June following. We are arranging with a shipping company that their boats shall call regularly at the various ports, and the special certificates which will be issued will, as far as possible, be timed to provide a full passenger list for these vessels. Thus a Pacific Island labourer will be enabled to know approximately the clay upon which hrs ship will be ready to receive him. That provision will confer a benefit upon the kanakas themselves, inasmuch as it will prevent their savings from being dissipated, and it will benefit the residents at the various ports, who might otherwise be embarrassed by the presence of a number of Islanders waiting for the vessels by which they are tobe deported. The issue of the certificates, whether general or special, is safeguarded in sub-clause 3 by a power which is vested in the Minister to cancel them at any time. </para>

            <para>. - I absolutely concurin the proposals embodied in this Bill. It seems tome that they are dictated only by a humane spirit. Upon the very lowest grounds of humanity they represent the least that we can do for a class of people who have been seriously affected by the legislation which we have passed, and which has evidently been found to be of too drastic a character. I do not mean to suggest that it has been too drastic in regard to its general application- </para>

              <para>- Exactly. These people are to be deported, and it devolves upon us, on the grounds of common humanity, to render their departure as complete and as easy as possible. Where marriages have been contracted, they should be honored, and where other engagements have been made, which make it impossible for us to deport the kanakas without outraging considerations of common humanity, we must allow them to remain here if they choose to do so. I am glad that the measure has been introduced, and I hope that the Government will adopt a humane course in respect of these people against whose employment our legislation has been directed. </para>

            <para>. - Of  course the Pacific Islanders will not be retained in the Commonwealth in idleness after the 31st December next. It is presumed that they will accept engagements. I do not know whether it is intended to enforce that provision of the Act under which anybody who employs a Pacific island labourer except under agreement, will be liable to summary conviction. </para>

          <para>.- It seems to me that the Government are yielding unnecessarily to outside clamour in submitting this Bill, which is something in the nature of panic legislation. There has-been some little demand in Melbourne for a Bill of this kind, but I scarcely think that the Government are justified in proposing to apply such legislation without occasion to all the States. If a man is not to be permitted to use a telephone for the purpose of making a bet, I fail to see why we should allow the telephone to be used in connexion with gambling on the Stock Exchange. There is no essential difference between the two transactions. The honorable member for Kooyong knows that the illegitimate gambling transactions which take place on the Stock Exchange are quite as numerous as thosewhich occur elsewhere. I am not an advocate of the gambling fraternity. I do not know one of them. I have never made a bet on a horse race that I can remember. </para>

            <para>- But it may be. said outside, if not here, that I amin sympathy with the gambling fraternity. As I never attend a race meeting, and do not bet, it  cannot be truthfully said that I hold a brief for those who do. I am aware, however, that on the Stock Exchange shares are sold by men who do not hold them, and never expect to hold them for any length of time. The use of the telephone in connexion with such transactions, however, is permitted. I do not think that we should give the Postmaster-General power to disconnect a telephone merely because, as provided in this clause, &#39;he &#34; has reasonable grounds &#34; to suppose that it is being used in furtherance of gaming or betting, or any illegal or immoral purpose. Something more than reasonable suspicion should be required. Even assuming that gambling has an injurious effect on the community, I think we ought to provide that, before taking this step, the PostmasterGeneral shall be satisfied by such proof as would be required by a court of law that the telephone is being used for betting or illegal or immoral purposes. I for one shall not, at the present stage, vote for this provision. It is, to say the least, singular that the deputy leader of the Opposition and others who frequently complain of legislation being rushed through at the fag-end of the session, when members have lost interest in the business of the House, have not a word to say in opposition to this proposal, which means a serious invasion of the liberty of the subject, and is sought to be rushed through the House without reasonable consideration. I think the clause should be amended in the way I have suggested, and that we should also require the Postmaster- General to give notice of intention to disconnect a telephone from the Exchange. Under the clause as it stands, it would be open to the Minister or his officers, on being informed that a telephone is being used for betting purposes, to cut it off without warning to the subscriber. That is not a- reasonable proposition. I shall oppose this Bill at every stage, unless its provisions are so modified as not to restrict the right of the people to the use of this great public convenience. I should like also to know how the use of slot telephones for these purposes is to be prevented. We are going too far. This is a proposal to elevate the Minister to the position of a censor of public morals. He has quite enough to do at the present time without being called upon to discharge the duties of such an office. If there is one Commonwealth Department which is undermanned, and requires to be overhauled in order that it may give satisfaction to the public, it is this; and yet we have before us a proposal to place on the shoulders of the Minister other and additional responsibilities. </para>

          <para>.- I do not know what useful purpose this Bill will serve. &#39;The Minister is already able to exercise the power for which it provides, and it seems to me that it has simply been put forward as a sort of placard. Cases have occurred in which people who have been, perhaps, impudent to the postal officials have had &#39; their telephonic communication cut off. Speaking from  memory,  I believe that in the telephone agreements there is a reservation of power to disconnect at any time. </para>

            <para>- I know of a case in which, because of alleged impudence to a postal official, a subscriber had his telephone removed. I would also point out that under the Post and Telegraph Act the Postmaster- General1 is granted immunity from action in respect of anything done by him in the discharge of the duties of his office. In a recent case the High Court refused to issue a <inline font-style="italic">mandamus</inline> to compel the Postmaster-General to deliver certain postal matter, but I think it decided that he could be sued for conversion. A man, however, could not take action for the nondelivery of a verbal message, so that if his telephone were disconnected Re  would  have no remedy. He has not even the remedy of suing for conversion. As I have said, the Postmaster-General cannot be sued for acts done in the discharge of his administrative duties, the only exception being that he may be sued for trover. This is a pretty little* platitude for the end of the session. It will assist some who, not having subjected themselves to sufficient temptation to strengthen their morality, require the subvention of an Act of Parliament to keep them straight. As the result of this class of over legislation in regard to  gambling,  we shall ha,ve a crop of moral exotics; and the Bill will be a further inducement to men to resort to subterfuge. If the rising generation are not cute enough to make their little gambling communications, notwithstanding this measure, then some of us have been woefully deceiving ourselves as to the mental virility and the  capacity  of the rising generation of Australia to think out expedients. </para>

            <para>- If so, I have done it unconsciously; I shall not knowingly err in that direction. The measure is not likely to be generally used by any Administration, and its partial application would be unjust. Will the Postmaster -General, on the passing of the Bill, be prepared to terminate the agreements for telephone service with the authorities of the Flemington and Caulfield race-courses? No one will deny that gambling is indulged in very extensively on those race-courses whenever a race meeting is held there. We should know exactly what we are doing in this matter. If honorable members are in favour of cutting off the telephone from all gambling institutions, well and good, though I am opposed to doingso. But I certainly object to allow the Minister to exercise discrimination in this matter, and to say that one race-course is moral and that another is not. The Bill says that the Minister may terminate an agreement when he has reasonable ground to believe that a telephone is being used for gambling purposes. </para>

            <para>- Because I have done it. I am not playing the part of a Puritan in this matter. From my point of view, there is nothing objectionable in betting on horses, if one can afford to lose the money that is staked. Would the Minister use the Bill against the Victorian Club on such evidence as I have just given of the fact that that institution is used for gambling, or would he require further information before taking advantage of its provisions ? I wish to know in what cases he intends to act. </para>

          <para>. - This is not panic legislation, introduced because of the representations of deputations. The measure has been in print for a considerable time, and has been brought forward because the legal advisers of the Government think that the Department has not now sufficient power to terminate agreements in cases where telephones are being used for immoral purposes. The instruction has been given that fresh agreements, and renewals of existing agreements, shall not be made except on the condition that this power shall be reserved to the Department. That applies to all subscribers. The Postmaster-General already has the power to prohibit the delivery of letters and telegrams to particular persons. </para>

            <para>- Yes.; but would a Minister exercise any of these powers on his own initiative? The honorable member for Kalgoorlie asked what will be done in the case of a club. I say that the Minister would be justified in using the power given him By the Bill in regard to any club used for gaming or betting or other immoral purposes. The words in the clause are the same as those contained in section 57 of the Post and Telegraph Act. That section provides that if the Postmaster-General &#34; has reasonable ground to suppose &#34; any person to be receiving money or any valuable thing as consideration in respect of any one of various immoral agreements there set out. he may direct that any postal article addressed to such person shall not be delivered. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable member for Coolgardie said that he wondered that the Opposition, having objected to the rushing through of legislation at this late period of the session, did not take exception to this particular Bill. I may tell the honorable member that the Opposition object to the action of the Government in rushing through a large number of measures at the last minute. They contend that only necessary measures, such as some of those which we have been already considering this afternoon, should be dealt with. If, however, the honorable member expects that he, while assisting the Government to push through unnecessary Bills, is to be assisted in the solitary case where he has taken exception, he is mistaken. This Bill should have been introduced at an earlier stage of&#62; the session. Every Minister now seems to be raking his Department with a view to finding some measure which he can bring down in the dying hours of this Parliament. I am quite willing to give the PostmasterGeneral the powers that he is now seeking. He already has fully as much authority in regard to other matters. There is no doubt that great evil is being wrought by the spread of gambling. The careers of many of our most promising young men are being ruined owing to their pursuit of this vice. Any one who has had experience in commercial circles must know that the facilities now afforded for betting, particularly in small sums, are productive of the very worst effects. So strong have some of the gambling institutions become that thev are actually attempting to defy the Government and the law. </para>

The fact that we have not dealt, or cannot deal, with evils that may exist there should not beurged as an excuse for allowing illegitimatetransactions to be carried on in other places.

It seemsto me that the powers which, under the Bill, he will be able to exercise in regard to telephones form a natural complement to those which can now be brought into operation in regard to other business connected with the Department of which he has control. There is no doubt that gambling is a very great evil, and that we should abstain from offering any facilitiesfor engaging in betting and similar transactions. Personally, I see verv little difference between Tattersalls Club and the Stock Exchange. There is, no doubt, a great deal of gambling carried on in the latter institution. </para>

          <para>.- I had hoped that this measure would be passed without the slightest opposition. Those honorable members who are practically opposing the Bill must represent a very small section of the community. A very serious condition of affairs exists in Victoria, and I presume also in other States, and I am sure that the action of the Ministry in bringing forward this measure will meet with the approval of a great majority of the people. It is in the highest degree necessary that we should by every means at our disposal discourage gambling. The evil is a perfect canker in the community, and the public are realizing the necessity of adopting sternly repressive measures. The honorable member for Coolgardie made some reference to the Stock Exchange of Melbourne. I presume that if any operations of an illegitimate character, detrimental to the public interest, were carried on in that institution, the PostmasterGeneral would have power to deprive the members of the advantage of the public services now rendered to them by his Department. </para>

            <para>- The mere introduction of the element of speculation is not in itself an evil so long as the end in view is a legitimate one. The gamblng evil, which it is specially desired to discourage, is so rampant, and is being attended with such evil effects, that many large public organizations, including the Australian Natives&#39; Association and the Chambers of Commerce, have united with representatives of all the religious bodies, and have asked the Postmaster-General to take action. Upon their behalf, I should like to add my congratulations to the Postmaster-General and the Government for having taken this step to cope with an admittedly growing evil. If similar justification existed for the introductiionof the otheramending Bills which have recently been submitted, I am sure that they would have commanded the unanimous support of honorable members. To me it is a surprise to learn that any honorable member is not prepared to support the Government in suppressing an undoubted evil, by giving the Postmaster- </para>

          <para>.- Personally, I am thoroughly in favour of vesting the Postmaster-General with the power which he seeks. Inasmuch as he will be called upon to deal with some very clever individuals, it is necessary that we should clothe himwith correspondingly wide powers. I am content to trust him to exercise a wise discretion, and not to discriminate between gambling institutions to the detriment of those which happen to be supported by poor people, whilst granting immunity to the more fashionable organizations, whether they be turf clubs or Tattersall&#39;s. </para>

To restrict his power to effectively deal with admitted evils because we fear that an unfair discrimination might be made, would be to betray weakness.

            <para>- I should have expected the honorable member for North Sydney - who is usually clear-headed - to have perceived a very important distinction between the two things. When a burglar enters a man&#39;s house, he does so from a desire to take awav something which belongs to another. But if I make a bet - and I am glad to say that I have never lost a pound upon any game of chance - the individual who wagers fully realizes that he incurs the risk of losing a certain sum of money. The burglar takes away something against the will of its proprietor, whereas the gambler merely receives money with the full consent of the individual who has lost the bet. The honorable member should not confuse the issue by instituting false analogies of that kind. I wish to enforce what I said regarding the inconsistency, not merely of the honorable member for Kooyong, but of all who belong to his school of thought, in attempting to use the socialistic power of the community to restrict individual liberty. </para>

            <para>- No. If I have a pound to spare, and choose to bet upon a race-course, I have a perfect right to do so. The honorable member for Kooyong, in taking the stand that he does, very inconsistently desires to restrict the liberty of the subject, which in other directions he wishes to extend. I do not agree with the position which has been assumed bv the Postmaster-General. He has quoted section 57 of the principal Act to justify the granting to him of power &#34; upon reasonable grounds &#34; to cut off telephones. Although in the Post and Telegraph Act we inserted those words, we did not clothe him with the power which he now seeks. Section 57 of the Act relates to the transmission of gambling matter through the post. But, in this Bill, the PostmasterGeneral asks us to empower him to cut off telephones if he has reasonable grounds to suppose that they are being used for anv illegal or immoral purpose. I would remind the Committee that the courts of justice should determine what is illegal, and it is rather an unusual thing to clothe a Minister- behind the back of a person accused - with power to declare that what he is doing is illegal. </para>

            <para>- I have already said that I would. At a later stage,I intend to move an amendment to that effect. I think that before a subscriber is disconnected, he should be afforded an. opportunity of proving to the Postmaster-General that he has not used, or knowingly permitted his telephone to be used,, for any illegal or immoral purpose. It is only reasonable that he should be allowed an opportunity to prove that he has done nothing wrong. As the clause stands, however, the PostmasterGeneral may cut off a telephone without a word of warning, and without any explanation to the subscriber. He might simply say to him, &#34; I have reasonable ground to believe that your telephone is being used for gambling or betting or illegal or immoral purposes, and I propose to remove it.&#34; </para>

            <para>- That is a delightfully vague answer. The honorable gentleman says that he would require to be advised first of all that it was necessary in the public interests that the telephone should be removed. There is nothing about the public interest in this Bill. I hold that every individual should be treated alike, and that if  this measure is, in certain respects, to remain a dead letter, there is no reason why we should pass it. No one could deny that gaming and betting are carried on at Flemington, but the Minister has dodged the question that I put to him. </para>

            <para>- They will probably be requested to tender advice in certain cases, and to refrain from doing so in others. It is open&#39; to argument whether decisive steps should not be taken to prevent any -increase of gambling in Australia ; but at present I am not dealing with that point. At present it would seem that a man who can afford to go to Flemington may bet as much as he pleases there, while others in less affluent circumstances, are to be prevented from wagering a shilling when they cannot go out to the course. To be consistent, we should apply this principle not only to the telephonic, but to the telegraphic system. Nine-tenths of the betting that takes places is transacted on information transmitted by telegraph as to  whether certain horses are to start, their place in the betting, and their chances of success. I hold, therefore, that if the House is prepared to apply this principle to the telephone system, it should apply it : to the telegraph system. As - the result of action taken by this Parliament to prevent the delivery of letters addressed to &#34; Tattersall &#34; the Department has suffered an annual loss of revenue representing thousands and thousands of pounds, while the profits of the banks, the &#39;directors of which have no conscientious scruples in this regard, have been largely increased, </para>

            <para>-  During the recent controversy in Tasmania, it was said that notwithstanding our legislation, the sweep money was greater than ever. There is no justification for the proposal to allow the Minister to discriminate, and to take action without sufficient cause. No one would defend the extension of telephonic facilities to those who are carrying on anything that is illegal or immoral, but I agree with the honorable member for Coolgardie that we should provide that the Minister shall take action only when it has been proved that a subscriber has been guilty of the act complained of. If the Minister will agree to so amend the clause, and to take into consideration the desirability of extending this principle to the telegraph system, I think that he will take a step in the direction of consistency. It is not reasonable that he should have this discretionary power. </para>

            <para>-  In my opinion, it is proposed to give an unreasonable power to the Postmaster-General, and one which Parliament should not, without full consideration, give to any Minister. It may be necessary in some of the States, and, perhaps, in Victoria, to do something to control what I believe is undoubtedly becoming a social evil. But we should deal directly in our attempts to suppress gambling, and should not give an unreasonable discretion to a Minister. The PostmasterGeneral has told the Committee that he will take certain action if his officers report, and he believes, that certain practices are taking place against the public interest; but the Bill says nothing about public interest. A measure like this should apply to all alike. I am not in favour of preventing the use of the totalizator at race meetings at Flemington, Randwick, or other reputable courses, or of preventing betting in legitimate clubs conducted under the laws of the States. But if the Minister is prepared to use the powers given by the Bill in regard to all places and establishments where betting is carried on, I am willing to make- a statutory declaration that betting is carried on at Randwick and Flemington race-courses and the Victorian and Sydney Tattersall&#39;s Clubs, where thousands of pounds are won and lost every year in connexion with betting transactions. If he is not prepared to bring these places under the Bill - and I am inclined to think that he is not - I do not think that he should apply the provisions of the measure to other places equally respectable, but on a smaller scale. A short time ago he used his discretionary power to prohibit delivery of letters to a firm, for interfering with whose business I think he had no more justification than he had for interfering with the business of many others engaged in the same line. It is to prevent unreasonable discrimination of that kind on the part of a Minister, who may be disposed to use these powers to court popular approval, that I oppose the Bill. If the honorable gentleman&#39;s desire is to prevent the telephone from being used where gambling is being carried on, I will give him proof that gaming and betting is taking place at the big betting clubs, and on the race-courses, so that he may take action accordingly. If he is not willing to terminate the telephone agreements made with the authorities of those places, but wishes to apply the provisions of the measure to other places, I am justified in regarding the Bill as hypocritical.. </para>

During my short political career I have known men whose early days were surrounded with good home influence, and who had the best training that our schools could give, afterwards mounting step by step to high positions in the Public Service, to become addicted to the curse of gambling. Yielding to its temptations to do wrong, they have fallen from the high estate to which they Had attained after years Of patient work, and are now confined in the prison cell. </para>

            <para>- Seeing how prevalent gambling is, right-thinking men should wish well to every legitimate effort to put an end to it. The Postmaster-General cannot deal with all the varied phases of this terrible curse, but he is attempting to deal with one phase of it, and may hope to meet with some degree of success, because the large city betting establishments known as &#34; tote shops &#34; could not carry on their business so easily if they were deprived of the means of getting and giving information provided bv the telephone service. If there is the least chance of this attempt to lessen the gambling evil proving successful it should be supported. </para>

            <para>-  I do not think that any sensible, man in control of a big Government Department -would do so. It is necessary that the Postmaster-General shall have power to act quickly, and therefore the onus of proving that a telephone is not being improperly used must lie on those to whose action objection is taken. To put the onus of proof on the Department would be to prevent effective action. I feel sure that the powers asked for will not be abused, and will be used with due discretion. These are not new powers. The Postmaster-General already has the right to refuse to transmit postal matter which may be regarded as indecent or immoral. This power has been used to the advantage of the community to prevent the distribution of post-cards which, if not grossly indecent, were, at least, extremely vulgar. Knowing .something of the extent to which the vice of gambling is undermining the morals of the community, this attempt to minimise it meets with my hearty approval. Our people cannot expect to grow into a strong and virile nation so long as they remain a race of gamblers. I shall support the clause. </para>

          <para>.--I hope that the Postmaster-General will see his way clear to accept reasonable amendments in this clause. I think that he would be well advised if he permitted a provision to be inserted to the effect that a telephone should not be cut off until the subscriber had received notice of the charge made against him, and had been afforded an opportunity to prove that it was unfounded. If necessary, I shall move an amendment in that direction. I should like to hear what the Attorney-General has to say with regard to the use of the word &#34; illegal &#34; in the clause. I do not know of any legislation by which we have conferred upon a Minister power to usurp the functions of a Court of Justice, and determine whether or not an act is illegal. The Courts of Justice exist for the purpose of determining questions of illegality, and we should not empower the Minister to pass them by, and settle such matters for himself. &#39;The Postmaster-General might pronounce to be illegal a perfectly legitimate proceeding on the part of a subscriber. I object to the use of the words &#34; if the PostmasterGeneral has reasonable grounds.&#34; Although these words are used in the principal Act, there is no reason why they should be employed in this case. The Minister should not only have reasonable grounds for believing that a telephone was being put to improper use, but he should require something in the nature of, legal proof before depriving a subscriber of the service. The honorable member for Kooyong admitted that this Bill was introduced in response to the clamour of a number of irresponsible, mischievous busybodies who want to improve the morals of the people by Act of Parliament. I feel exceedingly sorry for those who have fallen victims to the gambling evil, and would do what I could to reclaim them; but I am not so foolish as to suppose that we can reform humanity by methods such as those now proposed. Gambling is one of the primary instincts of the human race, and we shall not eradicate it by merely indicting a certain number of words on a sheet of parchment. Other agencies will prove far more effective in that direction than any attempt to interfere with the legitimate liberty of the subject. The members of the Opposition are continually shrieking against proposals made at the instance of, or with the approval of, the Labour Party, in the direction of extending the collective control by the people of. their own affairs ; but, in a matter which affects the individual alone, and in which rational men ought to be allowed to decide for &#34;themselves, they are silent as the grave. We ought not to deprive a man of the use of his telephone upon the strength of a charge made in secret, heard in secret, and decided in secret. Any subscriber against whom a charge is levelled should have an opportunity of disproving it. Not only should the nature of the charge be communicated to him, but also the name of his accuser.

          <para>.- The honorable member for Coolgardie has had a great deal to say with &#39;regard to the proposed interference with the legitimate liberty of the subject ; but, during the last three years, he has never raised his voice in defence of the legitimate liberty of those whose lawful trades and occupations have been interfered with bv our legislation. On the contrary, he has very cordially supported the extension of the functions&#39; of Government in that direction. Although&#39; he Was been quite &#39;indifferent as to the liberty of those engaged in lawful trades and occupations, he is now very much concerned about the liberty of those who engage in unlawful occupations. He has not only defended the liberty of the subject, but has gone so far as to advocate that license should be granted. There is no question about the right of the Government to exercise full control over the telephone service. The Postmaster-General is now in a position to prevent the transmission of objectionable matter through the post. When the honorable member for Coolgardie was Postmaster-General, he did not hesitate to exercise such powers. Did he then consider that he was interfering with the liberty of the subject? </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the hon-  01  able member would not have Hesitated to interfere with the liberty of the subject if he had ascertained that objectionable matter was being transmitted. He certainly prevented the transmission of moneys through the post to &#34; Tattersall,&#34; in Tasmania, and that was certainly an interference with the liberty of the subject. If it be right to prevent literature of a harmful character passing through the post, and to exercise a censorship over telegrams, it is equally right to prevent our telephones from being used for illegal and immoral purposes. I take it that the Bill is directed against well-known gaming institutions, and that the Postmaster-General will use it to suppress these flagrant evils. So far as I am concerned. I would make it applicable to the Stock Exchanges and the leading clubs in Australia. </para>

I wish to emphasize the statement of the Postmaster-General that he will exercise the powers conferred bv this Bill against all evil-doers, irrespective of whether thev be found in a club or in a tobacconist&#39;s shop. I certainly think that the Bill should be made applicable to the Stock Exchanges. I trust that the honorable member for Coolgardie will never again twit the Opposition with a desire to interfere with the liberty of the subject. Does he not recognise that all law is more or less an interference with the liberty of the individual ? Even imprisonment can be regarded in that light. The man who goes to Pentridge does not go there of his own free-will. </para>

I have no wish to indulge in any Puritanic talk, but I do say that the greatest besetting evil of young Australia to-day is that of gambling. The rising generation spend not only their own money, but that of other people, in this vice.

            <para>- Although the honorable member essayed the task of defending the Opposition from certain insinuations which he thought he detected in the remarks of the honorable member for Coolgardie, I am bound to say that his protest reminded me of the quotation from the players&#39; scene in <inline font-style="italic">Hamlet,</inline> &#34;The lady doth protest too much, methinks.&#34; In spite of his protestation, his address afforded strong evidence of his intimate knowledge of racing. He could not resist telling the Committee what he knew about the very evil of which he protested that he was innocent. Under the circumstances, I think it would be well if we had a few words from the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, who could put the case with some claim to real innocence. I have no desire to discuss the question of whether or not gambling can&#39; be suppressed bv legislation. That is a matter of opinion. The question that we have to consider in connexion with this Bill is, &#34; Shall we allow a Government institution to be used to further the evil of gambling?&#34; Having established a post-office and a telephone department, shall we allow them to be used for purposes which we know to be inimical to tha public  interest?  I &#39;am sorry that, in his address to the Committee, the honorable member for Coolgardie should have altogether ignored this point. I have seldom heard him make a weaker speech than he did this afternoon. </para>

            <para>- I would prevent the transmission of any messages in furtherance of gambling. The honorable member for Coolgardie has moved an amendment which would have the effect of nullifying the whole clause. Need I remind him of the legislation which has been passed by the various States Parliaments in respect of Sunday trading. I have known cases of Sunday trading to be brought before the Court - cases in which the hotelkeeper has escaped punishment simply because he has declared that the offence was not committed with his knowledge. State legislation in relation tq these matters has had to be amended bv the omission of the word &#34;knowingly,&#34; for the reason that every proceeding under it has broken down. I should like to ask the honorable member for Coolgardie, who has held office as Postmaster-General, whether he thinks it would be possible to obtain a conviction under the clause as proposed to be amended by him. </para>

            <para>- Then the honorable member is more sanguine than I imagined. Reference has been made to a certain gambling establishment in one of the suburbs, and I think it would be practically impossible for the PostmasterGeneral to prove that the keeper of that house knowingly allowed his telephone to be used for illegal purposes. I agree with the honorable member that ample notice should be given a subscriber of the intention of the Postmaster-General to remove his telephone. I do not imagine, however, that the Minister would take action on a mere rumour or unsupported statement that a telephone was being used for betting purposes. If the honorable member for Coolgardie moves to amend the clause by providing that reasonable notice shall be given, I shall vote with him, but I am opposed to his proposal to amend the clause in a way that would completely nullify it. </para>

If we are to act under this clause, it is well that we should take action at once. It is true, as pointed out by the honorable member for Fre mantle, that the Department would not be prepared to interfere with the rights and privileges of a subscriber, and thus to suffer a loss of revenue merely because of some rumour that his telephone was being used for betting purposes.

            <para>- Quite so. If the Committee think that we ought to stop an abuse of the system, it will pass this measure as introduced. If, on the other hand, it takes the opposite view, it will so amend this clause that it will either be ineffective or lead to litigation. There is some doubt as to whether we have not power under the existing law to take action in this direction, and we wish to remove that doubt. The Bill has been carefully framed by the Attorney-General who advises me that it would be inadvisable to insert the word &#34;knowingly.&#34; That being so, I cannot accept the amendment. I fail to see why there should be any suggestion that it is intended to apply this measure to one man, whilst allowing another equally guilty of these offences to escape. </para>

          <para>.- I think it is immaterial whether we insert or refuse to insert the word &#34; knowingly.&#34; The clause gives the Postmaster-General power to act without evidence; under it there will be no nossibilitv of challenging his decision. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">The King on the Prosecution of Howard and Freeman</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Arndel,</inline> an application was made for an order to restrain the PostmasterGeneral from refusing to deliver certain letters. There was a suggestion that the letters in question were connected with a purpose which was not very commendable, and the matter went to the High Court. The proceedings were taken under section 57 of the Post and Telegraph Act, which deals with the non-delivery of postal matter, and to which this provision is to be added. The Court declared, however, that under that section the PostmasterGeneral was not acting in a judicial capacity, the test being that he was not compelled to call evidence. Had he been compelled to do so, and to allow the defendant an opportunity to call evidence, he would have been acting in a judicial capacity. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton held that, although the Minister might not be acting in a Ministerial capacity, he was acting in an administrative capacity. Apparently, with a great deal of judicial acumen, the learned Justice drew a distinction between acting in an administrative rather than in a judicial or Ministerial capacity, and it was held that under that section the Postmaster-General had power to stop the delivery of postal matter. A person so treated might institute proceedings for conversion, but since the Minister was carrying out an administrative duty in respect to which his decision was final, he could not obtain from the High Court a prerogative writ commanding the Postmaster-General to deliver his letters. We are now dealing with a proposed addition to that section, and if the Postmaster-General has reasonable cause to believe that a certain set of facts exist with or without the knowledge of the subscriber concerned, he may cut off his telephone. I do not see that the insertion of the word &#34; knowingly &#34; would affect the stringency or liberality of the clause. </para>

            <para>- I do not think so.. It would simply mean that the Committee was of the opinion that the Postmaster-General should not take action unless he considered that a subscriber was knowingly allowing his telephone to be used for any of these purposes. As a matter of fact, this provision depends on reasonable administration, and I shall not oppose it. I am still of opinion that the Minister could take action without it. There is nothing in the Post and Telegraph Act prohibiting the Department from entering into new agreements with subscribers, and reserving the power of cancellation. Under such agreements, if a telephone were removed, no one would be able to sue for breach of contract. I was under the impression that there was a similar reservation in the existing agreements. I know that under them a subscriber has been cut off, and that, although complaints were made to the PostmasterGeneral, the telephone was not restored. It may be that, whether we pass this Bill or not, anything prescribed in this clause may still be done, but if the Minister has been advised by the Attorney-General that he needs this power, I shall not object to his obtaining it. If, however, it is to be applied to every subscriber who sends a telephone message about the odds or the result of a particular horse race, the administration will be absurd. Section 57 of the principal Act is not directed against messages passing between Jack, Tom, and Harry, as to what horse won a certain race, or what were the totalizator odds. It was not intended to put a stop to a telephonic communication passing between a man on the race-course and his friend who happened to be at home as to the totalizator odds or the result of a race. It was designed to prevent the Post Office being used as a part of the machinery of a betting shop. In that respect, this may be a useful auxiliary to the campaign now being carried on in some of the States to stop the excessive growth of gambling. I do not profess to be such a purist as do those who, with an eye to coming events, have proclaimed that they have perfect innocence of a race-course ; but there can be no doubt that there is an overgrowth of gambling. I have not made a bet for fifteen years, but, like other persons, I admire a good horse. I believe that the best class of racing is that in connexion with which no betting takes place. This provision is to prevent the telephone system being used as an aid to betting shops or illegal totalizators; but the sanction of the State law has been granted to the totalizator in South Australia, and I think that it would be absurd to say that a telephone should not be used by a person who wished to communicate to a friend the totalizator odds on a certain race, and the name of the winner. Assuming that the provision will be administered on common-sense lines, I am prepared to support it. </para>

We have the Courts to determine what is illegal, and therefore should not empower any Minister to declare a practice to be so.

          <para>. - The Commonwealth cannot do very much directly towards the repression of illegal or immoral practices, and gaming or betting; but in the Bill we take power to say that we are not going to give facilities for what we believe to be illegal or immoral. The PostmasterGeneral is not empowered to declare anything illegal or immoral, but he will be able to say that the Commonwealth property shall not be used for what he believes to be illegal or immoral purposes. A private individual might say that he would not permit his property or business to be so used, and, in doing so, would not be usurping the functions of a Court of law. We desire to enable the PostmasterGeneral to take up the same position. </para>

        <para class="block">That is a reasonable provision which I think will find acceptance with a large number of honorable members. The AttorneyGeneral has not satisfied me, nor has he, I think, satisfied the Committee, that the Minister is not virtually given power to say what is an illegal or. immoral purpose. The Postmaster-General, in preventing a telephone from being used, for any purpose, must decide that that purpose is illegal or immoral, and the point I took just now was that he has no right to decide a question of that sort, which should be referred to the Courts of the country. The argument of the AttorneyGeneral seemed to me so much special pleading, and did not shake my opinion that the Postmaster-General will practically be called upon to decide these questions, and, in doing so, will ignore the functions of the courts of law. How-, ever, the Committee being against me, &#91; now appeal to its sense of fairness not to allow a charge to be made and decided against a man in the dark, and whose telephone may be cut off before he can know that such action is proposed, or the reason for it. The amendment merely provides that, before action is taken&#34; for the disconnexion of a telephone, the subscriber shall know what the charge brought against him is, and mav have an opportunity to show that he has not used or allowed his instrument to be used improperly. </para>

            <para>- I venture to support very strongly those who are trying to repress gambling, because I think that .it does more damage to the community than can be estimated in mere money. The moral fibre of the people is being injured, and I should be glad to see unanimous support given to the .efforts which we are making to repress this evil. No Postmaster-General would be desirous of cutting off subscribers. These, after all, are the customers of the Department. A Minister would never wish to diminish his revenue, or to burden his administration, without very good reason ; but, if a telephone is disconnected, valuable plant is thrown out of work, and part of a subscription already paid has to be returned. Besides, a sense of justice would cause any Postmaster-General to give an opportunity to the person proceeded against to show that he should not have been disconnected. </para>

          <para>. - I am afraid that the honorable member for Coolgardie will not achieve the results that he anticipates by means of his amendment. The obligation would be laid upon any reasonable Minister to exhaust every means at his command to fully satisfy himself as to the soundness of his ground for taking action before he deprived a subscriber of the use of his telephone. If the amendment were carried, however, the Minister would be authorized to act hastily, so long as an opportunity was presented to the subscriber to show that he should not be deprived of his telephone. The moment a complaint was made, he would notify the subscriber affected. In no case would the Minister take the drastic step of cutting off a telephone before he had fully satisfied himself that his action was warranted. </para>

            <para>- I do not know anything about that. I do not consider that this Bill is necessary, because I believe that the Minister already has ample powers. In New South Wales, we had to take action in regard to Tattersall&#39;s sweeps under the Postal Act, and we experienced no difficulty. I do not recollect any case in which it was afterwards proved that injustice had been done. I know that the officers exhausted every means to satisfy themselves that action by the Department would be warranted. An officer would assume a very serious responsibility if he lightly advised the Minister to deprive a telephone subscriber of the benefit of his service. I do not think that the amendment would increase the safeguards surrounding subscribers,or that the interests of justice would be better served. </para>

            <para>- I do not believe in the Bill but if it is to be applied to one branch of our Postal Department it should be applied to all. The Postmaster- General professes that he intends to apply,the Bill impartially, but the moment a proposal is submitted to make it applicable to the biggest gaming institution in Australia - I refer to the Stock Exchange, where more people are robbed than on any race-course in the Commonwealth - he evidently fears to administer it in the way that he suggests. Apparently, the individual who gambles on the Stock Exchange is respectable, whilst the man who bets upon a racecourse is an outcast. If we are going to prevent racing news being disseminated by means of the telephone, why not extend the prohibition to the telegraph? I hope that the Minister will see the wisdom of accepting my proposal. </para>

To a large extent, the evil of gambling is due to the publication in the press of all sorts of information relating to horse racing. The London <inline font-style="italic">Daily News</inline> sets a good example in this connexion by refusing to receive advertisements relating to turf matters or to sporting fixtures. If the Government seriously intend to use the powers of the Postal Department to prevent the telephones from being used to assist gambling, they must also take similar action in respect of the telegraph. </para>

            <para>- If the Morse instrument be used for the transmission of gambling information, it is equally as bad as the use of the human voice for such a purpose in connexion with the telephone service. As to the point raised by the honorable member for Hunter, I would remind him that cipher messages are sent over the telephone wires, just as they are transmitted by telegraph. All that I desire is that we shall provide that telegraph wires shall not be used for purposes for which we forbid in thisBill the use of the telephone system. </para>

          <para>. - My reading of the amendment is that it proposes something entirely different from that which the honorable member for Dalley has just stated. It does not deal with the use of the telegraphic system in connexion with the furtherance of gambling, or betting, or any illegal or immoral purpose, but would prevent newspapers receiving reports by telegraph as to sporting news. Had the honorable member desired to deal with, the telegraph service as we have dealt with the telephone system, he would have used the words in clause 2. and proposed that if the Postmaster-General has reasonable grounds to suppose that any telegraph message is being sent in connexion with, or in furtherance of, gambling or betting, or any illegal or immoral purpose,he may refuse to receive or despatch such message. There is some reason in the argument that the conditions which apply to the telephone service should also be applied to the telegraphic system. But if the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie were carried, it would accomplish a purpose that no one of common sense desires. </para>

          <para>. - The amendment would have the effect of preventing a message giving the result of a cricket match or any sporting event being sent by telegraph. That is not the intention of the Bill. We might accept the amendment if the honorable member would agree to so alter it as to provide that the principle which we have applied to the telephone service shall be applied to the telegraph system. We cannot accept the amendment in its present form, but should be prepared to agree to it if it were altered to read - </para>

          <para>.- This is one of those little Bills which enable some honorable members to show how virtuous they are in comparison with their fellows. Probably five or six months after the general elections there will not be so muchenthusiasm shown in regard to a measure of this kind as has been discernible this evening. In my opinion, the Bill will have no effect, unless a particularly straightforward and vigilant Minister cuts off the telephone communication of the immoral places which are so well known. Probably, however, the sending over the telephone of not even one betting message will be stopped. I do not object to clothing the Minister with powers for the repression of evil; but I am of opinion that this measure will have no effect. </para>

We may be stupid, but we need not be hypocritical, and it is absurd to suppose that an army of officials will be employed to examine every message, with a view to discovering whether it conveys something in the nature of a bet. </para>

          <para>.- In my opinion, the only justification for the Bill is to give the Postmaster-General, in respect to the telephone service, a power similar to that which he exercises under section 57 of the Post and Telegraph Act. Under that section, he may refuse to deliver postal articles to gaming establishments, the intention being that men who are keeping betting establishments shall not be allowed to make use of postal conveniences for the prosecution of their business. But, to prohibit the transmission of messages conveying information regarding betting transactions, which will mean the stoppage of race telegrams throughout the Commonwealth, is impracticable, because the community has not attained a sufficient degree of Puritanic development to support such an administration. I am not prepared to vote for the Bill now that it goes beyond providing that the telephone service shall not be used as an auxiliary to a betting establishment. If the clause, as amended, is to be enforced, the States may well go a step further, and prohibit the publication of accounts of immoral proceedings and divorce cases, which some of us regard as, at least, as pernicious as the dissemination of racing intelligence. </para>

            <para>. - I would suggest to the Minister of Home Affairs that in connexion with the forthcoming general elections special arrangements should be made in the more populous, centres for separate polling booths in which to record the votes of electors in regard to the various questions submitted to them by referendum. I am afraid that if only the ordinary polling booths are provided serious congestion will take place. If each elector has four or five different ballot papers placed in his. hands, the voting will occupy a considerable time and considerable confusion will result. I do not think that any increased expense need be incurred. Even an increased outlay should be faced without hesitation when the sole end in view is to obtain a true reflex of the opinions of the electors. </para>
