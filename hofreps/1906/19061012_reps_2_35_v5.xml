                        <para>- Quite the contrary. My honorable colleague, when referring to the case of Captain Anderson, must have had in mind a list containing the names of a number of officers similarly situated, which has been before him for some time. Captain Anderson's case is a very hard one, because it was owing to the paralysis from which he suffers, brought about by conditions to which he was subjected while discharging his duties as a soldier, that he was incapable of applying for the gratuity which would otherwise have been granted. It is proposed to deal with this and with other outstanding cases. </para>

Has the Prime Minister any information on the subject with which he can favour the House?

If so, and he has obtained this preferential treatment for his State at the expense of the other States, will the Prime Minister withdraw his authority to act on behalf of the Commonwealth"? </para>

                        <para>- The Queensland treaty with Japan dates from the nineties, and was therefore in force before our Union. The concessions made to Japan up to that time then ceased, and have not since been granted. Assuming the newspaper statement to be correct, it can only mean that the Japanese Government extends to Queensland, as an act of grace, concessions for which it has not received any return since the establishment of the Commonwealth. If so, that is a matter not within our control. The Queensland representative in the East, like the representatives of the other States there, is authorized to issue certificates to merchants or <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> visitors who desire to come to Australia, so that our immigration laws may not be evaded. </para>

We all recognise that the machinery of legislation would move with much more irksomeness, as well as much more slowly, but for the unfailing attention and consideration which we receive at your hands, and at those of the officers of the House. The Chairman of Committees has taken his place during a period in which, fortunately, political storms have been few; but we have to congratulate him upon his absolute impartiality of treatment when any differences have arisen. As to you, sir, a Speaker of this House necessarily returns to his constituents under greater disabilities than surround any other honorable member, but if the universal opinion of honorable members with regard to the manner in which you have discharged your duties could be conveyed to your constituents, there would be no need for fear as to their response.

                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Parliament, we are losing several gentlemen with whom we can ill afford to part. I would first mention my old friend and colleague, the right honorable member for Balaclava, whose financial abilities, general capacity, and devotion to public duty will not be soon surpassed. He retires with the good feeling of every member of this House, and the fullest public appreciation of the great, work which he has been privileged to accomplish both for the Commonwealth and for Victoria. Then, again, we are to lose a younger member, whose retirement we also deeply regret. He has the misfortune - for which I am not going to hold him responsible - to sit on the wrong side of the House, but I shall be pleased at any' time to use my best efforts to correct that initial mistake. He has rendered valuable assistance in connexion with the Library Committee, whilst in the House he has exhibited marked ability, independence of spirit, and at all times absolute fairness to his opponents. In brief, he has given us every reason to feel that we shall suffer a great deprivation when he ceases to appear amongst us. He will take with him the affectionate regard of every honorable member in this Chamber. May I also make a hasty reference to the gentleman who presides over the other branch of the Legislature. His name has been associated with the Conventions prior to Federation, and he has, since the establishment of the Commonwealth, occupied the distinguished position of President of the Senate. His retirement will remove one of the landmarks of our early history. Personally, I have to thank honorable members on all sides for the consideration that they have invariably extended to me whilst I have been acting as leader of the House. At the close of this second session of my leadership I retain in. my memory not a single recollection of offence received from any member of this Chamber. </para>

Although individual members of that party have at times been strongly in opposition to us, and the party as a whole has on occasion exercised its undoubted right to question the wisdom of our policy, their undertaking of general support has been amply and generously fulfilled Of the leader of that party, no terms ore too high in which to express my sense of the strictly constitutional manner in which he has refrained at all times from even offering a suggestion that might appear to be intended to interfere with the responsibilities of the Government in any respect. This House, but not the Commonwealth, will lose two other members, who have occupied places of distinction in this Chamber. The highest eulogy their colleagues can pass upon them is conveyed by the appointments which they have offered to them. I venture to believe that their retirement will be a loss to this House and a greater loss still to the party to which they belong. On- the retirement of the Attorney-General, his office will be taken by the present Minister of Home Affairs, and my friend. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing,</inline> will take control of the Some Affairs Department.
