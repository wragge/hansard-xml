            <para>- I wish to know whether the attention of the Prime Minister has been directed to the report furnished by the Commercial Agent of New South Wales with regard to reciprocal trade with South Africa, which indicates that everything is in readiness, and that the people in South Africa are merely awaiting action on the part of the Commonwealth. My reason for asking the question is that I have received a letter, of which, I think, the Prime Minister has also received a copy, stating that contracts entered into under certain conditions had been cancelled owing to Australian products being subject to a higher duty than similar goods imported from England under the reciprocity treaty with the mother country. </para>

            <para>- The information that I have received goes to show that reciprocity is to be established only under certain conditions. With some of these conditions Iam already familiar, but with regard to others a doubt exists, which I am now endeavouring to resolve. I hope that within a week or ten days I shall know exactly what are our opportunities in the direction indicated. </para>

              <para>- This, therefore, is the thirteenth occasion upon which I have submitted a Budget to aParliament in Australia. My honorable friends opposite say that thirteen is an unlucky number. I hope that it will not bring ill-luck tothis side of the Chamber. On the eleven occasions on which I presented the Budget in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, the duty I had to perform was very different from that which lies before me to-day. This Parliament, unlike that of Western Australia, in which I held office as Premier and Treasurer for over ten years, has not the control of the lands, the mines, nor the railways of Australia, nor can we, unless with the consent of the States, enter upon any large schemes of national development. We have no power reserved to us under the Constitution unless with the consent of the States to undertake any ^beneficent development works such as the Coolgardie waterworks scheme, the Fremantle harbor works, or railway construction throughout the States such as I used to have the pleasure of proposing in the State Parliament. The Federal Budget is limited by the Constitution, and during the :first ten years of the life of the Commonwealth it must be limited also -by section 87, popularly known as the &#34;Braddon section.&#34; We have full power to impose taxation but I do not suppose that power could be popularly exercised unless in the direction of taxing others than those who so readily express an opinion upon it. Even if we indulge in Customs and Excise taxation during the continuance of the Braddon section, we have to raise _&#163;4, when we require only &#163;1. This disability will pass away at the end of 1910. Thereafter the power of the Parliament, in regard to the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue, will be materially extended. I hope, however, that long before that time arrives, we shall have come to an understanding which will be fair and satisfactory both to Commonwealth and States. The year just closed has been a very prosperous one. It was the most prosperous year that we {have had since the establishment of the Constitution. I do not propose to unduly weary honorable members with figures, because they will all be found in the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure and in the Budget papers. I think it will be found that the Budget papers are full and complete. A great deal of trouble has been taken to make them even more complete than in. former years, our desire being to give as much information as possible on every relevant subject. In addition to the ordiinary statistical information connected with the Estimates, and also with the progress of the Commonwealth, there will be found the full report of a scheme prepared bv me. and approved bv the Government, for solving the financial problems of the Constitution. That will be found at the end of the Budget papers. Last year the total revenue received was &#163;11.879,343, being an increase of &#163;413^45 above that received in the previous year. This increase was made up as follows : - From Customs and .Excise, .&#163;199,955 ; from the Post Office. &#163;191,631 : from patents, &#163;13.377 ; and from miscellaneous items, &#163;8,782. This revenue was collected in the States in the following amounts: - In New South Wales, &#163;4,3*3,779 <inline font-style="italic">&#62;</inline> Victoria, &#163;3,292,202 ; Queensland, &#163;1,550,025; South Australia, &#163;987,620 ; Western Australia, including &#163;77,666 from its special Tariff, &#163;1,286,878 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> and Tasmania, &#163;448,839. Dealing with these sums in the order I have named, I find that the Customs and Excise revenue for 1905- 6, including &#163;77,666 from Western Australia&#39;s special Tariff, was &#163;8,999,485, being an increase of &#163;i99,955 over the receipts for the previous year, which were &#163;8,799,530. It may be remembered probably by some honorable members that last year&#39;s Estimate was based upon a. reduction of &#163;65,000 in the receipts from Western Australia&#39;s special Tariff, &#163;50,000 on sugar and other reductions, which amounted altogether to &#163;117,000. Notwithstanding these estimated reductions, the result was an&#39; increase of &#163;199,955 on the receipts for the previous year, instead of a decrease of &#163;1 1 7 ,000. It may be remembered, too, that last year we passed an Act to prohibit the importation of opium. That necessitated a loss of &#163;22,000 to the revenue last year, because it was in operation for only a part of the period, but in this year it will involve a loss of &#163;64,000. We estimate that the loss will fall upon the States in the following proportions : - New South Wales, &#163;16,000 ; Victoria, &#163;10,000 ; Queensland, &#163;26,000; South Australia, &#163;7,000 ; Western Australia, &#163;4,000; and Tasmania. &#163;1,000. I, therefore, estimate that the loss of revenue consequent upon the prohibition of the importation of opium will be &#163;64,000 during the year. The increase in the revenue from Customs and Excise was arrived at in the following manner. In New South Wales there was an increase of &#163;200,305; in Victoria, of &#163;48,228; in Queensland, of &#163;87,769; and in South Australia, of &#163;9,16(3 - making the total increases in those four States &#163;345,462. But there were decreases in two States. In Western Australia there was a decrease on the ordinary account of &#163;76.368, and on the special Tariff account - which is being gradually reduced under the sliding scale - of &#163;64,883. In Tasmania the decrease was &#163;4,256. So that there were decreases in these two States amounting to &#163;145,507. Deducting those decreases from the increases in the other four States, there is left a total increase of &#163;199,955. I now come to the </para>

          <para class="block">Post and Telegraph Department. The facts which I shall be able to give to the Committee .in regard to it are very satisfactory. The year has been a very prosperous one. The revenue for 1905-6 amounted to &#163;2,824,182, being an increase of .&#163;191,631 over the revenue for the previous year, which was ,&#163;2,632,551. The increase was made up as follows : -  In New South Wales the increase was &#163;85,467 ; in Victoria, &#163;52,013 ; in Queensland, &#163;27,981 ; in South&#39; Australia, &#163;25,208; and in Tasmania, &#39;&#163;&#91;5,800. There was an apparent decrease in Western Australia, amounting to &#163;4,838. There were extraordinary payments made during the year 1904- * 5, principally in Western Australia, for savings bank work by the States, amounting to &#163;&#91;18,000. But for this, the total increase on account of the Post and Telegraph Department would have been about ,&#163;209,000 instead of &#163;191,631. The revenue from patents last year amounted to &#163;23,936, being an increase of .&#163;13,377 over the revenue for the previous year, &#39;which amounted to &#163;10, 559. There were also a number of small increases, totalling &#163;8,7&#39;82. The total increase of revenue in 1905-6 over 1904-5 was, as I said before, &#163;413,745. The past is very interesting, but it is not so interesting as the future. We know the past. We have to estimate the future. I therefore have not spent very much time in dealing with the past. Honorable members are aware of what has been going an in this country. An intelligent press takes an immense amount of trouble in placing information before the people of Australia, and that information is constantly being read by honorable members. Returns are published as the year proceeds, and at the end of the year, so that what I have been saying is. to a large extent, contained in information that is generally available; though it was not possible for me to do otherwise than to refer to it again. I now come, however, to estimate the revenue- which I anticipate will be received during the present financial year. The revenue of the Commonwealth for 1906-7 is estimated at &#163;11, 969,500, being .&#163;90,157 more than we received last year, when we obtained &#163;11,879,343. I have no doubt that honorable members who have studied the finances and who are in a position to judge of the future, will think that the estimated increase of .&#163;90,157 is a very small amount, seeing that: last year it was ,&#163;413,745- I may inform honorable members at once that the amount would have been greater, but for a matter I shall refer topresently. The revenue is made upof Customs and Excise, .&#163;9,115,000, including ,&#163;15,000 from the Western Australian special Tariff, which comes to anend on the 8th October this yearAfter that date the intercourse between all the States of Australia will be absolutely free. From the Post and Telegraph Department we estimateto receive &#163;&#91;2,813,000; from patents, &#163;22,500; and from miscellaneous sources, &#163;19,000, making the total revenue for 1906-7, as I just now stated, &#163;11,969.500. It is anticipated that the revenue will be , obtained in the several States as follows: - New South Wales, &#163;4,493,409 p Victoria, &#163;3,327,256; Queensland, &#163;1,502,525; South Australia, &#163;&#91;982,473;. Western Australia, including the .&#163;15.000 from the special Tariff, ,&#163;1,223,082 ; Tasmania. &#163;440,755; making the total, as estimated, &#163;&#91;11,969,500. In regard tothe Western Australian revenue, the special Tariff expires on the 8th October thisyear. But I desire to place on record that the special Tariff for that State, up .to the 30th June, 1906, realized .&#163;852,187, andi it is estimated this year to realize &#163;15,000,. so that the Treasury of Western Australia has, by the provision of section 95 of the Constitution, known as the sliding scale, benefited to the total amount of ,&#163;867,187. Now that the special Tariff is about to come to an end, I feel that I may congratulate myself on having been the means of, at any rate, helping the Treasury of Western Australia during the last few years. </para>

              <para>- We cannot always judge correctly, what is for the best : if we were wise men always we should be invariably right. The Customs and Excise revenue for 1906-7 is estimated at &#163;9,115,000, including the special revenue  of &#163;15,000 from Western Australia; and that is &#163;115,515 more than was received in 1905-6, when the revenue was &#163;8.099,485. If certain sums which, were received last year had been available this, year, the revenue from the Western Australian: special Tariff would have been -C62. 666 received as a sugar windfall, the result of a decision in a law case, and a further sum of &#163;42,000 from opium, which, together with the increase of &#163;115,51.5 we are to receive as compared with last year, would have made the total increase for this year &#163;251,869. That is to say, that if we had the same conditions in regard to those items as existed last year, the estimated revenue for 1906-7 would have exceeded the actual amount received last year by &#163;25^,869. able increase in a that the estimate having regard to in most parts of am sorry to say, </para>

          <para class="block">That is a consideryear, but I think is fully justified, the .good season Australia, though, I not iri every part, because in the north-western part of Australia climatic conditions are not at all favorable this year. In most parts of Australia, however, the season is good, and the prospects have very much improved. I am, therefore, sanguine that this estimate, which, if analyzed, will be found to be a liberal one, will be realized. There is a,n important matter to which I should like to refer in regard&#39; to the revenue of the different States, and that is the Inter-Stale Customs and Excise adjustments under the Constitution. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, duties of Customs and Excise are credited to the State in which the dutiable good&#39;s are consumed. </para>
          <para class="block">If duties of Customs and Excise are paid in one State on dutiable articles consumed in another, the State in which the articles are consumed is credited with the revenue. It will be apparent, from the figures before honorable members, that the two great cities of Sydnev and Melbourne are, as was naturally to be expected, becoming every year to a greater extent distributing centres for the rest of the States. Owing to their large populations, and the consequent volume of importations, freights from all parts of the world to these centres are necessarily lower than to smaller centres. The result of this has been that during the past financial year, New South Wales was debited with &#163;133,396, and Victoria with &#163;366,411, making a total of &#163;499,807 on imported dutiable goods transferred to other States for consumption, as against &#163;75,607 and &#163;196,152 respectively, or a total of &#163;271,759 in 1902-3. It is clear, therefore, that, although not very rapidly, a process is going on under which these two great centres of Sydney and Melbourne; are gradually increasing as distributors of imported Roods to the rest of Australia. During the past financial year the States credited with the amount debited to New South Wales and Victoria were Queensland, &#163;214,358; South Australia. &#163;36,940; Western Australia, &#163;135,917; Tasmania, &#163;112,592; a total of &#163;499&#62;8&#176;7- </para>

              <para>-I have excluded from the figures for Western Australia, the amount of 6s. id. per head due to the special Tariff. Tt is estimated that on the 31 st December, 1906. the population of the Commonwealth will be 4,121,000. The population used in the Treasury returns is the estimated population at the middle of the financial year. The estimated receipts per head of population for 1906-7 are, for New South Wales, &#163;2 4s 7d. ; for Victoria, &#163;21s. 8d. ; for Queensland, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 3s. ; for South Australia,&#163;1 16s3d.; for Western Australia, &#163;3 12s. 5d. ; for Tasmania, &#163;1 16s. 1d., an average per head for the population of the Commonwealth of &#163;2 4s. 2d. Honorable members will notice that there has not been a great increase. The receipts from Western Australia, however, have decreased from &#163;5 16s. 4d. per head in 1901-2, to an estimated sum of&#163;3 12s. 5d. for the financial year 1906-7, adecrease of &#163;2 3s.11d. This is, no doubt, largely due to an increase in the number of women and children in that State, and probably to some extent to more settled conditions on the gold-fields and elsewhere. </para>

          <para class="block">It will be noticed that the Treasuries of New South Wales and Western Australia have been great gainers, whilst the Trea suries of Queensland and Tasmania have been great losers. This return is,of course, approximate, because there has been an increase of population in some of the States, especially in Western Australia, and this fact, combined with others,  may, to some extent, influence the present condition of affairs. I now come to a very important matter. It affords me great pleasure to announce that the Government propose to recommend Parliament to establish penny post throughout the Commonwealth and the Empire on the 1st October next. We propose to also extend penny postage to all foreign countries that will agree to deliver our letters. My honorable colleague, the PostmasterGeneral, recommended that the time had arrived when this benefit should be accorded to the people, and I am very glad to say that the Government approved of it. As Treasurer, I have satisfied myself that funds are available, and I hope that the amendment of the law necessary to insure the establishment of penny post will be unanimously agreed to by Parliament at the earliest possible moment. My estimate of the post and telegraphic revenue for the current year would have been &#163;2,970,000, but, owing to&#34; provision having to be made for penny post, I have reduced my figures by &#163;157,000, viz., to &#163;2,81,3,000. My estimate of the loss covers only nine months, because one-fourth of the year will have passed before the reduced postage comes into operation. If the loss extended over the whole year it would, according to my estimate, amount to &#163;209,000. I may say that my estimate is not so sanguine as that of the PostmasterGeneral, who will, in a day or two, submit his proposals. The estimated loss of &#163;157,000 for the nine months will be distributed among the States as follows : - New South Wales, &#163;58,000 ; Victoria. &#163;14,000 - Victoria, has for some time past adopted the penny postage; Queensland, &#163;29,000; South Australia, &#163;23,000; Western Australia, &#163;19,000; and Tasmania, &#163;14,000. It is encouraging to know that penny post has been successful &#39; in all British countries in which it has been tried. I have not recent statistics relating to New Zealand, but I believe that the system has proved very successful there. The penny post was established in Canada in I()00. and the Minister of Finance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fielding,</inline> speaking on the 22nd May last, said : - </para>

            <para>It is but a few years since Canada had i&#163;d. domestic letter rate and a rate on letters to Great Britain, and even with these heavy postal rates the Post Office Department absorbed all the revenue it could collect, and at the close of the year some ^120,000 or ^140,000 was usually required from the Public Treasury to make good the deficiency and keep the postoffice running - we have no longer a i&#163;d. rate - Canada has penny post within her own borders and penny post with the mother country. The Post Office Department no longer absorbs all its own revenue, no longer calls for ^120,000- or ^140,000 from the Treasury. After affording the people a very liberal postal service, after giving reduced rates, after establishing the blessing - for it is not too much to speak of it so - of penny post, the Postmaster-General comes, at the close of the year, asking nothing from the Public Treasury, but tenders the splendid sum of  &#163;180,000  to assist the other public services of the country. </para>

          <para class="block">It was not possible that the different rates of postage existing in the various States could for long continue. It is absolutely inconsistent with the principles underlying Federation that the people of one State should enjoy privileges at the hands of the Government which those of other States are denied, or that the people of the cities and towns should be charged one-half the rate charged to the people in the country. Almost since the establishment of the Commonwealth the people of Victoria have had the benefit of penny postage within their borders, and I believethe people of Victoria would not thinkvery highly of the present Government if we declared that we intended to .level up instead of levelling down in regard to their rate of postage. What would they say if we recommended to equalize the postagerate all over Australia, but, instead of making it a penny, we proposed to make it twopence? I&#39; am inclined (to think that there would be a howl of oppositionfrom one end of this State to the otherHonorable members will be afforded an opportunity to discuss the details of our proposal within a day or two. The Postmaster-General has looked into the matter most carefully, and when he introduces! the Bill - which he probably will do at once - to authorize the adoption of the penny postage system, he will beprepared to .give honorable members full information in regard to the matters towhich I ha.ve referred. I need scarcely point out that we already enjoy uniform duties of Customs and Excise. Weenjoy uniform telelgraph rates - except in the case of Tasmania - and* we now propose a uniform system of penny postage, rot only throughout the Commonwealth, but throughout the Empire, and&#34; throughout foreign countries which are willing to deliver Australian letters. Upon* this occasion I do not propose to say more than to express my satisfaction that this great advantage is to be conferred upon everybody in Australia and throughout the Empire. I have no doubt whatever that it will become an accomplished fact, because I believe that honorable members will be only too glad to vote for the adoption of our proposal. I most heartily congratulate my honorable friend and colleague, the PostmasterGeneral, upon the fact that it is to be accomplished during his term of office, and upon his recommendation. The fact that he has made such a proposal shows that, after travelling in other parts of the world and rubbing shoulders with men charged with responsibility, he has returned to us more convinced1 than ever of the need for this advance in postal facilities for the people. I can assure the representatives of Tasmania that I have always advocated &#39; that we should do all within our power to give consideration to that State. I recognise that, as one of the smaller States, its Treasury has laboured under difficulties as the result of Federation ; and&#39; that the revenue it has. received since the establishment of the Commonwealth is &#163;998,112 below that which it would have received - on the basis of its returns for 1900 - under its own Tariff. In these circumstances, I have pleasure in intimating that the Government have decided to reduce the rate in respect of telegrams to Tasmania from is. 8d. to is. per message of sixteen words. In order that this may be done, provision is made on the Estimates for a payment, at the rate of &#163;&#91;5,600 a year, tlo the cable company. We guarantee the cable company &#163;&#91;5,600 a year, but no payment has been made under that guarantee since the extra charge of &#189;d. per word has hitherto been imposed. &#34;This additional |d. per word - as compared with the rate prevailing in other parts of the Commonwealth - has returned more than the guaranteed amount of &#163;&#91;5,600. Under -our present proposal, the people of Tasmania will secure that to which they are -entitled. They should have the same concessions, rights and privileges as are given the people in other parts of the Commonwealth with regard, not only to postal and telegraphic communication, but to every other Federal service. I do not think it was ever intended <inline font-style="italic">Jo</inline> differentiate between the States ir. regard to telegraphic communication. It is an anomaly that one should be able to send a telegraphic message of sixteen words from Thursday </para>
          <para class="block">Island, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, to Wyndham, Western Australia, a distance of 7,000 or 8,000 miles for is., when a message of the same number of words cannot be sent from &#39;here to Tasmania for less than is. 8d., owing to the fact that a stretch of 150 miles of sea separates that State from the mainland. I am very glad1 indeed that this anomaly is to be removed, and that the people of Tasmania will thus be benefited. There will, I believe, he but little loss of revenue consequent upon this change, because the increased traffic as the result of the reduced rate will be sufficient in a year or two to recoup it. I am also glad to say that on these Estimates the Government propose to deal with the increased subsidy of &#163;7,000 for the mail service between Melbourne and Launceston, in the same way that we have dealt with other ocean mail services, and that is, to charge the amount <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> amongst the States. Prior to Federation New South Wales had a mail service &#39; from Sydney to some of the Pacific islands, and under that contract it paid a few thousand pounds a year-. After Federation the contract was renewed with other conditions, and the extra amount paid was considered as &#34;other&#34; expenditure, and charged <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amongst the States. That is exactly analogous to the case of Tasmania. Prior to Federation, that State had&#39; a service for which it paid &#163;&#91;6,000 a year. Since Federation a. contract has been made for &#163;&#91;13,000 a year, and, as in the case of New South Wales, we intend to charge the difference of &#163;7,000 as &#34;other&#34; expenditure <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> For the future Tasmania will only pay her share <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of the additional cost of &#163;&#91;7,000, and this will also obviate the necessity of making any mileage payment to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, as was done last year. The estimated revenue, as before stated, from the Post and Telegraph Department for 1906-7 is &#163;2,813,000. If it had not been for the introduction of penny postage, if would have been &#163;&#91;2,970,000. The revenue is estimated to be obtained in the following manner : - From telegraphs, &#163;&#91;587,000: telephones, &#163;&#91;382,000 ; postage, &#163;1,687,000 : and miscellaneous items, &#163;157,000. If the provision had not been made for a penny post the estimated revenue for the Department would have shown an increase of &#163;&#91;145,818 instead of a decrease of &#163;&#91;11,182. After making an allowance of &#163;157,000 for the loss of revenue in connexion with penny post, it is estimated that the postal revenue for 1906-7 will be contributed by the States as follows: - New South Wales , &#163;1,075,000; Victoria, &#163;751,000; Queensland, &#163;347,000; South Australia, &#163;284,000 ; Western Australia, &#163;245,000; Tasmania,&#163;111,000 ; total, &#163;2,813,000. These amounts show an increase on the revenue received for 1905-6 for New South Wales of &#163;9,382, and </para>
          <para class="block">Victoria an increase of &#163;15,507, but decreases for Queensland &#163;12,755; South Australia, &#163;7,927; Western Australia, &#163;7,665, and Tasmania, &#163;7,724.Taking the estimated receipts together for the year, the revenue from the Department will be &#163;11,182 less than it was last year.

          <para class="block">I mow come to the Estimates  of  Expenditure for the present year. Last year the total expenditure was &#163;4,494,841, being &#163;111,432  Jess  than the Estimate. . The amount which the Commonwealth had  a  legal right to spend, under the Constitution, was &#163;5,324,766, whilst the amount actually expended was &#163;4,494,841. Consequently, we returned to the States  &#163;829, 925 more than was constitutionally obligatory. In other words, if we had spent that sum of &#163;829,925, which we had a right to do under the Constitution, the States would have received that much less from the Commonwealth. I only mention this to show that the facts do not bear out those charges of recklessness and carelessness which are often levelled against this Parliament by ill-informed people who criticise us. If this House wanted to get kudos for itself by spending as much  as  it could on necessary works throughout the different States, thereby gaining to some extent the approbation of the people, we could have spent very much more than we did. But, instead of so doing, we have handed over to the States an immense sum during the past6&#189;years, allowing the States Governments to spend1 the money, andthereby to gain any kudos that might be attached to the expenditure. </para>

              <para>- I beg the honorable member&#39;s pardon; we could easily have spent the money ourselves. But last year we were able, by economy and carefulness in our management, to return to the States &#163;829,925 more than it was obligatory upon us to return. Therefore, I say a.gain, the facts do not bear out the criticism often directed against this Parliament. The facts show that this House has always been most economical, and that it has at all times given full consideration to the interests of the States. I may, however, say that the time isfast approaching when new obligations entailed upon the Commonwealth will make it impossible to return to the States more than the three-fourths of the. Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under section 87 of the Constitution. The estimates of expenditure for 1905-6 were very closely adhered to, but there were underdrafts on various items, none of which were very large, amounting to &#163;161,379; and there were overdrafts, amounting to &#163;49,947. </para>

I do not propose to deal with the expenditure in detail. I may mention that the estimated expenditure on the Department of Trade and Customs - the cost of collection, in fact - is , &#163;264,258, an increase of.&#163;4,208 on the expenditure on the same service last year, which was &#163;260,050 ;  on defence, &#163;854,705, an increase over last year, which was&#163;777,714, of . &#163;76,991, and on the Post Office, &#163;2,704,105; an increase over last year, which was &#163;2, 629, 702, of . &#163;74,403. The foregoing figures relate to transferred expenditure only. &#34; Other &#34; expenditure - that is, in contradistinction to transferred expenditure, is estimated at &#163;7 18,923, an increase over last year, which was &#163;508,867, of &#163;210,056, while on new works, &#38;c, for transferred departments, the estimated expenditure is &#163;478.224, an increase over lastyear, which was &#163;318,488, of&#163;159,736.

We propose,, therefore, to return to the States this year the sum of &#163;311,228 out of the Commonwealth one-fourth of net Customs and Excise revenue. I shall inform honorable members how we arrive at the amount which the Commonwealth is entitled to expend. A quarter of the estimated net Customs and Excise revenue is &#163;2,212,685. The revenue from Customs and Excise used for maintenance of the Customs Department is &#163;264,258; the Post Office revenue is &#163;2,813,000; Patents revenue, &#163;22,500; any miscellaneous revenue, &#163;19,000 ; making the total amount available . for Commonwealth expenditure &#163;5*33* .443- If we deduct from that the estimated expenditure of &#163;5,020,215, we arrive at &#163;311,228 as the estimated amount to be returned to the States in excess of our obligation. The principal increases in the present Estimates are sugar bounties, &#163;130,394; repatriation of kanakas, &#163;25,000; repairs and maintenance of buildings, &#163;21,817 ; advertising the Commonwealth, &#163;5,000 ; statistics, &#163;7,453 ; elections and other electoral matters, &#163;55,900; Defence, &#163;72&#62;45I &#62; Post Office, including &#163;5,600 for the Tasmanian Cable Company, &#163;68,714; new works and special defence material, &#163;.160,004; anr1 Pensions, &#163;8,813, making the total increases .&#163;555,346. The decreases are for the Queen&#39;s Memorial, ,&#163;25,000, and other net decreases, &#163;5,172, making a total of &#163;30,172, leaving the total estimated increase over the actual expenditure of last year, .&#163;525,374. Included amongst the items of expenditure are &#163;58,803 Of revotes under the Home Affairs&#39; Department, and &#163;34,302: under the control of the Post Office. These re-votes are necessitated because the money was not expended last year, but every effort will be made &#34;to avoid a similar occurrence in the future. Provision has been made, amongst other things, for the following expenditure : - &#163;8,000 for the purchase of a trawler ; &#163;10.000 for wireless telegraphy ; &#163;40,000 for underground telephone wires in cities; and &#163;37,000 for the telephone line from Melbourne to Sydney. </para>

          <para class="block">I now come to deal with some questions affecting our expenditure on Defence. The total expenditure on Defence last year was - Naval Agreement, &#163;200,000. Chief Administration, repairs, works, and buildings, and everything, except new works, &#163;798,431, or &#163;25,584 less than the estimate, which was &#163;824,015. The estimate for 1906-7, including &#163;200,000 under the Naval Agreement, is &#163;876,078. The Government intend to continue and extend the practice of sending officers abroad for instruction. The policy of training cadets for naval and military service is to be energetically carried out. There is provision on the Estimates for 20,000 junior and 3,000 senior cadets. The Education Departments of the various States are co-operating willingly and successfully, and the whole of the Cadet Forces of the Commonwealth are now under the Defence Department.  &#163;r,000  has been provided on the Estimates to meet the initial expense of forming a corps of guides composed of surveyors and other persons in the various States pos- .sessed of * local knowledge. The Department is also providing for more rifles. There is an amount of &#163;50,000 on the Estimates for the purchase of 10,000 additional rifles of the most modern service pattern. The rifle clubs are progressing satisfactorily, and on the 1st July, 1906,&#39; they included a total of 37,082 members, an increase of 7,000 over last year. Provision is also made on the Estimates for 5,300 cadet rifles which, with those in stock and on order, will make the number- 16,100. An increased reserve of rifle ammunition is also provided for, while accoutrements and equipments are gradually being obtained in order to bring them up to emergency requirements. I am glad to be able to inform honorable members that Fremantle, will shortly cease to be an undefended port, one fort there being about finished, while a second is in progress. The Government have decided to give &#163;i for &#163;i, to an amount not exceeding &#163;1,000, towards sending a rifle team to Bisley. </para>

              <para>- The works for which the money is proposed to be appropriated are all necessary. I come now to an important matter, in which I, and honorable members generally, take a great interest - the Naval Agreement. Our contribution under that agreement is &#163;200,000, while New Zealand contributes another &#163;40,000, so that Australasia pays in all &#163;240,000 to the Admiralty towards Naval defence. It was understood, when the agreement was made, that the Imperial Government would provide as much again ; but we have been informed by  His Excellency  the, Admiral that the Admiralty expends on the Australasian Squadron between &#163;650,000 and &#163;700,000 a year, which&#39; includes 5 per cent, on prime cost, while considerably more is expended on the Australian station than the Commonwealth contributes. Of the ships on the station, the <inline font-style="italic">Challenger</inline> and three drill ships carry 461 Imperial men, that is, men brought from England, and 518 Australians and New Zealanders ; while, on the 30th June, 1906, there were in the Australian Naval Reserve seven officers and 316 men, or 323 altogether. The squadron consists at the present time of one first-class cruiser, three second class cruisers, and five third class cruisers, one sloop,, and one surveying vessel. The first and second class cruisers, and two of the third class cruisers, are in full commission, the remaining three third class cruisers being used as drill ships. It is gratifying to know that  His Excellency  the Admiral has advised the Government that he has received very favorable reports . from his officers as to the intelligence and good behaviour of the men. The enrolment of Australians and New Zealanders began on the 1st May, 1904 - only two years ago - and I think that I am justified in saying that our expectations as to the adequate manning of the squadron by Australians and New Zealanders will be fully realized. I have been informed that there are difficulties in the way of training men here for the higher ratings, because there are not in. existence in Australia the technical schools necessary to impart the required knowledge ; but these difficulties are likely to be overcome by&#39; sending men to England for instruction in the same way as officers are being sent. Those who desire to remain in the Naval service will have an opportunity to qualify, themselves for the higher ratings by proceeding to England and there undergoing a course of instruction in the same way as is provided for the officers of our Military Forces who are sent Home every year.. In order to make the agreement more workable, we require to have more Australiansand New Zealanders employed on the station, and it is also desirable that we should have more Australian officers on the ships. I have no doubt that these improvementswill be brought about in due time. The difficulties that had to be surmounted in&#62; the beginning are gradually being removed&#39; as we gain experience, and I have no doubtthat during the next two years relatively much greater progress will be made thar* hitherto. It must be gratifying to honorable members to know that so many men of good character are willing to enter the: Navy. At the time that &#39;the agreement wasunder consideration, it was feared by some that Australians would not accept servicein the Navy, but that statement has been controverted by the fact that: already 518 Australians and New Zealanders have been enlisted, and are now doing duty on H.M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Challenger</inline> and the three drill ships. The Government have had under consideration the recommendations of the Imperial DefenceCommittee as to the best means of protecting Australia from invasion or aggression. The report deals with our land1 forces, and also with our harbor and1 coastal naval defence. I regret to say that the document is confidential, but the Government hope to be in a position to communicate its contents to the House very shortly. They have taken steps in thedirection of obtaining the necessary authorization. In the meantime, the matter is being: carefully considered by the Naval and&#39; Military authorities. It is often said that Federation costs an enormous amount, and* in conformity with the practice that hasbeen established, I desire to give honorable members some information. It will be remembered that at the AdelaideConference it was stated that the extra cost of Federation would amount to- &#163;300,000 per annum. Last year the &#34; other &#34; expenditure, as distinguished?  from transferred expenditure, amounted <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> ,&#163;827,355. If we deduct from that amount the provision made for mew works in the transferred Departments ^318,488, New Guinea .&#163;20,000, sugar bounty and expenses ,&#163;1541706, &#34;and the Queen Victoria Memorial ,&#163;25,000, we arrive at a net amount of ,&#163;309,161, equal to is. 6d. per head&#39; of the population. For the current year, 1906-7, it is estimated that the other expenditure will amount to ,&#163;1,197,147. If we deduct from this amount the provision made for new works, transferred Departments ,&#163;478,224, NewGuinea ,&#163;20,000, sugar bounty ,&#163;284,428, kanakas .&#163;25,000, cable, Tasmania &#163;5,600, and mails, Tasmania <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000,</inline> we reach a net amount of &#163;376,895, equal to is. iod. per head of the population.

          <para class="block">It is the intention of the Government not only to encourage existing industries, but also to endeavour to establish new industries by means of bounties. Honorable members will recollect that amongst the bounties which we propose to offer is one of _fd. a lb. upon canned or tinned fish. That proposal is contained in the Bounties Bill. Provision has been made upon the Estimates for the purchase of a trawler to explore the fishing grounds on the Australian coast, and thus assist the industry. Our object&#39; is to encourage the fishing industry and help our fishermen. The payment of the bounty, we hope, will encourage fishermen to embark capital in the enterprise. The sum of ,&#163;8,000 has been set apart for the purchase of a trawler and&#39; equipment, and the intention is  -  ais I said before - to explore the fishing grounds along the coast of Australia. I am quite sure that a good reward awaits our labours in that direction. So far, very little in the way of systematic trawling has been undertaken in Australia, and it seems to me that any expenditure by which new industries may be established is wise. I would remind honorable members that over &#163;300,000 annually is sent abroad for the purchase of preserved fish. As a protectionist, I should like to see that sum spent in providing employment for the, fishermen of Australia. In Great Britain, the consumption of fish per head of the population is five times that of. Australia, the reason1, being no doubt that fish is cheaper there than it is here. The United States spend .&#163;100,000 per annum upon their fisheries, whilst Canada has disbursed &#163;600,000 upon fish bounties, and an additional &#163;32,000 annually in assisting the industry. In the latter country, 80,0,00 persons are employed in the fishing industry, and the plant in use is valued at &#163;2,000,000. The lobster -in- dustry alone employs 17,000 persons. At the Cape of Good Hope, a beginning was made in- 1897 upon similar lines to those which the Government now propose to follow. A trawler was purchased for the purpose of exploring the fishing grounds, with the result that capital and enterprise have embarked upon the business, and a great industry has been established. If there are industries which are worth establishing in a country, I do not think that anybody will object to a small initial expenditure in fostering them in their infancy, because the small expenditure must be altogether incommensurate with the ultimate advantages&#39; which will result to theCommonwealth. The Government propose very soon to take over the lighthouse services of the States as provided by the Constitution. </para>

              <para>- The amount in question is to be devoted exclusively to ocean lighthouses. For instance, there is a light very much needed upon the Glennie Group, west of Wilson&#39;s Promontory. Another small one is urgently required at Point St. Albans, in Backstair&#39;s Passage, Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Then  a  lighthouse is needed upon Eclipse Island, near King George Sound, and another is necessary at Point Dentrecasteaux, between King George Sound &#39; and Cape Leuwin. No doubt there are some others needed between Wilson&#39;s Promontory and Cape York. But those to which I have referred I have personal knowledge in regard to, and&#39; they have also been brought under my notice by the captains of mail steamers. There is no doubt that we are under a great obligation to provide those who are engaged in navigating our coasts with adequate lights at prominent points. </para>

              <para>- I have not gone into that matter, but if we estimate the cost of a first-class lighthouse at from &#163;10,000 to &#163;,15,000&#34; we shall not be far wrong. Then a sum of &#163;10,000 has been placed or. the Estimates in connexion with installations of the system of wireless telegraphy. The Government have not yet definitely decided what they intend to do. in this direction during the current year, but we are convinced that this wonderful invention should be utilized by the Commonwealth as it is utilized by other countries, and especially in providing for the protection and safety of shipping. The connexion of Australia with New Guinea by this means will at once appeal to honorable members. There we have a settlement containing 642 white residents, men, women, and children, and 375,000 Papuans, and so far there is no ready means of communicating with the mainland. It seems to me that that fact needs only to be mentioned to show the necessity of establishing communication bv means of wireless telegraphy with that largely populated country. Then we have to consider the safety of ships approaching our shores. The time has almost arrived - it will probably have arrived before the Treasurer has the honour of submitting his next Budget statement - when all the mail steamers coming to Australia will be provided with wireless telegraphic instal lations. Are we to sit idly by and do nothing in this direction when the safety of the lives of our people and of their property may be in jeopardy ? What would happen to any of these vessels if her shaft were broken? It would be absolutely unwieldy, and would not be able even to get steering way on. Therefore; we should be censurable if, having this cheap means of communication available, we did not take advantage of it. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. Wherever there is no means of communicationeither upon land or sea - and the wireless telegraphic system can be brought&#34; into operation at a much less expenditure than would be involved in the laying of submarine cables or the erection of telegraph lines, we should avail ourselves of it. I now wish to say one or two words in regard to population, and I regret that I have not a very satisfactory statement to make concerning its increase throughout the Commonwealth. During the past five years our population has increased by 286,662. That increase is practically accounted for by the excess of births over deaths. During 1905 there was an increase of 68,099 over the population of last year, and it was  made up by an excess of births over deaths, amounting to 61,427, and an excess of arrivals over departures of 6,672. The Government, and also the Parliament, I believe, have been very anxious to assist emigrants of the right class to come to Australia. The determination of the Ministry to encourage industries of all kinds, and so to provide remunerative employment for the people, must do good, and I believe&#34; that when the facts are known and1 understood in the old country and elsewhere, the effect of this policy will be beneficial. The Government have no desire to bring to Australia a number of people to compete in the labour market when it is sufficiently stocked&#39;. What we desire is to encourage the settlement of our lands, and to induce people to come here, either with strong arms and stout will, or with small capital, and to throw in their lot with us in the cultivation of the soil and the establishment of manufactures and industries. These twit enterprises must go together; they are necessarily beneficial to each other. No one can believe that a population of 4,000,000 is sufficient for this vast continent. I am not carried away by the cry of some </para>

          <para class="block">I believe a great deal of the country is jungle, and the means of getting from one place to another, except by narrow paths, is very difficult. What we ought to do - that is, if we take a real interest in the matter - is to spend a hundred thousand pounds in opening up, and making the Territory self-supporting and prosperous. The pastoral industry in Australia is flourishing. The value of wool produced last year was &#163;20,125,900, being the largest amount that has ever been received. The sheep increased in number from 65,822,000 in 1904 to 74,706,000 in 1905, being an increase of 8,882,755 in twenty-one months. It is a splendid record that in a period of threeyears and nine months, sheep have increased in number by 22,000,000. Australia had her largest number of sheep in 1891, namely,106,000,000. We require an increase of 32,000,000 sheep to equal that number. But I am glad to saythatthe return from sales of wool was greater from 74,000,000 sheep in 1905 than from 106,000,000 sheep in 1891. That is very satisfactory indeed. When in London a short time ago, I made some inquiries concerning the question of silver coinage and currency. Judging from the interviews I had with the Imperial Treasury officials, there is no desire to prevent Australia from having a coinage of her own if that is desired. Their wish is to meet our desire, and I think that we should have probably had a communication to that effect if there had not been a change of Government in England. </para>

              <para>- The question was not settled. Some communication from this Government was not answered at the time the change of Government occurred but the question was almost decided. I had a conversation on the subject with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austen</inline> Chamberlain, late Chancellor of the Exchequer. When a scheme to allow Australia to do just what she liked in the matter was placed before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austen</inline> Chamberlain for approval, he said that he wished to have a little more time in which to consider it, because he desired to ascertain whether there was not some other means by which Australia could be satisfied, without establishing asystem of coinage different from that existing in the mother country. I was assured by those with whom I conversed that the question of securing the profit or. the silver coinage for Australia does not influence the decision, and that the Imperial Government is quite willing that any profit which accrues from such coinage should go to Australia. There are, however, other questions in connexion -with the maintenance of gold to be considered.

                <para>The Treasury officials fear that the withdrawal of a larger value per annum than&#163;100,000 would result in considerable loss, and even at that rate it would take twenty years to withdraw the&#163;2,000,000 of silver in circulation in Australia. The continuance of two silver coinages in circulation during that period would be unsatisfactory. </para>

            <para class="block">But in addition to the foregoing considerations is the question as to whether the establishment of a different silver currency might not be in the direction of widening rather than tightening the bonds of Empire. Such a currency would require very careful watching to avoid its being either depreciated by reason of an excess issue of silver, or the public being inconvenienced through an inadequate quantity being in circulation, the difficulty being increased by reason of the smallness of the population. It was, therefore, thought worthy of consideration whether some other means could not be devised other than establishing a distinct and separate silver currency. </para>

              <para>- I do not think so. I now come to a very important matter, and that is the position of the sugar industry. The determination of the Commonwealth to make a great effort and monetary sacrifice in order to maintain the &#34; White Australia &#34; policy appears to have been thus far very successful. The amount payable in bounties is increasing. This year provision is made for the payment of ^278,500, which represents a production of 139,000 tons of sugar, as against a production of 69,000 tons last year. At first I hesitated to accept the departmental estimate. It is estimated! to make an immense increase - from 69,000 tons to 139,000 tons produced by white labour in one year. But I have been assured that the estimate is based upon probabilities, and I have accepted it. It is estimated that the acreage of sugar-cane cultivated by white labour this year will be 116,750 acres, and that the area cultivated by black labour will be 37,150 acres - making ,a total of 153,900 acres under cultivation. The production this year is estimated to be - sugar produced by white labour, 144,236 tons, and sugar produced by black labour, 54,614 tons ; making the total production 198,850 tons. I think that if that estimate, which has been obtained after a good deal of trouble and care, is borne out at the end of the year, and if we produce 144,236 tons of sugar by white labour, the result cannot but be regarded as very satisfactory indeed. The number of sugar-cane growers in Queensland employing white labour in 1902 was 1,521. It is estimated that at the end of 1906 the number of growers employing white labour will be 3,393, making an increase in four years of 1,872 growers employing white labour. On the other hand, in 1902 the growers in Queensland employing black labour numbered 975, and in 1906 they numbered 837, showing a . decrease of growers employing black labour of 138, In New South Wales in 1902 there were 1,005 growers of sugar by white labour, and in 1906 there were 1,450, showing an increase in the four years of 445 farmers employing white labour. In 1902 there were in New South Wales 115 growers employing black labour, and in 1906 there were 110. So that in the four years there has been a decrease of five farmers in New South Wales who employ black labour. It is estimated that at the end! of 1906 there will be 4,843 growers of sugar-cane by. white labour in the Commonwealth, as compared with 947 growers employing black labour. Steps have been taken during the year to find &#62; out how many persons are employed in the sugar industry. The Customs authorities have obtained information that on the 31st of December, 1905, there were 20,162 white persons so employed. That is a very satisfactory statement to be able tomake, and a fine result to have attained. There were only 8,452 coloured persons employed in the industry. </para>

              <para>- In the sugar industry, taking into consideration everything connected with it. The total number of persons employed in the industry at the date mentioned was 28,614. There were 17,937 white persons earning bounty ; and there were 2,225 white persons and 8,452 coloured persons who were not earning the bounty. In regard to cultivation, since 1904, and up to the end of 1906 - a period of two years - it is estimated that the area cultivated by white men will have increased in Queensland from 45,424 acres to 96,000 acres - an increase of 50,576 acres. The figures with regard to cultivation in New South Wales are hot so satisfactory. In the same twoyears it is estimated that the increase will be from 19,114 acres to 20,750, an increase of only 1,636 acres. The total increase in the area cultivated by white men in the Commonwealth in the last two years amounts to 52&#39;,2i2acres. During the same two yearsthe area cultivated by black labour decreased in Queensland from 74,375 acres to 35,000, a decrease of 39,375 acres; and in New South Wales the area cultivated bv black labour decreased from 2,411 acres to- 2,150 - a decrease of 261 acres. The total&#39; decrease in acreage where black labour was. employed in the two years was 39,636 acres. That result is most satisfactory. I never expected to have such satisfactory figures to convey to honorable members inregard to the policy which we have been trying to carry out. Since 1902 - a period of four years - the estimated production of sugar by white labour increased in Queensland from 12,254 tons to 125,000 tons - an increase of 112,746 tons. </para>

              <para>- I cannot speak of these figures as actually realized, because the period is not yet complete. They cover the period from 1902 to the 31st of December, 1907. The figures have beendefinitely ascertained up to the 31st December, 1905, but I wish to give the definite and the estimated figures together. I rr Queensland, as I have said, the increaseamounts to 112,746 tons. In New South Wales, however, it is estimated that the production by white labour will have decreased from 19,434 tons to 19,236 tons. </para>

              <para>- The result is not so satisfactory as the honorable member supposes, because we shall be paying bounties and getting very little in return. The total increased production by white labour in the four years is estimated at 1 1 2 ,  548 tons. During the same period the estimated production by black labourin Queensland has decreased from 65,581 tons to 53,000 tons - that is to say, by 12,581 tons ; while in New South Wales, it has, I regret to say, increased from 1,526 to 1,614 tons, or, in other words, by 88 tons. There has been a total decrease of 12,493 tons of production by black labour in four years. Honorable members are aware that, under section 87, known as the Braddon section, of the Constitution, the Commonwealth receives one-fourth of the excise revenue. At present, the excise is &#163;3 per ton, and therefore, the Commonwealth receives 15s. per ton, and has to pay &#163;2 per ton as bounty, losing thereby &#163;1 5s. on every ton produced by white labour. </para>

              <para>- That excise will begin to operate at the beginning of next year. Making the payment a bounty instead of a rebate - which was done by Act some time ago - has resulted in the Commonwealth receiving 15s. for every , &#163;2 it has to pay, out of its one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, on every ton of sugar produced by white men. After the 1st January, 1907, the excise will be increased to &#163;4 a ton and the bounty to &#163;3 a ton. The Commonwealth&#39;s one-fourth of the , &#163;4 excise will be&#163;1, and the bounty to be repaid will be &#163;3, so that the Commonwealth, out of its one-fourth, will have to pay , &#163;2 more than is received. While the States revenues will receive &#163;3 outof the &#163;4 excise, the Commonwealth will have to pay the bounty of &#163;3, and thus lose &#163;2 on every ton produced by white labour. </para>

              <para>- This does not appear to be a good bargain or a profitable arrangement for the Commonwealth, and the matter must receive consideration with a view to making, if possible, the payment a rebate, or otherwise the Commonwealth&#39;s one-fourth may not be able to bear the charge. The bounty payments are attaining large proportions. In 1902, the bounty paid to Queensland was &#163;24,493,andto New South Wales it was &#163;36,333, or a total of &#163;60,826. It is estimated that in 1906-7, the bounty paidto Queensland will amount to &#163;240,000, and to New South Wales to &#163;38,500, a total of . &#163;278,500, showing an increase of , &#163;217,674 in four years. It is estimated that the bounty paid to canegrowers by the end of 1906-7, including &#163;25,537 the expense of supervision, will, in Queensland, amount to &#163;532,826, and in New South Wales to &#163;192,358, a total of , &#163;725,184. The amount I have mentioned has been distributed amongst the States as follows: - New South Wales will have paid , &#163;266,493; Victoria, &#163;219,144 ; Queensland, , &#163;94,606 ; South Australia, &#163;67,722; Western Australia , &#163;44,798; and Tasmania, &#163;32,421; thus making up a total of &#163;725,184.

In New South Wales it is estimated that by the end of 1906 the sum of &#163;192,358 will have been paid in bounties, including expenses. I regret to say that the payment of this large amount has not resulted in an advance of white employment or of much increased cultivation - it is an absolute present to the cane-growers of New South, Wales, and without any sufficient result, so far as the policy of the Government and! Parliament is concerned. In 1902 there were 1,526 tons:, and in 1906 there were 1,614 tons produced bv white labour. </para>

              <para>- If we regard the position of the whole question of sugar growing by white labour, I think there is good cause for satisfaction. When the policy was introduced manyof us, and I, amongst the number, had great doubts as to whether white men would be able to work in this industry in the tropics. I had had some experience in the north-west tropical parts of Western Australia, but, so far as can be gathered from the figures, it seems that the policy established has beer. , thus far absolutely successful. It may be that finality has not been arrived at in dealing with this question, but I think we may all look&#39; to time and experience to finally place the question in a satisfactory position. The next question associated with the sugar industry is the repatriation of the kanakas, which has to take place almost immediately. I know I am only expressing the wish of the Government and of every member of this Parliament when I say that we all hope the greatest care will be taken in returning these men to their own country - that every kindness and consideration will be shown, and that every hardship that it is possible to avoid will be avoided. The Government have provided &#163;25,000 for the purpose of the repatriation. The Queensland Commission, which recently sat, estimated the cost of the deportation at &#163;53, 454. The members of the Commission state that there are 5,280 islanders liable to be returned, and they anticipate that not more than 4,500 will be deported. The Pacific Islanders&#39; Fund, of which we have heard so much from time to time, and which is in the Queensland Treasury, has, I am informed, only &#163;10,619 credit. It is estimated that, of the 4,500 who are likely to be deported, 900 will be sent away by the end of the year, and the remainder as soon as possible thereafter. The deportation of these kanakas is a part of the White Australia policy, and must be persevered with. I  aim  glad to be able to inform honorable members that satisfactory communications are going on with the Queensland Government for joint action in carrying out the law in this respect. I come now to a very important matter, the external trade of the Common wealth.. I refer, not to the Inter-State trade, but to the trade in imports and exports with countries beyond the seas. The value of our imports has not greatly varied during the last three years. In 1903 it amounted to . &#163;38, 835, 682. The value of our imports in 1905 is much about the same, the value of imports free of duty amounting to &#163;14,072,061, and of dutiable goods to , &#163;24,274,670, or a total of &#163;38,346,731. The figures show that 36.70 per cent. of our imports consisted of articles free of duty, while 63.30 consisted of dutiable articles. In 1900, the year before Federation, the value of our exports was &#163;45, 956,882 ; in 1905 the value of our exports had increased to &#163;56,841,035, an increase in five years amounting to , &#163;10,884,153. The value of our imports per head of population for last year amounted to , &#163;9 9s. 3d., and of our exports to , &#163;140s. 6d., making the total trade of Australia per head of population &#163;23 9s. 9d. I have prepared the following table of imports for1905, showing the value of the imports received under each <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> percentage, under the fixed duties exclusive of narcotics and stimulants and from narcotics and stimulants, with the amount of duty paid under each head : - </para>

          <para class="block">Our total oversea trade for 1905 amounted to - Exports, . &#163;56,841,035; imports, &#163;38,346,731; or a total of &#163;95,187,766, being &#163;677,708 greater than the total trade for the previous year, which was &#163;94,510,058. Our trade with foreign countries during 1905 increased to the extent of 2.75 per cent. In 1905 our trade with the United Kingdom was 52.29 per cent. , British Possessions 18.81 per cent., and with foreign countries 28.9 per cent., so that our trade with the United Kingdom and British Possessionslast year was about 71 per cent., as against about 29 per cent. with foreign countries. Our whole trade, including imports and exports, in 1901, was, with the United Kingdom 54.74 per cent., British Possessions 18.20 per cent., foreign countries 27.06 per cent. The division of trade is practically the same now, although the movement is towards an increase in the trade with foreign countries. In 1895, ten years ago, the percentage of imports was - From the United Kingdom 71.61, from British Possessions 11.46, and from foreign countries 16.93.  In  I005&#62; those percentages were - From the United Kingdom 60.17, from British Possessions 14.04, and from foreign countries 25.79. It would, therefore, appear that foreign countries are gradually increasing their trade with Australia, that our imports from the old country are gradually decreasing, and that British Possessions are holding their own.

I come now to a very important matter, and that is to my recommendations with regard to the financial problems of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. I am glad to say that I have been able to submit these recommendations with the full concurrence of my colleagues in the Government. The desire of the Government is to act as far as possible in accord with the wishes of the States. When I became Treasurer, I felt that it was my duty not to follow, but to endeavour to lead, in this -crucial matter. I felt that it was the duty of the Commonwealth Government, and, If with all diffidence I mav sa,v so, the duty of Parliament as well to lead the way rather than to leave it to others to discover a suitable road. Acting upon this principle, the Government have taken the responsibility of propounding a scheme with that object in view. I do not for a moment say that we have arrived at finality, or that the scheme I have propounded, and which has been approved by the Government, is the best for the purpose that could possibly be devised. But I do say that I am convinced that the plan I Have proposed is a good one, that it will meet the circumstances, and give satisfaction, not only to the Commonwealth, but also to the States. It is a difficult matter with which to deal, as we have to continually keep in mind the terms of the Constitution, the interests of the Commonwealth, and the interests of the States. These three considerations must be constantly borne in mind, and I felt that it would be of no use to propound a scheme unless I were fairly certain that it would be acceptable to the people. It would be most undesirable, as well as difficult, to attempt to force upon the country the views of the Government or even of Parliament. The desire of the Government is to arrive at a fair and reasonable arrangement with the States, and the best way to begin is to propound and recommend, as has been done, a scheme, to be criticised by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the States and by the people of Australia. It is not expedient that the Government should hesitate to take the lead in this matter. Nearly six years have passed1 since Federation was inaugurated, and that time has been fully. occupied in arranging the various Departments of Government and passing the laws necessary to give effect to the constitutional changes involved. Still, three Conferences of Premiers have been held in which this question has beer, raised, and, although some advance has been made towards a settlement, there is yet no finality. In four years&#39; time - on the 31st December, 1910 - section 87, the Braddon clause, becomes alterable. Parliament will then have the responsibility of deciding what amount of surplus Customs and Excise revenue shall be returned to the several States, and on what basis the return shall be made. I do not fear that the States will suffer injustice under this arrangement. This Parliament represents the people of the States, and will, I feel sure, always recognise the obligations and responsibilities of the States Governments. They have to carry out great works in settling people on the land, in building railways, providing water supplies, and giving all trie other facilities which are required for the- settlement and inprovement of the condition of the people, the provision of which does not come within the province of the Commonwealth. My confidence is somewhat shaken, however, when I notice that resolutions have been passed in Conference and in Parliament asking for a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution, under which the State of which, I am a representative would suffer a loss Of about&#39; ,&#163;300,000 a year. But, -although I have never seen any disposition on the part of the members of this Parliament to act -other than fairly and generously to the several States, I recognise that it is not right that the financial position of the States should be uncertain or unsafe, and dependent upon the annual votes of this Parliament. We should, therefore, begin to prepare at once fori the time when the. Braddon- provision will become alterable. I felt, on taking office as Treasurer, that the question was one of the chief obligations resting upon me, and have kept it in view ever since, and I went to London specially to obtain information in regard to the matter. In considering it. I have tried to meet the views expressed by the Premiers of the States  in Conference at Hobart, and to comply as nearly as possible with the terms of the Constitution. The proposals submitted have, as I have already said, received the approval of the Government, as a scheme most likely to meet with the support of those best acquainted with our constitutional and financial circumstances, and honorable members will find in the Budget papers the full proposals, with complete returns and tables which will be found useful in thoroughly investigating the position. The proposals of the Government embrace the taking over of the debts of the States, the amount of the debts to be so taken over, the continuance of section 87, the Braddon section, the amount and basis of the annual payments to the States, the bookkeeping system, the future borrowing by the States, some concluding remarks and a summary. I do not intend to deal with the scheme in detail now, as the full report is submitted for the information of honorable members. I have not consulted any one outside Australia in regard to matters between the Commonwealth and the States, because I am of opinion that those who possess full information and local knowledge are better able to deal with I hemthai: any one else. But, with regard to the taking over of the States debts and the substitution .of Australian stock for the States&#39; stock now existing, I /felt that great financial authorities in England could give valuable information, and I was not disappointed. Amongst those whom I had the privilege of consulting were the governor, deputy-governor, and officers of the Bank o&#39;f England, the directors and officers ofl the London and Westminster Bank, the brokers for those banks, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the permanent Financial Secretary to the Treasury, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hamilton. I also had the honour of an interview with Lord Goschen, who, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, carried out the ,gre.it scheme under which nearly ^600,000,000 worth of British stock was converted. In addition to having a long interview with Lord Goschen, I had a number of interesting conversations with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hamilton, who was his right-hand man throughout the negotiations referred to,, and who was then, as he is now, the principal financial Secretary to the Treasury. I&#39; also had the pleasure of meeting Lord Revelstok&#39;e, one of the governors of the Bank of England, and the head of the firm of Messrs. Baring Brothers. The conclusions I have arrived at after carefully considering the opinions expressed by those whom I have had the privilege of consulting are contained in a memorandum I addressed to the Prime Minister as follows :  - </para>

During its continuance it has never been of any advantage to the &#39; States, while it has hampered the Commonwealth, and prevented it dealing with important questions of policy. The one fact that if additional revenue were required from Customs and Excise, whether for general or specific purposes, it would be necessary to raise four times as much as was required, shows the unpractical character of such a provision, and renders its permanent continuance impossible. For instance,, if, say, an additional million were required from Customs and Excise for general purposes, it would necessitate raising four millions ; or, if an additional million were required for a specific purpose, such, for instance, as for Immigration, Defence, or Old-age Pensions, and a special Customs tax were imposed on certain articles with the object that the proceeds should be &#34;ear-marked&#34; for such, specific purpose, it would be necessary to raise four millions instead of the one million required. </para>

        <para class="block">The  Honorable the Prime Minister. </para>
        <para>In my Budget speech of the 22nd August, I said - &#34; Unless some arrangement can be made under which a fixed sum shall be returned to the States each year, it seems to me that we have no alternative but to continue the bookkeeping method - at any rate until the expiration of Section 87 of the Constitution.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> p. 121  1.) </para>
        <para>And again - &#34; I am of opinion that the bookkeeping system will never be acceptable as a permanent system to the people of Australia. It hampers both States and&#39; Commonwealth, and, although it has beer serviceable and will do good service for years to come, it cannot be looked upon as a permanent arrangement.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> p.  1211.) </para>
        <para>And again - &#34; My judgment leads me to believe that it will be found advisable to consider whether it is not possible to adopt the Canadian plan or some scheme which will be equitable and acceptable, under which&#39; it might be agreed that a fixed&#39; amount, subject, if necessary, to periodical adjustment, should be annually returnable to each State. If some such- proposal could be given effect the Commonwealth and the States&#39; would be in a position of. financial independence, and would be able to work out their financial &#39;problems in their own way.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> p. 1217.) </para>

            <para>The taking over by the Commonwealth of the State Debts is not necessarily connected with the return of any surplus revenue to the States, as, whether the Debts are taken over or not, the States will have to pay the interest. The necessities of- the States in this respect cannot, however, be ignored by the Commonwealth, as they have at the present time to pay &#163;8,400,000 annually in interest on their Public Debts, and largely rely upon the surplus returned&#39; by the Commonwealth to enable them to do so. There cannot in any case, I think, be any doubt as to the accuracy of the statement in my Budget speech - &#34; That the Commonwealth, with its great and exclusive &#39;power over Customs taxation, is .in a far stronger and better position to deal with- this great financial matter than are the States, either collectively or separately.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> p. 1216.) </para>

        <para class="block">I claim that these proposals are practicable, and that they are generous to the States. I submit that they are fair both to the States and to the Commonwealth, and that they are concisely put and easily understood. It will be noticed! that, although I propose that the scheme may be terminated upon the 31st December, 1920, there will be no occasion to bring it to an end unless Parliament decides to do so. It may continue indefinitely if it is regarded as suited to the circumstances. My reason for not making any proposal of a permanent character is that I do not believe&#39; it possible at the present time to formulate a plan that would be acceptable for all time to both the Commonwealth and the States. The difficulties in the way at present are too great, and we are  only  beginning to think  federally.  I think, however, that bv the end of 1920, when we shall have had  twenty  years&#39; experience of Federation, we shall be in  a far better position to again deal with the matter, if it is considered necessary to do so. If we were to attempt to make a permanent arrangement now, it would no doubt be necessary to amend the Constitution, and there might be obstacles to our success in that direction. There is plenty of room for criticism and for differences of opinion in this matter, and all I desire is that those who do not agree with me will suggest some better scheme. The honorable member for Mernda has had several conversations with me upon this matter, but I am sorry to say we are not in accord. He has in preparation a scheme which I hope he will allow me to place upon the table of the House in a few days, in order that honorable members may give it their full consideration. I have not seen the final draft of it, but honorable members know the .reputation of the honorable member. He has had a long commercial experience, and I believe that his scheme - which I will not venture to criticise at the present moment - aims at securing finality immediately. I am sorry to. say that I do not think his desire can be attained.  His  proposals are much more ambitious one than the proposals I have submitted, and I am quite sure that it will receive from honorable members every consideration. I thank the honorable member for what he has done, and regret I do not aGree with his views. I wish that some other honorable members, possessed of similar knowledge and experience, would do the same. I submit my proposals with confidence, and in the hope that they will prove acceptable to the Governments of the States and the people of Australia. I suppose it is characteristic of me that, while I do not make up my mind in a moment, when once I have made it up I am not easily turned from mv resolve. Probably that is the reason why I am sometimes credited with being an autocrat. </para>

              <para>- I am also glad to say that the proposals now submitted are practically in accord with the views expressed by the Premiers of the States at the Hobart Conference. As a matter of fact, they are more generous to the States than were the proposals of the Premiers. For instance, I do not suggest that the States should for ever forego the right to borrow on the London market except through the Commonwealth - as was agreed to at the Hobart Conference - but I propose to make that question an open one after 1920. In no way are the present recommendations of the Government less liberal to the States than were those submitted by the Premiers themselves at Hobart. If honorable members will look at Appendix B they will see that I have annotated the recommendations of the Premiers, so as to show clearly where they differ, and in what respect our proposals are more liberal or less liberal, than those submitted by the Premiers. Our proposals will give - subject to certain limitations - financial freedom alike to the States and the Commonwealth. The last subject with which I am called upon to deal is the Tariff. I am not in a position to submit proposals for an amendment of the Tariff with my Budget statement. Had I been able to do so, it would have been most desirable, because I should then have been in a position to indicate the financial effects of the proposals. Up to the present time, only the operation of the excise duties has been reported upon by the Tariff Commission, and considered by the Government. It is impossible for me to announce the * probable effect of any proposed duties until more reports have been received from the Commission embodying their recommendations in regard to Customs, and until their general effect upon the revenue has been ascertained. I should like to point out - no doubt it has occurred to honorable members - that any proposals for an amendment of the Tariff must take effect immediately they are submitted. That being so, their consideration will require to be proceeded with, without delay, until the final decision has been arrived at. That is a very important point, which honorable members should thoroughly weigh. In dealing with Tariff reform, we ought not to commence the consideration of any proposals we cannot finish. What would be our position if, after levying duties during the next month or two, it was found that we could not conclude the consideration of the Bill authorizing them during the present Parliament? I think that we should be compelled to return all the money that we had collected under the proposed duties unless we could pass legislation to legalise the collection of the duties until the. new Parliament has time to pass the necessary law - and that might be difficult, besides being unprecedented. It will thus be seen that great difficulties would arise, The Governnent recognise the great importance of the interests affected, and are most anxious to afford whatever relief is possible to any injured industries at the earliest possible moment. We desire to complete the. work of the session by the end of September, and will deal with all reports of the Tariff Commission, which we have proper time to consider, within the time available. It would, of course, have been preferable if the whole of the proposed amendments of the Tariff could be dealt with at one time, in order not only that their effect upon the revenue might be known, but also that any extra expenditure upon defence caused by the proposals now under consideration, and others not yet ripe for submission, might have been considered in the light of the revenue likely to be available. I have now dealt with all the subjects that occur to me. In Committee, Ministers in charge of the various Departments will be only too anxious to give full information upon every item which appears in the Estimates or in the Budget papers. The Government have no secrets. We  have no skeleton in our political cupboard. We desire to take honorable members into our confidence upon every public matter in respect of which it is reasonable and proper for us to do so. In conclusion, I would ask honorable members to try to realize what the  4,000,000  of British people in Australia have done and are doing. They have  &#163;107,000,000  upon deposit at the banks, of which over  &#163;23,000,000  are in coin and bullion. Thev have deposits in the Savings Banks of over  &#163;37,000,000,  and the number of depositors is  1,152,506.  They have produced minerals to the value of  &#163;636,000,000,  Qf which  &#163;24,766,000  were produced during  1905.  Of this  &#163;636,000,000,  the sum of  &#163;462,439,000  represents the production of gold, and of that quantity  &#163;15,500.000  worth was produced in  1905.  Perhaps I may be pardoned for saying that more than half of the gold production of that year came from Western Australia. </para>

          <para class="block">They have  9,380,000  acres under cultivar tion not including grass and fallow lands. During the last two years they have produced wheat valued at  &#163;18,766,000,  and have exported butter valued at  &#163;4,792,000.  They have  75,000,000  sheep,  8,000,000  cattle,  1,600,000  horses, and  1,000,000  pigs.. Their sheep have increased during the last three and three-quarter years by  22,000,000,  and the value of the wool produced is now over  &#163;20,000,000,  having increased during the same period by  &#163;7,000,000.  In  1906  their oversea trade represented  &#163;95,000,000;  their imports being of the value of  &#163;38,000,000  and their exports of the value of  ,&#163;57,000,000.  I am glad to say that  71  per cent, of this trade was with the people of the British Empire - our own people - the remaining  29  per cent, being with the people of foreign countries. The value of their imports is  &#163;15,000,000  less than those of Canada, but their exports exceed in value those of Canada by  &#163;13,000,000,  and of South Africa by  ,&#163;25,000,000. </para>

              <para>- As compared with our population of about  4,121,000.  The people of Australia produce annually about  &#163;3,000,000  worth of hay,  &#163;1,400,000  worth of potatoes, arid  6,000,000  gallons of wine. They have a grand total of primary annual production, including manufactures, representing a value of about  ,&#163;120,000,000  a year. They have great and populous cities, railways, &#39; tramways, water supplies, telegraphs, telephones, shipping facilities with the world and on their coasts, and are in -enjoyment of most of the advantages, conveniences, and luxuries of the old world. They have thirty times as many sheep, and produce forty times as much wool as Canada, whilst they have five times as many sheep as in the whole of South Africa. They produced last year  54,000,000  bushels of wheat, being only  15,000,000  bushels less than the output of Canada, which is regarded as the granary of the world. They produced nearly five times as much gold as Canada, their product being valued at only  &#163;1,500.000  less than that of South Africa&#34;, which has been considered as the greatest gold producer of recent times. This is what the people of Australia -  4,000,000  British people - are doing. We have our dlifficulties, p political, as well as financial; we have had to face times of depression as well as of prosperity, ; but the results I have referred to remain. Whether we look at our position collectively or individually we have, I think, good cause for satisfaction and gratefulness. Collectively, we have an opportunity - given to no other 4,000,000 people in the world - of guiding the destinies of an immense continent &#34; compass&#39;d by the inviolate sea,&#34; and of fashioning its laws &#34;broad based upon her people&#39;s will.&#34; Individually, far removed from the crowded centres of the old world, and its grinding competition - in a sunny land, with healthy and pleasant surroundings, where there is plenty of room for all to make a living, and even gain a competence - surely we may rejoice that our &#34; walks&#34; are &#34; by the long wash of Australasian seas,&#34; and that we have the opportunity and the privilege - </para>

            <para>.- I desire to deal briefly with the provisions of the Bill, which should not be allowed to pass without a critical examination of its scope and the probable efficacy of its provisions. We have heard a good deal front time to time from the Prime Minister as to the possibility of great good being done by the granting of bounties to rural industries. If the farmers of Australia rely upon this Bill as a stimulus to the agricultural and associated industries throughout the Continent they will be somewhat severely disappointed. The policy of bounties is one that we ought not to launch without being fairly sure that the limits of its application are likely to be adhered to, and that it will probably be successful. In nearly all cases bounties are continued after the period during which they were intended to apply, and in most they are increased. The position is the same, whether it be a bounty or a protective duty. In 1789, when Madison in troduced his first Tariff, and placed a duty of7&#189; per cent. on cotton in order to stimulate the industry, he said that it was to be imposed for only a few years, and that the industry, being once established, could continue without adventitious aid. But the duty was increased to 35 per cent. in 1812. Cotton is one of the lines which, under this Bill, is to be stimulated into productivity in Australia by means of a bounty. I may also point to the experience of Canada. Although I do not wishto specify the articles in respect of which the bounties were given, we know that the original policy, both with regard to period and amount, was never adhered to. Some of the commodities that are to be the subjects of bounty under this Bill have already had the bounty system applied to them in Australia. I think that fifteen or twenty years ago Queensland granted a bounty to stimulate the cotton industry. In 1892 some 700 or 800 acres there were under cotton, and produced over 200,000 lbs. of ginned cotton. According to recent information, the industry has not progressed. It is now practically non-existent, or, at all events, insignificant, so that we have practical experience as regards the effect of granting a bounty on cotton produced in Australia. </para>

              <para>- We are not going to get an assurance of high prices or regularity in prices in the future any more than we did in the past. As regards cotton, within the last fifteen or twenty years there have been serious fluctuations in price, but they are likely to continue. Between 1860 and 1870, owing to the American war, there were bigger fluctuations. But as regards the future, it must be remembered that during the last ten years the demand for cotton has fluctuated a good deal ; on the whole, it has been on the increase. Considering that certain parts of New South Wales and Queensland have been declared to be fairly well suited for theproduction of cotton, that the price is good, that cotton goods production and their exportation are increasing  in  England, there is every inducement to private enterprise, even without a bounty, to enter into the cotton industry in Australia. With a bounty it has not been a success in the past. I mentioned that in England the demand for cotton is increasing. &#34; The figures forlast year show that, notwithstanding the allegation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> and some of his followers, the cotton industry there is particularly strong. The actual profit made by the industry in Lancashire last year was estimated at  &#163;668,000.  There is a very big demand for cotton within the Empire itself if it can be produced here. Let me take some of the other items. To a large extent, coffee production depends for success, not so much on any bounty - and certainly not on the bounty offered in this Bill - but on the quality of the article. This is a bounty on production, and not a bounty on quality. That is, I think, the. experience of the commercial world. Coffee is now produced in Australia, but the small amount offered here as a bounty is not likely to induce a much larger production. Coffee of fair quality - and I have drunk some of it - is, I understand, produced in Norfolk Island. I believe that it is produced in parts of the Commonwealth. What we want to do is to get a reputation for coffee, and that will depend upon its quality. The offer of this bounty - which, if it does anything, may perhaps draw into the industry a few small men, who generally fail - is not likely to lead to a very great stimulus in production. On many lines we have had bounties in operation in the States. In&#39; South Australia, for instance, there was a bounty on the production of olive oil. It will show how unequal bounties are when I mention that practically that bounty was drawn bv one or two men. I think that one man derived the principal advantage from it. It has beer, in existence in South, Australia, and I do not think that the fact that the Commonwealth offers a bounty which, under the terms of this Bill, could not last for more than a year, would act as a stimulus to production. I do not know what the draftsman w.as about when he drafted the Bill. It seems to me to have been drawn&#39; by an amateur rather than bv a professional draftsman. I believe that olive trees do not bear until about nine years after they have been planted. The bounty which is to induce  Production  is to expire at the end of ten years, therefore it will last for only one year. </para>

              <para>- Either the bounty must be given up or the Bill must be remodelled in that regard. There is one objection to the whole scheme. Bounties ought to be given for the production of commodities which are likely to be produced over a fair area throughout the Commonwealth. In other words, the benefit df the bounty ought to be fairly well distributed throughout its territory. It is a great mistake to introduce bounties, the benefits of which can be enjoyed by only one State, or, at most, by one or two States. This is a subvention chiefly to the industries of Queensland and New South Wales, if to any extent it is likely to be availed of. </para>

              <para>- I beg the Minister&#39;s pardon, the conditions under which they are to receive the bounty are not existent in the Northern Territory. It is of no use to offer a bounty for the production of cotton in places where it could not be produced by white labour. The honorable gentleman offers a bounty with one hand, and practically takes it away with the other. Within the settled district&#39;s of Australia, so far as bounties are likely to be effective, they would operate chiefly in Queensland and parts of New South &#34;Wales. The reports say that cotton can be produced here; but, leaving out the Northern Territory, I have not seen in a report a reference to any other part of Australia where the cotten industry is likely to be successful. We have had from the Treasurer to-day figures showing that in bounties on sugar production alone Queensland and New South Wales have received, in the last five years, over ^700,000, and that there has been an average shrinkage of ,&#163;100,000 a year from import duties on sugar. So that, in connexion with the sugar industry, those States have received a subvention of over ;&#163;i, 200,000 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> and the operation of this Bill will be, although in a comparatively small way, in further aid of industries in those territories. I am not seeking to draw any distinction between the States. What I submit is that bounties ought to be given in respect of such commodities as are likely to be produced over a fairly wide area of the States, or, at all events, be applied to commodities the production of which would not be confined to one or two States. Because, so far as production was likely to be confined to one or two States^ those States could produce the article unaided. This is an Australian policy, or it is nothing. But if a bounty on the production of commoditieswhich are almost peculiar to a State be desired, then that State, with the consent of the Commonwealth, has the powerto make the necessary provision. The duty rests upon the Stales to stimulate certain classes of production. Talking of the probability of the success of bounties, I said in the beginning that in many cases they have failed. I remember reading in the report of the Tobacco Commission that the bounties given in the State of Victoria for the production of tobacco had failed. The amount was, I think, 3d. per lb. ; and1 for reasons which one may or may not accept, given in the Commission&#39;s report, and* for causes which are also explained in <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> and other authorities, the bounties-&#39; were not a success. That, at all events, suggests that we should be cautious before launching out on a system of bounties, the extension of which is almost certain to be demanded. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps sp. But, at all events, bounties could not keep it alive, and we cannot afford to forfeit excise for the sake of bounties on tobacco. I do not quite understand the scope of this Bill. The Minister of Trade and Customs mentioned, and&#39; clause 3 describes, what bounties shall be given in respect, of the goodswhich the Minister is to find to be &#34; of a merchantable quality.&#34; This is one of those Bills which prescribes a number of duties that necessitate the Minister being an expert. Under clauses 5 and 7, for instance - and in the latter clause, althoughthe Governor-General is mentioned, the Minister is meant - the Minister is to do certain things. He is to find what is the standard rate of wages in a particular industry. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 7 prescribes that he is to determine the market value of certain commodities, All that I cansay is, that if the Minister efficaciously discharges the duties imposed on him bv theBill, he must become an expert. Then thebounty is to be given to&#39; a number of persons. It is to be given to the grower or producer of the goods in question ; but we also find in clause 4 that -  the owner, occupier, or lessee of .any land or factory in which the goods were  produced.  or in which they may &#39;have gone for any process of manufacture, shall be deemed to be a producer. If the bounty is .to be given to the grower or the producer, and also to all the persons mentioned in clause 4, who are also to be regarded as producers, it seems to me that the amount which each of them will get must be very small. Some portion of it will go to persons who have absolutely nothing to do with the production of the commodities. There seems to be something wrong, either in the draftsmanship or in the policy of this Bill. Surely the, lessee of land as well as the owner ought not to share in the bounty. The lessee may be the producer or he may not. The owner may be the producer or he may not. But you cannot have both the owner and the lessee as producers of a particular commodity - except under the definition of this Bill. We ought to be careful before we consent to the system proposed. It is not likely to be attended with any benefit to the genuine producer on whose behalf the Minister professes to be so solicitous, and its benefits will be less than the producer had a right to expect, after reading the platform generalizations of the Prime Minister as to what he was going to do for the agricultural industry. The Bill and the policy which it represents are not likely to lead to that extended production throughout Australia which we have been led to expect, and if the farmers have any such hopes, they are likely to be falsified. </para>

              <para>- I know that he has a great deal of important business - principally in connexion with his electorate. The Prime Minister need not apologize for the absence of his colleague, because we know quite well where he is. He is doing what we should all like &#39; to be doing, and for the same reason. He is electioneering, and he is doing that persistently ; but I submit that when a Minister brings down important proposals to this House, such as the Minister of Trade and Customs has done in connexion with the Anti-Trust Bill and this Bounty Bill, he ought to be here to see those measures through. He ought to be here until our business upon them is completed. But we find this honorable gentleman throwing Bills down on the table of the House, reading some statements in support of them., which very often he does not understand - and when asked for information he cannot give it. For instance, when discussing the growth of cotton the other day the Minister quoted some figures, and when interrogated by the honorable member for North Svdney as to whether he was referring to raw cotton, or otherwise, he had not the slightest idea. He could not tell us whether he was speaking of raw cotton or any other kind of cotton. Honorable members, who would have undertaken to speak to-day, have gone away,  expecting  that, as usual, the Opposition would keep the debate going. I think it is about time this kind of thing was stopped. So far as I am concerned, I shall decline to proceed in view of what I regard as a direct breach of the understanding arrived at on Friday.&#34; </para>

              <para>- When interrupted by the call for a quorum, I was saying that it was distinctly understood by honorable members on this side that the figures which the Minister of Trade and </para>

          </continue>
          <para>* Customs did not put forward in full, but merely alluded to as his ground for introducing a measure of this character, would be placed in the -hands of honorable members before they were called upon to continue the debate. Had it not been for that understanding. I am sure honorable members in all parts of the House would have insisted on the Minister giving the figures in full. The Minister said that the figures contained important information which it had taken twelve months to gather, and which had induced him to introduce the Bill. Not only so, but it was suggested by honorable members on this side that, in order that the information might be available in time, it should not be handed to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but should be printed as a separate document. We now find ourselves called upon to discuss the Bill ; and to that I should not have objected in the least had the promise been fulfilled. We are asked to resume the debate without the information which is the basis of the measure, and which the Minister promised to supply. I cannot believe that if the Minister were here, he, knowing what took place on  Friday,  would not recognise the position  at once. It cannot be said to be the fault of honorable members that delay has taken place in the printing of the documents. So much was I satisfied with the Minister&#39;s promise, that, like the deputy-leader of the. Opposition&#39;, I have waited for the information before coming to any conclusion on the Bill. At the present moment, not only have we not the necessary information, but we have not our own figures prepared, because we have been waiting for what the Minister had to place before us, naturally anticipating that he would have figures from the best source to enable us to con&#39;sider a measure of the kind. I hope that the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs, will see the desirability of carrying out the understanding arrived at, and not insist on a second reading debate in which, while considering the necessity for the Bill, we have to deal, not with its details, but with its methods. </para>

              <para>- Not merely with the principle of bonuses ; because, whether an honorable member is, or is not, in favour of bounties or bonuses as a principle, he must consider whether the Bill proposed deals with items that require a bounty - which will most benefit by a bounty - or whether there are included items which are not deserving, or which should come second when such a question is being considered. That is the information we anticipated obtaining from the figures referred to by the Minister. It looks to me like taking advantage of honorable members to promise such figures and then fail to supply them. Had the Minister not made that promise we should doubtless have required the figures to be quoted, in order to  satisfy  us as to the desirability or otherwise of the Bill. I am prepared to resume the debate in a sort of way without the figures, but I am sure every honorable member will admit that, with the information available, he would be in a much better position to consider the question. </para>

But since honorable members press the meaning they attached to the remarks of the Minister of Trade and Customs, I suggest that, as the next measure to be proceeded with is not immediately available,  you,  sir, under the extraordinary circumstances of to-day, might see your way, with the consent of the House, to leave the chair,  and resume it at the usual hour after dinner. Such a course would relieve the honorable member for North Sydney from speaking on the measure before he is prepared to do so. </para>

We have already passed laws dealing with copyright, patents of invention, and trade marks. The only power remaining under the sub-section which we have not vet exercised is that relating to designs. The Bill is rather urgent, because certain practical difficulties have arisen in connexion with the operation of the other measures to which I have referred which necessitate the passing as soon as possible of a law dealing with this branch of the subject. A Convention between several leading European countries was signed at Paris on the 20th March.1883, and in the following year Great Britain gave her assent to it.

              <para>- No; this measure is based on the English Act. The English law on the subject is to be found in the Trade Marks Act of 1883 and amending Acts of 1888. This Bill embodies the principles of the English law, and applies the machinery we have already adopted in connexion with the other Acts to which I have referred to meet the circumstances of the Commonwealth. The administration of the law will be in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs. It is provided that there shall be a Registrar, but it is not intended to create any new office. The administration of this Bill will be in the hands of the present Commissioner of Patents, and there will therefore be no increased cost in that respect as the result of passing this measure. There is power given in the Bill to appoint  deputy  registrars, the intention being that if it should be found necessary in any of the States, there may be such an officer appointed for the purposes of this Bill. </para>

In clause 4 it is provided that &#34;design&#34; - means an industrial design applicable, in any way or by any, means, to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, of an article, or to any two or more of those purposes, while &#34; article &#34; means &#34; any article or substance.&#34; What is protected is the copyright in a design as distinct from the article to which a design is applied. Under the English law, the protection of designs covered originally only designs applied to certain classes of fabrics, such as cotton; but it was afterwards extended to designs applied to other articles, and now relates to all designs applied to articles of manufacture. The design is distinct from the article to which it is applied. For instance, the pattern printed upon cotton goods is something apart from the goods themselves, being the result of an effort to produce something to take the fancy and capture the taste of the public. In some instances, the design is the configuration or shape of the article to which it is applied. For instance, a design of the shape of a lamp shade has been held in a leading case on the subject to be protected. </para>

              <para>- No; but it requires the owner of a registered design, if he wishes to have protection for five years, to use it within two years after registration, and there is a proviso, which was inserted because of the provision in the English law, to the effect that, if the design is used in any manufacture abroad, the period within which it must be used here shall be limited to six months. The author of a design is to be regarded as its first owner; but if a design has been made on behalf of any person for valuable consideration, that person shall be deemed to be its author, and the author of an unregistered design may, by instrumentin writing, assign it, and the right to make application for its registration. The person registered as the owner of a registered design is to be regarded as the owner of a copyright in the design, while the registered design will be personal property, capable of assignment, and of transmission by operation of law; but the assignment must be in writing, and signed by the registered owner. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; it will extend for five years in all cases. Then theBill sets out the procedure to be followed in the registration of designs. Clause 19 provides that, after an application for registration has been lodged, the design may be published and used without prejudice. Thenfurther provision is made that certain conditions shall be fulfilled before registration is granted. If these conditions are not complied with, the Registrar will have power to refuse registration. Then an appeal&#39; will lieto the Law Officer of the Commonwealth, which means the Attorney-General or the Crown Solicitor. </para>

Part V. deals with the remedies for infringement of copyright or design. The person who infringes a copyright is liable to an action for damages, or for penalty, or to have an injunction issued against him. But it is not intended that a penalty shall be imposed upon, or damages awarded against, an offender unless it is shown that he has knowingly infringed a copyright. </para>

              <para>- We are now dealing with a class of cases quite different from that which&#34; the honorable member has in his mind. Part VI. deals with the register of designs. There is to be a register in which proper entries shall be made, and there is the usual provision that trusts shall not be noticed in the register. Other &#34;&#39; clauses deal with the inspection of the register, and provide for penalties for making false entries, and also for the correction of the register. In minor matters, the Registrar may, upon request, amend or alter the register by correcting any error ; but in important matters the Court itself must be appealed to. TEe miscellaneous clauses include provisions which give power to make regulations and to deal with certain offences. Clause 47 is worthy of notice. Registration cannot be obtained for a design if it has been previously published. At public exhibitions it is very often desirable to display designs for certain purposes, and clause 47 provides that designs exhibited under such circumstances shall be protected. Under clauses 48 and 49 the Commonwealth will be empowered to take advantage of the Conventions to which I have already referred. The measure is based upon English legislation, which went through several changes before if reached its present stage. We have in the six different States conflicting laws with regard to the registration of designs, and this is one of those matters in which, above all things, it is desirable to bring about uniformity, in order that&#39; one registration may give protection throughout the Commonwealth </para>

            <para>- I cannot understand the attitude of honorable members who, because they have not pluck to stand up in their places, and say they are against the construction of a transcontinental railway, wish to postpone the evil day by voting for a survey which they pretend does not commit them. The Treasurer has already stated his view of this matter. No; I am wrong in saying that, because the Treasurer afterwards wished us to believe that he had scarcely used the words attributed to him. I am sure, however, that honorable members will see that the moment they assent to this Bill the people of the western State will say to them, &#34; You have voted for the survey, and for an expenditure of &#163;20,000 of public funds, and, now you are opposed to the verdict of your own arbiters.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I wish to test the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the gentlemen from the Western Australian gold-fields. The honorable member for Coolgardie spoke eloquently in this House of the necessity to inaugurate a service of motor cars from Esperance .to Kalgoorlie, and the construction of a special track over which that  type  of conveyance could move with its customary celerity. That honorable member pointed out that the  difficulty  lay in the fact that the Commonwealth could not construct a line through any one State without the consent of that State, and that Western Australia would be opposed to an Esperance  Bay  line through its territory. The opposition of Western Australia, as a whole, to the proposal for a railway from Esperance Bay, lies undeniably in the fact that it would lead to the gold-fields market being largely supplied from the eastern States. Over a transcontinental line the coastal farmers of Western Australia know full well that not a ton of produce from the eastern States could find its way into their market in competition with their produce. On the  other  hand they know that if a line from Esperance Bay were built the cost of freight would be very considerably lessened to the eastern producers, and for that very reason thev are anxious at all hazards to prevent its construction. It was for that reason that the honorable member for Coolgardie suggested in a very able speech the method of transit to which I have just referred ; and I wish to give that honorable member a chance to stand to his original protestations. To show that the people on the western gold-fields are not altogether  unrecognisant  of the great advantages of having an Esperance  Bay  line, I shall quote from the report of a civic welcome which was tendered to the leader of the Labour Party when he visited the gold-fields last May. </para>

I should like to point out that if such an amendment were allowed there would be no finality to the Bill, because it would then be open to honorabe members to move an amendment authorizing the survey of a line from Perth to Port Darwin or from Perth to Sydney, and so on. I am of opinion that the amendment is distinctly out of order, and not within the scope of the Bill. The only way by which such an amendment could&#39; be moved would be by an instruction from the House to the Committee. </para>

            <para>- I should like to ask for some information for myself, and for honorable members. The leave in connexion with a measure of this character is necessitated by that part which deals with the expenditure of public money. It will be open to .me to submit my amendment when the next clause is under consideration. So far as the expenditure of public funds under this measure is concerned the&#39; inclusion of names in the title of the Bill does not in any way affect the sum of money to be voted, because the House may still choose not to exceed the large amount of  &#163;20,000. </para>

        <para class="block">I do not think the amendment can be ruled out of order, and I commend it to the attention of the &#34; Committee. I feel somewhat at a loss in approaching this subject in the absence of the esteemed assistance of my right honorable friend the Treasurer. I had hoped to have had his aid in making the terms of my proposition clear. The amendment is practically to test the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of my honorable friends the representatives of Western Australia in yet another direction. On this occasion I wish to test the value of their protest that this line will pay, and that the survey will show that it will pay to such am extent that the House will not hesitate, upon receipt of the report of the surveyors, to proceed with the work. Honorable members have scouted the idea that the survey will be in any way detrimental to the construction of the line. Holding- that view, they can hardly fail to support this amendment, which asks Western Australia or South Australia - or both of them, should they see fit to combine - to undertake to refund to the Commonwealth the cost of the survey in the event of its not being satisfactory. My honorable friends who are so satisfied that the line would be a success can hardly object to my amendment. </para>

            <para>-  Something like what I hope the projected railway will be very soon. On a former occasion honorable members addressed themselves to an almost similar amendment in a frame of mind that seemed to indicate that they thought it was merely a method of shelving the work. It is obviously not that, for the very best advertisement the railway could have would be a clear indication that these honorable members are prepared to back the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of their own assertions. If they are not it is about time the Bill was put in the waste-paper basket. We have had this Bill sprung upon us on many occasions. Its consideration to-night has actually taken the Treasurer by surprise, and so put an additional difficulty in the way of honor- able members properly understanding its scope and alleged necessity. I have told honorable members exactly what the amendment is intended to do, and I hope they will support me. Let them prove their <inline font-style="italic">bonafides</inline> in this direction- - let them say that, in the event of the Commonwealth failing eventually to construct the line, Western Australia or Western Australia and South Australia combined should refund the expenses of the survey, and I shall have no further objection to the passing of the measure. I give honorable members this opportunity, and I can see that the honorable member for Gray is coming over to my view. While I am dealing with this subject, I should like to point to yet another peculiarity, which makes my amendment still more valuable. Those who have read the reports on this proposal know that there will probably be some difficulty in inducing South Australia to agree to the route advocatedby some Commonwealth engineers, and which would possibly be advocated by this House. It is obvious that if a deadlock ensued owing to South Australia&#39;s tyrannical objection, the Commonwealth would have absolutely sacrificed the expenditure of &#163;20,000, which we are now asked to authorize. In these circumstances, the Committee, as a business body, must see that, before this clause is passed, the taxpayers of the Commonwealth are safeguarded to the extent I have proposed. </para>

            <para>- There is a slight difference between the amendment as circulated last year, and the amendment as now proposed. The former simply dealt with land adjacent to the route of the proposed railway in Western Australia, and, as the honorable member for Wannon was able to prove on a former occasion, the value of the actual area proposed to be set aside in that State would not cover a third of the yearly deficit which is expected by our experts to accrue from the construction of the line. Any honorable member who is anxious to see the exact figures which he quoted can look up the report of his remarks. He was able to show that the maximum rental value of all this land in Western Australia is 10s. per thousand acres, and that if every acre of the land were taken up at the maximum rate, still this alleged concession on the part of Western Australia would not wipe off more than, I speak from memory, a third of the estimated annual deficit. My amendment differs from the former amendment, inasmuch as it also asks South Australia to give a similar undertaking to the Commonwealth. It has often been said that the proposal for the construction of the  railway is put forward in the nacional cause, and is not submitted from any selfish, narrow, or provincial feeling on the part of South Australia or Western Australia. Therefore I confess I anticipate no objection whatever from the Western Australian representatives to this amendment. They have already accepted it in principle, because they have told us that their State is prepared to agree to its application. Having accepted it in principle, they cannot &#39; reasonably object to that principle being inserted in this measure. Their word, I feel quite sure, is as good as their bond, but we are here in a business capacity as trustees for the Australian taxpayer. My proposal is one which no Western Australian can reasonably refuse to accept, that is, if it is intended by them to deal fairly with the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>.- 1  hope that the Minister will see his way to accept this amendment, because it embodies a principle for which honorable members in this House and in other Parliaments have fought for many years. It embodies what is a plank in most liberal programmes. It is a sensible application of the betterment principle which has been advocated all over the British Empire. To my mind it would be a mistake if, when this Federal Parliament, had an opportunity of this kind, it refused to adopt the betterment principle. A Government professing such markedly liberal tendencies as that now in office would be wise to accept it in order to show that it is in touch with democratic thought. Even in Russia the land question has assumed enormous dimensions. This amendment, in its humble way, also deals with that important question. It will mean that any increase in value given to the land by the expenditure of the Commonwealth will be secured for the benefit of the railway line. That is a principle which I believe every member of the present Government has advocated on platforms innumerable; and for the life of me T cannot understand why it should not meet with the most cordial acceptance from the Minister of Home Affairs. I urge him to consider whether the Government cannot, in accordance with its previous declarations, accept the amendment, and prevent therather appalling change &#39;of front which would come about if on. a division its members were found to have voted against it. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the Government will give attention to the request that has been preferred. It may be that, under the existing condition of affairs, when neither Government nor individuals seem to think it necessary to give serious attention to the finances, it is not of much use to appeal to them - especially after the statement which has been made to-day, that our expenditure has jumped up bv half-a-million pounds a year, and that it is proposed to forego charges for services rendered which will approximate to something like &#163;250,000. In view of such facts, an expenditure of &#163;20,000 does not seem to be of much concern. </para>

            <para>- I have not said so, but the honorable member for Kalgoorlie is entitled to his own opinion as to what its effect will be. Although the money involved in this Bill is merely such a sum as might be paid out of one&#39;s waistcoat pocket, so to speak, yet it would commit this Parliament to an expenditure of over &#163;5,000,000. It might, therefore, be as well to exercise a little foresight. Of course, it is true as already stated that until both South Australia and Western Australia give their consent, the survey is all that can be undertaken towards the construction of the line. But, in my humble judgment, nothing like a complete survey, showing the possibilities of the vast tract of country concerned, can be made for anything like the sum set down in this Bill. Our experience of railway surveys in the States^ which are our only reliable guide, do not bear out the assumption that &#163;20,000 would be sufficient for a complete investigation of approximately 1,000 miles of country. But, assuming tha&#39;t the Government is warranted in undertaking the survey, we are not doing too much, in providing that those who are most vitally concerned, the. States through which the line will pass, shall give some assurance of their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> Personally, I think that there is no warrant for the construction of the railway, and that the best interests of Western Austra- </para>

            <para>- When people expect to obtain a benefit at the expense of some one else they will naturally reach out for it. That is a characteristic which is as inherent in the Victorian as in the Western Australian miner. It is human nature the world over. But that is no justification for Parliament committing itself without due consideration. I hope that the Government will safeguard the position by requiring the two States concerned to give us some assurance of their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> That they can do by transferring the land abutting on the proposed line to the control of. the Commonwealth. It may be that the land is not of great value now, but if, the line is constructed, it will have a value ; and we should have some guarantee, because the estimates which we now have show that there will be a considerable loss if the line is built. The first thing required is the assent of the two States which are chiefly interested in- this proposal to the construction of the line. The assent of Western Australia is not in question, but we know from the correspondence which has taken place between the Commonwealth and the Government of South Australia that the latter State will not assent to the construction of the line, even at the expense of the Commonwealth, unless a particular route be followed. Assuming, therefore, that a survey, -be made of another route, which does not meet with the approval of South Australia, what will be the result? The money expended upon the survey will have been practically wasted. That is a further reason why the Government should have some assurance from these States that the Commonwealth, will be safeguarded if the railway be constructed. If they declined! to vest in the Commonwealth an area of  25  miles, upon each side of the line, perhaps thev might be willing to grant to the Commonwealth alternate blocks. At any rate, it would be an evidence of the belief of South Australia and Western Australia that the undertaking would eventually prove to be a profitable one. In short, it would be a guarantee of their good faith. I feel, however, that, rightly or wrongly, the Government intend to undertake this survey. I realize that it is almost useless to appeal to them not to do so. I do hope, however, that, in their saner moments, they will - before the Bill is finally disposed of - take into consideration the view which I have presented. It is a strange coincidence that every Government which has been in power has seen fit to submit a Bill dealing with the proposed line. But ir. this, as in <inline font-style="italic">most other matters, numbers count for</inline> everything, and we know from experience that the Government command the requisite numbers. At the same time, they must recognise that it is only the righteousness of a cause which will enable them to hold the numbers together. I ask them why thev cannot accept the amendment? Do they intend, by means of their majority, to force this undertaking upon an unwilling country ? </para>

I ask the honorable member for Moira not to assist in inserting in the Bill an amendment which is utterly alien to its provisions. The measure simply seeks the authorization of Parliament to the expenditure of a certain sum upon the survey of a route, whereas the amendment proposes that, in connexion with that survey, we shall permanently appropriate part of the estate of Western Australia.

          <para>.- The Minister has told us of the enormous sacri-(ices which the people of Western Australia are prepared to make in this matter, but he concluded bv saying that they are not prepared to put their undertaking into writing in the terms of my amendment. The honorable and learned gentleman has greatly over-estimated the extraordinary nature of the surrender proposed bv Western Australia in this regard. This line will pass through  450  miles of Western Australian territory ; that, multiplied by fifty miles, will give an area of  14,400,000  acres. If all this land were taken up at the maximum rental obtained&#39; in the West for similar country, it would yield a revenue of only  &#163;7,200  per annum. The experts intrusted with the matter by the Commonwealth have estimated that the deficit to be expected from this line, arising from the excess of working expenses and interest charges over gross revenue, will amount to  &#163;70,000  per annum. Therefore, the great sacrifice which Western Australia is prepared to make, and which the Minister thinks should be sufficient to induce us, as the trustees of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, to withdraw all other objections to the proposal, is a sacrifice equal only to one-tenth of the actual annual loss which the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will have to bear in connexion with the running of the line. </para>

            <para>-  I refer to certain closer settlement proposals. Here we have an opportunity to start afresh. If- the amendment is accepted, no graduated land tax will ever be necessary in connexion with the area involved, because we shall retain the enhanced value given to this land by the construction of the line. The Commonwealth is being pledged to an expenditure of nearly  &#163;5,000,000,  and it is only reasonable that we should ask for some guarantee in return. The Minister is not prepared to give any guarantee. He is a representative of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, and not merely of Western Australia, who are no doubt anxious, if they can, to get some one else to bear their burden; and yet he has absolutely refused to agree to insert a simple provision of this character. He informs honorable members that it is entirely foreig.ni to the measure.. If it is, the blot is upon the measure itself, because the more safeguards we have the better in dealing with a measure of this kind. I regret that it has been necessary for me to rise again to urge upon the Minister the advisability of accepting: my amendment. I feel sure that if the honorable and learned gentleman will not accept this amendment he will accept some&#39; proposition of a similar nature. I hope that honorable members will help me to divide the Committee on the amendment, and to see that every possible safeguard shall be provided for. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to know what ground the Minister has for the assumption that the expenditure of &#163;20,000 upon the proposed survey will result in our being furnished with reliable data in the light of which we can consider the proposal for the construction of the line. The experience gained in various States with regard to railway surveys would lead us to conclude that the amount proposed to be expended will scarcely cover the cost of a flying survey. In Victoria, something like &#163;400,000 has been spent upon flying surveys. That amount has been absolutely wasted, because a flying survey does not enable any one to form even an approximate idea of the cost of constructing a line, or the possibilities of the surrounding country. I have looked through the reports in connexion with the proposed survey, and I have failed to find any statement by a reputable authority that the expenditure of &#163;20,000 upon a survey would lead to our being supplied with reliable data. We know very well that alternative routes have been suggested over a considerable portion of the distance between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, and I presume that close investigation will be necessary to enable us to arrive at a conclusion as to which of these will be the better one to follow. Consequently, I think it is only right that honorable members should know whose advice has been followed in fixing upon the amount of .&#163;20,000. </para>

          <para>.- It is not my intention to &#34; stonewall &#34; this measure, but I think that I am justified in expressing my opinions. Having looked up all the available information on the question, and having had some experience in regard to the cost of contemplated works in other directions, I know that,  although Parliament may vote only &#163;20.000, the work, even if it costs &#163;.100,000, must be carried to a completion. It is strange that no engineer has stated that &#163;20,000 will be sufficient. </para>

            <para>- I know that work can be done much more cheaply today than it could twenty years ago, either in the way of survey or in carrying out public works such as the construction of a railway. I desire to direct attention to the fact that what is known as a flying survey is not a reliable guide to-day as to the cost of the construction of a railway. I object to the Government proposing to spend &#163;20,000 when it is apparent to any man of experience, or of a practical turn of mind, that we cannot get for that amount the information necessary to guide us. Any reputable engineer would, I think, tell us that &#163;20,000 is not sufficient, and that, before we. get the information, the cost will be at least &#163;80,000. So far as T am concerned, I have no further remarks to make. Mv whole opposition to the Bill is based on the ground that the survey should be made by the States concerned. As to the other proposal, I shall deal with it after the survey has been made. From reliable information, I feel confident that if this survey is undertaken, this or some other Government will have to ask for an increased amount. </para>

          <para>This Bill is to amend the Audit Act 1901. There are several matters dealt with thai are of some importance in the keeping of the public accounts, but I do not think that any of them need cause much discussion. Clause 3 merely provides for a change in the term &#34; public accountants.&#34; It appears that the Incorporated Institute of Accountants protest against the use of this term, which is generally Used to describe persons who hold high qualifications in accountancy. By clause 4 it is desired to take authority for establishing a guarantee fund. There is such authority at present in the Public Service Act, but it does not apply to members of the Defence Forces, &#39; and to other persons exempt from the provisions of that Act. Clause 5 is a provision to save exchange. Under this clause postmasters will be authorized to use money, received for money orders, in payment of salaries and other expenses, instead of remitting the money to headquarters. Proper adjustment will, of course, be made by paying the amount of such payments into the money order account at head-quarters. That has been done in several of the Statesalready,andit is found to be a convenient plan, which saves the transfer of money, and, therefore,. saves the cost of exchange. Clause 6 is to meet a difficulty which has been experienced in making payments in distant parts of the States. Clause 7 deals with lapsed votes in regard to the Militia. At present, votes lapse on the 30th June, and any money which is earned by the Militia, and which is on that date in the hands of the commanding officers for payment to the men, has to be returned to head-quarters. To place the commanding officers again in funds after the 30th June would take time, and before it could be. done many of the men would make unsuccessful claims for their pay. It is desired to avoid dissatisfaction in this important branch of the Defence Forces, by allowing the pay to remain in the hands of the Accounting Officer for three months. Clause 8 provides for three new sections, the first of which will save much bookkeeping without any sacrifice of accuracy or principle. The principal clause of the Bill is clause 13, which is to legalize certain accounts which have been in existence for some time. The following may be termed &#34;trading accounts,&#34; namely : The Commonwealth Ammunition Material Account, the Small Arms Ammunition Account, the Defence Clothing Material Account, the Small Arms Account and the Defence Force Stores Collection Account (Queensland). In connexion with all of these, material is sold to members of rifle clubs and others, and the proceeds of the sales are paid into the accounts, in order that the fresh purchases made by the Governmentmay be paid for out of such proceeds. A strict reading of the law would probably require the proceeds to be paid into revenue, and the fresh purchases to be charged to a vote of Parliament. Such a course would, however, show the expenditure of the Commonwealth as much more than the amount which is really borne by the general taxation of the people; and it is thought that these special receipts should be devoted wholly to the purpose of replacing the goods sold. This practice was followed by Victoria and Queensland before the Defence Department was transferred to the &#91;Federal control. The Government Printer&#39;s Account is also a trading account, but is used principally as a suspense account. Wages and material are paid for from the account, and, when the work is complete, transfer entries are made in the books, charging the votes of the various Departments and relieving the Trust Account. To the two Naval Agreement Act Accounts expenditure made for the British Government is charged, and the accounts are credited when the moneys are repaid. To the Pensions Account are credited the deductions made in accordance with the requirements of the States laws, from the salaries of officers transferred from the services of New South Wales and Queensland. The Pensions Account, therefore, applies only to New South Wales and Queensland officers. The money will be used towards payment of the pensions, and, in some cases, lump sum compensation, when due. The Guarantee Fund account, the Defalcation account, the Money Order account, the International Postal and Money Order account, the Deferred Pay account, and the Ocean Mails account are, it is thought, sufficiently explained in the schedule to the Bill. It may be stated, however, that the Defence Force Stores Collection account (Queensland), the Deferred Pay account, and the Ocean Mails account, are included in the Bill principally to validate past transactions, it being intended to close them almost immediately. Honorable members will see that the object of the Bill is merely to legalize certain methods adopted at the inception of Federation, and to provide for the manner in which these matters shall, in future, be dealt with. In a fourth schedule which appears in the Bill, the names of the accounts, and the purposes referred to in section  62A  are given, and this schedule it is proposed to insert in the principal Act. </para>

            <para>.- Am I right in&#39; assuming that under this provision the Treasurer would have power to transfer from one account to another amounts appropriated under the heading of &#34;Advance to the Treasurer.&#34; If, for instance, a sum of &#163;20,000 were appropriated for a specific purpose, but proved insufficient, and a vote in respect to another purpose were in excess of requirements, would the Treasurer be at liberty under this provision to transfer the amount in excess of the sum required from the one purpose to the other ? </para>

            <para>. - Under the Audit Act the transfer of one item to another in the same subdivision of the Estimates is permissible. This clause  30A  is not intended to meet such&#39; cases. As I understand it, the intention is that when a Department applies to the Treasurer for an increase in respect to an item or for any expenditure not under the Appropriation Act, and the Treasurer approves of the amount so required being charged against the Treasurer&#39;s Advance, that amount, instead of being kept in a separate account against the Treasurer&#39;s Advance, may be debited at once to the sub-head or vote in the Estimates to which it relates. </para>

              <para>- In that case we should have to create a vote from the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. That is done towards the end of the financial year. The books are closed on 30th June in each year, and where cases of this kind arise the amounts have to be advanced bv the Treasurer out of what is known as &#39; 1 Advance to the Trea-  surer.&#34; They have then to be debited to the particular sub-heading to which they relate, in order that the public accounts may be so presented to the House as to show properly the expenditure under every heading. That system has always been followed. It is now proposed to make a short cut, rather than to wait until the end of the vear. In Western Australia we always charged the item at once to the vote or sub-head. Under the Federal system, however, that has not been customary. It is much more simple and sensible to charge the item against the vote at once. </para>

It is the right thing to charge the vote straightaway rather than keep a separate account of the advance, and at the end of the year allocate it, because it will save double work. </para>

            <para>A number of repayments and recoveries of amounts, included in the expenditure of previous years, and amounting in the aggregate to about  &#163;2,000,  were made during the year 1904-5. The Treasury departed from the practice hitherto in force of crediting these receipts to revenue, and placed them to the credit of the then current votes corresponding to those of previous years. This alteration of practice amounted . to an appropriation in aid of votes, or in reduction of expenditure, without parliamentary authority, and upon exception being taken, the Secretary to the Treasury advised that an amendment of the Audit Act would be sought to authorize such credits. </para>

          <para class="block">Undoubtedly the object which is sought to be attained by this Bill is to authorize such credits. The Auditor-General, who is an independent arbiter in these matters, has said that the alteration of the practice virtually amounts to an appropriation in aid of votes, or in, reduction of expenditure, without parliamentary authority. I think that the Committee should be extremely careful before it takes a step of that kind. The honorable member for Lang, who unfortunately is unable to be here to-day, has asked me to move an amendment. The Bill has been, reached so unexpectedly to-night that I have not had an opportunity to look through his voluminous notes, but I commend the amendment, which is in print, to the attention of the Committee, especially the Treasurer, who, I have no doubt, will be able to accept it. lt is as follows: - </para>

Provided, however, that any amounts credited to expenditure during the financial vear  1905-6  may, with the consent of the Treasurer, after favorable report from the Auditor-General, be allowed to remain in credit. </para>

          <para class="block">The effect of the adoption of this amendment would be to compel unexpended sums in any one year to be re-credited to revenue, except in cases in which the Auditor-General would permit their expenditure in the ensuing year. Under the scheme to be legalized in this Bill this vear we mav vote &#163;1,000 for the carrying out of a particular work. Only &#163;200 may be expended this year. It may be that the work is a new post-office, and that it is discovered that &#163;1,000 is more than sufficient. But, although &#163;800 remains unexpended, the Government may next year come down with &#34;an item on the Estimates  of  &#163;1,000. Members of Parliament may then overlook the fact that a previous vote of a similar amount has been made for the same  purpose, and may nol be aware that a portion of the money has been unexpended. In that way, the AuditorGeneral points out, votes may be obtained practically without the authority of Parliament. </para>

            <para>.- The matter in question is not an important one, but there is a little confusion in regard to payments towards the end of the year as to which it is impossible to get in the accounts in time. A case in point would be where a State - say, Victoria - pays  a  sum of money for the purpose of mails to New Zealand. Perhaps a good deal of that money should be paid by New South Wales. A credit is given on account of New South Wales, which would lessen the expenditure of Victoria if it were received  1*fore  the close of the financial  vear.  But if it is not received before such close, Victoria is charged with the whole expenditure, and afterwards gets a payment from New South Wales as revenue. Thereby the expenditure and revenue account is fictitiously enhanced. The difficulty could only appear at the end of the vear, when it is impossible to get in accounts in time to credit expenditure properly. As the balances are arranged at the end of every month, it is convenient, in order that the revenue and expenditure  may  not be fictitiously increased to have a provision whereby payments from the other States mav be taken in reduction of similar services for the ensuing vear. The difficulty has been found to be troublesome. The provision is not a very important one. but <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> think that what it attempts to do is reasonable. , </para>

Say that a credit is given for  &#163;10,000  towards the end of one financial year. The result would be to lessen the expenditure for the next financial year. </para>

              <para>- It strikes me that if , a credit for  &#163;10,000  came in at the end of one financial year, under this provision, the Treasurer when he asked Parliament for an appropriation, would require  &#163;10,000  less than he would do if that account had not come in. </para>

              <para>- But if the Treasurer had that credit of  &#163;10,000,  he would require so much less to be appropriated in the following year. I see eery little objection to the provision from the point of view which the Treasurer puts, but the provision goes beyond his case in the power which it gives. As the AuditorGeneral has drawn attention to the point, it might be desirable to furnish us with his opinion. If the matter in question is merely one of adjusting States accounts, there is not much objection to what is proposed. But the point which I put to the Treasurer is whether the provision could not be used in a way that would go beyond what he intends. </para>

              <para>- That may be so; but my recollection of the New South Wales provision is that the inspection there, and also the audit, were somewhat relaxed because it was felt that the inspections which were taking place all over the country were being duplicated. That position, however, does not apply to the Commonwealth. We have no other officers who can do tins work for us, as the States Governments have. Therefore, it occurs to me that unless we keep the inspectorial staff as efficient as possible we shall not have that proper supervision of accounts which is necessary. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to the inspection and the audit taken in conjunction. We have already provided for a relaxation in our inspection of these accounts, ari3 now we are asked to sanction a relaxation in the audit - that is to say, in the accounting within the Department, as well as in the inspection without the Department. Our inspection, so far as the Post Office is concerned, is not such as, in my judgment, can be safely relaxed. Certainly it cannot be done without leading to an increase in the peculations which are already going on. I believe that the accounting&#39; of these matters has been very much relaxed in many of the States, and that some of the detailed clerical work with which the Treasurer proposes to dispense is being carried on in a very lax way indeed. Only the other day I was informed that in the Money Order Branch of the Post and Telegraph Department the classification of money-order dockets is two or three months in arrear. I believe that fraud could take place in that Department, without the Department being able to discover it until the whole of that work had been brought up-to-date. That is a very serious matter, I think. Yet, in this Bill&#39;, we are asked to dispense still further with the inspection of the individual accounts at the outside offices, and to relax the system of auditing those accounts within the Department itself. </para>

            <para>.- It seems to me that we have already given to the Treasurer a wider power in the clause which we have just passed. This provision relates to a matter of detail, whereas the previous clause authorizes the Treasurer to dispense with annual inspections, and to have them carried out at such intervals as he may choose. It seems to deal with an audit in detail, which the Auditor-General may not think necessary, and very properly it provides that in such a case the AuditorGeneral shall not be responsible, but the Treasurer. I presume that it is intended to apply to cases where a detailed audit would not afford an additional check. Seeing that under clause 10 the Treasurer has the power to dispense entirely with an audit during a particular year, it&#39; can scarcely be claimed that it is an extension of that power to declare that where an audit does take place it need not be of the detailed character prescribed bv the Audit Act. </para>

            <para>. - We are voting very largely in the dark in dealing with this Bill. The Treasurer ought to know more about the necessity for such proposals, and the way in which they will affect the keeping of the accounts, than any honorable member who has not been in the Treasury can be expected to know. It should be his business to enlighten the Committee as to the necessity for any of these clauses, where honorable members desire that information, or where the effect of the clauses is not plain on the face of them. </para>

              <para>- I mean through the Treasurer. I am nob asking for the production of the document in which the Auditor-General&#39;s opinion is stated. A measure of this kind, proposing alterations, which might be far-reaching, in connexion with the audit of the public accounts, should surely be placed before the Auditor-General for his consideration. It should not emanate wholly from the Treasury, since the Treasury Department sometimes objects to the AuditorGeneral&#39;srequirements. I should like the Treasurer to tell the Committee whether this Bill has been placed before the Auditor-General, whether he has approved of it, or has taken exception to any part of it, and, if so, to which part? </para>

            <para>.- I am prepared to accept the statement of the Treasurer, and I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitton</inline> is a man of very considerable experience in the matter of auditing and finance. But it does appear to me that the members of the Committee are not sufficiently informed as to the necessity for this Bill at all. We have no information as to how the Audit Department or the Treasury Department are restricted or hampered in any way under existing conditions. The clauses which we have already passed, and the clause now before the Committee, appear to me to provide for some relaxation of the supervision of the Auditor-General, which is certainly not desirable, unless good reason for it can be shown. We have already agreed that the audit of a particular branch of a Department shall not be necessary every year. In view of the great area of the Commonwealth. I can quite understand why that should be provided for. But when we are asked to accept a proposal that the detailed audit of any accounts may be entirely dispensed with by the AuditorGeneral under the direction of the Treasurer </para>

              <para>- So far as my experience goes, divided responsibility leads to carelessness all round, andI should very much prefer the existing practice, under which the Auditor-General is responsible solely tor the correctness of the public accounts. When we have a right honorable gentleman at the head of affairs who is known to be prepared to spend money, it is well that our Auditor-General should be entirely independent and responsible in such a matter. I am opposed to the clause. </para>

              <para>- I say that we are sapping the independence of the AuditorGeneral in making anything that he does conditioned by a request for the consent of the Treasurer. I think that he should be entirely independent of the Treasurer, and should act as a check upon him. That is the prime function for which the office of the Auditor-General has been established. To make the Auditor-General subservient to the Treasurer in regard to the carrying out of his primary function seems to me to be entirely wrong. </para>

              <para>- The consent of the Treasurer is to be given only in cases in which he considers a detailed audit under the Act unnecessary. Where such permission is given, the Auditor-General can no longer be held responsible. I am afraid that we have not done right in passing clause  10,  allowing the Treasurer to say when inspections are to be made, and when an audit is to take place. Such an arrangement may be very prejudicial to the public interest, if we have a masterful Treasurer, and an Auditor-General who is in the slightest degree complacent. </para>

            <para>.- We should have had a more lucid and fuller explanation from the Treasurer than we have had. Under section 54 of the Audit Act, it is provided that the Auditor-General may make recommendations for the more economical keeping of the public accounts, though I do not remember whether he has done so in his report. Statements have been made from which I infer that, with the existing staff, our auditing work cannot be done very effectively. I understand that the auditing of the accounts of some of the country postmasters is to be done by the clerks in their offices. It is an extraordinary arrangement that a subordinate should audit the accounts of his superior officer, and, to ray mind, indicates that the audit staff is, perhaps, overburdened by details in some cases. The Audit Act, however, enacts that, for the protection of the public interest, the Auditor-General &#34; shall &#34; do certain things. He &#34; may,&#34; to facilitate the discharge of his duties, call persons in evidence, or call for the production of vouchers. But, in all provisions relating to the examining of accounts, it is laid down that he &#34;shall&#34; do certain things. The Bill provides for a dispensation under particular circumstances. Such a dispensation may be necessary, and, if so, we should grant it. I do not know of anv better arrangement than that provided for in the Bill. </para>

            <para>.- In the New South Wales Act there is a safeguard which has been omitted from the Bill. That Act requires that a statement as to any exemption must be laid before the Legislative Assembly, if Parliament is sitting, within seven days of the granting of that exemption, or, if Parliament is not sitting, within seven days after the next meeting of Parliament. That safeguard is a very important one. The Auditor-General is intrusted by Parliament with the examination of the departmental accounts, but, without some such safeguard as that to which I am referring, it might happen under the Bill that the auditing of half the accounts would be dispensed with by the Treasurer. </para>

            <para>.- In Queensland, the Auditor-General is placed in a stronger position than that officer seems to occupy under the Bill. I do not think that an Auditor-General should be subservient to the will of a Minister. He should be able to carry out his duties without fear of political interference, and should be given virtually as much freedom of action as is enjoyed by a Supreme Court Judge. The Commonwealth reposes confidence in its Auditor-General in relation to the just and honest auditing of accounts. I shall be prepared to vote against the clause. The Auditor-General should be in a position to audit the accounts inaccordance with his own views as to the proper practice to be followed in the public interest. </para>

          <para>.- In view of the proposals put forward by the Treasurer which involve an increased expenditure of something like &#163;500,000, and a loss of revenue estimated roughly at &#163;250,000, and of the recommendations of the Old-age Pensions Commission, I should like to know what are the intentions of the Government with reference to dealing with the report of the Old-age Pensions Commission, and whether before the Budget is taken into serious consideration the Prime Minister will be able to indicate when the reports of the Tariff Commission are likely to be dealt with. Until that information is available honorable members will find themselves awkwardly placed in considering the Treasurer&#39;s proposals.I am sure that honorable members will be delighted to receive such information as the Prime Minister is able to afford with regard to the matters to which I have referred. </para>

          <para>. - The questions which the honorable member has asked are very serious, and relate to very important matters; but as they arise naturally out of the Budget the honorable member is entitled to ask them... The only reply I can make to-night is that I have not yet been definitely informed when we are to receive the further reports from the Tariff Commission, which it has been intimated, are likely to be presented this week. If they are presented this week, they will be taken into consideration by the Government at once, and within the shortest time possible consistent with proper attention to other business we shall submit proposals in regard to them for the consideration of honorable members. No delay will be permitted, owing to thenecessity for disposing of the financial debate before the House. The Treasurer&#39;s statement dealt only with the estimated revenue and expenditure for the current year, and therefore honorable members will have noticed that no provision has been made in these for carrying out an old-age pensions scheme. But, as was implied in the Governor-General&#39;s speech, serious consideration has been given by the Government to the recommendations of the Commission, and since that time they have received our further attention. I think that I may now go so far as to say that the Government have in draft a proposal which, with little, if any. amendment, they hope to be able to submit to Parliament as a contribution towards a solution of the very vexed and difficult question of providing for old-age pensions. </para>
