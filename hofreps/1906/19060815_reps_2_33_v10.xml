                            <para>- An appeal was proceeded with, with my sanction, and I can give the honorable and learned member the reason for the action which has been taken. I think that it would be an unnecessary and great waste of money to have the Commission, because the defence raised upon the pleadings is that, exercising his powers under the Customs Act, the Minister of Trade and Customs has fixed the value on. which duty is to be paid at , £65. My desire was to have the point of law thus raised decided before the enormous expense of the Commission is entered upon. If the point of law were determined in favour of the Commonwealth - as, according to my reading of the Act it should be - it would be unnecessary for either party to go to the expense of having a Commission appointed. On the other hand, if the point of law were determined against the Commonwealth, the Commission could proceed. It was with the desire to save unnecessary expense, not to shut out facts, that the appeal was proceeded with. </para>

                    <para>Mr.JOSEPH COOK.- Is the Attorney-General aware that the Minister of Trade and Customs told the House and the country that he would facilitate in every way the action of the Massey-Harris Company in seeking to prove the Canadian price of their harvesters? If the Government regard the appointment of a Commission to take evidence in Canada on the subject as a waste of money, because the Minister has the absolute right to impose what duty he pleases, and take action accordingly,' they will do so in total contradiction to the Minister's statement. </para>

                            <para>- The question as to whether there shall or shall not be a Commission is entirely in the hands of the Court. I have had no notice of these questions, and the papers dealing with the case are complicated ; but, speaking from recollection, I understand that the learned Judge who granted the , Commission to some extent expressed the opinion that it might prove unnecessary, making a special order as to costs ; but, inasmuch as the plaintiff insisted on the appointment of the Commission, he did not find it within his province to refuse it. I understand, moreover, that the Full Court has refused to interfere with his exercise of his discretion, though one of the Judges would have been disposed to make a different order. That is' how the matter stands. It is of the highest importance to have the point 'of law decided whether the Minister under the circumstances of difficulty already indicated by Parliament, can, by virtue of section 160 of the Customs Act, fix a valuation for duty which cannot be impeached or set aside as anullity. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that I am compelled to return to the discussion of the matter now before the Committee, after having taken up some little time last night. But it is the duty of the members of the Tariff Commission to meet the criticisms that have been levelled against their recommendations, more especially when certain members are under a total misapprehension as to their effect. I listened yesterday to some very elaborate, if not instructive, disquisitions upon the constituents and qualities of alcoholic liquors, and I feel called upon to reply to some of the remarks made by honorable members, because, in my opinion, they are very misleading. The trouble has arisen through a misunderstanding of the terms used by chemists in dealing with questions of this kind. We hear the word "impurities" used in a sense that is entirely misleading as applied to alcoholic spirits. There is no doubt that alcohol, by a very exhaustive process, can be made absolutely pure, and this purity is what chemists aim at securing when they wish to obtain alcohol for laboratory purposes. The alcoholic liquors of commerce, however, are distilled in such a way that they retain certain impurities - as chemists would call them - which give them their distinctive qualities, and, to a large extent, their wholesome properties. In this connexion, I may also remark that the best chemists admit th'at chemistry is, to a large extent, at fault in dealing with the analysis of alcoholic liquors. The science of chemistry has not yet reached such a stage that chemists can definitely tell us the effects of the various constituents of alcohol. They can discover these constituents, but they have ultimately to fall back upon the older experience of those who have adopted practically a rule of thumb to decide what is good and bad in alco- holic liquors. Fortunately, we are able to conclude, with a fair amount of certainty, that experience forms a safe guide in connexion with these matters. There is no doubt as to what brandy 'and whisky were originally. Whisky was a preparation of malt spirit, distilled by pot stills, and brandy was a preparation of spirit distilled from wine by the same process. But the introduction of the patent still has brought about a considerable mystification, both in alcoholic liquors and in the minds of the public. I wish to refer specifically to the statements made by certain honorable members with regard to tEe manufacture of brandy. I said fast night, and I repeat, that I question whether a single gallon of brandy is made in Australia bv the methods employed in the production of the finer qualities of French brandies. I hold in mv hand a pamphlet issued as the result of an inquiry- into the distillation of brandy, and the constituents of that spirit by a Commission brought into existence in England a few years ago, at the instance of that well-known medical journal, the <inline font-style="italic">Lancet.</inline> This pamphlet represents the most advanced and complete views on the question. It contains distinct information as to the methods necessary to be adopted to produce the higher qualities of brandy. To begin with, it is stated - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The peculiar pleasing characteristics of genuine old Cognac brandy must be referred, not to alcohol at all, but what the French call the <inline font-style="italic">"impuretes"</inline> of brandy, that is to say, to the secondary products of distillation. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In another part of the pamphlet we are told how this process of distillation is conducted. The wine is, of course, heated in the usual way. The first portion that goes through the still is put aside. The central portion is also put aside, and then the third portion is similarly dealt with. The central portion is again distilled, and the central portion of that distillation is what' is known as brandy of the highest quality. I very much doubt whether that method of distillation has ever been practised in Australia to any considerable extent. With regard to the ageing of spirits, we have heard it stated in this House that ageing has practically no effect - that there is really nothing in it. The <inline font-style="italic">Lancet</inline> Commission, however, express themselves very definitely upon this point. They say - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The differences as regards chemical composition which will be seen to exist between old and new brandy are not so much in kind as degree. One effect of age upon the composition of brandy which can easily be traced is that of oxidation, a small depreciation, of alcohol occurring in favour of aldehydes and acetic acid..... This loss is chiefly alcohol ; there is a corresponding increase in ethers, in higher alcohols, and what may be called " vinosity " develops, coupled with " finesse and style. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is an indication of the distinct .difference between the new and the old alcoholic spirit. The remarks that I have quoted with regard to brandy apply also to whisky. It is a' matter of common experience with every one in the trade, and even with those who indulge in alcoholic stimulants, that the older spirit is undoubtedly finer and more palatable than that which is new. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be very glad if the honorable member can show me that that judgment has been pronounced. I wish now to refer to the point made by the honorable member for Bland yesterday, when he contended that the differentiation made by the Tariff Commission between the duties on pure and blended brandies was nonsensical - that it was ridiculously insufficient. I take it that members of this Par-' liament, who have devoted a considerable amount of time to the investigation of the question - who have gone into it thoroughly and earnestly, and with as much ability as they possess - are scarcely likely to put forward a proposition which amounts to nonsense. I am prepared upon general grounds to defend our recommendation in that respect, as representing a very fair average as between the two qualities of liquor. Anybody who has. read the evidence tendered to- the Commission will realize that I am entirely in sympathy with the development of a trade in pure brandy. I do not at all like the idea of fostering a trade in the blended article. At the same time, the Commission could not ignore a considerable volume of evidence which was submitted to it, to the effect that blended brandy is an article of commerce, and that, as a matter of fact, it is preferred by some persons to the pure article. When honorable members point out that the difference between the cost of. the production 'of the two articles is very great, they are looking at the wrong end of the question altogether. There is no doubt that the difference between the cost, of producing the two classes of brandy is as one to four. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the difference between the cost of producing pure brandy and that of producing the blended article. But when we come to the selling price, which, after all, is what de'termines the trade in these articles, we find that there is nothing like the difference which I have indicated. For example, let us take the price of a bottle of pure brandy, as against that of a bottle of blended brandy. At the very most, upon my calculations, the difference between their price would be about 4d. or 6d. When it is recollected that each bottle of pure Australian brandy will - -if the recommendation of the Commission be adopted - carry with it a Government certificate of quality, I think honorable members will realize that that fact in itself offers a considerable preference to the superior article. </para>

                            <para>- I would point out to the honorable member that if he were selling brandy it is not likely that he would take off the genuine article a label guaranteeing its quality, in order to depreciate its value. The Commission recommend that that guarantee should attach only to the superior article, and I think it' is obvious that nobody engaged in handling such an article would be likely to deprive it of the value which the label imparted to it. Take the position of any customer who desires to purchase a bottle of brandy. Let us assume that he enters an hotel or a shop and states his requirement. He wishes to purchase a bottle of good brandy. Let us further suppose that he is shown the pure brandy with the Government stamp of quality attached to the bottle, and also the blended article with its distinctive mark upon it. </para>

                            <para>- I have already pointed out that when honorable members talk of the cost of producing a pure brandy they are looking at the wrong end of the question. I admit that the cost of the production of the two articles is as one to four. But when that amount is . added to the duty, and to one or two profits, and a gallon of pure brandy is divided into six parts - six bottles contain a gallon - honorable members will see that the difference between the price of the genuine as against the blended article is not more than 4d. or, at the most, 6d. per bottle. Here arises the difficulty of stimulating the production of Australian brandy with which the Tariff Commission was met. As honorable members are aware, my sympathies are all in one direction. But the evidence was conclusive that blended brandy was an article which was regularly put upon the market, and which was even sought after by some persons in preference to pure brandy. When we came to consider the situation, most of us realized that it would be a very improper proposal to levy upon the cheaper article a duty which was altogether out of proportion to that imposed upon the superior article. In other words, it would be wrong to compel the purchaser of blended brandy to pay into the revenue of the country a contribution which was decidedly out of proportion to that paid by the purchaser of pure brandy. </para>

                            <para>- If honorable members will take the trouble to look into the matter they will see that the recommendation of the Commission would impart a considerable stimulus to the production of a pure Australian brandy. If the trade in that article has developed under the conditions which have hitherto existed, it is only reasonable to assume that it will progress much more rapidly under the stimulus which would be imparted to it by the adoption, of the recommendation of the Commission. Some honorable members apparently have not studied our recommendations, and do not realize that protection to the genuine article is part and parcel of our scheme. I think that I ought to remind those who talk so much about genuine Australian brandy that there are certain classes of wines used in the production of that article which, to put it mildly, do not make the highest classes of brandy. For instance, there is a good deal of " off " wine used ; that is to say, wine which has gone wrong in the process of manufacture, and which is distilled at a very high degree of rectification in order to make it less objectionable. M)[ opinion is that the public should be protected from that sort of thing. </para>

Its members have adopted a commercial, attitude towards these matters, and it is rather discouraging to us - after due consideration has been given to these phases cf the question - to hear honorable members criticise us because of the severely commercial nature of our recommendations. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the honorable member, with his keen intellect, will assess those recommendations at their proper value. Last evening I listened attentively to the complaint of the honorable member for North Sydney in regard to the alleged hardships which would be imposed upon importers if the recommendation of the Commission in regard to keeping imported spirits in bond for two years were given effect to in the absence of fair warning. Undoubtedly, the honorable member speaks as one with considerable experience in commercial matters, but I must confess that I am not able to agree with him as to the hardship that would be inflicted. There is no doubt that a very considerable quantity of immature spirit finds its way into Australia and passes into consumption. The bonding of that spirit, until it has attained an age of two years, would not in any way damage the interests of the persons who own it. It is a well known fact that spirit acquires an added value in accordance with the length of time which it is kept in bond. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will see that satisfactory proof of age could scarcely be forthcoming in regard to spirit which has already been shipped, or which is now in bond, and if we prohibited all that from passing into consumption, there would be no supplies. That was the point which I endeavoured to put. </para>

I have already pointed out that there is no absolutely rectified spirit in commerce, although a little may be found in chemical .laboratories. What is in commerce called " rectified spirit " is that which has undoubtedly been distilled at a high degree of rectification, but which still contains all the essential characteristics of the product from which it has been derived. </para>

                            <para>- It still contains a proportionate quantity of the secondary constituents of that alcohol which is distilled at a lower strength ; and none of the so called rectified spirit known to commerce is entirely devoid of these secondary constituents. J "While, undoubtedly, pot-still whisky or brandy shows a distinct change in ageing, that change is shown - although I admit that it is in a less degree - in the case of highly rectified spirit. In this connexion I would point out that it is notorious that deeds of violence perpetrated -in the larger cities of the old world by persons under the influence of liquor are almost invariably traceable to the drinking of that whisky known .as raw grain spirit. It is a matter of common opinion in Great Britain that that spirit has a maddening, effect upon the brain, and a very objectionable effect upon the general health of those who consume it. In the case of spirit which has been kept for a few years, however, those objectionable qualities disappear in a degree corresponding with its age. </para>

In support of that contention the honorable member has referred to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Lancet.</inline> As laymen, we cannot pretend to set our own personal views against those of experts in chemistry ; but, at the same time, we may hold different opinions on the evidence that we have been able to gather in regard to these matters.

As against the contention of the honorable member for Perth, I may say that I have made personal inquiries from those engaged in distillation, and also from experts, who have informed me that when spirit is distilled above 60 per cent, over-proof - as in the case of that produced by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company - the elements called " impurities " are existent in it in only the most infinitesimal degree. </para>

                            would define spirits as alcoholic liquids made from the distillation of wine, beet, cereals generally, and the by-products of sugar manufacture. - (Q, 2626-7.) From quotations read by him before the Commission, it appeared that all the alcohols, taken in certain doses, were poisonous. The least toxic was pure ethyl alcohol. - (Q. 2677.) Ethyl alcohol was the main constituent of all spirits. - (Q. 2712.) The toxicity of alcohol was correspondingly larger 'as its chemical formula was more complex.

                            <para>- No doubt that is so, though no one has listened when I have tried to impress the fact upon honorable members ; but this is a matter which -should be dealt with by regulation. We cannot shut our eyes to the possibility of chemical discovery which may show that spirit is not improved by being kept in bond: We cannot say that the work of the synthetic chemist is at an end. and that no further discoveries will be made. Consequently we should deal with this subject by regulation, which would be capable of alteration by a very simple process, instead of by an Act of Parliament. </para>

I remember that, five or six years ago, an article appeared - I think in the <inline font-style="italic">Lancet</inline> - in which it was pointed out that, if distillers liked to take the trouble, they could adopt processes which would give a spirit so pure that there would be no need for the keeping of large stocks for maturing purposes. These statements were, made in reference to the patent still which was then coming into use. </para>

I regret that there is not in our library a good work on chemistry of recent date, which would have enabled me to fortify myself - if I may use such an expression in dealing with spirits - on this subject; but an article appearing "in the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopedia Britannica,</inline> published in 1898, and probably written in 1896 or 1897, practically bears out the statement to which I have just referred. It must be remembered that during the last twenty or twenty-five years synthetic chemistry has made tremendous developments, so that we may stand on the verge of great discoveries. </para>

                            <para>- Then honorable members should not talk about wanting a pure spirit. They should confess that they want a spirit that is not rectified and is not pure, that they desire to foster a taste for an impure article. They should not talk cant upon such a question. If honorable members prefer to drink a spirit containing impurities which give it a flavour there is a good deal to be said in favour of their taste. I object, however, to their putting forward a number of statements upon the pretence that they are imparting chemical knowledge. They are doing nothing of the kind. When I saw the recommendation <inline font-style="italic">pi</inline> the Tariff Commission that spirit should be kept in wood for two years I looked through the report to ascertain what had caused them to arrive at that conclusion. </para>

All the witnesses whose views were in accord with the recommendations of the Commission had not devoted themselves to the study of this particular branch of chemistry. Some of them spoke from the knowledge of fifteen or twenty years ago, and' apparently had not taken the trouble to keep themselves up-to-date. When I read the evidence, I regretted that I had not been appointed to the Commission, so that I might have asked the witnesses one or two questions. I desire to quote a further statement from the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia</inline> upon this subject. It reads as follows: - </para>

                        <para>Methods foi obtaining a satisfactory potable spirit are, so far, however, only successful up to a certain point, and the distiller is therefore bound to have recourse to prolonged storage or to one of the many artificial processes of purification and maturing, the majority of which have been devised - with varying successes - during recent years. . . . By properly regulating the distilling heats, by using a well-devised still, both in the first instance and also for rectifying, a product very free from fusel oil, and especially from fatty aldehydes and volatile ethers, may be obtained. The removal of acids - objectionable chiefly on account of the unpleasant decomposition products which they form in still - is carried out by neutralizing the still contents with an alkaline medium. The alkali so used also decomposes undesirable compound ethers, and retains some of the aldehydes by converting them into non-volatile polymery. For the elimination of fusel oil, filtering through charcoal is the most common method. Luck has suggested for this purpose the passing of the alcoholic vapours through petroleum, which is said to absorb the higher alcohols much more easily than it does ordinary spirit ; and some distillers have successfully tried the method of Traube, which consists in treating the spirit with a saturated aqueous solution of various inorganic salts. </para>

                    <para class="block">Even this work is not quite up-to-date. Some time ago I read some articles containing information far in advance of that which appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia</inline><inline font-style="italic">Britannica,</inline> but, unfortunately, I have not been able to place my hand upon them for the purposes of this discussion. I was particularly struck with the articles to which I refer, because, some twenty years ago, I took a great interest in the subject. Of course, honorable members must distinctly understand that I had only an elementary knowledge, and did not pretend to be able to discuss the matter with any man who understood his work. I had a knowledge sufficient to enable me to take an intelligent interest in the subject. I think that the articles appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Lancet,</inline> but I cannot say with any certainty. I find by reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopedia</inline> that in 1898 - -three or four years before I read the articles referred to - premonitions were already being uttered that the old method of setting; aside the distillates for so many years, until they became rectified in some way quite inexplicable to chemists, would be abandoned. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so, because if they did, the best brandy would cost us 25s. per bottle instead of the price that we now have to pay for it. They may adopt methods which enable them to retain particular flavours, but that is all. I am not quite sure whether, so far as the physiological aspect of the case is concerned, the brandy made according to the old crude methods is not more injurious, than spirit highly rectified under the new process. But I cannot speak upon this subject as an expert. If the provision with regard to keeping spirit in wood for two years is to be retained, it would be very much better to adopt the proposal of the Government, and to deal with the matter by regulation, rather than by embodying it in an Act. As I have pointed out, a regulation is capable of amendment from time to time to suit the circumstances as they arise. Regulations have to be discussed in Cabinet and afterwards .submitted to the House. </para>

                            <para>- I assume that the Minister acts under the advice of his officers. If honorable members are determined that spirit shall be kept in wood for two years - the matter is not a vital one - the necessary provision should be made by regulation. If 'we embody such a provision in an Act we shall in effect declare that chemical knowledge has reached a certain point, and will never progress, that it will be impossible to produce wholesome spirit except by * keeping it in wood for two years after distillation. I decline to put any such limitation upon the synthetic chemists of the day, who thoroughly understand their work, and are making rapid strides in the acquirement of knowledge. Our knowledge is distinctly twenty or thirty years behind that of scientific men of the times. It is absolutely impossible for a man to keep pace with scientific knowledge in all its branches. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sure that the Committee are indebted to the honorable and learned member for Werriwa for his very able exposition of the component parts of spirit. The members of the Tariff Commission must feel the loss which they have sustained in that the honorable and learned member was not a witness before them to add to the information which they have presented to the Committee. I desire to express my appreciation of the labours of the Commission as evidenced in the report which has been submitted upon this question. At the same time, I hope that they will not resent criticism of the conclusions at which they have arrived. Hitherto, they have almost conveyed that impression. </para>

                            <para>- When we come to deal with subsequent reports by the Commission, a doubt will necessarily arise as to the particular set of recommendations to which we should pay most regard. I trust, therefore,, that the members of that body will not take offence if some of us differ from them in regard to matters of detail. I fully appreciate the labour and industry which they have brought to the discharge of their onerous duties. But upon same questions, which are comparatively matters of detail, I hold opinions which are not quite in accord with their - recommendations. I trust that the Government, before they ask us to support an increase in the Customs duty upon spirits, will give us a little more information than has been vouchsafed. </para>

                            <para>- When the Minister of Trade and Customs submitted these resolutions yesterday, the Committee were fairly entitled to more information than he gave them. Of course, if the Government can support their proposal to increase the import duty upon spirits. I shall have no objection to offer. They are in a position to know to what extent the revenue would be affected by any such action. But I wish to direct special attention to one matter which has caused a falling away from grace on the part of some freetraders. Only to-day, we have heard certain honorable members admit that there are conditions under which differential fiscal treatment should be accorded to some of our products. I was more than delighted to hear the honorable and learned member for Angas express that opinion ' yesterday. But the point to which I wish specially to address myself has reference to the rates of Excise duty which it is proposed to levy upon different classes of spirit. The conclusions of the Tariff Commission have proved that there was warrant for the assertion which has so frequently been made that the Commonwealth Tariff has destroyed some of our industries. The very first statement contained in the report of that body reads: - </para>

                            <para>- Yes, spirit which was produced from inferior materials. I have no objection to the distillation of that particular class of spirit, but I wish to direct special attention, to the diminished production of spirit from malt. If it were merely a question of the distillation of the cheaper class of spirit - in the production of which there- is no considerable quantity of labour employed - I should not worry about the continuance of the industry. But, seeing that the production of spirit from grape wine necessitates the employment of considerable labour the matter is well worthy of our attention. The Commission appear to have been convinced that, in order to re-establish the production of malt spirit in Victoria, it is necessary to differentiate between the Customs and Excise duties upon malt spirit, to the extent of 4s. per gallon, and upon the blended article to the extent of 3s. per gallon. I do not think that the Commission, in, their recommendation, have differentiated sufficiently as between the spirit which is distilled from barley malt and the blended article. They have allowed a difference of only1s. a gallon between the Excise rates upon these articles. In my judgment there was warrant for the finding of the Commission in regard to the difference which it has seen fit to make between the import duty upon malt spirit and the Excise duty upon it. But I do not agree with the conclusion of its members that there should be only1s. per gallon difference between the Excise duty upon spirit distilled from grape wine, and spirit which is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials. I am inclined to think that the recommendations of the Commis-' sion, if adopted, would prejudice the production of grape spirit in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I claim the support of members of the Commission even to the extent of reconsidering their determination in this connexion. They have realized the necessity for re-establishing the industry so far as the production of malt spirit is concerned. Hitherto we have produced brandy, whisky, and gin of a character calculated to build up a reputation abroad, We have the most satisfactory evidence that under what are regarded as almost lax conditions, there is being' produced in Australia to-day a brandy equal to almost any produced elsewhere. I would remind" the Committee that in the production of grape and malt spirits a great deal of labour is involved, and that we are warranted therefore in giving the local industry the fullest encouragement. The only case in which a reduction of the Excise should be made is in relation to grape spirit. It is said that such a reduction might lead to a loss of revenue, but I do not think that there is any warrant for such an assertion. In pre- Federation days the Excise duty on grape spirit under the Victorian Tariff was, I believe, 8s. per gallon, whilst the import duty was 12s. per gallon. The quantity of imported and locally-produced spirits consumed here then increased practically only in proportion to our population, and under the Commonwealth Tariff we have had practically a like experience. It may appear at the first blush somewhat strange that in the three States which have given some attention to the cultivation of the grape we have had under the Commonwealth Tariff an increase in the production of brandy from grape spirit. But under that Tariff grape spirit has had a preference of 2s. per gallon over blended spirit, and my desire is that that preference shall be continued. I should like some further information in regard to the contention that that should not be done. According- to the evidence taken by the Commission, grape spirit costs something like 4s. per gallon to produce, grain spirit about 2s. 9d. per gallon, and malt spirit about 3s. 6d. per gallon-- </para>

                            <para>- I am not questioning the findings of the Commission with regard to the rate of duty that should be imposed on blended spirit ; on the contrary, I am adopting them as a basis for the proposal that I am now putting forward. The Commission propose that blended spirit shall have a preference of 3s. per gallon over the imported spirit, but they recommend that grape spirit shall have a preference of only is. per gallon over blended spirit. I do not think that that preference is sufficient. Honorable members should not forget the advantage to the Commonwealth which would flow from the expansion of the production of grape spirit. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. There is no comparison between the labour involved in the production of grape spirit and that necessary to the production of potato or molasses spirit. According to the evidence given before the Commission, something like -/"i, 000, 000 has been invested in the grape spirit industry in South Australia. Those figures do not cover the labour involved in distillation. </para>

                            <para>- That is the cost of distillation, whereas the figures I have quoted cover the cost of the material, as well as that of distillation. That would account for the disparity. I come now to the production1 of malt spirit, the encouragement of which is just as desirable as is the encouragement of the manufacture of grape spirit. In the early days of the malt spirit industry in this State, 125,000 bushels of barley were used in one year. That quantity would represent a good yield from 5,000 acres, and would involve the employment of considerable labour. In these circumstances we ought surely to consider whether it is not worth while encouraging the manufacture of spirits which have their origin, so to speak, in the products of our soil, and can be made under conditions that will enable us to place a very superior article on the markets of the world. Although this may not be the proper stage at which to discuss this phase of the question, I draw attention to it now in order that the Government', as well as the members of the Commission, may be prepared, later on. to show whether there is any material objection to granting further encouragement to the production of pure grape and malt spirit. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, that is the. only way out of the difficulty. I was under the impression that we should be able to reestablish the local manufacture of blended whisky and brandy by allowing a preference of only 2s. per gallon over the imported article, but I gather from the evidence, and the statements .made by the members of the Commission, that it would be impossible to do so. In these circumstances, I have been forced to accept the recommendation of the Commission that a preference of 3s. per gallon be allowed. But I invite the Committee to say whether a further reduction of is. per gallon should not be granted in, respect of the Excise duty on grape spirit. </para>

                            <para>-- It would not be as high as the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate in respect of blended spirit. It has also occurred to me that it is desirable to require an increase in the proportion of grape spirit used in blended spirits. I should say that in blended brandy the minimum quantity of grape spirit should Le 50 per cent., whilst there should be a minimum of 50 per cent, of malt spirit in blended whisky. If such a provision were made, it would increase the use of natural products of our soil, and at the same time I think it would also tend towards the production of a better spirit. </para>

                            <para>- In the face of the evidence taken by the Commission, I do not ask the Committee to do so. But, seeing that under, the Tariff which has just been altered a differentiation of 2s. was made in favour of grape spirit, and the increase in the distillation of such spirit has been only slow, I think that an injustice will be done to an industry existing on the use of a natural product if the differentiation is reduced to is. I know the conditions which prevailed in Victoria prior to the imposition of the Federal Tariff, and those which have since prevailed, and I therefore . ask the Committee to reconsider the matter, because honorable members desire the development of our natural industries, and I believe that the concession sought for, while benefiting the industry on whose behalf I speak, will not prejudice any other. I hope that, as time goes on, our pure brandy and pure malt whisky will acquire a world-wide reputation, and the manufacture of such spirit will do the least amount of harm, and the greatest amount of good to the community. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a subject upon which I have little information. To my mind it is regrettable that we should have to derive so large a part of our revenue from duties on spirits, but the imposition of high duties is regarded as necessary to prevent abuse, and to discourage the importation of inferior productions. I am of the opinion of the Highlander who, after a heavy night, declared that whisky was bad, especially bad whisky. But so long as we impose these duties we must see that we get the most revenue we can from them. It is stated in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that - </para>

                            is as high a rate "as consumers will stand," and that a higher duty will lead to the consumption of inferior spirit. But against this theory, the actual facts of the colonies in pre-Federation days are conclusive. Of the six colonies two had 15s- duties on spirits, and 'one had 16s. ; and surely in such a matter as this, which is on:; of mere opinion, the Government is justified in taking what it thinks the necessary means of safeguarding the revenue.

                    <para>The writer of that article probably overlooked the fact that Victoria in 1894 had an import -duty of 15s. per proof gallon, and in two years lost £300,000 in revenue, when, as the result of the investigation of a Commission, the duty was reduced to 14s. Furthermore, South Australia had a duty of 15s., with a 16.5 allowance for underproof, making the rate equivalent to 12s. 6d. Western Australia had a duty of 16s., with a 16.5 allowance for underproof, making the rate 13s. 4d. These facts seem to me to be reasons why we should not- make the duty on proof spirit as high, as 15s. </para>

                    <para class="block">This question has been already fully discussed, and I do not propose to travel over, ground already covered. As Chairman of the Tariff Commission I am pledged to stand by its recommendations, which were based ' on the assumption that there would be no increase in the import duty. Last night I gave the reasons why the Commissioners thought that . the import duty should net be increased, while recommending a reduction in the Excise dutv. Under the operation of the Tariff which we are now amending, there has been an enormous increase in the revenue derived from spirits, especially under the Excise duties. As will be seen from the statement made on page 45 of our report, the production of spirits in Australia in 1899 was 737,200 proof gallons, and in 1905 1,506,339 proof gallons, so that the production practically doubled, the revenue increasing correspondingly from ^147:935 to ,£267,454. The increase in production was due chiefly to the distillation of molasses spirit in Queensland and New South Wales, and one of the reasons why the whisky distilleries in Victoria were suffering so much was that the market was being swamped with that spirit. One of the objects of the scheme of reconstructed Excise duties was therefore to differentiate between various classes of spirits according to the cost of production, and it is believed that a substantial reduction in the Excise duties without- a corresponding increase in the import duties can be brought about without injuriously affecting the revenue, or reducing it below the standard anticipated and provided for bv the Tariff launched by the right honorable member for. Adelaide in 1901. The Commissioners thought that the increase of revenue from Excise duties had been so large tHat the duties could be lowered without making it necessary to increase the import duties, which would result in an unnecessary disturbance of the retail and wholesale trade in spirits. </para>

                        <para>. - The Chairman of. the Tariff Commission has told us why that body recommended that the import duties, on spirits should not be increased, and gave what may be taken to be in part an explanation of that recommendation. Having regard to the circumstances of the local distilling industry,, their recommendations in regard to Excise duties are only natural ; but their estimates of revenue put before us seem to have been largely affected., if not entirely brought about, by the need for justifying the postulate upon which the Commission started, that there should be no increase ' in the Customs duties. That is no increase of import duties. Commencing with a proposition, of that kind, it is easy to see how the recommendations of the Commission were agreed to, but I submit that their calculations are to some extent biased. With them revenue was the last consideration.. When the Government took up the proposals of the Commission, their first concern, naturally, was the effect which the acceptance of these proposals would have upon the revenue. I have taken the precaution to look through the figures which the honorable and learned member for Bendigo has put forward in support of the contention that the adoption of the scale of duties advised by the Commission would not involve any -material? decrease of the revenue, and must say that they carry no conviction to my mind. He points to aw » increase in the local production of spirits, more particularly of the cheapest kinds of spirits from molasses, and contends that the reduction of all the Excise duties will be more than compensated for by the great increase in the quantity produced. Put in that bald way, I take it that this is sun. unconvincing statement. I should be very sorry to see a greatly increased consumption of spirits in the Commonwealth, but, leaving that consideration on one side for the moment, would point out that there is nothing to lead us to suppose that the increased local production would be so great as to make up for the inevitable loss of revenue that would result from the substitution of Australian spirits subject to the payment of Excise duty for imported spirits, which bear a much higher impost. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly. I am not acquainted with the circumstances of South Australia, nor with the extent to which the revenue declined in that State; but I am acquainted with the circumstances of Victoria when the revenue derived from spirit duties fell off., and know that a similar decline could be shown to have taken place in respect to all luxuries and to a considerable degree in respect to necessaries also. The circumstances of the time were severe and unprecedented, leading to a remarkable effort - which was superbly successful - made by the whole community to economize at every point in order that liabilities might be discharged and obligations might be met. . There was consequently an immense falling-off in the revenue. </para>

                            <para>- The circumstances of the two States were not similar. The land boom in New South Wales collapsed at an earlier date than did that of Victoria, and the banking crisis in New South Wales was met in another way. Having the direct personal knowledge of one who lived through that period of trial and stress in Victoria, the falling-off in the revenue to which reference has been made conveys to me no such lesson as is sought to be deduced from it. I have made inquiries, and find that the experience of Victoria in that connexion is the only one of the kind that can be quoted. We have to remember that at the time Federation was brought about, two States were levying a duty of 15s. per gallon upon imported spirits, and that Western Australia was collecting a duty of 16s. per gallon. </para>

                            <para>- That was because of the difference between the Excise and the import duties. It was because of the wide discrepancy there between the two duties that the local spirit distilling industry was fostered. Where there is no local distillation,' as in the case of New Zealand, the same comparison cannot be made. High duties, such as we propose, prevail in South Africa and elsewhere, and I have yet to find a well established authentic case in which such an increase of the import duty on spirits has led to a decline in the revenue. It is only an advance of 7 per cent. Therefore, I have no reason to suppose that the proposed increase will have any such effect. I am not offering my own opinion, but have read the papers placed before me by the officers of the Treasury and Customs Departments, which support the view that the increase of the import duty to 15s. will not have the result predicted. Moreover, after having made an independent examination as well as a joint examination of the whole case, and having reconsidered the whole matter, the officers of the Departments mentioned assure me that they are more confident than ever that the acceptance of the proposals of the Tariff Commission to reduce the Excise duties, while retaining the present import duties, would result in a loss of from £60,000 to £90,000 per annum. It is estimated that this loss would result from the substitution of locally manufactured spirit for imported spirit. On the other hand, they think that any change that might take place under the Government proposals would be of a gradual character, extending over a considerable term of years. I need not remind honorable members of the serious effect that any reduction in the revenue would have upon the finances of the Commonwealth, and also at present upon the finances of the States. </para>

                            <para>- No one with even an elementary sense of chemistry or logic - of which the honorable and learned member is so fond of speaking - would make such an assertion. I should be very loth to support any proposals of a financial or other character that would lead to an increase in the consumption of spirits. I prefer a policy which, while the present consumption is maintained, will cause a larger proportion of the spirits to be supplied by local producers, thus maintaining the revenue at its present standard. If we accomplish that, we shall have done all that we can expect. The figures supplied have been sifted over again from a fresh point of view, and further questions have been submitted to the Customs and Treasury officials. Having recast their calculations, and investigated the matter from a different point of view, they are quite clear that, putting aside any extraordinary and unforeseen departure one way or .the other, and assuming that trade will follow its natural course, the proposals made for reducing the Excise duties would involve the grave loss to which I have already referred - from £60,000 to £90,000 a year. This would be a very serious loss for us to incur at this, or at any other time. I do not wish to enter into other financial questions, but may point out that the Budget this year not only excluded from consideration the possibilities of any alteration in the revenue, arising from the adoption of the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, but also omitted the cost of any new proposals in connexion with a report of the Imperial Defence Committee laid on the table to-day, or any other proposals in connexion with-the Defence Department. With the probability of these additional undertakings demanding immediate attention, making,,' a further inroad upon our funds, and with the possibility that there may be other unforeseen calls upon us, it would be in the highest degree unwise to pass measures which would involve such a huge reduction of the revenue as would be forced upon us if the proposals of the Commission were carried into effect. </para>

                            <para>- As I have already stated, I think that in that case we shall receive a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo,</inline> whereas we shall have nothing to gain by the reduction of the duties proposed by the Commission. I had before me this morning the very figures which the honorable and learned member for Bendigo has. just quoted, and most of which are included in his valuable report. I have examined the explanation which is given of the reasons for the proposed decreases of Excise, and they appear to be very, reasonable. I see no- thing in them, however, to. support the theory that the great change proposed can be made without a very serious loss of revenue - a loss against which we ought to protect ourselves. On the other hand, we believe that if we retain the proportion which the Tariff Commission has recommended between the Import and Excise duties, while increasing both classes of imposts, we can fairly expect to hold our own. We might fall a little short, or we might obtain an extra ,£20,000 - the latter is a sanguine estimate. So far as the officers of the Departments can judge, it is not likely that, with the duties we propose, we shall realize ' more than £20,000 under favorable circumstances, or that we shall lose more than ,£20,000 under unfavorable circumstances. Examined from all points of view, the calculations made by the officers appear very fair. We have tested the matter by working out the figures on various assumed increases and decreases of Excise and Import duties, and in every case the same result has been arrived at. If honorable members resolve to make this very serious departure, I hope that they will do so with their eyes open. They may feel called upon to sanction it - they may think that the benefits to be gained from it are such that the immense sacrifice is justified. But I do not think that they can afford to set aside the warnings of both the Customs and the Treasury Departments in this connexion. After the fullest inquiry, the opinion of the expert officers of. those Departments is that the sacrifice which the proposal would involve is very great - so great that I db not think honorable members would be justified in authorizing it. I hope that upon consideration, even those who realize - as the Chairman of the Tariff Commission does - that the imposition of the increased import duty proposed will complicate the existing relations between the wholesale and retail dealers, and to some extent affect the dealing of the retail publicans with their customers, will recognise that these things must be faced, rather than that we should suffer such a dangerous depletion of our Commonwealth revenue. My honorable colleague, the Treasurer, in his Budget statement, estimated the surplus that would be returnable to the States during the current year at ,£310,000. If that amount be reduced by* ,£90,000, we shall only be able to return to them a little more than £200,000. </para>

Before the session closes, there are other matters which we shall require to take into account involving expenditure. Under these circumstances, I ask honorable members whether - in order to place the Excise duties upon a fairer footing relatively to the import duties, as the Commission's recommendation certainly does - it is wise to make this great sacrifice? It appears to me that the members of the Commission have discharged their duty 0 very thoroughly by taking fiscal questions into consideration. They seem to have worked out the chief problems submitted to them very carefully, and the Government in their proposals are preserving the same proportions throughout. But to say that in order to obtain the end in. view we ought to part with ,£60,000 during the first year of the operation of the new duties- </para>

The Commission, having decided that they would not recommend any increase in the import duties upon spirits, and realizing what ought to be done to relieve an industry which had been injured by the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff, naturally looked with a favorable eye upon anything which confirmed their theory that the alteration recommended could be effected without very great injury to the public. I cannot get away from the revenue aspect of this matter. I am sure that to take the step which has been proposed would constitute an act of extravagance in which we are not warranted. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall support the amendment of the honorable and learned1 member for Bendigo, who is the Chairman of the Commission which was specially appointed to inquire into this matter. I say at once that if I am called upon to make a choice between the evidence which that body has collected and the opinions which have been expressed by officers of the Customs Department, I shall not have the .slightest hesitation in giving my adherence to the testimony tendered to the former upon oath. I will give the reasons why I make this, decided preference in favour of the (Commission. My experience of the high officers of the Victorian Customs Department is that they are saturated with political notions. I regret to have to make this statement, but it is nevertheless a fact. More than once the representatives from the other States have been made only too well acquainted with this unconscious bias on the part of Victorian officials in regard to their own industries. For instance, only to-day I saw a letter emanating from the Customs Depart:ment, and addressed to a firm in my own State, in which it' was pointed out that certain articles - the duty upon which was in dispute - were being made in Victoria, and in, which the question was asked why the firm could not obtain its supplies from this State. Is that the function of these officers - to attempt to dictate to a firm where it shall obtain its supplies? I say that it is a piece of right-down rank impertinence on the part of this Customs official. </para>

                            <para>- It is about as strong as anything of which I have heard. That is the' attitude which these departmental officials assume towards many indus: trial questions. They allow their bias to colour and affect their decisions in regard to the payment of duty. For these reasons, and because of other experiences which I nave had in connexion with former discussions upon the Tariff, I do not hesitate to prefer the' opinions gathered by the Tariff Commission. It is an unfortunate circumstance that these officials should acquire unconscious bias. Above all other things, they ought not to be politicians. They ought to have nothing to do with the question of how the imposition of duties will affect industries. That is for this House to determine. They have merely to see that the revenue is protected. It is their function to endeavour to interpret the Statutes which we pass,, so far as their judgment will allow them to do so. That is one of the reasons why I unhesitatingly prefer to abide by the recommendations of the Commission. Another reason is that I believe more revenue will be collected Under a dutv of 14s. per gallon than would be received under a 15s. per gallon impost. Further, I am of opinion that a duty of 15s. per gallon would lead to adulteration, and we certainly ought not to induce that by reason of our Tariff decisions. There are three things that we ought to bear special lv in mind in dealing with the dutv upon grog. In the first place, our desire should be to insure the supply of as pure an article as possible; in the second, we should endeavour to make it as mild as we can in the interests of those who will persist in drinking it ; and lastly, we should try to derive from it as much revenue as it will honestly and legitimately yield. I believe that the ,14s. per gallon rate represents that point in connexion with the importation of ardent .spirits. So far as the fiscal aspect of the question is concerned, I decline to consider it at all. We ought not to consider it in respect of this matter, which has such a very material and moral bearing upon the welfare of the -people as a whole. There are other considerations which weigh with me. I think that the liquor trade is one of those that we -ought not to be anxious to build up in Australia from the point of view of providing employment for our people. For instance, I am told that the total number of hands engaged in' the distilleries in Victoria is 143. That number includes clerks, travellers, coopers, bottlers, and carters. In view of the small amount of labour which this industry employs, we ought not to be so seriously considering the fiscal aspect in connexion with the imposition of duties. I was surprised to learn from the Prime Minister to-day that an increase of duties will not necessarily lead to a decreased importation. That is the only conclusion which can be drawn from the attitude which has been assumed by the Government on the present occasion, and it is one which is directly opposed to the theory which they so constantly advocate, namely that if we increase the dutv upon any article we . shall keep out importations. Apparently the Government hold that that theory applies to every other article, except grog. Why it should not apply I am unable to understand, particularly when the duty proposed is of so serious a character as it is in connexion with spirits. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite content to leave that matter, because to my mind none of these fiscal considerations are worth pursuing. All that we should inquire into is the effect of the consumption of the grog itself, and the effect of the Government proposals upon the revenue of the country. These are the only considerations which ought to weigh with us. My own opinion - and that of the Commission - is that a duty of 15s. per gallon will mean a loss of revenue to the Commonwealth, and will not mean the importation of as much good spirit as the imposition of the lower rate would induce. I think that the more we can insure the supply of pure grog to the public the more we shall be making a stride in the direction of genuine temperance reform. If people will drink grog - and they unfortunately continue to drink it, notwithstanding all the effort which is going on in Victoria and elsewhere - it should be our aim to insure that the liquor supplied to them shall, be of the purest possible character. I believe that a great deal of the drunkenness in the community springs from the impurity of the stuff which men pour down their throats. I am quite certain that the imposition of high duties such as those proposed by the Government will have a tendency to induce adulteration. Some time ago I met a publican who told me that he was! about to retire from the business. He was an individual with whom I used to work many years ago. I asked him the reason for his action, and he said that his rent was high, and that other considerations made it almost "impossible for him to supply the people with good liquor, and that he would refuse to give them an article which he did not. regard as of good quality. The higher the duties that we impose upon spirits, the more likelihood is there that adulteration will be practised. As has been pointed out, the difference between a duty of 14s. per gallon, and one of 15s. per gallon upon imported spirits; may mean a difference of 2s. per gallon to the individual who sells them. The public will still desire to obtain the same quantity of liquor for the same amount of money, and consequently the publican, to make the profit which he has hitherto made, will be tempted to adulterate it. </para>

                            <para>- If spirits are to be diluted it would seem that something: more harmful than water must be used, and that in all probability in such circumstances adulteration must take place. The aim of all our legislation should be to cut down adulteration to a minimum, and as far as possible to abolish it. In this connexion, I think that the inquiries of the Commission may have a good result. They propose, for instance, to set up a certificated standard of pure Australian brandy and whisky. These spirits are to subscribe to the chemical test, which they consider ought to be made in a prescribed way, and' which will presumably result in the production of as pure a spirit as human ingenuity can devise. As far as they go in that direction the Commission are on right lines. If we could induce the people to drink pure instead of adulterated grog we should be taking a step in the direction of temperance. </para>

                                says that he makes brandy from other things than go to make pure wine brandy.. I understand that he largely uses molasses and a mixture of other things, and that he rectifies his spirit, and makes it something that is certainly not pure wine spirit. I am told again that so-called pure grape brandy is not in itself anything like a pure spirit - that certain ingredients are retained which in themselves are not beneficial, but add a flavour to the standard brandy. I am bound to say that I sit at the feet of the Chairman of the Commission. He tells us that after fifteen months spent in making a strict and close inquiry into the whole process of the manufacture of Australian and other spirits, the Commission, have come to the conclusion that an import duty of 14s. per gallon is as much as the trade can bear, consistently with providing a pure article for consumption. Believing that. I shall vote with him when we proceed to decide this question. The Prime Minister stated that in New Zealand an import duty of 16s. per gallon is operating to-day. I understand, however, that there is no local distillation there.

                            <para>- It seems to operate on the same plane. If the people can obtain an inferior article at a very much cheaper rate than that at which a superior article is offered, there is a tendency for the inferior to drive the superior article out of the market. That is the position with regard to many things, and it seems to me that the remark will apply te spirit. Inferior spirit would seem to be able to drive superior spirit out of the market. It is more easily and cheaply produced, and can be so blended as to hit the popular taste. But I was going to point out that in New Zealand there ls no' locally produced spirit to compete against the imported article; consequently, as they have to rely upon imports for the whole of their requirements, the people must pay the dutv of1 16s. per gallon, or go without their supplies. All the evidence we can obtain shows that if the import duties go beyond a certain point in countries where spirits are distilled, inferior local distillations creep in and drive the superior article out of . the market. That is made very clear in the report ot the Royal Commission which was appointed when the right honorable member for Balaclava was Premier of Victoria. That Commission pointed out, as the Prime Minister has said, that the depression which then existed was largely responsible for the falling away of the revenue of Victoria, but that there was something' more - </para>

                    <para class="block">It would therefore appear that, in this respect, spirits are like many other things - the moment one begins to debase them that moment the inferior article becomes popular, and tends to some extent to take the place of the superior one. I am not going to pursue this question further. We have already devoted a day and a half to its consideration, and we ought to be able verv soon to make up our minds with respect to the import duty to be' imposed. I should like to hear from the Prime Minister whether the Government have any further proposal to make in the way of a modification of- the schedule. Has the honorable gentleman any proposal to make as affecting the excise duty ? </para>

                            <para>- It might affect the question, since if a difference were made in the Excise duty on blended spirit it would establish a different relation between the Excise duty and the import duty on that article. Therefore, the two questions are to some extent interwoven. I thought that the Prime Minister would to-day bring down the further proposals of the Government, so that the Committee would know exactly what they were before being called upon to decide any of these questions. I still think that it would be preferable to have the whole of the facts before us before we are asked to decide any of these " questions. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The honorable gentleman's week-end perambulations in South Australia seem to have considerably modified his opinions, and possibly when he returns from Corowa and other wine-producing districts, he will have further modifications to propose. Although the honorable gentleman has shown that he is susceptible to some change in his opinions concerning these matters, he has not stayed here to give us the benefit of his altered views. He said that there was something wrong, and by way of interjection 'declared that he thought there was " Too much Joshua" about the proposal of the Commission. But, having made that statement, he betook himself from the Chamber, leaving the Prime Minister to bear the brunt of the whole proceedings. As I said yesterday, the action of the Minister in leaving the Chamber when proposals of this kind are under consideration is most reprehensible. I certainly think it is extraordinary that any Government should treat as lightly as the present Ministry appear to <inline font-style="italic">b-i</inline> doing, the recommendations and findings of the Commission. If there be . any serious blot on the findings of the Commission - if there are any serious amendments to propose - it would be only an act of courtesy on the part of the Government to ask the Commission to give further consideration to its recommendations. That would be a courteous way of treating the Commission. It has not yet been disbanded, and I suppose that its members would not close their minds to the reception of further evidence placed before them for consideration. If it is thought that their proposals should be drastically amended, they should be given an opportunity to reconsider them. The only further knowledge available seems to be the statement of the Customs officers, whose tendency is too- much to consider local industries, instead of giving impartial reports such as should' emanate from high officials who have no concern with party politics. For the reasons which I have given, I prefer the recommendations of the Commission to those of the Customs officials. The experience available for our guidance shows that the higher the import duties are made, the greater are the temptations placed in the way of the adulteraters and blenders of liquors. Our aim should be to obtain the most revenue we can from the duties on spirits and similar luxuries, and to make it as difficult as possible for those connected with their distribution to do wrong. In my judgment, the increasing of the import duty will offer a distinct temptation to the adulteration of liquor, and will not increase the revenue. I shall, therefore, vote for the amendment. </para>

That sort of thing should not be permitted, no matter what position an officer may occupy. I allude to the honorable member's suggestion that our Customs officials have a predilection for bolstering up Victorian industries. </para>

                            <para>- In that case, they would better serve the end which the honorable member says they have in view by supporting the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. I think that, from a protectionist's point of view, it would be better to lower the Excise than to increase the Customs duties. But the Government and the officers of the Customs Department are the guardians of the public revenue, and in that position must be very vigilant. It reflects the highest credit upon them that they are at all times ready to protect the revenue, and to warn Parliament of actions likely to be detrimental to it. Some honorable members seem to think very lightly of a loss of revenue amounting to between £60,000 and , £90,000 a year, but I am not one of them. I consider it a very important matter. I am not anxious, as some honorable members seem to be, for the imposition of direct taxation by the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Nor do I. We have before us the proposals of the Tariff Commission and those of the Government, and I intend to support the latter, accepting the statement of our responsible officers that the adoption of the Tariff Commission's proposals would mean a loss of revenue of between ,£60,000 and ,£90,000 a year. In my opinion, the importation of liquor should be discouraged as much as possible. I am not in favour of the unrestricted use of spirituous liquors, and should like to see spirits used as little as possible. The re,duction of the excise duties, while benefiting local distillers, will encourage the increased use of liquor, and I shall oppose it on that ground. For these two reasons, which I think are sufficient to justify such action on the part of any one who thinks as I do, I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Laanecoorie has explained that he supports the proposals of the Government for two reasons - that they will result in the maintenance of the revenue, and that they will tend to bring about temperance. The report which I have read completely discounts his assumption in regard to the maintenance of the revenue, while, as to the encouragement of temperance, which the honorable member finds it convenient to advocate at the present time, I think that the temperance people are not anxious that we should devote ourselves to the building up of an industry in which they do not believe. If the honorable member is really desirous of assisting the temperance cause, he will have to vote later on for increasing the Excise duties. </para>

The attitude of the honorable member member has varied as I have described. He knows that he advocated, these proposals on. two grounds : in the first place, because of the protection that they would afford to the revenue; and in the second place because he was anxious on temperance grounds to see a decrease in the consump-tion of spirits. </para>

The duties, import and excise together, collected in Victoria in 1891-2, the year before the increases of rate were levied, were, he said, £806,622. In 1892-3, in the early part of which year the higher rates came into force, the amount was £472,805, showing a decrease of £333,8r7. </para>

                        <para>We gather from the evidence that the high duties have fostered corruption in the trade, and led to much business immorality. Although we have no direct evidence, we firmly believe, and indeed the records of the Excise Department show, that inferior spirit is constantly sold fraudulently under the cover of good brands.

A large amount of additional interesting information, which we do not think it necessary to recapitulate, will be found in the minutes of' evidence. No material facts of sufficient importance to induce us to alter our principal recommendations were, however, brought to light. Much of the evidence has, on the other hand, tended to show that our proposal for the alteration of the duties is moderate and equitable and necessary in the interests of the revenue. </para>

                    <para>This matured verdict of the Victorian Tariff Board effectively disposes of the claim that a duty of 15s. is necessary in the interests of the revenue, and also shows that a high duty will inevitably lead to deterioration in the quality of the spirit supplied, and to the introduction of corrupt practices into the trade. In this Parliament we have always professed to be solicitous for the moral and material welfare of the people whose interests are committed to our charge.

                        <para>.- I intend to support the recommendation of the Commission that the duty be maintained at 14s. I am prompted to do this in the interests of the revenue. I find that the local production of spirit has increased by 50 per cent, during the last few years, and that it is at present nearly equal to half the total consumption of the Commonwealth. This development has taken place, whilst there has been a margin of only is. between the import and Excise duties, and we may assume that if further protection is granted to the local distillers the production will very largely increase, and that in the very near future the whole of our requirements will be met by the local distillers. Within six years the production of spirits in the Commonwealth has been increased from 700,000 gallons to 1,500,000 gallons, whereas in four years the importation of spirits has decreased from 3,000,000 to 2,500,000 gallons. I should think that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer would be alarmed at the prospect qf a greater margin being allowed between the import and Excise duties, because a great shrinkage of revenue must take place. If we insist, however, upon raising the import duty to 15s., our position will be worse still. I would point out to honorable members that we pay <inline font-style="italic">se.</inline> very high price for the maintenance of the local distilling industry. Even assuming that there is no increase in the local production, we shall, under the Government proposal, lose 2s. upon .every gallon of spirit locally produced, and will thus pay £150,000 per annum towards the support of the Australian industry. These figures are enormous when we consider the very small advantages that are conferred upon the community. Very few hands are engaged in our distilleries. Messrs. Joshua Brothers, who, perhaps, have the only up-to-date distillery in Australia, admit that they do not pay more than about £100 per week in wages. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> told the Tariff </para>

                            <para>- In my judgment, the Government proposal represents protection run mad. If we allow that we are losing 2s. per gallon by differentiating between the import and the Excise duties upon spirits, it represents a sum of ,£156,000 annually. </para>

                            <para>- We could obtain a large amount of labour for that sum. If we allow a difference of 3s. per gallon as between the import and the Excise duties upon spirits, it means a loss' of revenue of £225, 000 annually, and in my opinion 3s. per gallon more nearly represents the loss which we incur than does 2s. I shall vote for the imposition of a duty of 14s. per gallon. </para>

                            <para>- That is its concern. It is not necessary for us to accept the duty which the Commission has recommended. The only argument which has been advanced against a rate of 15s. per gallon is that it would mean a considerable loss of revenue. I do not agree with that statement. But even assuming that we lost considerably by levying a duty of i5st per gallon upon imported spirits, we should obtain an infinitely larger revenue from other sources. The adoption of the Government proposal would mean that more work would be provided in the industry in the Commonwealth, and thus the revenue would be more than recouped. It has also been said that the industry affords very little employment. Some honorable members appear to think that the only labour which it employs is that which is directly engaged in distillation. That is not so. We have to consider all the subsidiary industries connected with it. I need scarcely point out that at the present time we do not print the labels or manufacture either the bottles or the corks which are used in connexion with a large quantity of the spirits which are imported. Then it has been urged that the effect of the Government proposal will be to reduce the quality of the liquor which is supplied to the public. I maintain that there is nothing whatever in that contention owing to the operation of the Food and Drugs Acts in the various States. If honorable members will turn to progress report No. 2 of the Tariff Commission they will find that in 1905 the quantity of spirits imported into the Commonwealth exceeded that which was introduced in 1899 by 55,887 gallons. But there was this difference : That the value of the spirits imported in 1905 was less than the value of the importations of 1899 by £40,315. These figures seem to point to a very great deterioration indeed in the quality of the spirits which are imported. I think that the spirits which are introduced into the Commonwealth from abroad have already reached bed-rock so far as quality is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- It is the case under the operation of the present duty. At any rate, I am quite prepared to try the experiment proposed by the Government. The States will then be compelled to legislate to insure the supply of pure liquor to the public. In discussing this matter we must consider whether the loss of revenue which will flow from the adoption of the Government proposal will not be more than compensated for by the increased revenue which will be obtained from other sources as the result of increased employment being afforded to our own people. </para>

                        <para>; - I listened with interest to the remark's of the Prime Minister, and I gathered that his object in opposing the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo was to encourage the local production of spirits. He admitted that, under the Government proposal, there would be a falling off in the quantity of spirits imported, but he urged that there would be a larger production of locally-distilled spirits. I am given to understand by those who are engaged in the business that Australia is well catered for, so far as the quality of the spirits which are imported is concerned. I gathered from the Prime Minister's remarks that he favours placing upon the Australian market a locally-produced article, in preference to the pure spirit which is imported. When I was at Kilmarnock I was informed that Walker's firm was not in the habit of sending to Australia whisky which was under' ten years of age. In Ireland I was the recipient of similar information respecting Robertson's whisky. These facts go to show that we are well catered for in the matter of high-class whiskies. It seems to me that the Prime Minister's desire is to keep these whiskies out of our market. By so doing, he maintains that we shall obtain more revenue from the raw, immature spirit which will be produced locally, and the consumption of which will be likely to increase. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly there is a large importation of inferior spirits, in addition to the well matured whisky I have referred to, as can be readily understood from a perusal of the different prices which are charged for them. When in Western Australia a short time ago, I was struck with the ..number of fresh brands of whisky which are upon the market there. Upon making inquiries I found that it was impossible to introduce into that State a whisky which was not well matured, and which would not compare favorably with the .productions of such well established firms as Walker and Robertson. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite beyond the province of the honorable member to say that. Of course, I recognise that there is a very large quantity of inferior spirit imported into the Commonwealth for various purposes. One has only to take the catalogue of a wine and -spirit merchant to note the marked difference between the prices of various brands. If a merchant were asked, the question he would probably tell his customer that he could g'.t ." Bulloch Lade" whisky for half the price which is charged for Walker's " Red Collar " brand. It is perfectly true that prior to the enactment of the Federal Tariff, very good whisky could be purchased in Victoria. But as soon as InterState free-trade was established, one large firm here practically closed its works, and imported from New South Wales a cheap spirit made from molasses - a spirit to which it previously had no access. That is the spirit which is upon the market at the present time, and which the Government apparently wish to bring into general consumption. On behalf of the drinkers of whisky, .1 urge that we should insist upon the public being supplied with a pure article which has been matured by age in wood. I have seen experiments conducted with all kinds of spirituous liquors. When I was a young fellow, it was quite a common thing for experiments to be undertaken with highly rectified spirit ; and I recollect that it was possible to convert that spirit :into almost any liquor that one desired. This result was accomplished by a process of flavouring and colouring. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very fiery liquor. One dose of it is sufficient to lay one up. I believe that illicit distillation is being very largely carried on in all parts of Australia. Spirit so produced is mixed with the best imported spirits, and the agents for the latter have travellers constantly visiting hotels and making tests for the purpose of detecting any such adulteration. This adulteration of imported whisky with inferior Australian whisky is largely practised. The Prime Minister, in opposing the proposal of <inline font-style="italic">ti</inline> the  Chairman  of the Commission, is actuated by a desire to discourage the consumption of the imported' article, and to secure an increase in the consumption of that made locally, which is chiefly the product of Joshua Brothers' distillery. Joshua Brothers openly assert thai they use a cheap Australian spirit in the manufacture, not only of whisky, but of brandy, and that they  desire to discourage the consumption of pure brandy made exclusively, as in South Australia, from grape spirit. Twenty years ago, when Australian grape brandy was placed on the market, it was generally recommended by the medical profession as suitable for fever patients. As a pure brandy, it was preferable to imported brandies, since it contained the ethers so necessary to bring about a reduction of temperature with the least possibility of danger to the patient to whom it was administered. The tendency of the Government proposal is rather to encourage the consumption of inferior spirits to the disadvantage of some of the high-class whisky and brandy - which is chiefly importer! - sold in the Australian market. That being so, I feel it my duty, in the interests of a pure liquor supply for the people, to support' .the amendment moved by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo. </para>

                        <para>.- The proposal of the Government that the import duty on spirits shall be increased to 15s. per gallon has been put forward on the ground that it is necessary from the stand-point of the Treasury. It has been pointed out by the Prime Minister that, after the sudden disappearance of the Minister of Trade and Customs, he caused inquiries to be made by competent officers, with the result that they arrived at the conclusion that the Government proposition is one which, because of revenue considerations, should be adopted. I did not have an opportunity to hear the speech delivered by the Prime Minister, but I gather that he failed to put before the Committee the grounds upon which these officers arrived at the conclusion that if the proposition of the Tariff Commission, that a duty of 14s. per gallon be imposed, were adopted, it would result in a loss of revenue. It must be patent to any one having a fair knowledge of this question that when the duty on spirits is increased from 14s. per gallon to 15s. per gallon, it becomes, not a revenue, but a protective one. From that point of view, I can understand such a proposal as that emanating from the Minister of Trade and Customs, as the representative of a protectionist Administration. </para>

                            <para>- I think that it does. The honorable member for Wentworth has quoted statistics showing that the result of an increase in the spirit duties imposed under the Victorian Tariff was an immediate reduction in the revenue. We may reasonably expect 'that if the Government proposal be adopted there will be a reduction of revenue, and that the duty will have a protective incidence. Since it appears that the Government have not proved their case, and as the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, as representing the Commission, has moved that the duty Le 14s. per' gallon, I think that honorable members would 'be well advised in voting for the amendment. The Government have been, referred! to more than once during this debate as the custodians of. the revenue, but they have failed to put before the Committee any satisfactory reasons for their proposal from that stand-point. All that they tell us is that, " Having referred this question to competent officers, we have arrived at certain, conclusions." They have given the Commission and honorable members generally no opportunity to examine the grounds on which that decision is based. 'We know that the effect of an increase in the import dutv on spirits under the Victorian Tariff was to decrease, not to increase the revenue, and that being so, I appeal to the Committee to support the amendment. It is also clear that high duties have a strong tendency to lead to the introduction of spirits of an inferior character. A consideration for the health of the general public is one of the principles on which the recommendations of the Commission are based: We came to the conclusion1 that a duty of 14s. per gallon was the highest that could be recommended, consistently with a desire to conserve the revenue, and to secure the sale of as good a liquor as possible. Whit is the great Australian industry which it is said would' be built up by this increased duty? It has been pointed out that labour is a very small factor in the distilling industry. I have not the exact figures by me, but I know that the proportion of the labour to the output is the smallest that any of the great industries of Australia show. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua,</inline> when giving sworn evidence before the Tariff Commission, distinctly admitted that the distilling industry would have but little effect on the farming industry. It has been said that if this industry were successfully established it would be of immense benefit to the farming community, but even if the whole of the spirit consumed in Australia were made out of the products of our farmers, the effect of the industry upon the farming community would be so small as to be hardly worthy of consideration. Other cognate trades in connexion with the distilling "industry have also been mentioned, but, viewing this matter from even the stand-point of the protectionists, I hold that the industry gives so little employment, and is of such small moment to the farming interests of Australia that it is not worth so big a price as we are asked to pay for it. Having gone fully into this question, I would strongly recommend the Committee, in the absence of the information which we are entitled to expect from the Government as to the grounds <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> which they have based their conclusions, to vote for the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I am at a loss to follow the free-trade and protectionist aspects of this question as put by honorable members. It seems to me that it is purely a question of revenue, and that it has been so put before the Committee by the Government. The intention is that the same difference between the Customs and Excise duties shall be maintained, whether the Customs duty be fixed at 15s. or at 14s. per gallon, and it is on that understanding that I intend to vote in the way I shall indicate. I do not feel that the information which has been submitted by the Government would justify me in departing from the considered recommendations of the Tariff Commission. The Commission have given this matter their very careful attention, and their report is one of the comparatively few unanimous reports that we shall receive from them. In their recommendations they certainly propose a considerable difference in favour of the local manufacturer which would have a result that I, for one, am not going to quarrel with, and there has been no evidence of a satisfactory character submitted bv the Govern- u ment to suggest that the change of the import and Excise duties from 14s. and 10s. per gallon respectively to 15s. and 1 is. per gallon would prevent that decrease of revenue which the Treasurer desires to avoid. If I had been satisfied that the prevention of a decrease of revenue would have been brought about bv an increase of both duties without a deterioration in the quality of the liquor, the position might have been different. Bi't if spirits are to be consumed, I think it is desirable that they should be of good rather than of inferior quality. 1 certainly do not wish to see as the result of any alteration of duties an inferior quality of liquor brought into consumption. Holding these views, it seems to me that, looking at' the matter purely from a revenue stand-point, the Government have not justified the variation from the report of the Tariff Commission which they propose. I therefore intend to support the recommendation of the Commission, but on the understanding that the difference between the Customs and Excise duties is maintained, as suggested bv that body, and as is proposed', bv the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have laid their proposals on the table, and these proposals are now in the possession of the Committee. Although the members of the Commission displayed great ability and assiduity in the performance of their duties, they have not complied with their instructions. It is clear that they should have reported upon the good as well as the bad effects of the Tariff, but I cannot find that any evidence was taken regarding its good effects. Therefore, the Commissioners have only partly carried out the task allotted to them, although they have exceeded their powers by submitting a schedule of duties. </para>

                            <para>- I should have no objection to the appointment of a permanent Commission, to take evidence and make recommendations in regard to the working of the Tariff, but I should not allow such a Commission to submit schedules of duties. The Government have a double responsibility. They are the responsible advisers of the Crown, and are also responsible to Parliament for the proper administration of the Public Service, for which they have to provide sufficient funds. In my opinion, the Tariff Commissioners were not empowered to recommend a schedule of duties. Moreover, they have had regard, in considering these questions, only to the effect, of the Tariff on certain industries, and, while they may desire the imposition of higher duties for the protection of certain industries, the effect of alterations of the Tariff can be dealt with properly only by responsible advisers of the Crown, whose duty it is to provide funds for the administration of the public services of the country. </para>

                            <para>-The more indefinite they were, the better it would have been. They would have been able to say, " We have carried out our instructions, and have inquired into the effect of the Tariff upon Australian industries. We find that one industry has suffered, and that another has prospered greatly under the present duties." In making such a report, they would have been carrying out the whole of their allotted task, whereas, as I have pointed' out, .they- have left part of it undone. I make no complaint about that, because I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that they have not had time to do more than they have done. The Commissioners were appointed also, as the Chairman has reminded me, to inquire into the working of the Tariff generally. -Prior to their appointment many complaints were made regarding the administration of the Tariff, but, in my opinion, the power to inquire into the working of the Tariff generally did not give the Commissioners the right to bring down 'proposals for specific rates of duty. Nothing could be more mischievous in the public interest than to have questions such as those involved' in the arrangement of a Tariff decided by a Royal Commission. </para>

It has been said' by a high authority that finance is government, and government is finance, and we are having a Tariff settled., by a number of persons who, however able and desirous of doing their duty, to the Commonwealth, went beyond their powers in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- My ideas with regard to age do not coincide with those of the honorable member for Parramatta. At the outset of our career as a Parliament we ought to be exceedingly careful not to tread any path likely to lead us into difficulties, or to result in our establishing precedents that would be dangerous in the future. I think that the Commission would do well to content themselves in the future by indicating that certain industries, for example, had been injured by the operation of the Tariff, and recommending that more protection should be granted in. order to place them- on a footing equal to that which they occupied under State legislation. Any such report would cover the whole of the ground, and would not in any way weaken the recommendations of the Commission. In the same way, if they found that certain industries were prospering under the Federal Tariff to a higher degree than previously, it would be their duty to bring that fact under the notice of Parliament. , I submit that this is an important matter, and that I am not exceeding my public duty when I ask the Government to give it their attention, especially when the Chairman of the Commission indicates that the duties of himself and his colleagues would be very much lightened if an understanding in the direction I have indicated could be arrived at. I believe that good results would follow from the appointment of a permanent body of experts for the purpose of taking evidence, and reporting to Parliament _ with respect to the operation of the Tariff in regard to various industries. No one would suggest that such a Board should recommend the adoption of specific duties in any case. They would merely direct the attention of the Government to the fact that an industry was failing for want of sufficient protection, or for some other reason, and leave it to Parliament to decide whether, and in what manner, relief should be afforded. I do not know of any Commission having recommended the adoption of specific duties. If, however, other Commissions have done so, they have, in my view, taken a wrong course. Only one body of men, namely, the Executive, are responsible to this Parliament for carrying on the services of the Crown. They are in duty bound to shape the financial policy of the country, subject to the review of Parliament, and they should be subject to no undue influence on the part of an outside body such as the Tariff Commission. </para>

                            <para>- What I object to is the fact that they have recommended the adoption of a definite scale of duties. In doing so, I contend that they have exceeded the order of -reference. Even if they have not exceeded the order of reference they have presented their report in the very worst possible form. I may point to the fact that the first unanimous decision of the Commission with regard to the imposition of new duties was made public before the Government became aware of it, and certain persons were thus enabled to rob the Commonwealth. Even though the Commission mav be acting within the order of reference in recommending the adoption of specific duties, they are certainly not doing that which is best calculated to conserve the interests of the country. They should make general recommendations and allow Parliament to decide what the amount of dutv shall be. </para>

                            <para>- That is how I understood the honorable member. I would point cut that the Tariff Commission which reported to the Victorian Parliament in 1894 adopted exactly the same course that has been followed in this case. The Victorian Commission were asked to inquire into the effect of the Tariff upon local industries, and they made fifty or SixtY recommendations, in each case mentioning the rate of duty that they considered should be imposed. The honorable member contended that there was no precedent in this Parliament for the- action of the Commission. There could not very well be a precedent for their action, for the reason that this is the first occasion upon which a Commission has been called upon to report to this Parliament on the subject of the Tariff. Of what use would be a Commission if it could not give us the benefit of its conclusions in. a specific form? The report before us cannot be regarded as being framed in the interests of any particular party. The Commission comprises members sitting on both sides of the Chamber, who have presented a unanimous report with regard to the question before us. I think that the Commission would have failed in their duty if. after having taken such a large amount of evidence, and having worked so hard for man v months, they had not made a definite recommendation.' We are not bound to carry out their suggestions, and, as a matter of fact, the Government have not accepted them without modification. We have every reason to be thankful to the Commission for having expressed themselves so definitely upon the important question now under discussion, and I hope that the honorable member for Wide Bay will recognise that his contention is not borne out bv the practice followed in other Parliaments. </para>

                        <para>.- I am certainly unable to follow the reasoning of the honorable member for Wide Bay, who no doubt had devoted a great deal of' consideration to this question prior to presenting his views to the Committee. To my mind, the only object of appointing a Royal Commission to investigate any matter is that it may be in the position - after exhaustive inquiry - to advise the responsible Ministers of the day as to the path which they ought to pursue. I listened with very great interest to the exceedingly thoughtful addresses which were delivered last evening; by the Honorable and learned member for Bendigo, and by other members of the Tariff Commission, and I am of opinion that the recommendations of that body are deserving of every consideration at our hands. If there were any point at all in the objection which has been urged by the honorable member for Wide Bay against the recommendation of specific rates of duty by the Tariff Commission, it could only apply if the Ministry sought to give effect to their recommendations. But, as a matter of fact, the Government have submitted different proposals, and, personally, I am not disposed to agree with the alterations which they suggest. They propose to increase the duty upon imported spirits from 14s. ta 15s. per gallon, but they have not given us any proof that their proposal is a proper one under the circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the question of revenue is the only one, as I think it is very desirable to extend consideration to our home industries, and I hold that Australia should be able to produce spirits which are equal - if not superior - to the imported article. But, . in my judgment, a case has not been established for departing from the scientific recommendations! made by the Tariff Commission after an exhaustive study of this question. Therefore, I intend to vote for the retention of the existing duty. The only question upon which 1 shall probably disagree with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission has reference to the duty which should be levied upon blended brandy. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to say a few words in reply to a statement which was made by the Prime Minister this afternoon. I gathered from his remarks that he does not attach very much importance to the fact that when an increased duty upon spirits was imposed in Victoria, the revenue from this source declined very considerably. I need scarcely point out that there are others who attach a good deal of importance to that significant fact, and who also urge that the effect of the high duty was to lower the quality of locally-produced spirits to the detriment of the health of the community as well as to cause a serious diminution of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- But I think it may be accepted as an axiom of political economy that, speaking generally, the effect of raising duties is to lower the amount of revenue derived from them. In 1892, at the instance of the right honorable member for Balaclava, who was then Treasurer of Victoria, the Customs duty upon spirits was increased from 12s. to 15s. per gallon. What was the result? In 1 901-2 the revenue from this source was £806,622, but the following year it fell to £472,805- a decline of £333,817. The right honorable member for Balaclava, in explaining the loss, said - . </para>

                    <para>The depression accounted for some falling off of Victorian revenue, but the real reason was the existence of a low quality spirit which took the place of the imported. </para>
                    <para class="block">Then the Tariff Commission recommended a reduction of the duty to 13s. per gallon. It confirmed the view which was held by the Treasurer as to the causes which had contributed to that very serious decline in the revenue. In its report, it stated - </para>

                        <para>We regret to say that we regard the fact to be proved that a very inferior quality of spirit is vended, and that this state of things has been fostered by the high duties. </para>

                    <para class="block">In connexion with the lowering of the quality of the liquor supplied to the public, I may mention that after the raising of the duties, prosecutions for breaches of the law under this head increased to double their former number. The fines for such offences rose in one year from £3,000 to £6,000. In view of these facts, I think we have every reason to apprehend that similar results will flow from any increase in the rate of duty at present operating. </para>

I would ask the Prime Minister to give the Committee an assurance that he is satisfied from inquiries by his officers that, as the result of this duty, there will be no unnecessary interference with spirits that ought to be admitted. But for the fact that the proposal has suddenly been made, I should have made independent inquiries with respect to its probable effect. </para>

                        <para>. - This proposal is rendered necessary, not by anything contained in our original proposition, or known to the officers of the Department, but owing to the introduction in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the limitation as to spirits being matured for two years. That provision might let in spirits that are not two years old, or leave them unprovided for. The question will be dealt with satisfactorily in the Bill, but at present the amendment might permit the clearing of spirits that do not exceed a certain proof strength, and have not been stored- for two years. It is necessary to protect the Department for the time being. </para>

                            <para>- It will be for the officers of the Customs Department to see that the spirit is used for the purposes for which it is allowed to be imported, or produced locally. So far as my knowledge goes, verv little rectified spirit is made in the Commonwealth for industrial purposes, with the exception of sugar spirit, which is not so suitable for certain uses as is other spirit, such as potato spirit. Although I should like to see a much heavier duty imposed upon SUCH spirit than on spirit imported for drinking purposes, I do not think that its importation should be prohibited by the imposition of a duty of 40s. I suggest to the Government that they make provision to meet this case. </para>

                        <para>These matters of detail are fairly open to consideration. They are matters upon which even members of the Commission have no very pronounced views- Whether distillation should be at an alcoholic strength of 35 per cent, or 45 per cent, overproof is not a vital question, but it is vital that unless these spirits are distilled at a certain denned strength overproof they shall not receive the preference and advantages which we have recommended. </para>

                    <para class="block">Our officers suggest that brandy and blended brandy should be distilled at. a strength not exceeding 40 per cent., instead °t 35 Per cent., as set down in the schedule, and that whisky, blended whisky, and rum should be distilled at a strength of 45 per cent., instead of at the respective strengths of 35, 25, and 35 set down in the schedule. These are technical alterations which their experience of the trade leads them to recommend. In paragraph 4 we propose to substitute for the words "other materials" the word "grain," so that it shall read, " Blended whisky distilled partly from barley malt and partly* from grain." </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the Government will do well to increase the alcoholic strength of the spirits mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 5. I wish to know what the position of molasses spirit will be. To substitute "approved materials" for "other materials" in regard to blends will not do what is necessary, and even if it is provided, as I believe is intended, that "other materials" shall not include molasses, we should know under what heading molasses will come. </para>

The two classes of spirit will be separate and distinct, and will have distinguishing official labels. </para>

                        <para>.- The amendment raises the whole question as to how far the recommendations of the Tariff Commission shall be adopted. I understand that the Prime Minister proposes at a later stage to depart from the differentiation made by the Commission between brandy distilled wholly from grape wine and blended brandy. The Commission recommend that there shall be a difference of is. in the amount of duty levied upon the respective spirits. The Government now propose, and I think they are right, to differentiate between the two classes of spirit to the extent of 29. per gallon. The members of the Commission state that a differentiation of 2s. between these two spirits will not be sufficient to re-establish the manufacture of pure brandy in Australia. That is the reason why I stated earlier in the evening that I proposed to move that brandy distilled wholly from grape wine should be subject to an Excise dutv of only 9s. </para>

                            <para>- The Commission proposed - and I think they should insist upon their recommendation - that the blended brandy should be subject to an Excise duty of us., and that is why I take this opportunity of bringing the -case from my point of view before the Committee. There would be no difficulty, so far as I am concerned, in accepting a differentiation of 4s- as between the import duty and the Excise duty on pure grape spirit. But a difficulty will occur if the blended spirit is brought within is. of the pure grape spirit. </para>

                        <para>.- I quite agree with the amendments suggested by the' Prime Minister upon matters of detail which involve no .serious or vital principle. But I am sorry that the honorable gentleman wishes to reduce the amount of protection proposed to be granted to blended brandy. The Commission unanimously recommended that the preferential advantage given to manufacturers of that class of spirit should be 3s. per gallon, and now the Prime Minister proposes t® reduce the preference to 2s. per gallon. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe in government by officials. This is a matter which should be decided by responsible Ministers. I do not know that the officials are competent to advise Ministers upon fiscal questions. They mav furnish estimates of revenue and so' on, but it is not their duty to advise Ministers upon questions of fiscal principle. I protest against the proposed alteration, which would impair the unity and consistency of the scheme recommended by the Commission. That body includes free-traders and protectionists, and now a so-called protectionist Ministry intends to give away the protectionist recommendation of the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but some very strong reasons can be urged in favour of a greater differentiation than is. per gallon between pure grape spirit and the blended article. I take it that we are all anxious to encourage the drinking cf Australian wines in preference to more ardent spirits. I should be willing to do this at any time, and should think I was promoting the greater temperance and morality of the people as a whole. I think it would be an excellent thing if we could substitute light Australian wine for the ardent spirits new consumed by the people, and I should regard any movement in that direction as of a distinctly temperance character. I should like to make a quotation from a statement contained in a letter written by Penfold and Company, of South Australia. </para>

Thus four gallons of pure grape brandy would cost 16s. to produce, whilst three gallons of molasses spirit and one gallon of grape brandy would cost 6s. 6d. The difference in Excise on the four gallons is only 4s. in favour of true brandy, leaving a margin of 5s. 6d. on the adulterated article, which means is. 43d. a gallon. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I have already pointed out that there is a differentiation in favour of the blended article as against the pure article of is. 4 1/2 d. per gallon., or 5&amp; 6d. upon a four-gallon cask. That is a case which ought to be susceptible of answer by the members of the Commission. I am aware that it is contended that the pure brandy will have a label attached to it which will give it a commercial advantage as against the blended article; but I doubt whether any label which can be attached to the pure article will command a sufficient price to compensate for the difference to which I have referred. So far as I am concerned that is about the only point connected with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission in regard to the spirit duties which seems to be open to criticism. But I cannot shut my eyes to this great' difference in favour of the inferior, or adulterated or blended article. </para>

                        <para>-- I would have preferred that the debate upon this question should have been postponed until the particular item was reached. But even in the light of the remarks of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo I cannot understand why it is proposed to extend so great a preference to the production of blended brandy as against that of pure grape brandy. It seems to me that in view of the comparatively low price at which the former article can be placed upon the market it is ridiculous to suggest such high preferential treatment in connexion with our Excise duties. Hitherto blended brandy has enjoyed a preference of is. per gallon, as against pure grape brandy, but under the recommendations of the Commission that preference will be trebled. I do not see the necessity for that. Rum or sugar spirit is one of the cheapest spirits which can be produced in Australia. It is so cheap that the Tariff Commission itself has recommended that the Excise should be withdrawn from methylated spirit. It points to the immense quantity of molasses which are going to waste in Australia, and which can be converted into spirit with sufficient economy to allow it to compete against the use of petrol " for industrial purposes. I quite agree with that suggestion. To my mind, it is rather a reflection upon our intelligence that we did not foresee the possibilities of its use in that direction five years ago. </para>

                            <para>- Then there is some excuse for our inaction. I think that everybody will agree that the suggestion of the Tariff Commission in this particular connexion is a very wise one indeed. But the very fact that that body points to molasses being used for methylating purposes indicates that for the purpose of blending with grape wine spirit the spirit could be produced equally cheaply. Consequently it does not require the amount of protection that it is proposed to extend to .it. I do not for a moment suggest that molasses spirit is not wholesome, but I do contend that it is not right to give to it a greater measure of protection than the circumstances of the case demand, or to allow if to be sold as "blended brandy " in the local market. To my mind, the term is a misnomer. It should be called blended rum, instead of blended brandy. </para>

                            <para>- It may be a foundation, but it is rather too flimsy a foundation upon which to erect a superstructure which is worth anything. I think that the proposal of the Government has much to commend it to the common sense of honorable members. To extend to this class of spirit twice as much protection as it previously enjoyed is fairly liberal treatment, and I am prepared to go so far. But if we allow the Excise upon this so-called blended brandy to approach within is. per gallon of that which is levied upon pure grape brandy the distillers of the latter article will be placed at a great disadvantage in fighting the former upon the Australian market. In other words, we shall discourage the use of grape spirit, and I do not know whether honorable members can contemplate that state of affairs with equanimity. I admit that the honorable member for Moira has suggested that to overcome the difficulty we might reduce the Excise upon pure grape brandy, so as to allow it a preference of 5s. per gallon as against the imported article. But I am of opinion that by levying these comparatively low Excise duties, and by retaining the import duty at 14s. per gallon, we shall commit ourselves to a sufficiently heavy loss of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- I was anxious to know whether the members of the Commission were unanimous upon this question. In my judgment it is unreasonable for this Committee to set itself up as a tribunal equally competent to the Commission which investigated this difficult subject. We have had a very good instance of that afforded us by the honorable member for Parramatta, who offered as a reason for the view which he entertains upon this question the fact that a certain firm had made a particular statement in a letter to him. We have only to consider his position for a moment to realize that he is on very unsafe ground in this connexion. Need I remind him that the Tariff Commission have had scores of men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penfold</inline> before them upon oath? No useful purpose can be served by any honorable member declaring that a particular witness has said so and so ; because it is quite possible that the statement which he makes in written communications with an honorable member is entirely different from that which he made upon oath before the Commission, and when he was subjected to cross-examination. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking particularly of the case mentioned by the honorable member. If in an action at law ten witnesses had been heard on each side, it would be unreasonable to urge that the verdict of the jury should be upset because it appeared to be contrary to something said by one witness. That is an illustration of the position in which we find ourselves. The Commission examined and cross-examined some scores of witnesses on oath : and if I have read the evidence aright many of those witnesses broke down under cross-examination. They are now flooding the House with circulars which possibly - I do not say probably - differ entirely from the evidence they gave before the Commission. Only yesterday Messrs. Joshua Brothers issued to honorable members circulars in which they made certain statements protesting against the findings of the Commission. Side by side with the distribution of those circulars we had a letter produced by the chairman of the Commission, in which the same firm complimented him upon the findings of that body, and said that they were perfectly satisfied with them, or words to that effect. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I am not in any way interested in this matter. I am not a heavy drinker, nor have I that fine sense of flavours which some! honorable members seem to possess. We are proceeding, however, on an entirely wrong basis. We are in the position of one of the parties to a law suit, who appeals to a Judge to upset the verdict of a jury on the ground that it is not in keeping with the evidence given by himself. We ought not now to take notice of unworn statements of any witness examined by the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to be diverted from the point that I wish to make. Every honorable member ought to remember that a vast number of witnesses on both sides have been examined and cross-examined by eight men representing the two fiscal parties. I presume that the Commission heard the evidence of these witnesses dispassionately, and arrived at their findings apart from party feeling. No honorable member is logically justified in coming to a conclusion, different from that of the Commission merely on the evidence of one witness, unless he is also prepared to review the whole of the evidence which led the Commission to arrive at their conclusion. I wish to know a little more about this matter, and should like the chairman of the Commission in the first place to give us the reasons which he considers would justify us . in again vindicating its action. I am sorry to again call upon him to speak; I regret that after the able way in which he has discharged his duties as a member of the Commission, he should be called upon so frequently in this Committee to vindicate the judgment expressed by that body. The Government have come forward with a proposal different from that recommended by the Commission, and the only statement which they make in justification of it is that, " The officers say this," or " The officers say that." I have the greatest respect for officers in the abstract, but I am bound to say that a good many things done bv some of them in the Customs Department of the Commonwealth have very much shaken my confidence in them. That being so, I think that the Minister should fortify himself with the reasons which the officers have in mind in making these recommendations. It is scarcely sufficient for him to say that the officers of the Department advise that this or that be done. If it were, we should be governed' by officers. I should like the officer in question, through the Minister, to tell us why he thinks that we should depart from the conclusion arrived at by the Commission after examining all the witnesses and subjecting them to the test of criticism usually applied by such a body. The Prime Minister has taken up the part of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and has not 'given us his- reasons for departing from the recommendation of the Commission. Since the recommendation is one upon which the Commission were unanimous. I think we are entitled to have those reasons stated. That having been done, I shall ask the Chairman of the Commission to give those of us who are anxious to uphold the Commission the reasons which he thinks would justify us in helping him once more in this Committee to vindicate its action. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable and learned member for Parkes has described the Commission as a jury, and has declared that its findings, based on the evidence which it has heard, ought to be accepted as final by the Committee. I would point out, however, that the Commission was. not appointed to prepare a Tariff; it was appointed to take evidence, to report, and to make certain recommendations which would be considered, and, if thought fit, adopted by the Committee. The fact that it has made certain recommendations should not be sufficient to induce the Committee to abrogate their functions as a jury. We are responsible to our constituents and the country, and we must discharge those functions by examining the evidence. If we think that the Commission has made a mistake, it will be our duty not to adept its recommendations, but to act according to the best knowledge that we possess. </para>

The Tariff Commission has undoubtedly carried out a monumental work, and I feel under a debt of obligation to it. </para>

                            <para>- At the same time, they cannot call upon us - nor do I think they ask us - to refrain from exercising our own individual judgment on the facts which they have elicited. I certainly think that they have not recommended the best course to be pursued in regard to the differentiation in favour of pure wine brandy. It is admitted that absolutely pure brandy made from wine is perfectly wholesome, and that the encouragement of its manufacture must have a beneficial effect on the primary producers of the Commonwealth. There are something like 56,000 acres under vine cultivation in South Australia, and I understand that in Victoria alone there are some 3,000 wine growers interested in this question. The number in South Australia is probably much greater, whilst the number in Western Australia and New South Wales is largely increasing. </para>

                            <para>- I have just said that it must be admitted by members of the Tariff Commission, and others, that pure brandy made wholly from grape spirit is the most wholesome. It is recommended by medical men, and also, I believe, by the analytical chemist, to whom reference was made by the Chairman of the Commission. That gentleman said that he would prefer grape brandy for medicinal purposes. Since grape brandy is the purest, and the encouragement of its production will be most beneficial to the primary producers, it seems to me that we should strike a serious blow at the development of the industry if we adopted the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. The only argument that I have heard advanced against a differentiation in favour of pure grape brandy spirit is that the manufacturers will benefit by being able to place on 'their labels a statement to the effect that their product is pure. Will that compensate them for the direct encouragement that is to be offered to distillers to use a cheaper article, from which they can make the most money ? Certainly not. The fact that a bottle is labelled " pure brandy " will have little effect upon purchasers. At the present time brandy which used to be labelled " Boomerang Australian brandy " is now labelled merely " Boomerang," but I am certain that not one out of every hundred persons who purchase that spirit has noticed the omission of the words "Australian brandy." Indeed, I know that one of the largest wine and spirit merchants here had not noticed it until his attention was specially directed to it, although he has been dealing constantly in the spirit. It is a good thing to encourage the consumption of the purest and 'the most wholesome brandy, and we should therefore see that the distillation of pure brandy from grape wine only is not discouraged by there being a greater profit in the distillation of a blended brandy from grape wine and other materials. It is at present to the advantage of distillers that as little grape wine spirit as possible shall be used, because spirit distilled from other materials' is so much cheaper.

                    <para>Tariff Commission says that they will go on using 50 per cent, or more of grape wine spirit, but the temptation to make a larger profit by using other spirit will soon prove too strong to be resisted, while there is also the popular prejudice in favour of blended brandies to be reckoned with. Therefore, in view of the advantage of encouraging the consumption of the best and purest article, and in the interests of an industry which is of great importance to Australia, I hope that a greater differentiation will be made between pure and blended brandy. </para>

                        <para>. - I consider that the Tariff Commissioners have devoted a considerable amount of attention to the matters they have had in hand, and that the reports which they have submitted for our guidance are very valuable. But, while I am prepared to give due consideration to their recommendations, I am not prepared to follow them blindly. If they are not such as I can accept, or if I think that points have been overlooked, I shall require further information before supporting them. There are one or two points affecting the proposals now under discussion, in regard to which I require some elucidation. We are dealing with brandies of two descriptions, pure brandy distilled wholly from grape wine, and blended brandy distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials, such as molasses. In dealing with the subject, it must be borne in mind that the cost of producing spirit from grape wine is very much greater than the cost of producing spirit from molasses, which is a by-product. I agree with the honorable member for Bland that the term " brandy " was originally applied to spirit distilled from grape wine. But it has become customary to place on. the market under that name spirit distilled from grape wine blended with spirit distilled from other ' materials, such as molasses, potatoes, and wheat. This blended brandy. being cheaper than pure brandy, has competed very seriously with it. It is thought, therefore, that in framing the Tariff V distinction should be made between brandy and blended brandy, and I hold that view. I also agree with the honorable member for Bland that only spirit distilled wholly from grape wine should be allowed to be sold as brandy, other spirit being sold as blended brandy, so. that the public mav not be imposed upon. The recommendation of the Commission in regard to distinctive labels is an admirable one, so far as it goes, but, as the honorable member for Boothby has shown, purchasers do not pay much attention to labels. Behind the proposals to differentiate between the dutv on brandy and the duty on blended brandy is a large producing interest. We have been told by a circular that there are something like 56,000 acres under grape vines in South Australia, and large areas are being, cultivated in Victoria and New South Wales for the production of grapes. The Committee will therefore do well, in adjusting the Customs and Excise duties, to pav attention to the interests of that industry. It seems to me that if the re? commendation of the Tariff Commission is accepted there will not be a sufficient margin in favour of pure brandy to encourage its production, seeing that 75 per cent, of the spirit in blended brandy is distilled from materials other than grape wine, and that there is a public demand for blended brandy. The circular to which I have referred contains the statement that a difference in duty of 2s. in favour of pure brandy will be barely sufficient to give a living wage to those employed in the growing of grapes, and that a difference of 3s. would be better. I shall support the recommendation of the Commission in regard to the labelling of spirits, because, if carried into effect, it will achieve a good end : but I feel that a larger margin than they recommend should be made in favour of pure brandy, to prevent its production from being crushed out by the competition of blended brandy. </para>

                            <para>- I do not look upon it from that stand-point. The proposal appeals to me as being intended to accord fair treatment to the pure brandy distilling industry, and I think that we should do everything we cam to encourage manufacturers to place upon the market an article of superior quality. We should remember that the amount of labour employed in the industry in connexion with which the superior article is produced is much greater than that engaged in the production of the blended brandy. I should like to hear what the members of the Commission may have to say in support of making an even greater distinction between the pure grape brandy and the blended article. </para>

                        (Indi - Attorney-General think the Committee should adopt the proposals of the Government. It is proposed to fix the Excise duty upon pure brandy - - real brandy - at ios., and to impose a duty of 12s. upon what is called blended brandy, but which consists of some product blended with real brandy, and is not a pure brandy. This proposal would tend in the direction not only of encouraging a primary industry of very great magnitude and importance to Australia, but would also promote honesty in trade, and confer a benefit upon the consumers of spirits. The Government proposal is, in accordance with the recommendation of the Commission, to impose an Excise duty of ios. upon brandy distilled wholly from grape wine, and to levy a duty of 12s. upon what is called blended brandy, but which may contain only 25 per cent, of brandy, the remainder being spirit made from some material other than grape wine. Before these proposals were made, how did matters stand? Protection to the extent of 3s. per gallon was granted to pure brandy, and the proposal is to increase the preference to 4s. The increase will, therefore, be equivalent to a 33 per cent, advance upon the previous protection. With respect to the so-called blended brandy, it is intended to double the protection by increasing the preference from is. to 2s. per gallon. Therefore, the proportionate protection: proposed to be given to the inferior article is very much greater than that to be extended to the pure article. I think that the ' Government proposal has everything to commend it. Upon this occasion I find myself in practical accord with the honorable member for Parramatta, and I hope that we shall have many other opportunities of agreeing with each other.

                        <para>.- I have been rather amused by the remarks of some honorable members, who appear to think that, if the proposals of the Commission are adopted, the pure brandy trade of Australia will be ruined. That industry has by no means been failing* even under the present disadvantageous conditions, and I think that it must be obvious that the recommendations of the Commission would, if carried out, bring about a decided improvement. If the pure brandy trade has prospered under existing conditions, it is reasonable to suppose that it will assume still greater proportions in the future. The whole question resolves itself into whether blended brandy may be regarded as a legitimate article of trade. Whilst my sympathies ran in another direction, I must confess that the evidence given before the Commission compelled me to join in the recommendation placed before Parliament. There is very little doubt that blended brandy is a recognised standard article of trade, and is even asked for by people of a particular taste - a taste which may or may not be vitiated. If blended brandy is to' be regarded as a legitimate article of trade, it was obviously the duty of the Commission not to attempt to impose upon the consumers of that product any greater burden by way of duty than upon the consumers of pure brandy. That was what prompted me to give in mv adhesion to the recommendations of the Commission. At the same time, I recognise that, looking at the matter from the national stand-point, tha pure brandy industry is entitled to the utmost consideration that we can give it. Under the circumstances, I shall vote in favour of the recommendation of the Commission j but I quite realize that other honorable members may have the fullest justification for voting otherwise. </para>

                        <para>- - I am quite tired of hearing the honorable and learned member for Parkes urge that we should swallow holus-bolus the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. The Commission were appointed to take evidence and report to Parliament, and it is for us to consider the results of their inquiries. The Commission apparently recommended that the protection previously accorded to the South Australian and New South Wales pure brandy industry should be increased bv 25 per cent., whilst the blended brandy industry of Victoria should have extended to it protection three times as great as that now enjoyed by it. The Government, however, propose that the increase of protection shall be doubled instead of trebled, and the members of the Commission have taken offence because honorable members have ventured to question the justice of their recommendation. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard members of the Commission interjecting, and assisting the honorable and learned member in his arguments. I cannot call to mind one case in which the report, of a Royal Commission in England has been wholly adopted. None of the proposals of the Local Government Commission were adopted in their entirety, whilst the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Coinage were rejected. It is our duty to deliberate upon matters such as those now submitted to us, and I think that we should give the greatest amount of preference to those who manufacture the pure article. The letter read by the honorable member for Parramatta was very much to the point. Messrs. Penfold and Company stated in that communication that five gallons of wine would produce only one gallon of brandy, and that the cost of the spirit from the still was 4s. per gallon. Messrs. Joshua Brothers could obtain is. worth of pure brandy, and blend it with 75 per cent, of other spirit, costing, say, is. 6d., and thus gain an advantage of is. 6d. per gallon over the manufacturers of pure grape spirit. Under the circumstances, I prefer to support the proposal of the Government. Messrs. Joshua Brothers closed down their distillery because they could not manufacture spirit at the same low cost for which it could be produced in New South Wales and Queensland. They threw 140 me.n out of employment, because they found that it would be more to their advantage to import molasses spirit from New South Wales and Queensland, and no doubt they have done a good stroke of business. It must not be assumed, however, that the number of men engaged in the industry has been reduced, because an additional number Have found employment in New South Wales and Queensland by reason of the closing down of Joshua Brothers' works- </para>

                        <para>. - From the point of view of the consumer it is desirable that the Government proposals should be accepted. The consumer requires protection, and I am very glad that a number of honorable members are determined that he shall have it. We can best serve the interests of the consumer by offering to the producers of pure spirit a decided advantage over those who produce blended spirit. The honorable member for Perth has spoken of the necessity which the distillers are under to produce a spirit which will suit certain palates. I am afraid that the palate is more likely to get down to the level of the blend than the blend is likely to rise to the level of the palate. As a result, we shall probably develop amongst our people a taste for spirits which " bite all the way down " - in other words, for blended spirits. A spirit such as would be , recommended by the medical profession does not " bite all the way down," but gets in its work in the way that it is intended to do, and is of great value. But it would be very difficult to trace the effects of a compound which consists of only one-fourth of spirit from .the pure juice of the grape and of three-fourths of some unknown spirit. Blending may be necessary to suit certain palates, but I. think that that process is introduced for the purpose of enabling a compound, which will command a certain sale, to be placed upon the market at a cheap price. </para>

Pot-still brandy, so far as my information goes, is not brandy which passes into general consumption. . Only last night I read a letter which showed that in South Australia an attempt was made to get it into general consumption, but the effort failed. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps after fifty years' experience a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seppelt,</inline> who has one of the best establishments in the world, from the point of view of its up-to-dateness, does not know his business. It is possible that some of the old concerns, such as I have seen in the south of France, may have appliances superior to those which he possesses. My point is that we have expert testimony that brandy distilled by means of the pot still does not pass into general consumption in Australia, because the public will not have it. The brandy which is put upon the market as a blended brandy is made up of 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit, the balance being rectified spirit of the grape. What we want to do is to preserve a distinction between the brandy which is so made wholly from the pure wine spirit and that which consists of only 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit made by the pot still, the balance being composed of the rectified spirit of other materials. I suggest that we should retain the duty upon spirit n.e.i. at 14s. per gallon. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo argues that if we fix the Excise duty upon brandy which' is distilled wholly from, grape wine by a pot still or similar process at us. per gallon, and that upon blended brandy at 12s. per gallon, and if we levy an Excise of 14s. per gallon upon spirit n.e.i., which will include molasses, we shall be charging the last-named the same rate that is imposed upon imported spirits. If 'we wish to overcome that difficulty, I suggest that we should fix the Excise duty upon brandy distilled wholly from grape wine at ios. per gallon, that upon blended brandy at us. per gallon, and that upon spirit n.e.i. at 13s. per gallon. We shall thus differentiate sufficiently in favour of pure grape spirit, and attain the object of the honorable and learned member. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very reluctant to depart from any unanimous recommenda-tion of the Tariff Commission, and would only do so if I thought that the case made out for an alteration of any such recommendation had not been sufficiently answered. So far I do not think that we have had a sufficient reason given for the different treatment which the Commission recommended should be accorded to brandy distilled wholly from grape wine and brandy which, is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials. If it be a fact that the former article is a more wholesome one, in addition to being a more legitimate article, I would extend a preference to it much more readily than I would offer a preference to one particular set of manufacturers as against another set of manufacturers. I would grant a preference for purity and wholesomeness much more readily than I would a mere protective preference. If it be admitted - and the Tariff Commission appears to acknowledge it - that pure grape brandy is a better article than is blended brandy, there is good reason why we should make a distinction which would encourage its consumption. The distinction which existed when the Tariff Commission dealt with this matter was greater than that which would be made under its own recommendations. For instance, the Commission recommends a reduction of the Excise duty upon spirits distilled wholly from grape wine of is. per gallon as against a decrease in the Excise duty upon blended brandy of 2s. per gallon. That is a difference of 100 per cent. Unless reason can be shown to the contrary, it seems to me that the effect of adopting the recommendations of the Commission would be to discourage the use of the purer and more wholesome article. The honorable member for Parramatta stated - and I think that the honorable and learned member for Parkes took him up wrongly in this connexion- </para>

                            <para>- I think that the honorable and learned member misunderstood the honorable member for Parramatta, who believed that there was a marked difference iri the cost of production, and used the figures in question merely to support that opinion. The evidence and the knowledge that I have obtained from other sources leads me to believe that the cost of producing pure grape wine brandy is considerably higher than is the cost of producing the blended article. If that be <inline font-style="italic">so,</inline> and any encouragement is to be given to the pure article, a sufficient margin must Le allowed' between the Excise duty on the two. It has not been proved to my satisfaction that that encouragement will be given if the difference that has previously existed be reduced. I am anxious to support the recommendation of the Commission, but if I cannot be convinced on that point, I shall have to support the proposal of the Government to allow a greater difference. I do not think that sufficient reason has been shown for reducing the Excise on grape brandy by is. per gallon, and reducing the Excise on blended  brandy  bv  2s.  per gallon.. </para>

                        QUICK (Bendigo) [10.1 81. - I wish to deal as briefly as possible with one or two points that have been raised. In the first place, the honorable and learned member for Parkes asked why the Commission had recommended a protection of 4s. per gallon in respect of brandy distilled wholly from grape wine, and of 3s. per gallon in respect of blended brandy. The reason is that the blend was to consist partly of grape wine spirit and partly of spirit obtained from- other materials, but was to comprise mot less than 25 per cent, of pure wine spirit. As a matter of practice, a blend may consist of spirits derived from molasses, grain, or other distilling material. Too much stress has been laid upon the fact that cheap molasses costing only 9d. a gallon is, or will be, used in blending. As a matter of fact molasses spirit is not exclusively used for that purpose. According to the evidence it is sometimes used, but grain spirit is also employed. Honorable members will see on turning to page 24, paragraph 3, of the report, that the grain spirit which mav be so used costs from 2s. 9d. to 2s. nd. per gallon. That being so, the average cost of spirit used for blending, instead of 9d. per gallon, is more likely to be is. 6d. or 2s. per gallon.

                            <para>- Grape spirit costs about 4s. per gallon. When, we require that for blending purposes 25 per cent, of grape spirit shall at least be used, and that the rest of the blend shall comprise spirit made from grain or molasses, we must recognise that the cost of the blending material will certainly be more than 9c!. per gallon. The Commission thought that a fair, rough and ready calculation showed that it would be sufficient to give blended spirit an advantage of is. per gallon less than that enjoyed by the pure article. In dealing with a question of this kind the measure of protection cannot be indicated with mathematical or logical certainty. The calculation made by the Commission was a rough and ready one, based upon the difference in the cost of the materials used, and upon the supposition that sometimes 50 per cent, or 75 per cent., instead of 25 per cent., of grape spirit might be employed. I submit that our estimate that a difference of is. is sufficient to allow is just as likely to be correct as is any other estimate that has been put before the Committee. It is based upon evidence, but it appears that our conclusion is to be rejected. If it is we shall not be responsible, but shall bow respectfully to the decision of the Committee. I should like to point out further that the recommendation to allow a difference of only is. and a protection of 3s. per gallon, as against the protection of 4s. per gallon in the case of the pure standard brandy, is based upon evidence that the raw material out of which the blended brandy is to be made may not average od. per gallon, but more like 2s. per gallon. I think' that is sufficient to justify our recommendation. However, the question is an arguable one, and its final decision rests with the Committee. Ap'parently under the guidance of the Committee the House will propose to reduce from 3s. to 2s. per gallon! the protection which we recommend should be given to blended spirit. In reply to the point raised by the honorable member for Coolgardie, I should like to mention that the words " similar process " were inserted after the words "brandy distilled wholly from grape wine bv a pot still," so as not to exclude the Coffey patent still which is used in some of the great distilleries in the States. They were designed to allow the use of the patent still, provided it be so managed as to yield results substantially similar to those obtained from the use of the pot still. Bv means of the pot still spirit is distilled in such a way as to retain the natural ethers or the natural volatile elements and characteristics of the true brandy or whisky. It was admitted by most of the witnesses that when run at high pressure and strength, the patent, still will not yield that result, but that it may be so managed that it will do so. We do not wish to exclude the patent still. In settling the wording of this clause, 1 consulted a trusted Excise officer who assured me that these words will not exclude the patent still provided that it is so managed as to yield results substantially , similar to those obtained from the pot still. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to briefly state my views with respect to this question. There should be no conflict of opinion as to the difference between brandy made from wine and that made from other materials to which reference was made in the evidence given before the Habitual Drunkards Board appointed by the Victorian Government in 1898'. Among the witnesses examined by the Board were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daniel</inline> Ferguson, Chief Inspector of Distilleries, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archibald</inline> Wm. Smart, senior landing surveyor, the one having thirty-five years' experience and the other an experience extending over something like twenty-one years. It was shown clearly by those witnesses that only one-third of the whiskies and. brandies then imported into Victoria were the pure spirits their names represented them to be; that another third consisted of a mixture of brandy and whisky with silent spirit ; and that the remaining third consisted qf silent spirit blended with essences which, in their concentrated form, were generally virulent poisons. What is protection to the manufacturer is protection to the consumer, and the Government deserve the support of every loyal protectionist in their attempt fo protect the consumer by giving an impetus to the manufacture of brandy from wine and of whisky from malt. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart,</inline> when giving evidence before the Habitual Drunkards Commission, said - </para>

                            <para>- My only desire was to show that we have been fully alive to the fact that spirit can be produced cheaply from molasses. The honorable member for Perth interjected, when the honorable member for Laanecoorie was quoting the <inline font-style="italic">Lancet</inline> as an authority upon the purity of brandy distilled from grape spirit, that the brandy produced in that district of France from which we. obtain the <inline font-style="italic">Fin Champagne</inline> is equal to the best that is made in Australia. I would remind the honorable member, however, that the price of such brandy practically prohibits its use in hospitals and like institutions. </para>

                            <para>- There is a good deal of force in that statement. A body of experts has expressed an opinion favorable to Australian brandy as against that produced elsewhere. When the authorities of the British Army obtained samples of brandies they were unable, of course, to think of purchasing the high-priced French brandy to which I have just referred. Those brandies could not compete with Australian brandies. In the country 7s. 6d. a bottle is charged for Hennessey's brandy, though no one will say that it is a spirit distilled wholly from grape wine. On the other hand, there can be obtained in Bendigo, at 3s. 3d. a bottle, a brandy distilled wholly from grape wine, which any medical man would say is far more valuable for medicinal purposes. In America, according to the expert whore evidence I have just quoted, spirit which is to be used medicinally must have been matured for at least two years. It will be admitted that blending leaves the door open for adulteration, and no honorable member desires that either the food or the drink of the people shall be adulterated. I should like to see a greater amount of protection given to the distilling of pure grape brandy and pure malt whisky ; but, as that cannot be obtained, I shall, as a protectionist, accept what the Government offer. I wish to pay my meed of praise to the Tariff Commissioners, who have devoted great energy and talent to the task intrusted to them. A long experience of Commissions in Victoria leads me almost to support the view of the German cynic, that, if the Lord had placed the making of the earth in the hands of a Commission, it would never have been made, or, if made, would have been a botch. I have no fault to find with the present Commission ; but I wish to point out to its members - and I hope that they will take the remark in good temper - that they cannot be allowed to " boss " the Committee. It is within the region of possibility that, to suit a certain type of politician - such as, thank Heaven, we have not yet produced in Australia - a Government may appoint a Commission to give a one-sided report, and, if such a Commission were allowed to dominate Parliament, it would be a very serious matter. Therefore, I shall resent very strongly any attempts to force the opinions of any Commission on honorable members. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not think that the compromise suggested by the honorable and learned member for Angas will carry him any further forward. If the duty upon blended brandy is reduced to lis., we shall not provide for a sufficient differentiation between pure grape wine brandy and blended brandy. It would simplify matters very much if a special paragraph were inserted, dealing with brandy made from grape wine spirit, as contrasted with blended brandy made of grape spirit and of spirit distilled from other materials. I cannot agree to accept a reduction of the duty upon blended brandy to 11s., because that would place the manufacturers of pure grape wine brandy at a disadvantage. </para>

                        <para>With reference to the constituents of blended brandy, we are of opinion that no spirit should be regarded as a blended brandy unless it contains 25 per cent, of true brandy, the product of grape wine, the result of a separate distillation at a low alcoholic strength; the balance may be patent-still spirits from any approved material. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members will see that the Commission recommend that spirits used for blending shall be made from approved material. They apparently came to the conclusion that certain kinds of spirits should not be used for blending with brandy. I fully agree with that view. No doubt the Commissioners had it in their minds to preclude the use of cheap spirit made from molasses. I am afraid that if manufacturers were permitted to use molasses spirit for blending purposes the distillers of pure brandy in South Australia would be entirely shut out of the market. Spirit made from molasses should be used only for making rum, or for the purposes of methylization In the United States the bulk of the molasses spirit is methylated, and nearly one-half of the molasses spirit produced in the Commonwealth last year was similarly treated. </para>

                            <para>- No, but because it could be more profitably used for industrial purposes. If we were to permit the use of molasses spirit for blending purposes, pure grape brandy would be entirely shut out of the market. ' The manufacturers of brandy would have to buy cheap spirit for blending purposes, and would have to turn out an inferior article. In fact it would destroy the trade entirely, and that is the reason why I propose to exclude molasses. It would mean not only that the manufacturers would have to sell inferior brandy, but that a very large acreage which is under vines at the present time would be rendered practically valueless. It would mean the ruin of some hundreds of vignerons, and great injury would be done to thousands who are engaged in the industry. I should like to point out to honorable members that we have not merely to consider the persons who are actually employed in the processes of distillation. The industry indirectly employs many hundreds of growers, harrowers, pickers, and carters. </para>

                        <para>. - Before the honorable member actually submits his proposal, perhaps he will allow me to make a suggestion which may simplify our procedure. I have been consulting the Chairman of the Tariff Commission and various other honorable members upon this matter, with a view to solving the difficulty which confronts us. The suggestion which has been made, and which the officers of the Department regard as quite a workable one, is that we should introduce another item relating to brandy between items 1 and 2. In the first place, it is suggested that upon brandy which is distilled wholly from grape wine by a pot still the Excise duty shall' be 10s. per gallon. It is then suggested that we might introduce into these resolu-tions a blended brandy which has been distilled from grape wine " containing not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit, which has been separately distilled by a pot still or similar process at a strength not exceeding 40 degrees over-proof, the whole being matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, and certified bv an officer to be brandy so- blended and matured." The duty upon this article might be 11s. per gallon. Honorable members will notice that the whole of this blended brandy would have to be distilled from grape wine, though only 25 per cent, of it must be distilled bv means of a pot still. Then it is suggested that blended brandy distilled partly from grape wine and partly from grain should bear a duty of 12s. per gallon. </para>

                            <para>- It does not satisfy me. If honorable members will turn to progress report No. 2 of the Tariff Com mission, under the heading of " Spirits and the Distillation of Spirits," they will find that brandy which is made entirely from wine spirit is to have an advantage conferred upon it by being labelled " Pure Australian Standard Brandy." If honorable members turn to the next paragraph they will see that another class of brandy, which is to be blended with a different spirit - and this is why I wish to prevent the use of molasses spirit for blending purposes - is to be labelled "Australian blended brandy." That will be very confusing. If we are to allow a blend containing only 25 per cent. of grape spirit to be placed on the market we should not permit it to be described as brandy. </para>

                            <para>- I object to molasses spirit being used in blending. If a blend containing only 25 per cent. of pure grape spirit is to be labelled " Australian blended brandy," it* should bear a statement to the effect that it contains only 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit. The public would then know what they were buying, and a blend so described would find but few purchasers. I do not think that honorable members recognise the full significance of the Prime Minister's proposal. His object is a good one, but I do not think that he proposes to go far enough. There is no reason why we should permit a blend which contains only 25 per cent. of pure grape spirit to be labelled "brandy." </para>

                        <para>.- The view of the honorable member that grape spirit only should be used in the production of brandy is worthy of commendation ; but whilst I think that the nature of a blend should be clearly stated on the label, I have vet to learn that it is undesirable to be able to obtain a good article at a low price. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I fully recognise the care which the Commission has bestowed on its work, and the extent of the expert evidence given before it; but I think that it is, to say the least, singular if the opinions of its members can be swayed by the fact that certain honorable members have not risen to protest against the exclusion of molasses spirit. If the Commission are sure of their facts, surely it should make no difference to them whether 10 or 100. men oppose their proposal. It has no evidence that is opposed to the manufacture of spirit from molasses, and I hold that we should not penalize such a spirit because of its cheapness. </para>

                        <para>. - My point is that if spirit produced from grain, molasses, or any other material containing sugar is declared to be unwholesome we ought to exclude it,' but that we ought not to exclude a spirit which is not less wholesome than any grain spirit which may be blended with grape spirit and sold as brandy. I agree with the honorable member for Hindmarsh that if we decide that brandy shall be only that which is the product of the grape, we should exclude grain and all other spirit ; but since we are prepared to allow a mixture of grape spirit with spirit distilled from wheat or any other grain to be described as "blended brandy," I fail to see why we should exclude the use of molasses spirit for the same purpose, unless it can be shown that it is less wholesome. There seem to be only two logical courses open to us. We must either provide that nothing shall be labelled as " brandy " except that which is the product of the grape, or if we are to allow a blending of grape and other spirits to be described as blended brandy, we should not prevent any spirit being so used except on the ground of its being deleterious. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the result will be that the more cheaply produced stuff will compete with the other, and the general public will not trouble much what it is distilled from. They will only, know that it is called brandy, without troubling much whether it is made from grain, grapes, or anything else. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission shows that the public taste is hit by a blend more than by the genuine stuff. The popular brandy is a blended brandy, and it is just possible that we may have a blended brandy that will taste just as well as a better' kind. The more logical course to take would be, if we intend to exclude brandy made from molasses from being officially called brandy, to prevent it going on to the market, as a drink at all. If it is vicious stuff, exclude it from consumption! ; rule it out altogether. If the Government intends to adopt this classification it certainly ought to go further, because, as now proposed to us, it seems to me that it will only be making things worse. The stuff which is not genuine brandy should be ruled out of the market as a drink altogether. </para>

                        <para>. - I feel, of course, that we are submitting a proposal which requires a good deal of further consideration. At present we are dealing with a schedule, which, if agreed to, becomes a schedule to a Bill yet to be submitted. If on further examination honorable members think that there is any imperfection in the proposal, they will still have it in their power to remedy it. The Committee can add just what it pleases. We are dealing here with the titles which we propose to confer upon certain liquids. We refer to blended wine brandy and grain brandy. But other brandies are not excluded. </para>

                            <para>- That can be done, but it will not be possible for manufacturers to apply those names which are appropriated by Act, and for which labels are assigned, to other brandy. Outside these brandy may be made from any spirit whatever, if it is matured for two years in the wood. There is nothing but the taste and judgment of the public to guide them as to which liquor they will consume. We start with brandy at ios., wine brandy us., grain brandy 12s. ; and then we come to all the other brandies or whiskies from whatever they may be manufactured. </para>

                            <para>- No one has ever been refused the right to attach the name brandy to whatever he wishes to sell as brandy ; but it rests with the public to say whether they will buy it or will not. That liberty is not diminished in the slightest degree by what we propose; but such brandies cannot be sold under the special titles that will be legalized. There are to be labels authorized by the Act, and I will ask honorable members to wait until they see the Bill and the labels before they decide that there is any unfairness in what is proposed. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that, owing to the new proposal which the Government has made, it is appropriate that we should adjourn now, so that we may have an opportunity of considering the scheme. The proposal is entirely new. It has not been even hinted at by that celebrated Commission whose investigations were supposed to reach to the last of these important matters. The proposal appears to me to be inequitable, because it excludes a certain spirit without naming it. I care nothing as to what the Committee may decide in a direct, open, and straightforward manner, but we ought not to hide our meaning in a cloud of words which would be interpreted to mean one thing and one thing only. If we mean to exclude spirit made from molasses or from any grains, let us state that clearly and be done with it ; but I shall not support the Government proposal drafted as it is. </para>

                            <para>- Potato spirit only. I submit that we ought to hear the members of the Tariff Commission on this point. If the members of that body, who have said so much about their report and declared that they would not have it interfered with, are supporting this proposal, I am surprised at their attitude. I hold that an alteration of this kind should be made at a time when it could receive fuller consideration. </para>

                        <para>.- When I interjected about distilling in New South Wales prior to Federation, T thought that my memory was not quite so much at fault as the extract quoted by the honorable member for Wide Bay would perhaps lead one to believe. The extract is quite correct as it was quoted, but I find that just prior to Federation distillation had ceased in the State owing to the fact that the Excise and import duties had been made equal. Some years prior to Federation, however, the distilleries of the State were producing a great deal of spirit, and I had that fact in mind when I spoke. No doubt the honorable member for Wide Bay is correct in saying that the difference between; the Excise and Customs duties imposed by the Federal Tariff have had a beneficial effect on the distilling industry of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, because it is desired to give a special degree of protection to spirits produced from materials which are a great deal more costly than molasses or potatoes. For this reason, the Excise duty on pure grape spirit has been made as low as ios. The action of the Committee in agreeing to that duty was an admission of the principle that we are justified in giving special consideration to spirits distilled from costly material. So far as the preservation of the public health is concerned, it is said by some that a blended grain whisky is as wholesome as a pure malt, whisky. I see nothing to prevent the distillers of molasses spirit from placing it on the market, though if they do so they must pay an Excise duty of 13s. They will not be able to call it by any of the names mentioned in the schedule, but they could do as Messrs. Joshua Brothers do in naming their spirit merely " Boomerang." Provision is made for the use of the terms "pure Australian brandy," "pure Australian malt whisky," "blended wine brandy," and "blended grain whisky." </para>

                        <para>. - I take objection to this proposal, not on account of the difference made in the Excise duty, as that may be met by the cheapness with which this spirit is distilled, but because it is sought to prohibit the use of spirit which is not shown to be more harmful than the spirit which is allowed. If the distinction which is attempted to be made is drawn, it seems to me that the Excise Department may prevent spirit made in the northern States from being labelled " blended sugar brandy." They may say, "You shall not call this spirit brandy, because the Excise Act allows the application of the term brandy to certain specified spirits only. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to say a word in regard to a- development which is taking place throughout Australia to-day, and is out of keeping with the arguments used in this Chamber last session by honorable members of the Opposition. ' When the Arbitration Bill was under discussion the members of the Opposition wished to provide that the funds of trade organizations should not be used for political purposes; but to-day it is alleged that thousands of pounds have been contributed by the Tobacco Trust, the shipping ring, and various big firms in Sydney, to a fund which the members of the Opposition are shepherding, and which is being used by them when travelling, through the country with their wives, in the endeavour to wrest from the Government at the next elections the reins of office. This is the most scandalous piece of work that has ever affected a Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable and learned member for Parkes were here, he would silence the honorable member. I understand that he has already taken some of the starch out of him. This is one of the most scandalous proceedings that has ever taken place in connexion with any parliamentary party. The leader of the Opposition is travelling through the country, utilizing the large funds placed at his command for the purpose of injuring honorable members who are here, attending to their public duties. Other honorable members who are rarely in this Chamber are spending their time - and it is alleged are being well paid for so doing - in performing propaganda work, instead of attending in this House, and looking after the interests of their constituents. </para>

I might say that statements are appearing in the press that levies, which must represent a very large sum, are being made upon thousands of men. So far as my knowledge goes, the honorable member's statements are quite incorrect - that is the strongest parliamentary term that- 1 am permitted to use. Although in every contest funds have to be spent upon electoral campaign work bv every party, no unusual expenditure is being incurred, upon the present occasion, </para>

                        <para>.- I was also connected as treasurer with a large organization in New . South Wales, and I wish to say that, to the best of my knowledge, the statements which the honorable member for Gwydir has made are absolutely incorrect, so far as that organization is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- The Australian Liberal League. The honorable member is a working man, and the representative of working men. The statements we have just listened to are founded upon such slender authority that they lead me to suppose that the honorable member has served his apprenticeship in the workshops of calumny. </para>
