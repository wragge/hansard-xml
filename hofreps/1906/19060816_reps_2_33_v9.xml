The consequences might have been most serious if we had accepted obligations in regard to the action of officials who were not directly responsible to us. In accordance with a promise made a day or two ago, the papers in the case are being obtained from Sydney, and will be laid on the table in the Library, so that honorable members may satisfy themselves that justice has been done. </para>

                        <para>- Because it is intended to exclude beetroot, potato, and sugar spirit. As the honorable member may know, grain spirit costs from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per gallon to produce, whereas molasses spirit costs only10d. or1s. Spirit can also be made from various fruits at very low cost. Partly for this reason, and partly because it is contended by some experts - although there is a conflict of opinion) - that the grain spirit is not only more expensive, but is purer and better than the other spirits referred to, it is proposed to adjust the duties. </para>

                    <para>. - As far as I have been able to see the proposed new classification is, on the whole, an excellent one, but I wish to make a brief allusion to the probable consequences of the classification. In the first place, the word " grain " extends over a very wide range. For instance, it would include rice and rye, and I am told that some very deleterious compounds are manufactured from those classes of grain. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that maize spirit is not so harmful as that distilled from rice or rye. If we grouped pure wine spirit and grain spirit, we should exclude molasses, potato, and other kinds of spirits, which I take it for granted would be grouped under the head of spirits n.e.i., and would be dutiable at 13s. But whilst we should be excluding these inferior spirits from the classification now before us, we should not prohibit their use, and as a result a large quantity of inferior brandy would be placed upon the market in competition with the purer article. The1s. difference in the Excise duty between blended grain spirit and spirit n.e.i. would not compensate the manufacturers of the former for the extra cost they would have to incur, as compared with that involved in turning out the inferior classes of spirits. There would probably be a difference in the cost of production amounting to several shillings per gallon. And thus we should have a cheap inferior spirit placed upon the market, which I am afraid would to a great extent take the place of the purer article. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it is fair to assume that after twelve months of strict inquiry they were fully informed. I cannot conceive of their adopting a principle of classification such as they have followed without going thoroughly into the question of the purity or otherwise of molasses and every other kind of spirit. They have, at any rate, adopted a classification which assumes that some kinds of spirits are inferior to others, that molasses and potato spirit, for instance, are inferior to grape spirit. In amplifying the classification adopted by the Commission, the Government are really confirming that principle. My point is, however, that, although we are excluding the cheaper classes of spirit from the classification now under consideration, we shall not prohibit their consumption. </para>

It seems inevitable that the market will be flooded if an inferior class of spirit, which can be' produced very cheaply, indeed, for almost nothing, and which will come into competition with the superior spirit proposed to be classified in the paragraphs! now under consideration. That is the difficulty that I foresee, and it is a very serious one. I should like to hear if the Customs officials have any information they can offer upon this point. </para>

                    <para>.- Since this question was under consideration last evening, I have, in common with other honorable members, given it some attention, and it has been borne in upon me that it would be altogether unwise for us to put the official seal of the Commonwealth upon spirit purporting to be brandy, but which is not brandy. We have to consider the effect of the proposed classification, not only upon the spirits put upon the market for local consumption, but upon those intended for export. We have, perhaps, the greatest area of wine-growing country in the world, and there is every prospect of our being able to develop a splendid export trade in brandy. I understand that one of the South Australian distillers is already exporting to I ranee large quantities of pure .grape brandy, which is no doubt being matured there, and sold as French brandy. That being so, it seems that if we officially labelled as brandy spirits which are made to the extent of three-parts from grain, we should prejudice the sale of' our pure wine brandy. Even though spirit were called grain brandy, the fact that it was put forth bearing a Commonwealth. Customs label, certifying that it was brandy, would tend to prejudice the sale of the real brandy that might be exported. Therefore, the third paragraph proposed by the Government does not commend itself to me. I understand that it has never been the practice anywhere to blend grain spirit with wine spirit, but that molasses spirit is mixed with wine spirit in the brandy of commerce. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, ' the spirit has to be highly rectified. It is said that grain spirit has characteristics which do not accord with those of wine spirit, and that for that reason a blend of the two spirits is not likely to suit the tastes of the multitude. In any case, the main objection that occurs to me is that it is unwise to class as brandy anything but the product of the grape. If we desire to engender confidence in the brandy which bears the official label of the Commonwealth, we should reject paragraph 3, and subject blends such as are therein indicated to an Excise duty of 13s. per gallon. We must remember that we have fixed the import duty at 14s. per gallon, and that some of us believe that that will result in a loss of revenue. It is certain that a further loss of revenue would be incurred if we fixed the Excise duty upon the class of spirits referred to in paragraph 3 at 12 s. per gallon. I am willing to extend a* fair degree of protection to the producers of good brandy, or malt whisky, but I do not see any particular reason why something which would injure our brandy trade should receive special consideration. For these reasons I am inclined to vote against paragraph No. 3, and place the spirits therein indicated under the head of spirits n.e.i., which will be subject to a duty of 13s. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The term " brandy " is a misnomer when applied to any other than grape spirit. Honorable members may know that the term " brandy" is of German extraction, and means burnt wine. Therefore, in essence, brandy is wine, and any spirit made from grain cannot correctly be designated brandy. If we place the Commonwealth stamp of approval upon mixtures of grape spirit and grain' spirit, we shall probably create a false impression in the minds of consumers. Very few persons who drink brandy take the trouble to inquire as to the constituents of the liquor. They take it for granted when they see " brandy " on the label that they are getting brandy. whereas, under the proposed Government indorsed qualified descriptions they will be getting spirit which cannot, in any sense, be called brandy. The Government should not lend themselves to any such deception. I do not think we should use the word "brandy" in connexion with the term "blended," except when it is applied to spirit distilled from .grape wine. If we are going to adopt any distinctive label for what are erroneously termed blended brandies, that is to say, for beverages which are composed partly of grape wine spirit and partly of grain .spirit, we should employ .some such term as " snake-juice," and add to the description " rank poison." Then we could feel assured that the consumers would know what they were drinking. If they have a fair idea of the character of the . beverage which they are consuming we shall probably find that the demand for that -class of spirit will fall off very considerably. </para>

                    <para>.- I was rather surprised1 to learn that the term " brandy " could be applied to any spirit other than that which is produced from grape wine. With regard to the attitude which has- been taken up bv the honorable member for Bland. I think that we have to consider the quality of the brandy which is imported. </para>

When the honorable member was speaking it struck me that if we do not permit brandy which is locally produced from other than grape spirit to be designated by that term, we should also prevent imported spirit of the same kind from coming into competition with grape wine brandy. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the term "blend" in these resolutions is not used in the way in which it has been previously employed. The particular article under discussion seems to me to be a mixture rather than a blend. For instance, a Scotch blend of whisky is generally a blend of the spirit of two distilleries made from the same material. </para>

                        <para>- Of course the term "blend" does mean simply a mixture of various kinds. If we admit that whisky may be made partly from malt spirit and partly from grain, we must also admit that brandy may be produced in the same way. I think that the difficulty can be overcome when the Bill is introduced by giving a more distinctive name to each of these articles. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that that course is necessary. When the Bil], in which these resolutions will be embodied, is brought forward, I think that the article referred to in item No. 1 of the Excise proposals, should be called "pure Australian grape brandy," because I am of opinion that a name should carry its own interpretation. The other brandies might then be called " blended brandies." The recommendation of the. Commission is that brandy which is distilled wholly from grape wine should be called " Australian standard brandy." But the term "standard," I would point out, does not convey any particular meaning to the ordinary individual. After hearing the remarks of the honorable member for Bland. I recognise that a difficulty exists in differentiating between this article and imported brandy. The Tariff Commission, so far as I understand, did not arrive at any conclusion as to how the brandies which are imported are produced. They simply decided that the best French brandies are not introduced into Australia. They were not able to elicit any satisfactory information as to the materials from which the imported brandies which are in use in Australia, are produced. We shall be doing an injustice to those who are engaged in the local production of grape brandies if we allow a blended article to be sold here in competition with them. The local distillers of pure grape brandy believe that they can compete with any article which is imported. I shall return, however, to this matter when the Bill embodying these resolutions is under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- The Commission has laid it down that where we depart from a brandy which) is produced wholly from grape wine we' must not impose any restriction whatever upon the distillers. I do not object to the vignerons seeking to obtain the full advantage to be derived from the production of a pure grape brandy. But why. is an agitation set up in favour of grain brandy ? Whoever heard of a grain brandy? </para>

                        <para>- Some persons appear to be more expert in draftsmanship than they are in describing an article to which they wish to render a service. Underlying the whole of this manoeuvring, or finessing, is the determination not to allow spirit to be produced from a certain commodity, which is known as molasses. I ask the Government whether it is a manly policy to give expression to that determination in this way ? It has been intimated by a few honorable members that if spirit is permitted to be distilled from grain, there will be a large increase in the production of grain. I hold that no man with common sense will believe a statement of that character. </para>

He says, " If we allow spirit produced from other than grape wine to be used in brandy, let us impose a higher duty upon it." But why single out grain spirit for special treatment? I am satisfied that the Government have a reason for so doing. The Attorney-General indicated that reason last night. He believed that a large consumption of grain would lead to the opening up of new country, and to that article realizing a higher price. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable member think that that is the idea underlying this movement? I know perfectly well that it is not. The whole purpose of the Government is to exclude another spirit. I say that it is beneath contempt for Parliament to attempt anything of the kind. I have yet to learn' that it is wicked to produce a good article cheaply. If it be good and plentiful that fact should be recognised. I say, " Tax it to the full extent that it should be taxed, but do not differentiate against it merely because it is good and cheap." For this reason, I ask the Committee not to adopt the Government proposal, but to indorse the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, which has devoted so much attention to these matters, and which has presented its conclusions in a most definite form.- </para>

                        <para>- That is quite another question. Personally, I am of opinion that spirituous liquors are very fair subjects for taxation. I trust that the Committee will support the recommendation of the Tariff Commission in this connexion. I should like to indicate to honorable members the wav in which this proposal will be put. I presume that the Chairman will put it in the form, " That the rate of duty recommended by the Commission stand part of the schedule," and that all those who are in favour of the proposal of the Commission will then have to sav " Aye." </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. When I said that, in arriving at this decision, the Commission must have had in mind the exclusion of molasses and potato spirit, no denial came from any member of that body. As a matter of fact, the chairman has agreed to the proposal. I am satisfied that the House would not allow a mixture of 25 per cent, of tea and 75 per cent, of some other substance that was not injurious to health to be sold as " tea," and I hold that a mixture of 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit with 75 per cent, of some other spirit should not be described as brandy, At the proper time I shall move that the word " brandy," which occurs in two places in this paragraph, shall be left out, and it will then be open to any honorable member to move the insertion of any other word or words. My own proposal is that the word " spirits " be substituted for brandy. I do not know who is in charge of this Bill ; it seems to be left to take care of itself. </para>

                        <para>- It is an absolutely fair statement. I desire to obtain from the Government some information with regard to certain spirits, and, in the absence of the Prime Minister, I do not know to whom to appeal. I understand that it is the desire of the Government, as well as of the Committee, that only wholesome spirits shall be supplied to the public. I believe, however - and it is on this point that I seek information from the Government - that wine spirit and also other spirit 65 per cent, over-proof is being manufactured into bogus rum and whisky. It is said to be flavoured with essences and adulterated1 with colouring matter after it leaves the control of the Customs Department. It is necessary, when we are dealing with the whole question of the spirit duties, to consider the best steps to take for the protection of the public. So far as brandy is1 concerned, we can readily protect the consumer by providing that only that which is distilled from the pure grape shall be so described. I should like to know whether the Government have any information supporting my statement that highly-coloured inferior spirits are being sold as genuine whisky, rum, and so forth? If this is being done, manufacturers of pure rum and whisky must be seriously handicapped, and I hope that the Government will be . able to supply us with some information on the- subject. </para>

                    <para>. - A very fine Federal spirit permeated the last two speeches to which honorable members have listened. In the first place, the honorable member for Hindmarsh is very anxious that grape spirit shall alone be used in the manufacture of brandy, whilst the honorable member for Wide Bay desires that a blended brandy in which the molasses spirit produced in Queensland is largely used shall go into general consumption. I sympathize to a considerable extent with the honorable member for Hindmarsh, since, if there be any justification for the proposal made by the honorable member for Bland, we ought certainly to provide that only brandy produced from pure wine spirit shall be sold as brandy. I was sorry to hear the honorable member for Wide Bay assert that the action of the Committee in proposing to confine the use of molasses spirit to blended grain brand v was "beneath contempt," for such a term should not be employed to describe any action on the part of this Chamber. I am prepared, when occasion demands it, to use strong language, but it does not appear to me that -the honorable member for Wide Bay is justified in his excitement and zeal about this proposal to exclude molasses spirit from blended wine brandy. He was scarcely fair in urging that one of the component parts of that blend should be spirits distilled from molasses. As a matter of fact, he wholly ignored the question of cost. According to figures supplied bv importers, the estimated cost of wine spirit is 4s. per gallon ; that of malt spirit is, 3s. 2d. per gallon; grain spirit, is. 9d. per gallon; and molasses spirit only 6d. per gallon. </para>

There is no justification for placing grain spirit and molasses spirit on the same footing. If we are to differentiate, we ought to do so in favour of the honest spirit produced from grain.

I trust, however, that the Committee will not be misled and induced to adopt the course which lie has suggested. If we are to have a differentiation in favour of pure wine spirit, then we ought to have some regard to the question of cost, and in the case of blended brandy should give the greater preference to brandy consisting largely of pure grain spirit. </para>

                    <para>.- I am extremely surprised that the Committee failed to agree immediately to the proposal submitted by the Government. It seems to be, from every point of view, a most desirable one. If adopted," it will give support to one of our chief products : it will afford a market for the produce of our wine-growers, and, at the same time, will enable us to see that, as far as possible, only pure brandy is offered to the public. We cannot possibly insure to the consumers an absolutely good spirit, for, in the last resort, supervision over the retail houses is necessary to bring about that result. We can, however, absolutely provide that the spirit imported into Australia, and that locally produced, shall be correctly described, so that the people will know what they are drinking. We should also provide that if a man be supplied with that for which he does not ask, the vendor shall be liable to punishment. I am surprised that the honorable member for Wide Bay should have complained so bitterly of the proposal to exclude molasses spirit from blended grain brandy. The arguments are against his contention. The honorable member for Coolgardie has aptly pointed out the difference between the cost of grape spirit and molasses spirit. The cost of the material used in the production of grape spirit is equal to about 2s. 6d. per gallon. Five gallons of wine are required to make one gallon of spirit, and if the vignerons are to receive anything like fair remuneration, that wine cannot be obtained at less than 6d. per gallon, and in' many cases 8d. per gallon has to be paid. Twenty lbs. of maize are required for the distillation of a gallon of proof spirit, and, as maize to-day costs 3s. 6d. a bushel, the cost of maize spirit is about 1s. 3½d. per gallon. </para>

                        <para>- Twenty-five lbs. of wheat are required for the distillation of a gallon of proof spirit, which, at 3s. 4d. a bushel for the wheat, makes the cost of the spirit is. 4d. Oats is rarely used by itself for distillation purposes, being generally mixed with other grain to make the wort come away more freely, 27 lbs. being required for the distillation of a gallon of proof spirit. Twenty-five lbs. of barley are required for the distillation of a gallon of proof spirit, which, at 3s. 6d. a bushel for the barley, makes the price of the spirit 1s. 9d. Of malted barley, 34 lbs. are required for the distillation of a gallon of proof spirit, which therefore costs about 2s. 11d. Good molasses, however, can be obtained for from 30s. to 35s. a ton, so that the cost of a gallon of proof spirit made from that material would be between 3d. and 4d. This is the spirit which the honorable member for Wide Bay wishes to foist upon the drinkers of this country. But is it consistent to treat spirit made from cheap material in the same way as spirit made from dear material ? The proposal of the Government is absolutely just and fair. It is calculated to provide good liquor for the people, and to assist a primary industry, and I shall support it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The distillation of spirit in Queensland is now very great, and I am certain that all the molasses spirit made in that State is not used for blending purposes. As a matter of fact, a great deal of it is used for industrial purposes, and, no doubt, the demand for it in this direction will increase. The Government, however, should give a better reason than has been furnished for prohibiting the use of molasses spirit as a blend. If it can be shown that such spirit is' deleterious, I shall be willing to admit that it should not be used. But that has not been stated by either the Prime Minister, the Minister of Trade and Customs, or any of the experts whose opinions have been cited, and if that is the only reason, I maintain that it is an exceedingly weak one. On the other hand, if it is to be differentiated against on the ground of cheapness, I should like to know why it is not proposed to charge different rates of duties on maize spirit, wheat spirit, barley spirit, and malted barley spirit, which differ considerably in cost. Furthermore, potato spirit and beet root spirit, which are quite as costly as wheat spirit or barley spirit, are not allowed to be used. Surely this is an illogical position. In my opinion, the amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh should have the support of the Committee. When I have the opportunity, I intend to move the omission of the words " blended wine " from the title of the spirit on which it is proposed that the dutv should be11s. a gallon, because I think that that spirit should be known only as brandv. </para>

                    <para>.- Seeing that the Committee is discussing a proposal to alter the Excise duties, and that the administration of the Customs Department is also to some extent under review, I am surprised that the Minister of Trade and Customs is not in his place. Versatile as is the Prime Minister, he is hardly fitted to fill the vacancy, because I believe that he prides himself upon the fact that he knows very little about spirituous liquors, whereas his honorable colleague, by reason of a long parliamentary experience, no doubt, is well fitted to give us information on the subject. Rut, difficult as it is for an inexperienced member, without such guidance, to follow this complicated discussion, it is plain that Australia is gradually building up an export trade in wine. We have thousands of acres suitable for the cultivation of grape vines, and for the carrying on of those industries in which the inhabitants of the southern part of Europe have excelled. But we know that if you give a dog a bad name you may as well hang him, and if we allow our brandies to be blended with spirit distilled from other material than grapes, their reputation will be ruined, because we shall cease to have a standard Australian brandy of unrivalled excellence, and the public of other countries will be unable to distinguish between our pure brandies and our brandies which have been blended with spirit distilled from molasses, barley, and other materials. I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- It is evident that a number of honorable members who have taken part in the discussion have not known exactly what is before the Chair. The Committee has agreed to two rates of duties, which give complete protection to grape growers and wine makers, and I object to the attempt which is now being made to prevent molasses spirit from being used for blending purposes in the same way as grain spirit. It has been argued that molasses spirit should be excluded, because it is cheap, but, on the other hand, spirits distilled from other materials than grain, which are equally as dear as grain spirit, have also been excluded. The proposal cannot be defended on the ground of protection, because the quantity of grain used for the distillation of spirit is so small that its production cannot give employment to any large number of persons, and it seems to me that it is not a good reason" for objecting to the use of a certain spirit to say that it is cheap. No one has been able to assert that spirit distilled from molasses is injurious. </para>

                        <para>- It can be inferred from the proposal of the Government. The member's of the Tariff Commission, however, make no such statement. They were prepared to allow blended brandy to be distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials, recognising that provision would be made for the production of a pure wine brandy. I agree with the honorable member for Hindmarsh that pure brandy should be distilled wholly from grapes, but we are dealing now, not with pure brandy, but with a blended brandy. I apologise to the honorable member for Coolgardie if I hurt his feelings by the words I used. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable members say that molasses spirit is excellent, but must not be used because it can be produced too cheaply, and thereby imply that the public can get a good article for too little, there is no more to be said. The -honorable member for Bland took up the right attitude in regard to this matter. I have shown that the farming industry will not benefit materially by this provision in regard to the use of grain spirit. Why should we sacrifice revenue in order to maintain an industry in support of which nothing has yet been said. I should like to ask the protectionist members of the House whether, after having fostered an industry under our Tariff, we should, during a period in which we are pledged to observe fiscal peace, alter the duties in such a way as to destroy it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is quite correct, but his legal mind has caused him to ignore the fact that if a special preference be given to manufacturers of other classes of spirit the competitive relations between them and the distillers of molasses spirit will undergo a complete change. The proportional relationship will he altered, even though the duly upon molasses spirit may be retained. I would again direct the attention of honorable members to the figures which I quoted last night. These show that die distilling industry in New South Wales which did not exist before the introduction of the Tariff has grown to such an extent that 655,531 gallons of spirits have been produced up to the present time. The honorable member for Echuca is quite prepared to wipe out this industry. </para>

                        <para>- It is the duty of the Government to conserve the revenue, and I maintain that if a good spirit cap be cheaply produced we should subject it to a higher duty when it is blended with something else. If it could be shown that molasses spirit was bad I should have nothing whatever to say in favour of it. But, if the only- objection that can be urged is that it is cheap, I contend that permission should be given to use it for blending purposes, and tha.t a higher duty should be charged in order that the Government and the public might derive the benefit. </para>

                        <para>- Then I argue that it is the duty of the Government to protect the revenue by imposing a higher duty upon molasses spirit when used for blending purposes, and' not to preclude manufacturers from using it in that way. The amount of grain that would be used for distillation purposes would not be very great, and no appreciable benefit would be conferred upon the farmers by the encouragement of distillation from grain. The Government propose to throw away revenue for a mere idea. T would not object to the proposed Excise duty being increased to 13s., if the cheaper spirits were allowed to be used for blending purposes under paragraph 3. </para>

The Tariff Commission, after a thorough inquiry into the matter, came to the conclusion that blended brandy should be composed partly of spirit distilled from grape wine, and partly of spirit distilled from other materials. THat is their idea of blended brandy. </para>

                <para class="block">If molasses spirit is bad, it should not be used for blending purposes. The same argument would apply to any other kind of spirit. I am not fighting in the interests of molasses spirit in particular, but when we find that an industry has grown up under the Tariff, not only in Queensland, but in New South Wales, we should not impose differential duties that would have an injurious effect upon it, when no particular purpose, and certainly no purpose of high policy, is to be served. It seems to me that the Government are manoeuvring to prevent cheap and good spirit from taking the place of grain spirit, although the manufacture of the latter, even upon a large scale, would not be of any assistance to the farmers. I am quite prepared to agree to the addition of another shilling to the duty if molasses and other approved spirits are allowed to be used in making blended brandy. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is coming back to what I suggested last night, namely, that a blend such as he indicates should1 be called " rum brandy " - very rum brandy. Speaking generally, blended grain brandy as indicated in paragraph 3 will be composed of grape spirit and grain spirit. The cost of grain spirit ranges from 2s. 9d. to 2s.11d. per gallon, whereas that of molasses spirit ranges from10d. to1s. In other words, there is a difference of about 2s. between the cost of the respective spirits. If the duty be added, grain spirit under paragraph No. 3 would cost 14s. per gallon, and molasses spirit under other provisions would cost 14s. per gallon. In other words, the two spirits are placed practically upon an equality, so far as their possible use in blends is concerned. I take it that we have revenue considerations as well as those relating to fiscal policy to bear in mind. The proposal of the Government, whether designedly or not - and the same principle underlies the proposal of the Tariff Commission - is based upon the idea that the spirit which is more cheaply produced can stand a higher duty for revenue purposes. Quite apart from the question of its wholesomeness, a spirit cheaply produced can stand a higher duty, and still be upon an equality for competitive purposes when it comes into the market. </para>

                        <para>- Because I presume we want revenue. Paragraph 3 applies only to brandies composed of grape wine spirit and grain spirit, but I say that there is nothing to prevent blends of grape spirit and molasses from being sold as brand}'. The proposal before the Committee is that a blend of grape wine spirit and grain spirit shall be called a blended grain brandy, and the name will indicate that both grape wine spirit and grain spirit have been used in the blend. That would be a statement of fact, and I should object to a blend of grape wine spirit and molasses spirit being called a grain blend, because that would be a misdescription. So far as this particular item is concerned, the honorable member for Wide Bav can have no objection to its being limited to blends of grape wine and grain spirit. If he wishes to insert another provision relating to blended molasses brandy, that will be a matter for after consideration. If, however, we are to follow the same principle that we have adopted all along, and increase the duty upon the spirit as the cost of production falls- which, I think, is largely intended to serve the purposes of the revenue, although there may be considerations of quality involved - the manufacturers of molasses spirit blends will be no better off with 13s. duty upon that class of spirit. In fact, they will be worse off, because they will have to pav 1 3s. per gallon dutv upon the blend, whereas if the spirits were taken separately they would pay only 10s. per gallon upon grape wine spirit, 'and 13s. per gallon upon molasses spirit. If the honorable member for Wide Bay wants to insert an item relating to blended molasses spirit, the revenue officers would no doubt be glad to accept it, because the manufacturers would have to pay more dutv. He would pay 13s. per gallon upon four gallons, instead of 10s. upon one gallon, and 13s, upon each of three gallons. The honorable member for Wide Bay has suggested that the Government proposal implies that grain spirit is better from a medical stand-point than is molasses spirit. </para>

But I know the English language, and I am acquainted with the simple rules of addition and sub.straction, and that knowledge is all that one requires to possess to enable him to speak upon this aspect of the question. The principle which has been followed in the Government proposals - and the principle which has practically been recognised by the Tariff Commission - is that the dearer class of spirits should be placed upon something like' an equality with the cheaper class of spirits, otherwise the spirit which cost less to produce would drive the dearer article completely out df the market. </para>

                        <para>- I am a protectionist, and I do not propose to use any free-trade arguments, either now or at any other time. The honorable member for Wide Bay is also a protectionist, but I do not know what fiscal faith is professed by the honorable member for Capricornia. I have never heard him object to the application of protectionist principles to sugar. Under these proposals, molasses spirit will enjoy a considerable advantage, and one which I do not begrudge it. It is a by-product of the sugar industry. Unfortunately, an attempt is being made to enable it to oust from the market spirits which are produced from more expensive materials. The Honorable member for Wide Bay has stated that all he desires is that molasses spirit shall have the same chance as is accorded to other spirits. Under the Government proposals, I maintain that it has that chance. </para>

                        <para>- Molasses spirit can be blended with grape spirit and sold as brandy, but not as grain brandy. Of course, it is possible that it may be advisable to introduce such a heading as "Brandy rum," or "Rum brandy." It seems to me that those who are opposing the proposal before the Committee wish to retain for molasses spirit- owing to the cheapness of its production - the advantage which it now possesses. That mav be a very proper thing, but if that is the end in view, its advocates should not disclaim their desire. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the whole of this trouble has arisen from a misconception on the part of the honorable member for Wide Bay: I have listened attentively to the speeches he has delivered on the subject. He appears to think that the proposal under consideration will exclude the use of molasses spirit in the production of brandy. </para>

I merely wish to point out that the honorable member -for Wide Bay is at least justified in objecting to the proposals of the Government, unless they can assure him that the consumption of molasses spirit is more injurious than is that of grain spirit. There are only two logical positions which can be taken up in reference to this matter. One is that which has been assumed by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, who contends that if brandy is to carry the <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of the Government approval </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. But let us suppose that spirits were bottled under the supervision of an Excise officer. For the convenience of their trade, merchants very frequently keep stock in bond in the form in which it is likely to be purchased. If stock is put up in that way the Government will grant to that portion of it which complies with the conditions which are here prescribed the use of a special label. They will also exercise control over any other label which it is sought to attach to a portion of the goods. It seems to me that under these provisions, whilst the Government would permit their special grain brandy label to be applied to a brandy which was made partially from grain spirit, they would refuse to allow the term " brandy " to be attached to a blend which was obtained from the use of molasses spirit. That would be perfectly right, and a proposal of that character will command my support if it can be , shown that the consumption of molasses spirit is more injurious to the people than is that of grain spirit. But if that cannot be demonstrated, the Government, if it believes that only spirit from the grape should be called brandy, should say, " We will only allow our label to be placed upon brandy which is the product of pure wine spirit." That is a perfectly logical position to fake up. But when they go beyond that, and permit an admixture of other spirits in an article - an admixture to the extent of 75 per cent. - and when they say, " We will recognise only grain spirit," they take up a position which is only tenable if it can be shown- that grain spirit is better from a health stand-point than the other spirit which they exclude. Whilst I am perfectly willing to support the proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh that brandy to which the Government, label will attach must be wholly the product of the grape, I do not say that we should prevent the manufacture of another article which has a market, and which is not more deleterious, from a health stand-point, than are spirits generally. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If we are going to apply a Government label to brandy, it is preferable that it should be confined to what the Government recognise as the only pure brandy - that is, an article which has been distilled wholly from grape spirit. If we are to go beyond that, I would rather see this provision left out entirely; and thus subject other blends of brandy to the duty of 13s. per gallon. The honorable member for Coolgardie has said that some State feeling has been imported into this discussion. The only way in which such a feeling can be imported is by_ the selection of certain articles for special treatment. If we merely say that a particular duty shall be levied upon approved spirit - that is, upon spirit from either grain or molasses the consumption of which is not injurious to human beings - we make no State selection whatever. But if we approve of' spirit which is produced from certain articles only, we at once create a distinction as between State and State. </para>

                        <para>- Many people, including some medical men, hold that good rum is the least injurious spirit, and we have no evidence that molasses spirit, is more injurious than is raw grain spirit. That being so, I do not see why the Ministry should be prepared to allow a blend of grain spirit and grape spirit to be described as "brandy," and to bear the Government label, whilst, at the same time, they refuse to acknowledge as " brandy " another blend consisting of a mixture of wine spirit and a rectified spirit similar to grain spirit. There may be some reason for charging the higher duty on that in which molasses spirit is used, since the cost is much less; but if the Government are going to place themselves behind a label, that label should be applied only to pure brandy. </para>

They certainly ought not to allow the Government label to be placed on anything; that is unwholesome, but, at the same time, they should not permit it to be applied to a certain blend as being a good article, whilst, at the same time, another blend, which may consist of a mixture of grape spirit, with an equally good rectified spirit, is inferentially treated by them as bad. </para>

                        <para>- How do the Government propose to describe sugar spirit? A specific name has been given to grain spirit blended with grape spirit, but Apparently sugar spirit is to be regarded as an orphan without a name, and may be described by some persons as being other than brandy. I think that it would be sufficient in this provision to use the word " brandy" alone, and I am inclined to support the proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh. </para>

                    <para>. - I approve of the action taken by the Government in regard to brandy made from pure grape spirit, for only that which is so made can be properly described as brandy. I hold, however, that it is an anomaly to differentiate between blended brandy consisting of a mixture of grape spirit and grain spirit, and that which consists of a mixture of grape spirit and molasses spirit. A few honorable members, who are ignorant of the facts, have endeavoured to show that spirit made from molasses is inferior to any other spirit; but any one who knows anything of distillation will admit that one highly rectified spirit is practically as good as another. It has been said, for example, that potato spirit is not as good as spirit derived from certain other materials ; but this is entirely due to prejudice. Before the distillation of. spirit from molasses, potato spirit was regarded as the cheapest that could be produced, and doubtless that led to the people viewing it as an inferior article. A few representatives of the " cookies " have become imbued with the idea that if we encourage the manufacture of grain spirit we shall practically emancipate the " cocky" farmers, and place them in a better position than they have ever occupied. These honorable members hold themselves up to ridicule when they declare that in the production of blended brandy grain spirit alone should be mixed with wine spirit. Whilst I fully appreciate the contention that brandy should be made from ' wine spirit, I fail to ses why we should differentiate between molasses spirit and grain spirit. The one is as good as the other. The Constitution does not allow us to differentiate between the States, but because New South Wales and Queensland can produce a very cheap spirit, a few representatives of other States are raising an outcry against its use. The complaint against the use of cheap molasses spirit has come for the most part from members of the free-trade party. They are always ready to support the free admission of cheap goods from China, Japan, and other countries, yet they are highly indignant when it is proposed that a cheap and wholesome local production shall be allowed to go into consumption. The honorable member for Coolgardie, who is among those who object to the use of molasses spirit, has always something to say against Queensland. He is constantly putting questions to Ministers in regard to the sugar industry of that State. </para>

                        <para>- That statement only illustrates the ignorance of the honorable member so far as these questions are concerned. If it could be shown that grain spirit is better than molasses spirit, I should certainly favour the Government proposal ; but it is well known that there is no difference between highly-rectified grain and molasses spirits. Reference has been made to " rum brand v." but those who have been endeavouring in this way to play upon words are evidently not aware that the process of making rum, is altogether different from that followe'd in the manufacture of brandy. I intend to support the proposal of the Commission. </para>

                    <para>. - With the permission of the Committee, I should like to alter the provision whose insertion I have proposed bv substituting for the term " blended grain brandy" the term "blended spirit,'* and the necessary consequential amendment and bv adding the words " on and after 17 th August, 1906'." When the Spirit Bill is before them, honorable members will have an opportunity to consider the question of labelling, but the alterations which I now propose will remove the imputation which honorable members fear may be made to the detriment of wine brandy, and the reflection on spirit distilled from materials other than grain. We . are dealing only with such spirit as will receive the approved brands recommended by 'the Tariff Commission. Importers and merchants will still be able to sell as brandy or as whisky whatever compounds they choose to designate by those names, and practices such as that referred to by the honorable member for Hindmarsh will go on unchecked until the Parliaments of the States pass laws to deal with them. The Victorian Parliament has recently passed an Act prohibiting adulteration, but the Commonwealth Parliament is powerless to legislate on the subject within States, except to the extent likely to be provided for by the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members are tinkering with the scheme recommended by the Tariff Commission, "with the result that they are in danger of destroying its symmetry. The Commissioners recommended the adoption of terms such as are recognised in trade and commerce. For instance, brandy and blended brandy are both recognised articles of merchandise,, between which a clear distinction can be drawn. But if we create a number of grades of blended spirit, we shall conf use both the trade and the public, and depart from the cardinal principle which should be kept in view. The present proposal is to create a sort of mongrel term which will not be known to trade and commerce, because , whoever heard of an article being vended as blended spirit? There is no individuality about such a term. I did not raise any strenuous objection to the use of the term "blended grain brandy," because it was to a certain extent descriptive of the nature of the spirit; but to call an article " blended spirit " is to give it a name which is not distinctive. We should, as far as possible, use only terms known to the trade. </para>

                    <para>. - I apprehend that we want to deal with facts, and not merely with names. The subject before us is important from a revenue point of view, or from a fiscal point of view - according to the opinions we may Hold. We are not laying down any names for the use of those engaged in the trade. We are simply dealing with definitions for our own purposes, and there is no difficulty whatever in conveying our ideas. When we say "blended spirit" we mean that the article is a spirit, and that it is blended. We are here to deal with facts, and the whole question of nomenclature can be considered in connexion with the Bill. The question for us to consider at present is as to what amount of taxation shall be levied upon particular articles, and it is proposed to provide that if a blend is composed partly of spirit distilled from grape wine and partly of grain spirit, we shall call it a blended spirit for the purpose of the Excise duty. There is no difficulty about that. It has nothing whatever to do with the trade appellation. No one will <inline font-style="italic">bs</inline> compelled to call the blend by that name. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter that honorable members will have the fullest opportunity to deal with when the Bill is under consideration. The question of the label is absolutely irrelevant at the present time when we are discussing a matter of taxation. We cannot create an article, but we say that if any one chooses to create it by blending spirit in, a particular way he shall pay a certain amount of duty. We are not forcing any one, or inviting any one, to blend grape wine and grain spirits, but we say that if they do it they shall pay a certain1 rate of duty. If they do not make the blend in the manner described, they will not be compelled to pay the duty. As for the observation of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo that the Tariff Commission have used only trade names, I think that my honorable friend must have spoken without full consideration. If he looks down the list of recommendations he will find the description " spirit n.e.i. matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years." Is that a trade term ? It is merely a description of an article. Then again, " spirits n.e.i." are referred to. That is not .a trade term. No one ever heard of a distiller sending out his goods branded " spirits n.e.i." Then again, " spirit for fortifying Australian wine to be used subject to regulations " is not a trade term. </para>

                        <para>- My contention is that all the words used in this list - or iri any list of the kind - are merely intended to indicate the will of the Legislature as to the duty to be imposed upon articles answering the description given. What such articles may be called in the trade is quite another matter. I think that the whole difficulty is solved by the one consideration that when" the Bill is brought in honorable members will have the fullest opportunity to say what names shall be applied in trade - so far as we are able to determine them - to the various articles, and what title, if any, shall be affixed by the Commonwealth, authorities to any particular article! That is a matter for subsequent consideration. For the present, however, it is a mere waste of time to fight over terms, provided that we are agreed as to the facts. If we are agreed that an article which is partly grape wine and partly grain spirit in certain proportions, and of a cer tain strength, shall pay a certain Excise duty, I do not care by what name the concoction is called. The term "blended spirit ' ' is a perfectly innocuous one. It does not reflect upon, nor does it recommend, the article. </para>

                        <para>- By adopting the name " blended spirit " we sail between brandy and whisky, and I think that we have taken the proper course. We know what is meant, and we shall not force the term upon the trade, or invite those engaged in manufacture to use. it. The only consideration that should engage our attention at present is whether the articles referred to should bear the amount of duty proposed. </para>

                        <para>- The Government propose to permit of the blending of grape wine spirit with other classes of spirit, and to put such a blend upon the market as brandy. If this practice is followed great injury will be done to the Australian pure brandy. I think that the proposed new paragraph should be dropped, and that spirit such as. -that -'described should come under the head of spirits, n.e.i. If this course be adopted we shall obtain more revenue, and run less risk of objectionable compounds being placed upon the market to the prejudice of the pure article. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members will observe that all the amendments which have been inserted require that spirits shall be matured in wood for two years before they are allowed to leave bond. I wish to know - in connexion with both the operation of our import and our Excise duties - what arrangement, if any, has been made to give effect to that provision? Are all clearances of spirits from bond to cease during the next two years, except upon payment of a duty of 40s. per gallon? </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to obtain definite information regarding the use of highly-rectified spirits for manufacturing purposes, even though they enter in a minute degree into human consumption. The recommendation of the Commission - and I understand that similar terms have been employed in the Bill which has been drafted to cover these resolutions - is that all spirits which enter into human consumption must be matured in wood for two years. That is a perfectly proper provision, so far as spirits which are consumed as a beverage are concerned. But I would point out that spirits which are used in essential oils require to possess a high degree of strength, and to an infinitesimal degree they enter into human.' consumption. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the intention was not to regard spirits in the form of essences as passing into .human consumption. The Prime Minister should look into this matter with a view to making the position clear, because we do not wish to penalize the manufacturers who use these highly-rectified spirits by compelling them to pay a duty of 40s. per gallon. </para>

                    <para>. - I am fortunately in a position to inform the honorable member for North Sydney that the difficulty in regard to the shipment for which entries were tendered has been settled, and to state, in reply to the honorable member for Bland, that the word "industrial" is understood in the Department to cover spirits used in connexion with essences, perfumery, and things of that kind. That interpretation will be made perfectly clear, but even in the absence of a definition the word would be so interpreted by the Department. The usual practice is being followed, and I am assured that no obstacle is being presented. The Bill will also provide for sufficient notice being given abroad relative to the provision that spirits shall be stored for at least two years. That notice will not extend over two years, but will be sufficient to allow importers to deal with orders now afloat. In dealing with future orders, they must obey the requirement that only spirits of a certain age shall be admitted. </para>

                        <para>- Methylated spirit should be dealt with in a separate Bill,, specifying the conditions under which it shall be obtained free, and providing all the safeguards necessary for the protection of the revenue. The Commission did not intend that methylated spirit should be unconditionally free ; we intended that it should be free only when used subject to certain departmental precautions for the protection of the revenue. We ' considered that care should be taken by the Department to trace it to its destination, and to see that it was not used indiscriminately for other than industrial purposes. Unless very rigid safeguards be adopted, a leakage in the revenue may occur, since a lot of methylated spirit intended solely for industrial purposes may go into consumption. The conditions for methylation must be strictly defined, and provision must be made for severe penalties for breaches of the conditions. That can be done only by Statute. I invite the attention of the Government to this matter. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal of the Government that " spirit for fortifying Australian wine to be used subject to regulations " shall be free is not in accordance with the recommendation of the Commission. Our recommendation was that the Excise duty on spirit for fortifying Australian wine should be reduced from is. to 6d. per gallon. That was all that the vignerons asked ; they did net demand that this spirit should be absolutely free. Their sole contention was that it should be subject to a uniform rate of 6d. per gallon, so that those in a small way of business would have to pay no more than would those whose operations are conducted' on a large scale. I understand, however, that the Government propose that while this spirit for fortifying Australian wine shall be free, a charge shall be made for supervision with a maximum of 6d. per gallon. That "was not demanded by the vignerons of any State,_ and, therefore, I cannot understand why the Government have put it forward. Already there has been a strong protest against it. The vignerons would prefer a uniform Excise duty of 6d. per gallon without any haphazard regulation to the effect that spirit for fortifying purposes shall be free, and that they shall pay for the cost of supervision a rate not exceeding 6d. per gallon. </para>

                        <para>- But there will be a difficulty in ascertaining the cost of supervision, and those concerned do not know what this proposal may involve. They would prefer to have a certain charge fixed by law. If this Government proposal be adopted, some of the' winegrowers in a large way of business may obtain the spirit they require for fortifying purposes at an average of about 2d. per gallon, whereas small wine-growers may have to pay 6d. per gallon for it. Those who gave evidence were unanimously of opinion that the vignerons did not desire a duty or charge based upon the cost of supervision. With all due deference to the Minister in charge of the Department, I would urge the Government to revert to the recommendation of the Commission that the duty be reduced from is. to 6d. per gallon, so that all may be treated alike. </para>

                    <para>The allowance of drawback of duty on spirit used in fortifying wines would probably cause a further loss of ^4,000, but the proposal itself is open to considerable objection, inasmuch as it "would be impossible, unless the whole process of fortification and subsequent export was conducted "under the supervision of an officer, to ascertain the quantity of spirit entitled to drawback. As the effect of the proposals to reduce the duty on spirit for fortification to 6d. per gallon, and "to give drawback, would be to reduce the revenue now derived from spirits used in fortifying wine to a nominal amount, it would seem preferable to allow all spirits for fortification free of duty, subject to the condition that the expense of the officer supervising operations would be charged against the person using the spirit, to an extent not greater than 6d. per gallon on the spirit used. </para>

                    <para>.- I find it difficult to follow the reasons given by the departmental officers for objecting to the proposal of the Commission, unless their contention is that, under the proposal of the Government, the supervision necessary would be less than that which would be required under the Commission's proposal. I presume, however, that, if the duty were reduced to 6d. per gallon, no more supervision would be necessary than has been requisite with a duty of is. per gallon, and I would remind the Committee that we have not heard of any substantial (frauds. I cannot see at present how the degree of supervision, is affected by the alteration in method. If it be not affected, then it is clear that the departmental minute is entirely irrelevant to the proposed alteration. In that case, we have to turn to the point raised by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo that, under the Government proposal, wine makers on a large scale will be able to obtain spirit for fortifying at a less rate per gallon than will those carrying on business on a small scale. We desire that our small manufacturers shall grow into large manufacturers rather than that the large manufacturers should expand their operations at the expense of those in a smaller way of business. Consequently, unless there is. some very substantial difference1 in the 'degree of supervision required under the two systems, T trust that the Government will adopt the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. After all, the departmental minute has probably emanated from one officer, and it seems to me that it has nothing to do with the case since, under either proposal, there must be supervision. </para>

                    <para>.- I am prepared to leave this matter in the hands of the Prime Minister, since I feel sure that, upon investigation, he will find it necessary to have a fixed rate of - duty. As has been pointed out, supervision is necessary in any case, and it is not reasonable that the vigneron who uses a very large quantity of spirit for fortifying wine should obtain it at a lower rate than the man whose output is not on such a large scale. Another point 'for consideration relates to the quality of spirit used for fortifying purposes. We should pass a provision that will enable consumers to be assured that the spirit used for fortifying Australian wines is up to the standard. </para>

                    <para>.- The claim of the vignerons has been that the rate charged should be merely such as will cover the cost of supervision. When the matter was first raised, the right honorable member for Adelaide thought that nothing less than1s. per gallon would do that, and consequently the rate was fixed at1s. ; but it has since been found to be more than twice as much as is necessary. For some years, therefore, the vignerons have been asking, for a reduction, and when they interviewed the Minister in regard to the matter they received the promise that, when the Tariff was being reconsidered, regard would be paid to their representations. From their point of view, the recommendation of the Tariff Commission is a fair one. They do not look upon a charge of 6d. per gallon as excessive. I understand the proposal of the Government to be to abolish the Excise rate, and to make a special charge for supervision when dealing with spirit used for fortification. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Prime Minister will adopt the recommendation of the Tariff Commissioners, who went into this matter very carefully, as they did into other matters. We must all admit they they have done their work well and satisfactorily. No adequate reasons seem to me to have been given for departing from their recommendation. Apparently, the departure has been made merely to avoid adopting their recommendation. I do not know what has influenced the Department in making the suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the Minister adopted the advice of his Department, and if, in the absence of proper reasons to the contrary, we refuse to adopt the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, we shall be trifling with the matter. What is the good of appointing a Commission to thoroughly investigate the subject if we are to depart from its recommendations without any real reason being given ? In my opinion, the departure proposed will make the charge proportionately greater for the small man than for the large man, because the cost of supervising a large output would be less per gallon than that of supervising a small output. I am sure that it is not desired by the Government to make the charge on the small man proportionately higher than that on the large man. </para>

                        <para>.- Most honorable members who have spoken during this debate have congratulated the Treasurer upon the optimistic note that he has considered himself justified in sounding with regard to the public finances and the general prosperity of the country. I do not complain of the Treasurer's optimism, because, perhaps, it is rather a good thing to be sanguine than otherwise. The proposal to introduce the penny postage system, and to make a free gift of a large sum of money to a limited section of the community, is rather startling. I hardly think that, at the present stage of our history, we can afford to incur the loss of revenue that would be involved. I am rather surprised that the Treasurer did not go the whole hog, and propose to introduce free postage. It would have been a matter of only a few hundreds of thousands of pounds, and it would have placed the citizens of the Commonwealth in a position of advantage over all the rest of the world. As a member of the Labour Party, I rejoice to notice that the Government are prepared to make a distinct step in the direction of Socialism by becoming national ship-owners. It is intended to embark upon the fishing industry by fitting out a trawler, with the object of ascertaining the extent of our fisheries. The idea is a very good one, and I am glad that the honorable member for Parramatta has so far divested himself of his old-time prejudices that he is able to express his approval of such an extremely socialistic enterprise. The honorable member, who is practically the leader of the Opposition in the House - there ought to be one leader of the party in the House and another outside of the Houses-seemed to be carried away by the optimism of the Treasurer. He said - </para>

                        <para>It is difficult to understand how, in a system like our own, great financial prosperity can co-exist with national distress, and it may safely be affirmed that such a conjunction for any length of time is impossible.

                    <para class="block">I mention that because I wish to direct the attention of honorable members to some of the conditions which exist amongst us today, and which present a vivid contrast to the buoyancy of the revenue. In Great Britain, at the time referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford"</inline> Northcote, the famine in Ireland was then causing very great distress, whilst the revenue was never more buoyant. The Treasurer was able to present to us some evidences of the prosperity of the general community, and, almost at the same moment that he was speaking, representations were being made by members of the Victorian Parliament with regard to the existence of dire distress, amongst certain sections of the community in Melbourne. It was stated, upon the authority of the Unemployed Committee, that 140 houses situated in one block in Collingwood, contained twenty-six adult males, or 1.9 per cent, of the whole of the adult male residents in that area, who could not find employment. It was said that the same percentage of unemployed was to be found in the greater portion of the city of Collingwood, and that men had in many cases been idle for seven months out of the twelve. In Carlton, 314 houses were visited, and 73 adult males, or 24 per cent, of the workmen residing in the tenements in question, were found to be out of work. In Fitzroy, from 18 per cent, to 24 per cent, of the adult males were unable to find employment, and one out of every four of the working men in North Melbourne were out of work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> a member of the Victorian Assembly, spoke of cases of which he had personal knowledge, in which one family of seven and another of. three, had nothing to eat from 1 ' o'clock on Saturday afternoon until Monday morning. Therefore, in this great city, much distress exists, and it is gratifying to notice that, the State Government .propose to spend £250,000 upon public works with a view to affording some relief. In Sydney, a Committee appointed by the Trade and Labour Council have been making very, careful investigations, and have summarized the results of their inquiries. They say - </para>

Jam, biscuit, lolly, and pickle factories are dens under his direction ; and in the fruit-canning industry, the waggon from the chemical works - another underpaid concern - deposits in the early morning its load of drugs for purposes not disclosed.

I think that if we can do anything in the direction of affording profitable employment for the labour that is now idle, we shall be taking an important step in advance. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> estimated the value of the work of an adult male at ,£300 per annum. One of the greatest authorities in the United States upon, physical economics, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hope,</inline> recently made an interesting statement before the American Medical Association. He was striving to arrive at the economic value of a human being, and in this connexion he* said that, upon a 3 J per cent, discount basis, at . ten years of age a boy was worth: ,£529, at fifteen years of age he was worth £852, and at twenty-five years of age he was worth ,£1,087. From whatever stand-point we regard this matter we must recognise that it does not pay any country to have its population idle. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper of 7th instant contained a paragraph which commented, upon the terrible condition of the women workers of London. It stated that these women were being worked excessively long hours, and under very bad conditions, for the munificent wage of one penny per hour. The same issue of that journal contained a report of a deputation of employers which waited upon the Chief Secretary of South Australia, whose members were only willing to pay a wage of a penny per hour to our Australian girls. Surely we ought to be ashamed to countenance in the Commonwealth) a condition of affairs which' we so strongly denounce in the old country.

The cure for this state of things is, perhaps, not easy to find. In Australia there ought to be avenues in which every person who honestly desires it can obtain employment. Some of the remedies which have been suggested are, to my mind, extremely amusing. I admit that some good will probably result from preaching the doctrine which is being advocated during the luncheon hour at establishments all round Melbourne by worthy gentlemen who urge that Australians should be sufficiently patriotic to support local "industries. But in this connexion I was somewhat amused to read a newspaper report of an address which was delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Charles</inline> Atkins, who, I believe, is an aspirant for Federal Parliamentary honours. That gentleman visited the Scotch College, and, after telling the boys that they should try to out-British the British in their patriotism, he said - </para>

                        <para>Their patriotism should, however, also have a practical, as well as a sentimental, side, and they should create as much work as possible by increasing the consumption of goods manufactured in Australia. His coat was made in Hobart, his suit in Geelong, his boots in King-street, his socks - -(laughter - in South Yarra, and his hat in Collingwood - (loud laughter). It had been said that local goods were poor in Quality, but by increasing the consuming they would not only improve the quality, but also cheapen the price. He wanted them to believe in Australia, for as soon_as they began to travel, the need would quickly come home to them, and they should not be afraid to do a little bit of " skiting." For instance, they might tell people that the annual amount of production in Australia reached to ^121,000,000, which indeed was something to boast of. He was sure every boy in the College was ready to do something for his country. </para>

                    <para class="block">I repeat that I was rather amused when I lead that report, because I recollected that I had seen certain bill-heads, which announced that the firm of Charles Atkins and Company were sole agents for the Standard Varnish, New York, for the Heath and Milligan Company's Paints, Chicago, for H. Rosenthal and Brothers' brushware, New York, and the Water Paint Company of America, New York. It seems to me that if we could extend the boycott which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atkins</inline> desires to put into operation against all the imported articles which I have enumerated, conditions would be very much improved. In my opinion the real question which we have to face is that of immigration. It is a perfect farce to talk about inviting persons to settle in Australia when conditions exist such as those to which I have alluded. Upon the subject of immigration I would remind the Prime Minister that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> recently made a report to the New South Wales Government which contains some very interesting statements. At the present time that State is paying 6s. per head for the privilege of securing from the old country single "young men who come there chiefly with a view to obtain work upon farms. I maintain that we already have quite sufficient men of that class who are in receipt of starvation wages. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> points out that the agents of the shipping companies in the old country receive <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per head from the Canadian Government for the immigrants whom they induce to settle in the Dominion. The shipping companies which are interested in the Australian trade are giving their agents 14s. per head for the immigrants whom they induce to settle in New South Wales, and the Government of that State are contributing the balance of 6s. per head.

The greatest mistake of all was sanctioning the immigration of penniless married couples with families of young children, all having been primed' with an exactly reverse idea of the conditions they had to face.

Personally, I do not see how we can do anything effective in that direction until we have appointed a High Commissioner. The class of immigrants whom we desire to attract are those who are possessed of capital, and who are willing to settle immediately upon the land. I believe that they should be able to select their holdings before they leave the old world. In this connexion we must recollect that every land-holder employs at least two, if not three men.

                        <para>In 1829 a small book was published in London which attracted a great deal of attention, not only by reason of its manner, but also on account of the complete originality of the ideas it contained. It purported to be a letter written from Sydney, and described the annoyances to be endured by a man of taste and fortune, if he emigrated to Australia. He could have no intellectual society ; he could not enjoy the pleasures of his library, or of his picture gallery ; he could hope for none of the delights of easy retirement, seeing that he had to go forth on his land, and with his own hands labour for his daily food. For, said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wakefield,</inline> the author of this little book, you cannot long have free servants in this country ; if a free man arrives in the colony, though he may for a short time work for you as a servant, yet he is sure to save a little money, and as land is here so excessively cheap he soon becomes a landed proprietor. He settles down on his farm, and though he may have a year or two of heavy toil, yet he is almost certain to become both happy and prosperous. Thus, the colony is an excellent place for a poor man, but it is a wretched abode for a man of means and culture. Wakefield, therefore, proposed to found in Australia another colony, which should be better adapted to those who had fortunes sufficient to maintain them, and yet desired to emigrate to a new country.  His  scheme for effecting this purpose was to charge a high price for the land, and so to prevent the poorer people from purchasing it ; the money received from the sale of land he proposed to employ in bringing out young men and women as servants and farm labourers, for the service of the wealthier colonists. Now, said Wakefield, on account of the immense natural resources of these colonies, their splendid soil, their magnificent pasture lands, their vast wealth in minerals, and their widespread forests of valuable timber, which stands ready .for the axe. a gentleman possessed of only £20,000 will obtain as large an income from it as could be procured from £100,000 in England ; yet he will be able  to enjoy his learned and cultured leisure, just as he does at home, because all the work will be done for him by the servants he employs. </para>

                    <para class="block">As a matter of fact, South Australia was first settled upon the conditions advocated bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wakefield</inline> as. far back as 1829. The South Australian Association acted upon his suggestion, ' and at the outset sold land at not less than 12s. per acre, and subsequently at £1 per acre. The system adopted by all the States of selling at £1 per acre land worth, in some cases, ^3 or £4 an acre, and in others only 15s. per acre, had its origin in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wakefield's</inline> suggestion. To-day the poor man cannot get on the land ; the Crown lands of the States, and particularly of Victoria, have been so alienated that there is no opening for him. The honorable member for Grampians pointed out that he knew of men who, having only limited means, had gone on- the land and done well. If we had cheap land available for settlement those having a knowledge of farming would be able, even if their means were limited, to make comfortable homes for themselves in the course of a few years. But the door has practically been closed to such men. In Victoria to-day only 13,828 acres of first class land remain unalienated. So far as this State is concerned, therefore, it would appear that the door has been closed to agricultural immigrants, unless we can find some means of placing them on the land. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> the value of property in New South Wales is ^368,778,000. Nine hundred and eighty-seven persons, or companies, own 35 per cent, of this property; 2,086 own 45 per cent, of it; and 50 per cent, of it is held by some 3,000 persons, or companies. I have here some interesting figures, showing how,, under the conditional purchase system,, which was designed to allow the poor man to obtain land on easy terms, the number of large estates in New South Wales has increased. Since 1882, 44,352,613 acres of conditional purchase lands have been transferred, and only 18,481,880 acres have been applied for. At present, 22,830,261 acres in New South Wales are held by 722 persons, or companies, whose holdings average an area of 31,621 acres each, and the total area alienated comprises 48,081,314 acres. In South Australia, 304 persons, or companies, own 3,545,000 acres, whilst 1,269,704 acres are held by 30. The following table gives the names of the thirty largest land-owners in South Australia, together with their area and the unimproved value of their holdings: - </para>

                    <para class="block">In many parts of South Australia one may travel all day by train without seeing more than a few individuals, the scanty population of many districts being due to the fact that the land has been alienated, and not put to proper use. One big land-owner in that State some time ago cut up a portion of his estate into orchard blocks, and the railway returns relating to that district - in which fruit is now being grown - are in striking contrast to those relating to the wool-growing districts. There is a large area of land in South Australia which ought to be available for settlement, and until it is thrown open it will be idle for us to talk of encouraging immigration. </para>

                            <para>- There is plenty of land suitable for settlement in New South Wales, but, unless the land laws of that State be amended, it will not be available to those who desire to till the soil. The honorable member for New England is my authority for the statement that one man in that State, who has been in no less than eighty ballots, has not yet secured a block, whilst I recently read a paragraph in a Sydney newspaper to the effect that another man was able to rejoice that, after being in twenty-two ballots for a block of land, he had at length been successful. One has as much chance of drawing a prize in one of Tattersall's sweeps as one has of being able to take up a block of land in New South Wales. I now come to the position of Victoria, which is one of the smallest, and yet perhaps one of the richest, States in the Commonwealth. Here 25,797,312 acres have been alienated, and there are 633 persons or companies holding areas over 5,000 acres in extent. Their holdings comprise a total of 11,707,492 acres. Twenty-three persons own estates of 50,000 acres and upwards, the average area of their holdings being 149,233 acres. Four thousand square miles in' the Western District are held by sixty families, and on that large tract of country there are only 1,285 dwellings, and a population of 7,869. Railway lines 362. miles in length, and costing ; £3,753,000, have been constructed through land held by about forty persons. In the shires of Hampden and Mortlake twenty families own over 800,000 acres. They hold 16,337acres of closed roads, and one-eighth of the alienated land of Victoria is held by 525 persons or companies. One million acres are held by eleven persons, whilst eighteen persons hold 1,240,000 acres. If this practice of acquiring large estates is to continue, Victoria will yet be owned by one individual. In these circumstances it is, to say the least, singular that any proposal calculated to break up large estates should be denounced as being little short of robbery. The total area of Victoria is only 56,245,760 acres, and, according to the latest returns, 25,797,312 acres have been alienated. About 8,000,000 acres have been reserved, something like 8,000,000 acres have been leased, and of the land available for selection only 13,828 acres may be described as first class. </para>

                            <para>-The amount realized by land sales in Victoria aggregates £30,627,053, an average of £1 8s. 3d. per acre. A great deal, however, was sold on long terms, and, according to the State Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drake,</inline> if 5 per cent, were allowed on deferred payments during a period of ten years, the average price of the land sold would be reduced to 15s. 6d. an acre, while if the period were increased to twenty years the price would be reduced to 12s. 6d. per acre. These figures are of interest in view of what has been said about the big prices which have been paid for land in the past. In 1904-5 the Victorian land tax realized £97,840. The estates assessed numbered 1,262, and contained 7,039,132 acres, being valued at £10,356,984. It is generally agreed that the Victorian land tax is levied on a wrong basis. Areas of less than 640 acres are exempt from taxation, so that city property escapes scot free, while country land is divided into four classes. The land belonging to class 1, supposed to be capable of carrying two sheep to the acre, is valued at £4 an acre ; that belonging to class 2, supposed to be able to carry lj sheep to the acre, is valued at £3 an acre; that belonging to class 3. supposed to be able to carry a sheep to the acre, is valued at £2 an acre; and that belonging to class 4, supposed to be able to carry less than a sheep to the acre, is valued at £1 to the acre. Those who know anything of grazing land know that this is not a fair way of estimating its value, and it is, moreover, notorious that the valuations have been made carelessly. and are unreliable. The tax is at the rate of per cent, on the capital value, and there is an exemption amounting to <inline font-style="italic">£2!S°°-</inline> Some of the estates which are taxed in this way have been sown with English grasses, and otherwise improved, so that the basis of taxation is inequitable, and no doubt it will soon be recognised that a fairer system must be adopted. In Kew South Wales the land tax is id. in the <inline font-style="italic">£.1</inline> on the unimproved value of taxable land. The value of the alienated land there is £129,178,000, but taxation is paid only on land valued at £76,800,000. The number of taxable landholders in the State is 178,000, and the various exemptions bring the number of those who are taxed down to 41,000. Those who have created such, an alarm about the Labour Party's taxation proposals overlook the fact that a great many exemptions are allowed, apart from the exemption of /T240 in capital value given in New South Wales. In Tasmania 46,655 estates are taxed. Of holdings between 5,000 and 15,000 acres there are 551, of the capital value of £4,502,056. There are 142 holdings of between 15,000 and 40,000 acres in area, having a capital value of over 000,000 ; there are twenty-two holdings of an area of between 40,000 and 80,000 acres, having a capital value of over £1,000,000; and there are thirteen holdings exceeding an area of 80,000 acres, having a value of £1)585,430. The tax yields £46,000 per annum, the taxable value of the land upon which it is levied being £21,839,973. The Tasmanian land taxation, like the Victorian, is on an unfair basis, the tax being levied on the improved, instead of on the unimproved, value of the land. In the State there are only 728 properties of an area exceeding 5,000 acres, so that there are probably not 200 estates in Tasmania to which the Labour Party's taxation would apply. It is necessary, however, that these estates shall be broken up, if that beautiful little island is to make the progress to be expected from its resources and climate. In Victoria land is divided into urban and rural, and. although a valuation of £127,851,305 has been placed upon the private land of the State, if the New Zealand method of valuing were adopted that would be increased to £135,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> has in the past referred to the unreliability of Victorian statistics, but I believe that the present Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drake,</inline> has greatly' improved' the methods in vogue here.

                    <para class="block">The figure's just given have been made up to last year, and show existing values ; but if New Zealand methods of valuing were adopted, the amounts would be largely increased. The value of the private land held in South Australia is over £35,000,000, while that held in Western Australia is worth over £11,000,000. and in Tasmania over £21,000,000. Victorian land is more valuable than any other. It is valued at ^5 2s. 9d. per acre, but its value would be greater if the New Zealand method of valuing were applied. The value of the Tasmanian alienated land has been estimated at 6s. 7d. per acre. I do not know quite upon what basis those figures have been arrived at, but I believe that the calculation has been made in accordance with an arrangement agreed upon among the Statisticians. The total alienated area in Australia is 120,106,547 acres, having a value of ^373,679,000, or an average of <inline font-style="italic">. 6-3</inline> 2s. 3d. per acre. </para>

                            <para>- Naturally the best land has been alienated. A committee of the Labour Party has given consideration to the question of imposing a progressive Commonwealth land tax. This action has been misunderstood and misrepresented in many quarters, but any suggestion put forward for remedying an admitted evil should receive fair criticism and examination. Some have said that the proposed tax would be too light, while others speak "of its imposition as a confiscation of private estates. In dealing with the subject it must be remembered that in the large cities land has often been improved to its fullest capacity by the erection of buildings; and the object of the Labour Party, with which I think the people of the country are in sympathy, is to compel the owners of large estates to use them to their fullest capacity. We desire to break up the huge land monopolies which exist in the country districts. The Treasurer will find ultimately that direct taxation for Commonwealth purposes will be necessary. </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen it. The Constitution is opposed to differentiation in taxation, though, no doubt, the difficulties which have to be faced could be met by the introduction of a suitable measure. It must not be forgotten, when an attempt is being made to estimate the probable effect of the proposals of the Labour Party in breaking up large estates, that there is already land taxation in several of the States. In South Australia a progressive land tax is in operation, and in Victoria a similar impost falls very heavily upon the big estates. We must, therefore, pay some regard to the taxation that is now levied by the States upon land. The proposals of the Labour Party are as follows : - </para>

                    <para>It will be noted that the increasing rate provided in the Labour Party's scheme is not retrospective in the sense that the possessor of a large estate has to pay the highest tax on the whole of his valuation. The £5,000 exemption applies all through, so that a man with a £10,000 estate pays on £5j°00 only. The graduation, too, is intended to work so that the highest rate only applies to the limit of the man's valuation and - the next rate lower in the scale. Thus, the 4d. rate docs not apply to the whole of the £60,000 valuation, but to the £10,000 between £50,000 and £60,0'. o, the lower rates applying to the remaining £50,000 down to the £5,000 which is exempt. </para>
                    <para class="block">It may be urged that the proposed tax upon properties about half-way down the scale would not be sufficiently heavy to effect the purpose in view ; but, on the other hand, no one can say that the tax is an unreasonable one to impose.

                            Lyne has been looking into the. incidence of the Labour Party's scheme of Federal land taxation. The tax, as agreed to by the Federal Parliamentary caucus, gives an exemption to holdings of £5,000 in value, and then begins a scale which commences with an imposition of o£d. in the pound on holdings between £5,000 and £10,000 in value, and ends with one of 4d. in the pound for holdings over £60,000 in value. In the light of his investigations,

                            Lyne has formed the conclusion that if the existing land taxes in three States are abolished in favour of the Federal tax, land-owners whose holdings do not exceed in value £25,000 get actually relief instead of additional burdens. In Victoria holders of land worth £70,000 will, he finds, pay less under the proposed Federal tax than under the present State land tax.

                    <para class="block">I do not know that the Minister of Trade and Customs is in favour of the abolition of the land taxes at present imposed by the States, and I do not see any reason why they should be done away with. The returns showing the amount raised by the various States by means of direct taxation indicate that the propertied classes are not by any means so heavily taxed as are the working classes. Last year New South Wales raised £332,570 by means of a land tax. South Australia, in 1904, derived £77,369 from the same source. Victoria, last year, received £97,840, and Tasmania £46,548. The total amount raised in the four States in which a land tax is levied was £544,287. Absentees draw £400,000 annually from Australia. If the States require revenue they should not abolish their land taxes because the wealthier classes are not contributing sufficiently to the revenue, particularly in view of the fact that the monopolization of ' land is increasing every year. I find that the total amount paid in all the States in the form of probate duties is £^729,535; in stamp duties, £506,190'; in land taxes, £556,942 ; and income taxes, £807,873. In Western Australia and Queensland the dividend taxes realize £214,524 per annum. Thus the total amount raised by direct taxation in the Commonwealth is £2,815,064. That is a very small amount in comparison with the revenue derived by indirect taxation. New South Wales has always had a very large income from land. A large area of the Crown lands are leased, and, although the rents have been reduced from time to time, the income from that source is still very considerable. In 1905, the receipts from Customs in New South Wales amounted to £2&gt;395'735&gt; and Excise duties realized £642,482, whilst £122,606 was derived from other duties. The stamp duties realized £473,283; the land tax, £332,530; and the income tax, £231,442. The total revenue from the sources mentioned was £4,148,025, and it will be seen that the Customs and Excise duties represented considerably more than half of the aggregate. I do not think that the proposal for the introduction of a graduated land tax has received fair criticism at the hands of those who profess to earnestly desire to deal with the problem that is now confronting us. I have already referred to the fact that, owing to the manner in which the land is held in large estates, no provision can at present be made for immigration. Our own people are not able to obtain the land they require, and it would be wicked and cruel to invite immigrants from the old country whilst land monopoly prevails to such an extent that no openings are presented for settlement. When the white man first came to Australia he found the land in the possession of coloured squatters, who did not trouble themselves about 3,000 guinea rams. Their stock consisted of kangaroos and opossums, and they were quite contented. The white men, however, told them that they were not making the best use of the land*, and that they must clear out. If they did not hasten to make themselves scarce, they sometimes received a dose of lead, which put them beyond all further trouble. I do not blame the early settlers for having taken possession of the country, but I maintain that present conditions are just one degree better than those which prevailed when the white man first came to Australia. We should tell those who are now content to devote land of a high-class character to the raising of sheep and' cattle that they are not putting the land to the best use, and must make way for others who are prepared to do so. Some of those who now hold large estates took up the land in the first instance as a sort of gamble. They knew very well that as settlement increased, and public money was expended in opening up the country, their properties would increase in value, and they were content to play a waiting game. When land was purchased from the State, it was fully expected that it would be devoted to some useful purpose, and if we had had proper laws in the old days, the present trouble would not have arisen. We are spending large sums of money annually upon public works, and are thus increasing the value of the land, and we are entitled to see that facilities are offered for the settlement of an increasing population upon the soil. I do not wish to do any injustice to the present holders of large estates, but they must be made to realize the necessity of turning the land to better account. The alienation of land has proceeded in Victoria to such an extent that only a few thousand acres of first-class land now remain in the hands of the Government. It is imperative that we should face the financial problem without any undue delay. We shall have to make provision for the payment of old-age pensions, and to face the prospect of a diminishing revenue. If higher protective duties are imposed - and it cannot be denied that great dissatisfaction exists in connexion with the present Tariff, and that the majority of the electors are in favour of higher protective duties - we shall suffer a loss of revenue, and it seems to me that no fairer means could be devised of meeting the deficiency than that of taxing the land, and especially the big estates. The acting leader of the Opposition has denounced the land taxation proposals of the Labour Party as socialistic. He has gone further, and has designated them "class robbery," though he has not told us why he so regards them. It seems to me that the party of which he is the acting leader is very much like the. old aborigines who are described in an interesting little book by Jeannie Gunn.

                            is quite correct in saying that direct taxation is within the provisions of the Constitution. I never said that it was not.

Everybody is aware that in the preamble to our Acts of Parliament we do not use the form which' was adopted in many of the old English statutes. We do not specify in our taxation Acts the particular purpose to which the money raised under them is to be devoted. It is admitted that the Commonwealth Parliament has power to impose direct taxation- </para>

                            <para>- The incidence of that taxation may be varied. For instance, in connexion with the sugar industry we deliberately differentiated between the product of white labour and that of black labour, in order to give effect to a policy which was unanimously indorsed by honorable members - the policy of a White Australia. Here we have in our midst an evil - that of land monopoly - which is even worse than was the coloured labour evil in Queensland. A proposal to levy a progressive land tax which in its incidence will strike at the big land-holders is no more unconstitutional than was our action in offering the Queensland sugar-planters a substantial rebate to encourage them to employ white labour in preference to kanaka labour. There is no doubt that we have power to impose such a tax. We are not bound to give our reasons for levying it, although we have openly stated what those reasons are. </para>

The Treasurer proposes to initiate a scheme of immigration ; but I say that we ought not to sanction any such scheme whilst there are so many of our own people unemployed, because of the difficulty which they experience in securing land. I wish now to quote a statement which was made by the honorable member for North Sydney during the course of this debate. He is usually so well informed that I am surprised that he should have fallen into the error to which I am about to direct attention. He said - </para>

                        <para>What estates will the imposition of such a tax force from the hands of their present owners? Will it not be those estates which pay the least - estates such as exist in the western portions of New South Wales, and which give their owners very poor returns? The tax may be levied upon the value of the land during good seasons, and as the result of its operation during bad seasons, the holders of these lands may be compelled to sell. Of what use would such lands be for the purposes of closer settlement? It would be cruelty to put small settlers upon them. Whilst the proposed tax may make the better class of lands groan under the burden, it will not dispossess their holders. </para>

                    <para class="block">In order to show how utterly misleading his statement is, I have merely1 to mention that the western division of New South Wales embraces an area of 81,836,152 acres. It includes the township of Broken Hill, and a number of other large towns. Yet there is less than 2 per cent, of that area, or only 1,623,152 acres, alienated. Section 114 of the Constitution provides - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, raise or maintain any naval or military force, or impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth ; nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State. </para>

                    <para class="block">Consequently the Constitution renders it utterly impossible for a progressive Federal land tax to be imposed upon the landholders of the western district of New South Wales. I cannot understand how the honorable member for North Sydney fell into such an error. I thought that everybody knew that the country in question was all leased ; that it is the property of the Government of New South Wales, and that consequently the Commonwealth cannot subject it to taxation. Not one area in the drier portions of New South Wales would come within the taxation proposals of the Labour Party. Our desire is that the tax shall be so adjusted that those to whom the honorable member for North Sydney referred will be absolutely exempt. </para>

                            <para>- Lands in the district to which the honorable member referred would not be subject to the proposed tax. Those who seek to make out that we wish to leave " the fat turkey and kangaroo tails " intact, and that our desire is* simply to crush the poor man, are playing a very pretty game. As a matter of fact, many of the officers of farmers' unions in many districts - and .particularly in the south-eastern part of South Australia - are squatters ; owners of large holdings have squeezed the small men out of office, and at the last conference of these organizations it was decided to take political action. The honorable member for North Sydney is their mouthpiece in this Chamber. These men are fighting, not for the interests of the small farmer, but for themselves. They have, so to speak, " nobbled " many of the farmers' organizations. </para>

I shall be prepared to give the names of some of these gentlemen, together with the areas they hold. I am not suggesting that every branch of the farmers' unions is conducted on these lines. The branches in my district have been careful to exclude the big man whom they have had to fight from the outset ; but owners of large areas have taken possession of the central organization, and it suits them to raise this bogy. </para>

                            <para>- If the quotation which I have made from the speech made by the honorable member for North Sydney were circulated among the farmers, it would give rise to misapprehension. I was one of those who assisted in passing the law under which the owners of holdings in the western division are now living, and which has had the effect of reducing their rents. I should not be a party to any proposal that would press harshly on any one - that would press harshly on the holder of either a big or a small area. I object, however, to the suggestion that the owners of holdings in the dry districts of New South Wales are likely to suffer under the proposed tax. I propose now to read an extract from a speech delivered in the Sydney School of Arts bv the honorable member for New England, and published in the Daily <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph.</inline> The report sets forth that- </para>

Had a member of the Labour Party made the assertion that forcible possession should be taken of. the land, there would have been a howl of indignation. Newspapers would have dealt with it in leading articles, and, doubtless, the honorable member for Parramatta would have denounced the use of such strong language. But, because the statement was made by a member of the Opposition, nothing has been said about it. I am not suggesting that the honorable member was not justified in making the statement. </para>

                            <para>- -We do not know what are the views of some honorable members of the Opposition. The cry that the Labour Party are seeking to confiscate the lands of the people has not been raised of late so frequently as it was a few months ago. The right honorable member for East Sydney does not appear to consider that the proposed land tax would have the effect of bursting up large estates ta any serious extent, and, apparently, the honorable member for Parramatta shares that view. The question of whether or not the tax is sufficiently high is certainly a debatable one. It has been said that it is a socialistic proposal, amounting to confiscation. Those who make that assertion do not appear to recognise that the forcible resumption of land is really confiscation!. Our proposal is designed simply to induce owners of large estates to put them to the best use. At the present time land, which should be cultivated, is being devoted to grazing purposes. How are we to compel owners of large estates to put them to their proper use, unless we tax them? It is true that some land-owners have cut up their estates, and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> recently published a list of large estates that had been so subdivided. Those who say that the proposal of the Labour Party to impose land taxation is a policy of confiscation, do not object to Crown resumptions under which the owners of land receive for it, not the value which they have given to it by their personal exertions, but that which has been given to it by the expenditure of the State on public works and improvements. Will any one say that the block of land which was originally bought in Melbourne for £3.600, and was afterwards valued at several millions, owed its increase in value to anything done by its owners? The added value was due to the growth of the community and to the improvement of the city at the public expense. It seems to me strange logic to talk' about our land tax proposals as confiscation, and not to regard it as confiscation to pay to private individuals values due to public expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- It would be taxed only on its unimproved value ; there would be no tax on improvements. I am trying to emphasize the want of logic displayed by those who term it confiscation to tax the unimproved value of land1 for the development of the country, 'but do not term it confiscation to pay away to private individuals unearned increment due to public expenditure. The single taxers believe in taking away the whole of the unearned increment, and spending it for the benefit of the community, but the proposals of the Labour Party do not go so far as that. The increase in the -value of private land by public expenditure has been enormous. Probably the construction of railways has added at least £2 an acre to most of our land. Many honorable members, however, say that that increase in value should go wholly to the holders of the land. No one wishes to act unfairly to those who are now in possession of the land, and there must, of course, be exemptions to meet special cases ; but it cannot be denied that the bursting up of the large landed estates is verv much to be desired, because the presence of starving poor in the country is due mainly to land monopoly. The right honorable member for East Sydney is in favour of compulsory resumption. He would take from the big land monopolists their land, but would pay for it at the value which it has acquired through the construction of railways, and the expenditure of public money in other improvements. That, in mv opinion, is equivalent to confiscating public property. If land is resumed bv the </para>

                            <para>- While New Zealand has many natural advantages, it has progressed in spite of many disadvantages. Its progress since the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> came into office has been very great, as will be seen by comparing its present condition with its condition when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Julius</inline> Vogel's borrowing policy came- to an end. Thousands of families there are now settled on what were once mere sheep runs. The best estates in* Victoria and in New South Wales are not being properly used, because the owners, being well off, are content to make an easy living bv producing wool, which is one of the most profitable of industries. Land which is suitable for agriculture is not now even stocked to its full carrying capacity. It is a blackfellows policy to say that nothing should be done to put an end to this state of things. The right honorable member for East Sydney has said that we should leave the taxation of land to the States. No doubt he expressed the views of his' party, and certainly of such sup porters as the Federated Employers' Union, whose members, on the motion of a big squatter, carried a resolution against the proposed tax. Is it likely that land taxation of the kind we propose will be carried in any . of the States, having regard to the constitution of their second Chambers ? Do we not know what has happened in New South Wales? There, when the right honorable member for East Sydney first proposed his land tax of a id. in the £, the Upper House threw it out, without consideration, by a majority of forty-one to four. But, although the right honorable member had been only twelve months in office, he at once appealed to the country, and was thus able to force the proposal through. </para>

                            <para>- No one has suggested! the transfer of control. The honorable member asks that question in order to. frighten people. The second Chambers of the States Parliaments are constituted! largely of land-holders, and will always, oppose legislation likely to interfere with their class interests. Therefore, when the right honorable member for East Sydney and his followers say that this is a matter which should be left to the States, we are justified in accusing them of deliberately attempting to prevent the bursting up of large estates. The position would' be different if it were likely that the Parliaments of the States would impose land" taxation' with that object. But only recently, when communications were passing' between the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the States with a view to making arrangements for the providing of land' for immigrants, the Commonwealth authorities could get no satisfaction from the States authorities. Victoria possesses only 13,800 acres of first-class Crown land,. South Australia has none, and that of New South Wales is so tied up that it cannot be utilized. In the last-named State some big estates have been recently resumed, and there are immigrants from England'.' settled upon' them. </para>

                            <para>- If the matter is left to the States, nothing will be done. Here in Victoria the cry has been1 raised that the income tax should be reduced, although, as I have shown, the land taxation paid by the whole Commonwealth amounts to only a little over £500,000 per annum. The right honorable member for East Sydney justified his action in introducing a land taxation measure in New South Wales by stating that, in view of the great advantages they enjoyed, the wealthy classes did not pay a sufficient amount of taxation. He also mentioned other good reasons why a tax should be imposed upon landed property. When he was addressing the public in Sydney upon the subject of the proposed Commonwealth Constitution, he stated that if he entered the Federal Parliament he would adopt an attitude similar to that assumed by him in the State Legislature. He has not done so, but has been content to leave the whole question of land taxation practically untouched. It is absolute nonsense to talk about bringing immigrants to Australia until the present conditions with regard to land settlement are radically changed. I submit that a land tax will have to be imposed for revenue purposes, if with no other object in view. We cannot make provision for the payment of old-age pensions, nor can we carry out a proper protective policy, unless we raise revenue from other sources than Customs and Excise duties. It is our dutv to lead the way for the States. When, in spite of the lengthy stone wall, we passed the Commerce Act some of the States adopted measures of a supplementary character, with a view to prevent the public from being imposed upon by manufacturers of unwholesome food preparations. </para>

                            <para>- I take that statement as a high compliment. I think that I am pretty safe when the honorable member is opposed to me. In dealing, to the limited extent that the Constitution permits us to do, with a number of matters which we have made the subject of legislation, we have set an example to the States, which has in many cases been followed with beneficial results to the general community. The States Parliaments, owing to the obstructive methods adopted by their Upper Houses, cannot deal effectively with large landed estates, and it is our clear duty, as a Parliament elected upon a thoroughly democratic basis, to take up this question, and impose taxation upon the land in such a way as to check monopoly and afford natural outlets for settlement. We should certainly take steps in this direction before we attempt to encourage immigration. Our own people ought to be our first consideration. Even if we impose a land tax, a great deal of work will still have to be done by the States before any general policy of land settlement can be entered upon. If we do not impose a tax upon land, with a view to affording better opportunities for settlement, and turning the soil to more profitable account, we shall be forced to adopt some such measure in order to obtain revenue, and the Government would do well to take up this subject and submit it to the country at the next elections. In view of the 'financial changes that will shortly take place, and of the increasing necessities of the Commonwealth, the Treasurer has not given that thought that he should have done to the question of land taxation. The best way in which we can meet the necessities of the case is by imposing a good rousing progressive land tax. If we impose a tax that is considered to be too high, the States can easily adjust their taxes accordingly. There is no difficulty in reducing taxation, but many obstacles are placed in the way of imposing taxation, or increasing it, particularly when it affects the pockets of land monopolists. </para>

I am s,ure that his statement will attract considerable attention, and that it will be read with interest by our friends and others abroad. I am sure that those who read the Treasurer's speech must wonder what kind of persons he was addressing, and whether they would be able to assimilate the whole of the voluminous but interesting information that his Budget contained. &gt; I do not propose at this stage to deal with matters which may, perhaps, be discussed with greater advantage when the Estimates are being considered in detail. I wish to address myself more particularly to the question of the transfer of the States debts. I trust that honorable members will read closely and carefully the admirable memorandum which has been prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> A. Coghlan, the Agent-General for New South Wales.

                    <para>Many sanguine forecasts have been made as to the monetary gain arising by the transfer of the State debts to the Commonwealth. It has been seriously contended that the rate of interest, 3.7 per cent., which our loans now average, can probably be reduced by the operation "of. consolidation and conversion to under 3 per cent. This is a hope impossible to realize, though, as already stated, we may look forward to a time (perhaps not far distant) when, the States and the Commonwealth working harmoniously for the good of the Australian people, and the unmistakable but unwarranted distrust of Australia now existing in London being removed, the Commonwealth Government will be able to obtain for the renewal of loans falling due, terms so advantageous as will materially reduce the interest bill now to be paid. </para>
                    <para class="block">An authoritative statement of that kind must receive our fullest consideration when we are dealing with proposals such as have recently been submitted to the House. It behoves us to ascertain, if possible, why the Commonwealth, which was founded under such happy auspices, should have drifted into its present unsatisfactory position. The explanation, is not to be found in the state of our trade, or the condition of the community generally, because the Treasurer had the privilege of submitting one of the most satisfactory Budgets that has ever beep presented to an Australian Parliament. Therefore, it is necessary for us to consider whether our legislation or the general trend of our politics is such as to account for the position which we occupy. Apart, however, from that consideration, there is in the document to which I refer informative matter which I venture, with becoming diffidence, but with all sincerity, to commend to the attention of every honorable member who has the slightest interest in the future of the Commonwealth. As honorable members are aware, several schemes have been submitted at various periods for taking over the States debts. When the right honorable member for Balaclava filled the office of Treasurer, he submitted to the Hobart Conference of Premiers most excellent representations regarding the difficulties which underlie the transfer of those debts. His successor, in presenting his Budget the other day, laid before honorable members recommendations which bear the specific <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of Government approval. That is the first occasion upon which such proposals have come before us in an authoritative form. The honorable member for Mernda has also outlined a scheme for the consolidation of the States debts. I yield to nobody in my appreciation of that honorable member's capacity to deal with that subject. But I have given very close consideration to his recommendations, and I regret to say that I find myself unable to agree with many of them. He has looked far into the future, and it may possibly be that  twenty-five  years hence we should be in a favorable position to investigate his proposals. His scheme is an elaborate and complete one, and constitutes  an attempt to secure finality so far as the redemption of the States' indebtedness is concerned. But I venture to say that his recommendations are not such as the individual States can accept at the present juncture. I think, further, that he has strained a very important section of the Constitution when he suggests that the Commonwealth should render financial assistance to the States in this connexion. It was never intended by the framers of our Constitution that any State should receive from the Commonwealth such a large sum as the honorable member suggests. On the contrary, I hold that section 96 of our Constitution, which provides that financial assistance may be rendered by the Commonwealth to the States, relates only to temporary assistance. Certainly, such assistance was never contemplated in connexion with the States' indebtedness. In short, the scheme of the honorable member - if effect were given to it - would result in a unification!. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. Personally, I am indifferent as to the source from which the proposal may emanate, but I am satisfied that, until effect is given to some such arrangement as I have suggested, we cannot satisfactorily carry out any scheme for the transfer of the States debts. I do not think the honorable member for Mernda has attached sufficient weight to the fact that, so far as the responsibilities of the States to the Commonwealth are concerned, we are now passing through a transition stage. We have to recognise that during the next fifteen years a great change will probably take place in our population. If present conditions were to continue, the outlook would be a bad one indeed for the whole of the Commonwealth. We can only hope for an expansion of our population, which will entirely change our present view of the situation. I regard the scheme submitted by the Treasurer as a more practical one than that which has been presented by the' honorable member for Mernda, and I think that it is likely to meet with a more ready acceptance by the States. It has always been my desire that we should, adopt a system that would induce the States and the Commonwealth to work harmoniously together, and I feel that we shall never succeed in solving this problem until we are able, as it were, to carry the States with us. We shall do injury to our people if we refrain from taking action until the end of the Braddon period, and then endeavour to use what may be regarded as a coercive lever to induce the States to fall into line. with us. We should clearly and definitely indicate that, as a Parliament, we feel that we have no right to take any step that would be subversive of the claims of the various States. I am sure that the electors would indorse such an attitude." I had intended to deal at some length with the proposals submitted by the Treasurer, the honorable member for Mernda, and the honorable member for North Sydney, but I feel much more at home when discussing the details of such a question as this at a round table than I do when addressing myself to it in general terms in 'Committee. The honorable member for North Sydney has submitted what is practically a modification of the scheme propounded bv the honorable member for Mernda. His proposition appears to me to be a most liberal one, and indicates that the honorable member, who is always careful to master the facts of any matter with which he deals, has secured a complete grip of the position. Suggestions have been made by the Treasurer and his predecessor - the right honorable member for Balaclava - as well as by the honorable member for Mernda and the honorable member for North Sydney, which I feel could be so welded together as to produce a scheme satisfactory alike to the States and to the Commonwealth. I have no desire to detain the Committee by dealing at length with the excellent statement prepared by the honorable member for North Sydney, but, speaking generally, I think that we shall fail in our efforts to solve the problem of the transfer of the States debts unless we take the whole of them over at one operation. If we deal with them in a piecemeal fashion, we shall seriously prejudice our future operations. I am opposed to the proposal that we should at once do away with the bookkeeping system. I have ascertained from business men in this city that they have become so accustomed to it that it now causes them but little inconvenience. As a matter of fact, from a statistical point of view, it is highly advantageous, and will continue to be so until we acquire a closer knowledge of Inter-State conditions, and until our population settles down, and our lands become more fully occupied. I agree with the Treasurer and his predecessor that it would be a mistake to discontinue the operation of the Braddon section at the present juncture, and that, for the sake of securing harmony between the States and the Commonwealth, the bookkeeping system should be continued until 1920. </para>

                            <para>- I hold that we have not yet arrived at a proper understanding as to what is the true indebtedness of the States. We have not yet reduced the debts to a common standard such as will be necessary if we adopt the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system. I have pointed out in a memorandum, which has been circulated, that not only, does the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> incidence of the principal vary, but the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> incidence of the interest also varies to such an extent that we cannot possibly apply the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system until we have reduced the whole of the debts to a common standard. I agree with the suggestion that we should adopt a 3 per cent, basis. I would draw attention to the fact that, whereas the total debts of the States amount to £236,680,739, the funded debts of Victoria amount to £51,513,767, whilst she has also an unfunded debt of £2,476,609. This State has also a municipal and corporation debt amounting to £13,182,377, but the municipal obligations of New South Wales amount to only £2,941,939. Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia have also a very small municipal indebtedness. This is due to the fact that in Victoria we have had for many years a very complete municipal system - a system which, until quite recently, was not in operation in the other- States. I feel that in order that we may arrive at a fair recognition of what are the responsibilities of the States, we must take into, consideration this municipal indebtedness, since in Victoria it has been largely incurred in carrying out public works which in New South Wales have been undertaken by the Government. This is a point worthy of being considered when we proceed to determine the individual responsibilities of the States. It is true that the Constitution does not contemplate the taking over of municipal debts, but if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system were adopted, we should be taking over a large amount of indebtedness incurred by the Government of New South Wales in carrying out work undertaken in Victoria by municipalities. </para>

The honorable member for Mernda has proposed the appointment of a Committee for another purpose ; but a body such as I speak of is necessary, not only to deal with the actual transfer, but to bring the various proposals which have been made into harmony, so that the very best results may be obtained from them. When dealing with mv proposal for the establishment of a council of finance for the Commonwealth of Australia, I shall elaborate my views on this subject. I intend to ask for the appointment of a Commission, to consist of members of the Commonwealth and of the States Parliaments, for the drafting of a scheme for the transfer of the debts of the States1 to the Commonwealth, and the making of recommendations as to the constitutional amendments and powers required. These recommendations will have to be submitted to the various Parliaments before effect can be given to them. My suggestion is that all the proposals which have been put forward for the transfer of the debts of the States shall be submitted to this Commission. In this way we shall secure the co-operation of the States. I shall not, however, deal with the matter fully to-night. I wish to repeat what I have already contended, - that we must not expect that the Braddon section will not be renewed. I am sure that the States will not agree to its ceasing to have effect at the end of the period provided for in the Constitution. We can, however, accomplish nothing of a satisfactory and useful character in connexion with these large financial transactions unless: we appoint some such body as I have spoken of. The Debts Commissioners of England were first appointed by Pitt in 1786, and very many Acts of Parliament have been passed imposing upon them new obligations. They were appointed chiefly to see to the proper investment of various sums, and their application to the reduction of the national debt. Their last report gives particulars of what they have done, and their work is a splendid example of what can be accomplished by a body of men which has assigned to it special functions of this nature. A similar Commission exists in Egypt, and in South Australia our Speaker, when Treasurer of the State, appointed another body of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- It was originally appointed to control the interests1 of the various nationalities, and each nation concerned appoints one or two representatives. They have great powers in regard to the distribution of interest, the undertaking of public works and the management of the debt. The functions of the Commissioners suggested by the honorable member for Mernda would not be so wide as those of the body which I should like to see created. It .may interest honorable members to be informed as to the constitution of the English Commission, ft consists 'of the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Chancellor of His Majesty's Exchequer, the Master of the Rolls, the Accountant General of the Court of Chancery, and the Deputy-Governor of the Bank of England for the time being. All these are men of high standing and wide experience, and I think we should do well if we appointed a similar .body of men to help us in arriving at a solution of this most important question. I think the Treasurer has presented a scheme which, with one or two modifications, might prove effective. He has properly guarded himself in regard to the payment of a lump sum to each of the States, by proposing to take power to levy extra duties in the event of it becoming necessary to make good a deficit in the Commonwealth funds, or to provide funds to meet any special emergency. I have endeavoured to ascertain whether it is proposed to take any definite action during the present session, but all the information that is vouchsafed by the Treasurer is that a Bill is in preparation. I would ask honorable members to seriously consider whether we should not at once proceed to appoint a Commission to consider the various proposals that have been made for the proper adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and to formulate a scheme for overcoming the difficulties which now present themselves. I think we should endeavour to secure the cooperation of the States in this matter, and that we should go the length of inviting them to appoint representatives to the proposed Commission. I do not mean that individual States should be represented, but that, say, two experts should be appointed to represent the whole of the States, and to co-operate with two representatives of the Commonwealth, the four experts having a Judge of the Supreme Court to preside over them as Chairman. I have been able to deal with only the very fringe of this great question, and I shall take an opportunity at a later stage of putting forward my ideas in a memorandum in which I shall endeavour to clothe the skeleton presented by me in this Chamber two years ago. </para>

                        <para>.- -The honorable member for Kooyong is to be complimented upon the careful research that he has evidently given to the financial questions with which he has dealt, and I am sure that, when he presents his memorandum honorable members will be only too glad to give it their best attention. I have been looking through the Budget papers, and I should like to give honorable members the result of an analysis of some of the figures, which may throw some light upon the alleged extravagance of the Commonwealth. We have heard much about the great incubus which' the Federal Parliament and Departments are proving. People who talk glibly about Federal extravagance -forget that machinery had to be provided for an expansion of population. For instance, in the United States, machinery was provided in the beginning which has practically remained unaltered. In the first instance, the representation provided for was in the ratio of one member to 30,000 electors, whereas, through the automatic operation of the provisions of the Constitution and the increase of population, the representation in 1894 was in the proportion of one member to every 195,000 electors. Similarly, we began with machinery that was, perhaps, too large for our population at the time, but, in view of the fact that written Constitutions are more or less rigid, we had to provide for the growing necessities of a young community. I find from the figures supplied by the Treasurer that last year the revenue amounted to £1^897,343, and the expenditure to £4,494,841, whilst the amount returned to the States was -£7.-384&gt;5°2. Now, I shall deal with the expenditure which is sometimes referred to as indicating Federal extravagance. That is owing to the fact that it is not subjected to the analysis it ought to receive. Last year the " other," or new, expenditure amounted to £827,355. I have seen it mentioned in the public press that this is the expenditure that is caused by Federation. The words "other" expenditure, however, are used to cover three classes of expenditure, and that is how the mistake arises. One class of " other " expenditure amounts t0 £5o8&gt;000&gt; whilst £318,488 is provided for new works, rifles, &amp;c, items of expenditure which, under the old State system, would have been debited to loan, but which, under our healthier system of finance, have to be paid out of revenue. Therefore, even if we divide the other expenditure into these two parts, we must reject £318,488 as not being included in the cost of the Commonwealth. If we further analyze the figures we arrive at this position : £318,488 was devoted to new works, &amp;c. ; then policy, and not machinery, was accountable for an expenditure of the £154,706 which was devoted to the payment of sugar bonuses. Non-recurring expenditure amounted to £25,000, and the balance of £309,161 represented the actual cost of the Federal machinery. If the electors are not satisfied with the total of "other" expenditure, they have the remedy in their own hands, except as regards £309,000. They can, by deciding to adopt a different policy, do away with the rest of the expenditure. But, it may be said that next year there will be a very large increase upon the :amount expended last year. It is estimated that £1,197,147 will be expended, and I find that £376,895 may be regarded as representing the cost of Federation. At the outset that appears to be a rather large increase upon the actual expenditure for 1905-6, but an examination of the estimates shows that there is a very large item of non-recurring expenditure under the heading of electoral expenses. £50,000 is provided to defray the cost of the Federal elections as against an actual expenditure of £1,925 last year. Then the expenses expected to be incurred under the Electoral Act amount to £21,000 as against an actual expenditure of £16,256 last year. Census and statistics account for £8,700. Thus, in the Estimates for the current year we have non-recurring expenditure totalling £79,000 as against £18,000 last year. I do not wish to quote the figures, but, comparing the revenue and expenditure for 1901-2 with the revenue and expenditure for 1905-6, and noting the amounts returned to the States in the respective years, we have not retrograded. There has been an increase of revenue, but not a corresponding increase of expenditure. There has been a slight increase, but not so great an advance as the net increase of revenue would justify, in the amount returned to the States. A much larger amount would have been returned to the States if we had adopted a wiser policy. Here, again, the result is not due to the machinery of Federation, but is capable of being controlled by the electors. If we were to cut down the loss which we annually incur by paying a bounty to the sugar industry, and if we refused to waste money ' upon the Post and Telegraph Department merely to bring kudos to a particular 'Minister, we might be afforded an opportunity - without resorting to additional taxation - to make provision for the payment of old-age pensions. If we acted in the way I suggest, we should bring about a healthy state of affairs, because a good many of the items of expenditure during the past three years are of a nonrecurring character. They really represent capital expenditure which under the old system would have been taken out of loan moneys. For instance, I find that in 1904-5 the Defence vote included a capital outlay of £200,259; in 1905-6, it was £171,572; while during the current year the amount is estimated at £182,177. All that expenditure is non-recurring. It represents a special expenditure which was made upon the recommendation of Major-General Hutton. I think that up to the end of June, 1905, something like £400,000 has been expended in that way. </para>

                            <para>- -I think that I am fairly justified in saying that it is non-recurring expenditure. Of course, the one Department about which a person may justifiably be sceptical is the Defence- Department. I do not know how we stand in regard to it. One Minister of Defence appears to know everything about defence matters - if we are to judge by his pronouncements in this House, and in the press - but his successor at once reverses his policy. In the same way the commanding officer of our Military Forces believes in reliance on a land force for the defence of the Commonwealth, whereas our Naval Director entertains an entirely contrary view. For instance, Captain Creswell, on 10th November, 1905, recommended the construction during the course of seven years of three cruiser destroyers, sixteen torpedo boat destroyers, and fifteen torpedo boats at a cost of £1,768,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">In view of the policy which has been adopted during the past five years, and of the conflict of opinion which exists between the Military and Naval authorities, it behoves us vo be a little cautious when Ministers come down with elaborate estimates of expenditure. I have already mentioned that if we did not waste money in paying a bounty to the sugar industry </para>
                    <para>Ave should occupy a much stronger position than we do. I take the Estimates of the present year to illustrate my point. The bounty to be paid to Queensland represents £240,000, and that to New South Wales £38,500, or a total of £278,500.' But we have to add to that sum the difference between th.e revenue which was derived from the industry in 1902-3 and that which it is estimated will be received during the current year. The position is that in 1902-3 the revenue received from this source was £780,448, whereas during the present year it is calculated that it will amount to only £628,000. In other words, there will be a shrinkage in our revenue of £152,448, which, added to the £278,500 outlay upon the bounty, will make a total loss in connexion with our policy of offering special treatment to the sugar industry of £430,948. I wonder how the electors of Australia will appreciate that policy when the position is properly put before them, as I hope it will be within the next few months. I hold that we are absolutely wasting money in this connexion. What justification is there for paying New South Wales £38,500 a year, seeing that in 1901 89.7 per cent, of the acreage under cane cultivation in that State employed white labour, as against only 90 per cent, in 1905-6. </para>

                            <para>- Do the Government urge that? Is that the way in which our constitutional power is interpreted ? Are we to lose £38,000 yearly owing to the bungling of Ministers? The idea underlying the interjection of the Treasurer is that, in giving effect to a uniform policy, we cannot avoid incurring that loss. But I would point out that what we are required to do under the Constitution is to have a law uniform in application, but not necessarily in effect. I suggested at the time this question was under consideration that the law should provide that the bounty should be paid only in cases where white labour had been substituted for black labour. Unfortunately, we have a Government in office which is incapable of seeing that that is the true solution of the sugar problem. </para>

                            <para>- I now come to the debts question. One would imagine from the utterances of honorable members that the problem presented in connexion with this scheme had not previously been faced. But as a matter of fact there is not a difficulty with which we are now confronted which was not touched upon by members of the Federal Convention. For instance, it was pointed out that without the consent of the States the Commonwealth would not be able to take over the debts which accrued after1901. I emphasized the fact that even debts that were subsequently converted could not be taken over. But nothing was done. The public were told that within a few years after the establishment of the Federation a tremendous saving of interest would be effected on account of the reputation which the Commonwealth would have gained for its solvency. Personally, I have never heard of a saving of any magnitude having been made except where debts were maturing. In 1888 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goschen</inline> introduced two big conversion schemes, aggregating about £600,000,000, but about half of the amount represented securities which were redeemable at once, and the balance was redeemable at twelve months' notice. The merit of his policy was that he risked the possibility of the market being against him. and of the bond-holders asking for cash, when he gave notice of redemption, and was successful. In the Federal Convention I pointed out that there was nothing to be gained through (consolidation of the debts. I said - </para>

Before it can gain a reputation for solvency it must do something to justify it, and honorable members are mistaken when they think that the English creditors are going to jump at a Federal security until they see how the forces operate in the Federal Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It is that which causes the appreciation which is going on in the Canadian 3 per cents. I would like honorable members to say how it is that the unitary system of France shows a better result than does the Federal system in Germany ? If a Federal system, apart from the result of proper financing, and because of the stability of its assets, appreciates its securities, it is extraordinary that, so far as its 3 per cent, bonds are concerned, Germany is in a worse position than is France. In 1904-5 the right honorable member for Balaclava confirmed the remarks which I quoted just now. He said - </para>

You can at all events absorb the whole surplus . . . . and the question now remains whether it would not be better for the Commonwealth to assume liabilities corresponding approximately to the aggregate of the surplus, and thus get over the difficulty of making periodical payments to the States, and whether you would or not by doing that remove any timidity from the minds of the States Treasurers as to their liabilities for public debts. </para>

                            <para>- We should strike a fair average of the amounts returned in respect of past years, and make a fair allowance fpr an increase. I do not see why we should return to the States a fixed sum based upon an average of what has already been returned to them. Our population must increase. If the Customs revenue largely expands - and if must grow - is the Commonwealth to return only a sum based upon past results? Surely the people are 1.0 be considered in their State as well as in their Federal relations? Great credit is taken by the Commonwealth for the fact that it returns every year a large surplus to the States. One would think that it was intended that the Federation, the moment it was established, should absorb the whole of its possible share of revenue. Surely it was not anticipated that we should do anything of the kind? </para>

                    <para>Mr.GLYNN.- That is so. As a member of the Convention. I tabled, not only a motion relating to this question, but one designed to remove the difficulty in regard to the transferred properties, by proposing that we should take over a corresponding proportion of the debts of the States. At the time <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> - then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -</inline> Barton seemed to favour the proposal, and called upon the leading financial authorities - the then Treasurers of the States - to express an opinion upon it. If I remember rightly, however, almost every one of them declared that it was not a good one. But what is the present position? The very principle that I then enunciated is embodied in the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act. It is true that it has not been put into operation owing to the disinclination of the States to accept such a solution of the difficulty, but the fact remains that, although the principle was objected to by the so-called financial experts of that time, it is now embodied in Commonwealth legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. What folly it is to suggest that we should cause a valuation of , the transferred properties to be made, and hand over their capital value to the States. Surely, as regards payments, they will have to be dealt with eventually on theper <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> principle. Our position is very like that of a partnership in which men with different aggregates of capital come together, and all that remains to be done is to adjust the difference. If we do not accept that solution, we must take over a part of the indebtedness which will wipe out at all events a portion of the values to be credited to each of the States, in respect of the transferred properties. If we do this, and also take over a proportion of the indebtedness of the States, the interest on which will be. sufficient to absorb the surplus returnable, the system may not at first work perfectly, but it will, at all events, rid us of the timidity of the States Treasurers in regard to their liabilities. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer. An effort was made in the Convention to bring the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distribution into force, if not on the expiration of the bookkeeping period, at 'all. events at the expiration of ten years from its initiation. If I remember rightly, I tabled a motion at the sitting of the Convention in Melbourne, but, unfortunately, it was dealt with at 3.30 a.m. It was then decided to trust to the Federal Parliament the solution of the difficulty. The time must come when we must apply the surplus on the unitary principle. There must be at some time or other an inequality in the distribution, but what has been the position with regard to Great Britain and Ireland? For many years, there was in force what I may be permitted to describe as a system of bookkeeping finance, and a portion of that system was continued until l8S3- Afterwards, there was, to a large extent, an amalgamation of the finances, although Ireland has been paying <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> a far larger share than is justifiable according to the capacity to pay of the component parts of the Union. </para>

In the excellent appendices that have been placed in our hands, he shows that the receipts from Customs and Excise average £2 4s. 2d. per head of the population, but the position in regard to Western Australia is a source of trouble. It is estimated that the receipts from Customs and Excise in that State, leaving out, of course, the returns under the special Tariff which expires at the end of this year, average £3 :14s. per head. </para>

Why did the Convention prescribe that, the bookkeeping system should be compulsory for a period of five years, and that it should thereafter be dealt with according to the wisdom of the Parliament? Surely it was thought that at the end of the five years period we should have sufficient data to enable us to adopt a. system which would be contemplated as final. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish that consideration, however, to affect my argument. Tasmania in the first year of the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff suffered a shrinkage of about £161,000 in her revenue, and, although we might introduce a system that apparently might not do perfect justice to one of the States f or a few years, we ought to remember that the Tariff for the last five or six years has been unequal in its incidence upon the component States of the Union. I do not wish to trespass further on the time of the Committee. 1 have simply presented a few figures, which it occurred to me during a rather hurried perusal of the Treasurer's papers ought to be impressed upon those who seek to discount the good work done bv the Federation. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the statement of the honorable member, and I am merely pointing out to the Committee that we ought to be careful what steps we take, lest we make the position worse for those who come after us. I agree with the honorable member for Angas that no saving could be effected by the Commonwealth immediately taking over the whole of the debts of the States, and that we may only hope to secure economy by taking over the loans as they fall due. We must possess our souls in patience until the States have loans falling due, when we may proceed to take action, if we feel that we are in a position to do something in this connexion. I do not think that any good result would follow an attempt on our part to convert the whole of the loans of the States. The evidence is against any serious proposal in that direction at the present juncture. <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> points out that the market value of the 3 per cent, stocks of this State range from £84 to , £85, that Queensland 3 per cent, stock is quoted at £84, and that Tasmania's 3 per cent, stock is quoted at £85. On the other hand, he quotes figures showing that the 3 per cent, stocks of the Canadian Dominion have a market value of £96. We should endeavour to borrow on equally advantageous terms, but I am afraid that at present we shall not be able to do so. The favorable position of the stocks of the Dominion of Canada should furnish a powerful reason for seeking to improve our credit. We must improve our credit before talking of borrowing more money. By obtaining gold to a substantial amount, and then buying Australian bonds, we should, after two or three years, find our credit increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> does not suggest that we shall be able at once to retrench or reduce our interest bill. He says - </para>

                        <para>The extent of the reduction in principal or in interest which the Commonwealth will ultimately be able to secure when it undertakes the redemption or renewal of the State loans is, of course, purely a matter of speculation which a series of issues alone can determine. It would be wise, when dealing with the matter, not to count upon any great reduction available from this source at the outset of the new arrangements, though, as already pointed out, satisfactory results may ultimately be obtained. </para>

                    <para class="block">We have not reason to expect satisfactory results at present, but they will be obtained eventually. In years to come, our stocks' will have increased in value, and we shall then have to pay more than when we borrowed or converted. Let us, therefore, first go into the market as buyers. By doing so we shall improve our position. Queensland has already done something of this sort, though almost by accident. It has certainly not been done of set purpose. When she found herself in possession of a Targe amount in gold with which she did not know what to do, she very sensibly applied it to the reduction of her debt. She bought £386,522 worth of bonds, and placed on deposit £85,000, while she has in her strong-room £317,000. This is a special fund which has been created by her Treasury-note issue. </para>

                            <para>- I think it would be a good one for the Commonwealth to adopt, though I do not intend to discuss that matter now. I feel that the suggestion of the honorable member for Angas as to the manner in which the transferred properties might be dealt with is the correct one. We might relieve each State of a portion of debt, which would balance the value of the properties transferred bv it to the Commonwealth, and, if we adopted a scheme similar to that of Queensland, we could use our available gold to buv up stock. The amount of stock which we could purchase would not be large, but we might invest £3,000,000, £4,000,000, or £5,000,000 in that way. This would greatly improve our financial position, and the time would come when we might very reasonably go on the market, not to buy up the stock, but to ask investors to agree to its conversion at lower rates of interest. In this way, we should increase our credit, and that would be an advantage to us when we wished to make use of it. </para>
