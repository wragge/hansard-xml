                        <para>- I notice that it has been decided to make a call of the Senate for the 18th inst., presumably in order to allow the general elections, to take place at the latter end of November. Next Tuesday is the 18th, and the Bill to which the call applies is not yet passed. Moreover, the Government have two other measures for the amendment of the Constitution. I should like to know what the Prime Minister proposes to do in connexion with them. Can the call apply to. them? </para>

                        <para>- I regret that the call was expressly limited to the measure before the Senate, although the representatives of the Government endeavoured to make it embrace the Bills on our notice-paper. Our intention is to dispose on Tuesday of the measures to which the honorable member refers, which can then go on to the Senate. I think that the House has made up its mind in. regard to them. </para>

                        <para>The extract quoted from the Commissioner's first report must be read in conjunction with the passages preceding and following it, from which it will be seen that the Commissioner only purported to enunciate the conditions affecting long service leave under the States laws as they existed at the actual date of transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth. Since that date, the Federal Parliament has legislated in the matter (section 71 of the <inline font-style="italic">Public Service Act</inline> 1902), the effect of which is that the State law regarding long service leave is superseded by that "of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt a million or two does not seem much to the honorable member. The action which the Government ask the Committee to take will be very far reaching in its effects. A little reflection will show how greatly, if adopted, it will strengthen the Empire. Although we do not ask for reciprocal treatment from Great Britain, I hope that' it will not be long before there will be complete reciprocity be tween the mother country and all her dependencies, as well as between the colonies themselves. Last night we discussed an agreement for reciprocal trade between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and I hope very shortly to make a similar proposition in regard to another British dependency. These steps are directed to the achievement of a great principle, the recognition of which will "draw the British-speaking people closer together, and protect their trade against those who are injuring it. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the establishment of. reciprocal relations between Great Britain and her colonies will cause a great influx of British white persons into Australia. We do not wish to see here a mixing of races like those in South America, and, to my mind, nothing will do more to keep our population white than a reciprocity agreement which will bring the various parts of the Empire into closer relationship. The honorable member for Lang, says that we are raising our duties in favour of Australian manufacturers. It will be early enough to protest against that when the duties approximate the rates in force in other countries. I am opposed to any reduction of rates, which are as low as assumed protectionist rates can be, because I am not in favour of a revenue Tariff. We do not want to bring into existence again a state of affairs similar to that in New South Wales prior to Federation. The improvement in the condition of the mother State, and especially of Sydney, by reason of the increase in manufacturing brought about by the Federal Tariff, is very noticeable. I do not want to go back to the old cheapness and poverty. </para>

                        <para>- What I borrowed was spent to good purpose. I do not believe in false economy, resulting in the non-development of the country. This proposal does not go so far . as I should like, but at the same time it will confer appreciable benefits, and will give British manufacturers a good margin to work upon. Our imports from foreign countries of articles affected by the proposed increases' of duty in 1905 were valued at , £961,848, and under the preferential arrangement the people of Great Britain should be able to considerably increase their exports to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Because I do not consider that there would be the slightest prospect of passing a comprehensive preferential trade scheme through Parliament at this stage of the session. I propose to take a vote upon the resolutions with regard to extending preference to the old country, before dealing with the schedule, in order that we may ascertain the feeling of honorable members with regard to the principle involved. If the proposed concessions are made, they will indicate to the British people that Australia is prepared to reciprocate with the mother country. Up to the present we have had no reciprocal proposal from "Great Britain, but I feel satisfied that if the proposed arrangement is carried into effect, negotiations will be opened up with a view to the exchange of products and manufactures under conditions of mutual advantage. </para>

                <para class="block">Commission. Although I never approved of the appointment of that Commission, I have paid due regard to its recommendations. If we wish to indicate to the people of England that we desire to enter into preferential trade relations with them, we cannot wak an indefinite rime. Moreover, I would point out that these proposals will not seriously affect any matters that may be reported upon by the Tariff Commission. We indicate the margin of preference, and the duties will rise and fall in accordance with that margin if they are altered upon the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. Therefore, I do not see what objection can be taken to our acting at the present time. As the average increase of duty against foreign goods is up to 10 per cent., and as for the last three years the average value of imports of articles mentioned in the schedule from countries other than the United Kingdom has been about £850,000, the transfer of, say. 25 per cent, of the foreign trade to the United Kingdom would result in an increase of revenue amounting to about £64,000. This increase would help us considerably, although- these proposals are not introduced in Order to swell the revenue. The revenue would fall in proportion, as the preference led to the greater displacement of foreign goods by British products. Of course, this calculation is based ora the assumption that no material displacement of imports by local manufactures will result from the readjustment of duties. Our total imports from all sources, exclusive of bullion, are valued at about £37,000,000, of which British imports represent £23,000,000. </para>

Unless we can obtain some preference that will induce our farmers to carry on their operations on a larger scale, arid lead to the adoption of improved methods of transportation such as are in use in other parts of the world, we cannot expect to develop our export trade to the point necessary to enable us to contribute as we should do towards meeting the requirements of the old country. Until that time arrives, we shall have to content ourselves by occupying the humiliating position of being able to supply only per cent, of the requirements of the old country in foodstuffs. I contend that we may reasonably look to Great Britain to afford us a market for our produce. </para>

It is only when duties are improperly imposed, or are placed on the wrong articles, that they bring about an increase of prices to the consumers. The duties on primary products have not increased the prices in our markets. </para>

                        <para>- If we could grow wheat upon a more extensive scale, and our transport arrangements were of the most efficient and up-to-date character, we should probably be able to sell our produce at cheaper rates than at present, and thereby confer benefit upon the consumers of Great Britain. There arc some items in this schedule which I do not wish to discuss in detail at the present moment. It has been pointed out to me that their inclusion may not be advantageous. One can only ascertain after very careful investigation whether they are used by our own people practically as raw material. I shall deal with that aspect of the question at a later stage, and I shall then be prepared to strike out any item which can be shown to be objectionable. I may mention that applications have also been made to me to insert in the schedule a number of articles of a manufactured or partially manufactured character, but until we are in a position to supply our own requirements in the matter of iron they will continue to represent the raw material of our local manufacturers. One must be very careful indeed of interfering to prevent the admission of semi-raw material unless we can supply it locally. I have no desire to labour this question. I recognise that we have very little time at our disposal. This is an important matter, and I hope that honorable members will be able to conclude the discussion upon it to-day. It must be recollected that it has practically been under consideration for two or three days past. Last evening, in listening to the debate upon the reciprocal Tariff agreement with New Zealand, I almost imagined that it was the discussion upon the proposal which I am now submitting. </para>

Latterly he has not had very, much time in which to prepare speeches upon the business before Parliament. He seems to have been engaged in more easy and popular duties elsewhere.

                        <para>- One has merely to attempt to detach oneself from the surroundings of this Chamber to realize how ludicrous that statement is. However, we have to make the best of the circumstances in which we find ourselves. The Government must accept responsibility for initiating this proposal in the closing hours of a session and of a Parliament. One cannot resist the temptation to say that the object of all these preferential proposals is very obvious. It is not intended that; they shall furnish an opportunity for a thorough discussion of preferential trade as such, but only that they shall enable the Ministry to put forward another political placard, which will do duty during the coming elections. One can imagine, for instance, how even a mere empty placard such as this will scintillate in the hands of a capable rhetorician like the Prime Minister. No doubt that is the primary object underlying the introduction of this proposal at so' late an hour of the session. We have been told by the Minister that it represents the initiation of a great principle, which is to extend as far as the Empire. So far as the principle and its application to the Empire are concerned, I think that all sections of- the House will find themselves upon absolutely common ground. There is no desire, so far as I am aware, to do anything contrary to, or in derogation of, any movement which has for its object the binding together of the constituent parts of the great Empire to which we belong. Therefore, we all echo the wish of the Minister that something shall be done in this direction. </para>

                        <para>- The favorite method of the Minister is to "bullock" through the House the work which he has in hand. When the Prime -Minister is in charge of a Bill he condescends to afford honorable members a reasonable explanation of its provisions, and, no doubt, exhausts his physical and mental energies in the effort to do so. But it is left to the working " bullock " of the team to get certain measures through without very much consideration and discussion. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister was never more correctly described than as the working " bullock " of the team. His methods of forcing business through the House - while it must be admitted that they are effective - are certainly not such as ought to be of universal application. If we were to apply them generally they would mean the speedy abolition of Parliament as a deliberative body. Of course, this Parliament has abrogated its deliberative functions for some time past, and there can be no clearer evidence of that than is afforded by the fact that we are discussing this important proposal when so few honorable members are in the Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to do anything to disturb the Minister's good temper. I am glad to see him in such an amiable mood. From the speech which he delivered this morning I gather that he looks forward to the time when there will be reciprocity between the Commonwealth and other portions of the Empire. Amongst other things, he hopes that as a result we shall secure an influx of white population. How in the world reciprocity - particularly upon the lines which have been sketched by the Minister himself - will lead to an influx of white population into the Commonwealth, I am at a loss to understand. I should think that the best way to induce an influx of white population is to remove some of the restrictions which the present Government have imposed upon the admission into Australia of the white immigrants from Europe and the United Kingdom. I do not mean to say that they should be permitted to come here and bring down our social conditions, or in any way to unfairly compete with our own people. But, nevertheless, there is room for the abolition of some of the enactments which now impede the ingress of a white population from the rest of the Empire and of Europe. If the Minister is sincerely desirous of peopling the northern parts of Australia with a white, contented, and happy population he cannot do better than remove the restrictions which have been imposed bv this Parliament and by this Government. There is another remark of the Minister to which I should like to advert, but there is so much confusion, reigning that I can scarcely hear my own voice, and, consequently, I think that we had better have a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> The Minister has declared that the reason why our Tariff has been raised against foreign countries - in other words, why a preference has been extended to Great Britain by increasing the duties levied upon foreign goods is that our Tariff was below the level of the Tariffs of other countries. He said that when our Tariff had reached the level of the Tariffs of other countries we might consider the propriety of reducing our duties as against imports from the United Kingdom. I presume that he had in his mind chiefly the Dominion of Canada. It is quite true that Canada has a higher Tariff than has the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The remarks of the Minister have no point unless they relate to countries within the Empire. I hold in my hand a statement showing the measure of the preference granted by Canada to the goods of the United Kingdom, and how it affects her trading relations with the mother country. The honorable gentleman says that if, for instance, we raised our duties to the level of those prevailing in Canada, we should be in a better position to grant reductions to the old land. What are the facts? The Canadian Tariff was increased, and the result is shown in figures supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> than whom I know of no more patient and careful investigator of these questions. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the total importations into Australia. We import goods to the value of £38,000,000, and of those importations £23,000,000 worth, or 60 per cent, of the total, come from Great Britain. The value of New Zealand's annual imports is nearly £13,000,000, and the value of those which she obtains from the United Kingdom is nearly £8,000,000, or 61 per cent. The value of Canada's imports is £50,000,000 per annum, and her imports from the United Kingdom! are of the value of only £12,000,000. Thus, in spite of her efforts to facilitate commercial intercourse with the mother country by means of a preference she has been able to direct the stream of .her imports in that direction to the extent of only £12,000,000 out of a total of £50,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that, and these figures should warn us to be careful as to how far we copy her example. Comparisons are continually being made between Australia and Canada, but there is no greater similarity between their position than there is between that of the most diverse countries in the world. Canada's contiguity to the United States triumphs over all fiscal efforts to divert her trade to Great Britain. She has granted a preference of 33^ per cent, to the products of that country, and yet she has succeeded in causing only 24 per cent, of her total imports to be drawn from that source. </para>

                <para>He goes on to point out that the preference given by Canada to Great Britain began to operate in 1898, and that by 1900 her imports from the United States had increased by 31,000,000 dollars, or 40 per cent., whilst her imports from Great Britain had increased by only 12,000,000 dollars, or only 37½ per cent. That is to say, two years after Canada's preference to Great Britain began to operate - she began with a preference of 25 per cent., which was subsequently increased to 331/3 per cent. - her imports from the United States had increased by 40 per cent., and her imports from the United Kingdom by only 37½ per cent. This return also shows the triumph of her geographical position over any fiscal arrangements that she has attempted to make. It shows the need to examine our own position. </para>

                        <para>- No one can say what it would have been. All we can point to is the actual result - that there has been not a relative increase, but rather a decrease in her trade with Great Britain as compared with the extension of her trade with the United States. It may be that, in the absence of a preference, there would have been a smaller or a greater trade with the United States, but on that point I cannot express an opinion. I have quoted figures showing the effect of the preference, and we have to consider them in the light' of the intention with which that preference was granted. They show that, what ever diversion of trade may have taken place in favour of the United Kingdom has been more than counterbalanced by the increase in the trade of the United States with Canada. I do not wish to push these figures to an unreasonable extent, but they show clearly that the Canadian preference has not been the success anticipated or desired. </para>

                        <para>- In 1897- before the preference was granted - the value of her imports from Great Britain was 29.412,188 dollars, as against 61,649,041 dollars in the case of her imports from the United States. In 1904 her imports from the United Kingdom were of the value of 61, 777, 574 dollars, whilst those obtained from the United States were of the value of 150.826,515 dollars. This shows that her effort to divert trade from the United States to Great Britain by means of a preference has not been attended with success. I give these figures for exactly what they are worth. They show that we need to exercise the greatest possible caution in accepting a system of preference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> points out that - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">He then goes on to show that in 1901 goods to the value of 33,447,056 dollars were obtained by Canada from the British Empire, whilst her imports from foreign countries were of the value of 72,522.700 dollars. In 1904, her importations from the British Empire were of' the value of 51,614,555 dollars, and those from other countries were valued at 97,295,021 dollars. Thus, having regard only to the dutiable goods on which the preference was intended to operate, the proportion of trade remained very much the same as before. The result of the preference to Great Britain has been to divert to her but little of the trade of her great competitor. The Minister suggests that we should increase our Tariff to the level of that of Canada, so that we may more readily reduce our duties in favour of Great Britain. If the result would be, as in the case of Canada, a corresponding diminution in our trade with the United Kingdom, and an increase in our trade with foreign countries, we ought not to do anything of the kind. I think that we ought to have a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> I should like to call the attention of honorable members to a few figures showing the bearing of the schedule, which has been submitted by the Government. I pointed out last night that when the two preferential proposals were read together, it would be seen that the trade with Great Britain and the rest of the Empire sustained more losses than gains - that the balance was against it, and that the preferences would prevent more trade with these countries than it was likely to facilitate. That fact becomes clear when we look into 'these proposals. For one or two reasons, the volume of additional imports pf British goods will be very small. In the first place, the foreign goods to which the schedule applies consist very largely of specialties, and therefore the trade in 'them cannot be diverted to any extent to Great Britain. The total imports of sixteen of these items amount, so far as I can ascertain, to an annual value 'of £2,250,000, and only about £750,000 worth of these goods come from foreign countries and British possessions. These figures differ, but not to any great extent, from those submitted by the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> makes this point quite clear in his examination. He points out that the total volume of trade affected by the schedule amounts to £2,291,439, of which £i,473&gt;189 comes from the United Kingdom, £20,531 from Canada, £6,274 from India,- and £838 from other British Possessions. Deducting the trade of the United Kingdom and other British Possessions from the total, <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> balance of <inline font-style="italic">£790,603</inline> is left, of which £432,533 comes from the United States. Therefore, the foreign trade involved in these preference proposals, putting aside the £432,533 from the United States, is worth only £329,306. Honorable members will see that it is farcical to propose a preference in regard to £790,603 out of a total importation of £38,000,000. The values of some of the principal lines of imports involved, and the countries from which they come, are shown in the following table: - </para>
                <para class="block">Therefore, only 13 per cent, of the goods enumerated came from foreign countries, and, no doubt, were specialties or patented productions, which could not be manufactured in the United Kingdom. Great Britain also practically monopolizes the trade to a lesser degree in regard to most of the other items in the schedule. The proposals of the Government affect the wrong items to facilitate British trade to any great extent, articles being selected in regard to which she has already practically a monopoly. The Prime Minister laid great emphasis on the statement that it is to be stipulated that .goods upon which a preference is granted must be brought here in British bottoms; but let us examine that concession. Last year the total number of vessels bringing goods direct from the United Kingdom to Australia was 300, of which 289 were British, and n foreign. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to it. The figures which I have read, and which have been prepared .by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> cover the shipping of last year which these proposals would have affected had they been operative then. The quantity of British goods coming here in foreign vessels last year was only 15,000 tons, or 1 1/2 per cent, of the whole importations. Therefore, that concession practically amounts to nothing. Moreover, if the number of foreign bottoms is reduced, and the cargoes of British ships increased, there will Le a corresponding increase in British freights. That is an economic fact which cannot be questioned, related as it is to the law of supply and demand. This will countervail the preference to a large extent. Another point which I wish to make is that a large number of articles which are grouped in the schedule are such as are manufactured in Australia. The object of raising the duties on them against the outside world is not to increase importations from the United Kingdom; the intention is undoubtedly to facilitate production here. But if more protection is thought to be necessary, it should be asked for straightforwardly. There should not be this attempt to sneak it in under the pretence of making concessions to the Empire. Some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> speaking at Akaroa, in New Zealand, made no bones about declaring1 that his object was to give the people of that Colony further protection. This is from a report of his remarks appearing in a New Zealand newspaper : - </para>

                    <para>At the conference of Premiers in London it was proposed that a rebate of 10 per cent, should be made on British merchandise, but I proposed increasing the Tariff on goods from foreign nations. This latter course will not increase imports from the mother country, but will check the imports from alien nations. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is a frank, full, and candid statement. He intended that it should result in increased protection to the people of New Zealand. He said that the latter course would not lead to an increase of imports from the mother country. Why should the Government pretend to give the mother country a preference in order that she may send more goods here, when their real object is to increase the protection to the local manufacturers ? It is not honest or straightforward to bring in, under cover of Imperial sentiment, protective duties that could not otherwise be imposed. The best judges agree that by means of these duties we cannot hope for the diversion of more than from £100,000 to £150,000 of trade from foreign countries to Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- There can be no doubt about that; and it is not honest to impose further protection for the benefit of Australian industries under the cover of preference. If this proposal, be taken in conjunction with the New Zealand treaty it will be found that while from £100,000 to £150,000 of foreign trade may be diverted into British channels at least £350,000 worth of trade will be diverted from Great Britain and British possessions. There is no trade preference in proposals which will bring about such results. As a scheme of preference the proposals now before us are absolutely inadequate. If the Government had desired to divert trade into British channels they could have included a number of items in the schedule which would have had that effect. For instance, instead of selecting the articles now in the schedule, as to which the United Kingdom has a practical monopoly, they could have chosen articles in regard to which foreign countries are competing keenly with Great Britain. Take the division "manufactures of metals.'"' There is the item of horseshoe nails. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports would probably say that the nails should be made here. </para>

                        <para>- Our importations of horseshoe nails from Great Britain last year were valued at £3,150, whilst those from foreign countries were valued at £8,170. This is one of the items which should have been included in the schedule, if it had been desired to divert trade into British channels. Then, again, take the item of " electrical materials." I believe that the United Kingdom to-day produces as good and up-to-date electrical materials as any other Country. We receive these articles from Great Britain to the value of £138,000, whilst the imports from foreign countries are valued at £67,000. Why not try to divert this trade into British channels? Then there is the item nails and staples. Great Britain supplies us with £16,000 worth, whilst from foreign countries we receive £44,000 worth. Then in re- gard to wire, iron and steel, we receive from Great Britain £30,000 worth, and from foreign countries £296,000 worth. Why should we not give Great Britain a preference with regard to these articles, and afford her an opportunity to acquire a greater share of the trade? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has not the remotest idea of the point I am making. I am merely emphasizing the fact that we receive from foreign countries a much larger quantity of the goods I have described than are sent to us from Great Britain, and I am arguing that we should endeavour to afford Great Britain, an opportunity to acquire a larger share of the trade. </para>

                        <para>- What I am speaking of has nothing to do with the question of local production. The point is whether, until we do produce these articles for ourselves, we should obtain our supplies from foreign countries or from Great Britain. I am pointing out that if we wish Great Britain to secure an appreciable share of the trade now enjoyed by foreigners, such items as I have mentioned should be made the subject of preference to the old country. Wire-netting is in the same category. Of this, we receive £220,000 from the United Kingdom, and £11.5,000 worth from foreign countries. Of barbed wire, we receive £11,000 worth from the United Kingdom, and £60,000 worth from other countries. Of wire, n.e.i., £27,000 worth comes from the United Kingdom and £30,000 worth from foreign countries. Of the articles I have mentioned, we import from foreign countries £622,000 worth, which is almost as large a sum as that represented by our imports from foreign countries in respect of the articles mentioned in the schedule. The items I have indicated are such as should be made the subject of. preference to the mother country. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member pointed out - and the figures sustain him - that out of the total of £10,000,000 worth of foreign importations, we endeavour - and we shall not succeed in that - to divert less than if per cent, into British channels. He points out, further, that the Government proposals deal with only 4^ per cent, of our total imports from foreign countries and British possessions, and that the twenty-five items contained in -the schedule represent only one-nineteenth of the value of our imports, or about .£2,000,000 worth out of £38,000,000. Of this ,£z, 000, 000 worth, Great Britain already supplies us with 66 per cent. If the Government had been selecting items upon which they ought not to operate, they could not have compiled a better schedule. If their intention had been to choose items upon which preference would be ineffective, they could not have done better than they have. The reason is obvious. They have selected articles which are being manufactured here, so that by the simple method of putting up the duties as against the foreigner they would increase the protection, to local manufacturers, and at the same time retain the barriers that at present exist as against British goods. It has been- said that the proposal of the Government is comparable to the old fable of the mountain being, in labour and bringing forth a mouse. This is a preferential mouse with a vengeance, and it has been brought forth after a mountain of labour extending over three years. Is it to be imagined that the shrewd merchants and politicians of the mother country will not see through a shallow device of this kind?Thev will at once discover that we have selected as subjects for preference goods which are being manufactured here in large quantities, and that this is nothing more nor less than a cunningly conceived contrivance for granting further protection to our own manufacturers. They will realize that it will not be of the slightest benefit to them. The Minister is anxious to see the time when we shall be able to reduce our duties as applied to the rest of the Empire. </para>

Unless the object be to facilitate trade within the Empire, I fail to understand what it can be. At any rate, I think that the interjections of the Minister make his purpose quite clear. That purpose is to maintain for Australia as high a measure of protection as possible against every part of the Empire. We must recollect that the objective of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> is to negotiate reciprocal treaties with foreign countries. He has stated again and again that he desires to make use of a lever to enable him to reduce the duties of the rest of the world as against Great Britain. That is the declared object both of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chamberlain</inline> and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour.</inline> They say that they are not protectionists, but that they merely wish to use protective duties as ai lever against the rest of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I will tell the honorable member very plainly what I favour before I resume my seat. If that be the ultimate object of this preferential trade movement all over the Empire, how is it to be gained by the simple method of increasing duties against the rest of the world? This experiment has been tried again and again. It is an old proposal in a new garb. Ever since time began, these reciprocal treaties have been arranged, and in nearly every instance they have failed to accomplish their purpose. They have failed not because it was impossible to. make an arrangement which seemed to be theoretically fair, but because when that arrangement had been made human nature, allied to the great law of supply and demand which- operates upon such a large scale in relation to industrial matters, has constantly compelled them to fail. Everybody who has read <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Farrer's <inline font-style="italic">Fair Trade</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Free-trade</inline> will be familiar with the experience of Great 'Britain in this respect. I have here a statement of the step which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> took in the same direction many years ago. At that time the British, duties against the goods of foreign countries were at the highest possible point - much higher than that at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> aims at putting them to-day. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> ' Peel, during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Peel Administration from 1841. to 1845 made strenuous efforts to conclude a reciprocal Tariff arrangement. They were men who, in commercial acumen and resource, were, at least, the equal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain.</inline> I say that without any desire to underrate the latter. In some respects I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> as the biggest figure upon the political horizon today. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> were big men in their day - men of profound intellect and experience who were imbued with the desire to accomplish then what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> is seeking to accomplish now. What was the result ? In Bastable's <inline font-style="italic">Commerce of Nations</inline> I find the following: - </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Very strenuous efforts were made by the Peel Administration (1841-1845) to conclude commercial treaties on the basis of reciprocity, but the attempt was a complete failure. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> who, as Vice-President of- the Board of Trade, had charge of the negotiations, afterwards declared that " In every case we failed. I am sorry to add my opinion that we did more than fail. The whole operation seemed to place us in a false position. Its tendency was to lead countries to regard with jealousy and suspicion, as boons to foreigners, alterations in their laws which, though doubtless of advantage to foreigners, would have been of far greater advantage to their own inhabitants." The lesson thus received conduced to the change of view on the part both of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone.</inline></para>
                <para class="block">So that, after endeavouring to lever down foreign Tariffs, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> seek to do to-day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel were obliged to. confess to complete failure, and were driven back to their free-trade propaganda. But, admitting that the object aimed at is to secure the reduction of the duties levied under foreign Tariffs, are we to attain it by this method of increasing duties? The fact is writ large on the pages of history, that when we attempt to induce other countries to lower their Tariffs they invariably interpret our action as a sign of weakness. If these efforts are to succeed, even within the Empire, I think that we shall have to begin upon a very different basis indeed. We find very much the same influences as those to which I have referred operating to-day as between New Zealand and the Commonwealth. We hold that the treaty with New Zealand is not as liberal as it ought to be, and the people of that country regard it in precisely a similar light. Neither appear to be satisfied with the details of the schedule. Why? Because each has in mind the maintenance of its protection against the other. Why not make a proposal for free intercourse between the two countries and thus put the matter upon a different plane? Let us say to them, " We are people of the same race as yourselves." </para>

They were driven from the position which they had taken up by theLogio of events. We are attempting to do the same thing to-day, and the same human nature is already beginning to operate as between the people of the Commonwealth and' of New Zealand. What is occurring in Canada? There the Prime Minister confesses that he cannot obtain an answer to his communication, so keen are the commercial jealousies between the various parts of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. There is no inducement for Canada to conclude a preferential Tariff arrangement with' us. Why do we wish to trade with her unless we are prepared to offer her some return? This paltry tinkering with the subject of preferential trade is the very way in which to defeat the ultimate object that we have in view. If we are to extend a preference to goods from various parts of the Empire, the bolder the scheme and the more sacrifices that it involves the better chance will it have of success. </para>

                        <para>- That can only be because these proposals are made by a man whose horizon is limited by the manufactures of his own country. It is because the honorable gentleman will not view the whole matter in its proper perspective that in his judgment a reasonable scheme has no chance of passing here. At any rate, these are the teachings of experience. But, apparently, they do not make some of our statesmen wise, and we shall have to learn again that we cannot achieve our object unless we follow the lines which experience dictates. Last night the honorable member for Laanecoorie stated that he could not understand how any free-trader could be in favour of a scheme of preferential trade. Of course, he had in his mind that idealistic, theorizing free-trader who never has existed, and who probably never will. -The honorable member lays down his own definition of the standpoint from which matters are viewed by a free-trader, just as the Government constantly do. He says that he cannot understand how a free-trader can be in favour of any sort of preference. It is just as well that the honorable member should know that free-traders are not to be mastered by the tyranny of any theories whatever, any more than is any other section of the community. Theories, like logic, are sometimes square pegs in round holes. They may be all right in their broad generalization, just as is the protectionist theory or any other theory. But they do not fit all the facts of our human life. Therefore, free-traders are not idealists, standing off and taking no cognisance of the sweep of the world's practical relationships. They are practical men travelling in a given direction, because they believe that it will lead them towards the ideal of human happiness and completeness. In this respect, therefore, we have to make calculations as to whether a given policy will effect the object which it has in view. For instance, Federation involved a surrender of protective duties between the States. It meant an advanced measure of free-trade as between the States. The penalty paid for that advance, so far as one State is concerned, was the acceptance of a policy of protection against the outside world. But the result of Federation has been to increase the area within which free-trade operates. The same remark is applicable to the United States. They represent the greatest free-trade community to be found in any part of the world- A similar condition of things obtains in united Germany. Instead of each State being fettered with. Customs duties, as it used to be, the German States have swept away those duties, and now enjoy freetrade. In Canada the same conditions obtain. The actual area covered by free - trade has tremendously increased during recent years. That being so, the honorable member for Laanecoorie should readily see that even a free-trader may believe in preference, with a view to widening the ultimate area over which comparative freedom of trade mav operate. I do not wish, however, to further pursue that line of argument. I urge that even ultra-free-traders - such, for instance, as the honorable member for Lang and the honorable member for New England - may be, under given conditions, in favour of preference. How can we have a preference which would give us a wider and fuller glimpse of the ideal which we seek as an Empire if it does not carry with it a reduction in the duties now existing between the various parts of the Empire? That is the only kind of preference that is likely to be lasting. A preference upwards has always failed, and will continue to do so. The only successful preferences to-day are those which have been made between countries on the basis of a mutual reduction of duty, such as we proposed last; night in connexion with the treaty with New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. He said that he aimed at the abolition of the present protective duties between the various parts of the Empire - that there should be between them a Tariff upon only a revenue basis. The Minister told us to-day that that is not his objective. He is not prepared to take down the Tariffs between the various parts of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman is prepared only to raise the existing Tariff as against outsiders. That being so, this proposal on the part of the Government has nothing whatever in common with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> objective - the ultimate abrogation of the present Tariffs as between portions of the Empire and the placing of them upon a purely revenue basis. I am bound to say that in this matter of preference, the direction taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> is that which I am prepared to take, as far as the internal relations of the Empire are concerned. If we confine our attention to the Empire, we need not trouble so much about the nations outside. Let us secure free-trade, or an approximation to it, within the Empire, and then, so far as our trading and commercial prosperity is concerned, outside affairs will trouble us but little. I say frankly that I subscribe to the statement made last night by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, that I should welcome freetrade within the Empire even if it meant protection against the outside world. That would be an extension of the principle of reciprocity and neighbourly trading. It will thus be seen that the Opposition believe in a preference in a direction altogether contrary to that now proposed by the Minister of Trade and Customs. 'Coming again to his political philosophy, of which I propose for the <inline font-style="italic">moment to</inline> take a slice, I recognise that to make even a beginning we, must be very moderate in our proposals. I should like to know whether swinging into line with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> as the Prime Minister professes to be, in order ultimately to effect Imperial trade federation, the Government are prepared to make the smallest possible sacrifice? Not an atom of sacrifice on the part of Australia is shown in the schedule now before us. Not a duty is reduced in favour of Great Britain. All that the Government propose to do is to say to Great Britain, " We shall keep up the inner wall to prevent even a fractional increase in the volume of your goods entering Australia, but we shall build a still higher wall outside. Between those walls - in that outer court - we will conduct our family trade negotiations." That is all that this proposal means. If we are to weld the Empire together in trading, commercial, defence, or any other relationship, we must start on the basis of self-sacrifice. There is no trace of anything of the kind in the schedule. I admit that the sacrifice on the part of the protectionists of Australia must be small. I recognise their position to that extent ; but I ask them whether, as a beginning in this direction, they will make no concession. I propose to suggest a direction in which we could give a guarantee of our <inline font-style="italic">bona fides,</inline> without interfering with the protective policy of Australia; a step which we could take to show the people of the old country that we are prepared to make concessions towards the common ideal which we profess to be seeking. -The basis of the valuation of goods for dutiable purposes is the market value, plus 10 per cent., and my suggestion is that, when assessing the duty payable on British goods, we should deduct that 10 per cent, from our valuations. That would mean a reduction of about 2 per cent, on a 20 per cent, duty, about i£ per cent, on a 15 per cent, duty, and about 1 per cent, on a 10 per cent, duty. It would cover the whole range of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, and as a preference would be of infinitely greater value than the whole of the proposals contained in this schedule. Its direction would be downwards, in favour of the old country, instead of upwards, as the Minister is proposing. If we wish for Imperial Federation, let us give some evidence of our <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> This can be done only by reducing the duties upon the products of Great Britain. I propose to insert certain words, which will incorporate mv suggestion. </para>

                <para class="block">If that amendment is adopted we shall give a distinct, if small, concession to the United Kingdom in regard to dutiable articles sent here by the people of that country, amounting to a reduction of 2 per cent, where the duty is 20 per cent., of 1 1/2 per cent, where the duty is 15 per cent., and of 1 per cent, where the duty is 10 per cent., the whole range of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties being covered. The people of England will find no evidence of sincerity in the proposals of the Government as they stand, inasmuch as they give no concession to Great Britain. Last night we finished with the Australian Industries Preservation Bill. That measure enacts that if British goods are sent here with intent to injure by means of unfair competition Australian trade, or whose importation will probably result in creating a substantial disorganization of Australian industry, their importation .mav be prohibited, while they may be liable to confiscation under certain conditions. Furthermore, if the competition of Great Britain would probably, or does, in fact, create substantial disorganization of Australian industry, or throw workers out of employment, her goods may be prevented from coming here. In determining whether there is substantial disorganization, consideration is. to be had to the remuneration paid in the old country, and if the workmen engaged in the manufacture of the imported goods are employed an hour, or even half-an-hour, a day longer than our workmen are employed, the selling of the goods here may be prohibited. In view of those restrictions, we must give some better proof than the proposals of the Government as they stand of our <inline font-style="italic">bona fides,</inline> and I think that the small concession which I suggest will be regarded by the British people as an attempt towards the realization of the Imperial idea outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> and supported so eloquently by the Prime Minister, which we all desire to see brought about. If the destiny of the Empire depends upon the keeping together of the various dependencies of Great Britain and the mother country, the closer we can make our trading relations the better it will be for all concerned. To my mind, the Empire can be held together only on the basis of common defence as well as of common trade. I am proposing an initial step which our conditions permit us to make, and which no protectionist should hesitate to agree to. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the proposal made by the honorable member. Even if the amendment were embodied in the resolution the difference in the result would be so small that a magnifying glass would be required to discover it. In many cases the 10 per cent, is not added to the value of the article for the purposes of assessing the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I never break the law, if I can help it. The honorable member for North Sydney apparently does' not know that the Minister can arbitrarily fix the valuation of goods when their true commercial value at the port of shipment cannot be ascertained. At present we are importing certain articles from America which cost 12s. 6d. to produce. They are being sold here from £7 7s. to £10 10s., and I am making them pay duty upon a valuation of <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">£5.</inline></para>

                        <para>- In any case, I cannot accept the amendment. The honorable member for Parramatta had a great deal. to say upon the subject of our having refrained from reducing duties. The duties now levied are so ridiculously low that there is no room for reduction. A great many of the articles in regard to which preference is to be given are now admitted free of duty, but we propose to levy an impost of 10 per cent, upon such goods coming from foreign countries. The honorable member for Parramatta stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> object was to bring about universal free-trade. But I do not think so. </para>

I cannot fail to recall the way in which the mother country assisted and supported us in our early days, and How magnanimously she has behaved by endowing us with plenary powers of self-government. From every stand-point, she has done all that a mother could do for her child. When I contrast her treatment of her dependencies with that which has been meted out by other countries fo their colonies, I am lost in amazement. Take the case of France, Germany, and Spain a.; an illustration. </para>

                        <para>- Nobody admits that more readily than I do. What was the nature of the treatment which Spain accorded to her possessions when they were nearly equal in importance to those of Great Britain? She used them for her own selfish purposes - for the advancement of her own favorites. The same remark is applicable to France and Germany. No country in the civilized world extends to its possessions the same considerate treatment which Great Britain accords to her dependencies. With the solitary exception of the United States, no dependency has ever attempted to throw off the yoke of the mother country, whereas the Spanish possessions - realizing the injustice under which they laboured, and recognising that they were merely being used to supply the needs of Spain - -have frequently risen in rebellion. Feeling as I do for Britain a gratitude which is almost too deep for words, I cannot fail to regard <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> proposal under discussion as one which is unworthy of Australia, and unworthy of the acceptance of the mother country. When I reflect upon the fact that she has afforded us the protection of her flag during all these years, I think it is incumbent upon us to make such a sacrifice as will indicate that we are not entirely ungrateful. We should not attempt to drive a bargain with England. We ought not to say, " We are prepared to extend preferential treatment to you if you will impose duties upon the goods of other countries." The exhibition of such a spirit is unworthy of us. On. the contrary, recognising our responsibilities, we ought to say, ""We are ready to offer you a concession in the matter of trade which will be worthy of your acceptance." Instead of adopting that course, what do we find? The miserable! protectionist- party which are now in power come forward with this so-called offer of preference to British goods. A number of the articles named are already free under our Tariff, and, in effect, the Government say, " We will continue to allow these goods - so long as they are of British origin and are brought here in British ships - to be admitted free, but we will levy a duty upon them as against the foreigner." If the Government were capable of rising to a proper appreciation of their responsibilities, they would say to Great Britain, " Whatever article you produce shall' be allowed to enter the Commonwealth, if not absolutely free, at the lowest possible rate of duty." In other words, her goods should be admitted at such a rate as would bestow upon her a real and substantial preference. I venture to say that 'Great Britain produces articles which for workmanship and value cannot be excelled in any other part of the world. But upon studying the schedule under consideration. I find no mention of those articles. The proposal which has been submitted is alike unworthy of Australia and of the acceptance of Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- [ am very much afraid that they are hidebound by the protectionist spirit, which in this Chamber has developed with amazing rapidity during the last few months. There are two or three items which - if they had been included in the schedule - might have represented something in the nature of a concession to England. But I find there no mention of agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery, for which Great Britain has acquired a world-wide reputation. At the present time our imports of that description from the United Kingdom are valued at , £32,282, whereas those from other countries, including the United States and Canada, are valued at approximately £200,000. Under the Government" proposal no advantage has been conceded to Great Britain in respect of goods in which she does not possess practically a monopoly, but the duties upon those goods have been increased as against the outside world. Assuming that these articles continue to be imported from countries other than the United Kingdom, who will be called upon to pay the duties? Will it be the foreigner or the consumer ? I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs should be in his place when an important proposal1 of this character is under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- If they do they should have enacted the farce outside. If, on ' the contrary, they are serious in the belief that they are offering a preference of any value to Great Britain, they should approach its consideration in a way that would convince the public. I am deeply disappointed with the attitude of the Government. I recognise all that England has done for us, and feel that we ought to be ready to do what little we can to assist her. If this schedule represents all that we can do for Great Britain, then the sooner it is consigned to the waste paper basket the better. It has been brought forward at a most inopportune time. Had the Government introduced a measure embodying a real preference to Great Britain, and then sought the views of the electors upon it, I venture to say that from one end of Australia to the other the people, recognising what we owe to the motherland, would have warmly supported it. Let us offer her something worthy of her acceptance, even if it should involve some sacrifice on our part. As a matter of fact this proposal will be of little benefit to" the mother country, but the Government hope, by means of it, to secure more protection against the outside world. Many of the items are already on the free-list, so that, so far as they are concerned, no advantage will be derived by Great Britain. Seeing that the motion as it stands does not embody a proposal to make any real sacrifice, I oppose it as a sham, but am prepared to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta in the hope that even if it confers no substantial benefit on Great Britain, it will show that at all, events a section of the House, and a large section of the people, desire, in the near future, to offer something worthy of acceptance. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister of Trade and Customs this morning indulged in some high-flown sentiments about the glorious ideal of British preference, and one would' have thought, from his utterances, that the motion embodied a substantial trade concession to Great Britain, offered as an evidence of our desire to preserve the unity of the Empire, and to cement the bonds of kinship about which the Government have recently said so much. As a matter of fact, however, a cursory glance at the schedule is sufficient to show that the main principle underlying it is not so much an attempt to offer Great Britain any substantial advantage as to secure a substantial benefit for the limited circle of Australian manufacturers. That is the selfish, sordid motive which the Government appear to have in view. It is a proposal not so much for preferential trade as to go behind the back of Parliament to increase the burden of taxation borne by the people of Australia, and to increase it in the interests of the manufacturing section of the community, located for the most part in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to say that it is in direct contravention of the programme which members of the present Ministry espoused at the last general election. They declared at that time that they were anxious to inaugurate an era of fiscal peace, coupled with preferential trade with Great Britain. Again and again members of the present Ministry emphasized the need for the maintenance of fiscal peace; but they now seem to think it suits their purpose better to proclaim the policy of fiscal war. </para>

                        <para>- I am seeking to point out the absolute hollowness, mockery, and insincerity of these proposals. The conditions to-day are the same as when Ministers preached the doctrine of fiscal peace, but nearly every action taken by them since assuming office has been in the direction of insidiously going behind the back of Parliament to raise Customs taxation. They knew that it would be idle to submit direct proposals for increased duties, and they have, to a large extent, succeeded by passing such measures as the Commerce Bill and the Australian Industries Preservation Bill in gaining increases by a side wind, and securing the power of absolute prohibition, which' Parliament would never sanction on a straight-out Tariff issue. - It is with the same object in view that their proposals for preferential trade with New Zealand and Great Britain have been submitted. That fact cannot be too clearly exposed. The people ought to know that the Ministry is simply playing with a magnificent sentiment and perverting it to the sordid and selfish ends to which I have referred. This is a travesty upon the principle of preferential trade, and is a downright insult to the British nation. What preference will be secured by this much-vaunted scheme? When we examine it we find that the preference to be granted is virtually infinitesimal. There is not one item that means a concession to Great Britain' in the shape of a reduction of duty. A considerable part of the schedule consists of items that are already on the free-list, whilst many of the others relate to imports the bulk of which already come from Great Britain. Upwards of 60 per cent, of the total trade in respect of many of these imports into Australia is held by Great Britain. The balance of the items will confer no advantage on the old country since they relate to specialties which do not come into serious competition with British imports, while some of them &lt;lo not compete at all. Therefore, in proposing to increase the duties on these articles, no preference is given to Great Britain, the only result being to increase the protection afforded to local manufacturers, which, in my opinion, is the real intention of the Government. The Minister of Trade and Customs told us this morning that Great Britain imports annually £166,000,000 worth of foodstuffs, of which only ,£6,918,000 worth, or 4J per cent., come from Australia, a fact which he deplored. But he should know that Great Britain takes all the foodstuffs that we can send her, and that to secure a larger part of that trade, we must increase our population and our cultivated area. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the proposals of the Labour Party for superimposing a progressive land tax on a high Customs Tariff would alter it, though I should be out -of order if I turned aside to discuss that question now. My point is that we already have in Great Britain a market for all the foodstuffs that we send there, and cannot increase our exports to that country until we have a larger population and a larger surplus production. The Minister suggested that the British nation should give a preference to Australia on foodstuffs, but the only way in which that could be done would be by imposing duties upon foodstuffs sent from other countries, which would increase the cost of food <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Great Britain. That is recognised b" the British people, and I draw attention to the unanimity of the labour organizations of that country on the point, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> brought forward his proposal for preferential trade. He tried to make out that only a small increase in the price of food was involved ; but the adoption of his scheme would have meant a good deal of suffering to the poorer sections of the community. </para>

                        <para>- Protective duties are always imposed temporarily, yet are always more or less permanent. The specious excuse is made that they are to last only until the temporarily protected industry has established itself; but we never hear it admitted that any industry so established is able to stand alone, and the manufacturers who once benefit by duties all strenuously oppose their reduction. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and some of the countries of Europe have had centuries of protection. Similarly, bonuses are introduced nominally for a time only, but they are constantly renewed, and, even when ultimately abolished, are generally succeeded bv a duty. The British people have emphatically asserted that they are opposed to duties on foodstuffs. That was abundantly manifested by the result of the last British elections, and is further proved by the following .resolution, passed by the House of Commons, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Kitson, on the 13th March last: - </para>

                    <para>That this House, recognising that the people at the recent general election demonstrated their unqualified fidelity to the principle and practice of free-trade, records its determination to resist any proposal, whether by a tax on corn or a general tariff, to create in Great Britain a system of protection. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That resolution was carried by 474 votes to 98, a majority of 376 being in favour of it. Therefore, the Minister cannot reasonably expect that the present British Parliament will place duties .on foodstuffs. I find that of a total importation valued at £38,346,731, the proposed preferential treatment would affect only £2,291,439 worth. Of these goods, £r.,473&gt;l89 worth come from the United Kingdom; £20,531 from Canada; £6,274 from India; and £838 from other British possessions. Against this total importation of £1,500.832 from Great Britain and British possessions, there are importations from Japan and China, valued at £28,765; from the United States of America, valued at ,£432&gt;533j and from other foreign countries, valued at £329,306, a total of £79°&gt;6o3- If will thus be seen that the greater part of the trade upon which preference is proposed to be given is already in British hands. A large portion of the balance is made up of special lines of goods which are not manufactured in Great Britain. The great bulk of these articles come from the United States, at which country we shall strike the heaviest blow by adopting these proposals. I wish to refer to two or three items which appear to be worthy of special notice. One of these is strawboard. This item was freely discussed, when the Tariff was under consideration, and was the subject of a great deal of misrepresentation. I have been in communication with a large manufacturer of cardboard boxes in Sydney " who uses immense quantities of strawboards. He has a very extensive establishment, and he says that his industry will be very seriously handicapped if the duty is increased in the manner proposed. He points out that no strawboard is manufactured in the United Kingdom, and that, therefore, any proposal to give preference to Great Britain by increasing the duty against other countries must be a sham and a delusion. </para>

                        <para>- His statement is that no strawboard is manufactured in Great Britain. Some millboards are made there, but they are used for a different purpose. Great Britain imports 100,000 tons of strawboard annually, nine-tenths of which quantity comes from Holland. Great Britain imports strawboard for the purposes of her own manufacturers,, and it is evident that any preference in regard to that raw material will not confer any 'benefit upon the mother country. </para>

                    <para>The quality of the Victorian strawboard is much inferior to that of Dutch make, and is not even equal to that manufactured in Japan. Victorian bookbinders, though a duty of 4s. per cwt. (at least 80 per cent.) had to be paid under the State Tariff, still imported Dutch strawboard, the Victorian make being too rough and brittle to use in their trades. Cardboard box makers also find it impossible to make small boxes or "good work" out of Victorian board. It can only be used for cheap boxes of a fairly large size. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Notwithstanding the duty of 80 per cent, under the Victorian Tariff, the bookbinders in that State found it absolutely necessary to import Dutch strawboard; it was of much better quality and more suitable for their work. Therefore, the Minister, in seeking to benefit one industry which employs very few hands, will inflict great injury upon another and much more important one. In 1902 the Broadford mill employed only five men and six boys, and incidentally provided work for half-a-dozen other men in carting firewood. In 1902, when the duty was reduced from 4s. to1s. per cwt., the plant was duplicated, and, although nothing is said as to any additional hands having been employed, it is fair to assume that the staff was increased. In any case, the proposed duty will benefit only one Victorian manufacturer, who employs a small number of hands; whilst, by increasing the price of strawboard, it will have a discouraging effect upon another important industry, employing a considerable number of hands. </para>

                        <para>- Another item to which I wish to refer is furniture. We know that Great Britain exports a very small quantity of furniture. Most of that imported into the Commonwealth comes from other countries, and a large quantity of the bent wood type from Austria. The bentwood furniture which is made in that country is extensively used by the poorer classes. If the duties are increased upon this class of furniture, the preference given to 'Great Britain will confer no advantage upon her, but will impose an extra burden upon those who use bentwood furniture, for which no suitable substitute can be found. It is cheap, durable, and particularly suitable for use in the Australian climate. </para>

                        <para>- No timber is grown in Australia that can be used with the same advantage for furniture making as the Austrian product now used. Several materials have been tried, but rank and ghastly failure has resulted. Austrian furniture is to be found in almost every house in the land, and even in this building. The effect of increasing the duty would be to raise the price of Austrian bentwood furniture from 9d. to 2s. on each article. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly in the same way as are Beale's pianos. The parts are put together here, and in that process a large number of Australians find profitable employment. Anything which will tend to diminish that employment is to be deprecated. I have no desire to criticise the schedule in detail at the present stage, but I propose to mention a few items which are not included in it, and upon . which a real and tangible preference might be given to Great Britain. The following figures show the respective values of imports into the Commonwealth from Great </para>

                <para class="block">Britain and foreign countries in relation to goods upon which, even under the present scheme, a real preference might have been given to Great Britain : - Horseshoe nails, British, £3,154; foreign, £8,1.70; nails, wire staples, &amp;c, British, £16,455; foreign, £44.359 ; wire, iron and steel, British, £31,077; foreign, £296,387; wire netting, British, £220,083 <inline font-style="italic">&gt;</inline> foreign, £.115,1.1:4; barbed wire, British, £11,139; foreign', , £60,267; n.e.i., wire, British, £27,304; foreign. £30,085. The total of these imports is, British £^09,212, and foreign £554.389. It will be seen that in respect of these few items we could extend to Great Britain a real and substantial preference. But nothing of the kind is proposed. On the contrary, a number of articles have been selected which are already free, and it is proposed to levy a duty upon those articles when they are of other than British origin. A number of other items have been selected in respect of which Great Britain already enjoys a natural preference by reason of the fact that she possesses upwards of 60 per cent, of the trade. Of the remainder of the articles .specified in the schedule, a number are of a special character which do not enter into competition with British manufactures. Upon the face of it, the scheme stands self -condemned ; it is a mere make-shift and a pretence. So far from it extending a real preference to Great Britain, I regard it merely as another of those cunningly devised schemes with which we have lately become so familiar to increase duties in the interests of Australian and particularly of Victorian manufacturers. It is being used as a means to unworthily play upon a lofty national sentiment. If time permitted I could show that the proposal will inflict injury upon British trade to the extent of £130.000 or £150,000 a year. That is the kind of preference which we are asked to extend to her - a preference which will actually involve her in a monetary loss. I shall certainly vote for the amendment submitted bv the honorable member for Parramatta, and should it be defeated I -will move - </para>

                    <para>.- In submitting this proposal, the Minister declared that it was intended to affirm a great principle. For my own part, I think that it is simply playing with a great principle, inasmuch as it will not bring the Commonwealth and Great Britain into trade relations any closer than those which already exist. I admit that to some extent it removes the competition of the foreigner, but from a preferential stand-point, it is nothing but a mockery. It was a surprise to me to hear the Minister declare that at the present time the Commonwealth has a freetrade Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see this question) dealt with in a comprehensive way. Under the cloak of this treaty, the Minister desires to sneak in a further measure of protection. At the same time, he wishes the mother country to believe that he is extending a substantial preference to her goods. This morning he spoke of the £166,000,000 worth of foodstuffs which she annually consumes. Need .1 remind him that England takes all the foodstuffs that Australia can send her. Assuming that she were willing to enter, into a reciprocal treaty with us, and to impose a Tariff in our favour against the rest of the world, does the Minister imagine that other nations which are sup- plying her with foodstuffs would cease .to do so? Certainly not. Denmark, which annually sends to Great Britain £10,000,000 worth of dairy produce, would not send a pound's worth less. The effect might be that the price of Danish produce might be reduced, but neither England nor Australia would derive any advantage. At the present time, Australia possesses an open market for her goods in England, and the latter can absorb ten times the quantity of foodstuffs that we export to her. The Minister also asked, " How can we compete with America?" I would point out that we compete with that country in the matter of wheat and wool, and the day is not far distant when America will require to import produce from Australia. Her population is fast absorbing all her own surpluses, and as a result, she is now able to export very little produce to England'. But in respect of bulky goods, we shall always be at a disadvantage as compared with America, on account of the great difference between the cost of transit. The Minister has argued that protection does not increase the price of any article to the consumer. I think that he had better take a trip to England, and make the statement there. If he did so, the people of the old country would regard him as a proper subject to be locked up. If protection did not increase the price of goods to the consumer, Great Britain would have adopted a policy of preferential trade with us long ago. </para>

                        <para>- I hold that under this proposal we shall give no real preference to England. The Tariff is not to be reduced in her favour with the object of assisting her in her struggle against foreign competitors. I should have liked the Government to submit a motion offering a real preference to England, and calculated to bring her into closer trading relationship with the Commonwealth. In the course of his speech on the Address-in-Reply, the Prime Minister said that Australia was prepared to make a sacrifice, and when the leader of the Opposition interjected, " That means lower duties," he replied that he was prepared to make that sacrifice. I do not think that the Prime Minister has had anything to do with this proposal. It seems to me to be the work of the high priest of protection - the Minister of Trade and Customs. </para>

                        <para>- We should be prepared to make a small beginning by supporting the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta. It would mean a little more preference to imports from Great Britain, and would show the people of the old world that we view this matter in a proper light. I believe that, as time goes on, we shall establish a true system of preferential trade which will draw us closer to the mother country - that the high Tariff now existing against her will be whittled away, and that the people of our own blood living in other parts of the Empire will be enabled to trade on. better terms than) at present with Australia. England is making, a great sacrifice in guarding our shores and protecting our trade on the high seas. She also takes our surplus products, and we should be prepared in return to make, at all events, a slight sacrifice on her behalf. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta means the insertion of the thinnest of wedges, and, if adopted, it will indicate that our sentiment is a living one. It will give the Minister of Trade and Customs an opportunity to show whether he is an honest believer in preferential trade, or whether he is simply seeking, under the guise of preferential trade, to raise a higher Tariff wall against the foreigner. In the course of the exhaustive speech in which he dealt with all phases of this question, the honorable member for Parramatta expressed the sentiments of the Opposition, and I should like the Minister to accept his amendment. The Opposition believe in preferential trade. The Minister should be prepared to accept the amendment, since he made the startling, statement to-day that, in assessing the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties payable on certain goods, 10 per cent, is not added in all cases to the invoice prices. </para>

                    <para>.The amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta is worthy of support. On several occasions, both in this House and outside of it, we have heard honorable members on the Ministerial side expressing a desire to bring the people of Great Britain into closer commercial union with Australia, and intimating their willing ness to make a sacrifice to achieve that end. At the last general election the high priest of the Protectionist Association, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, stated that his party would consent to a preference being granted to Great Britain by a reduction of the duties on pianos, cotton, and linen piece goods, cutlery, plated ware, and certain other goods imported from that country. On the . four lines to which I have specifically referred, a preference could be given to Great Britain by a reduction of duties without interfering with any one's fiscal belief, since they do not touch to any extent the question of free-trade and protection in Australia. The duty on pianos of course affects <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> and we should have to reduce it to only a slight extent so as not to interfere with the Minister of Trade and Customs' friend. If the rhetorical statements made from time to time by the Prime Minister and others as to the necessity of doing something to draw Great Britain and Australia into closer commercial intercourse have any backing, the Ministry should be prepared to do that which would be an earnest of their desire to place Great Britain on a. somewhat better footing in our markets than she holds at the present time. We shall not do that by simply raising the duties against the foreigner. There are many items the duties on which could be lowered in favour of Great Britain without injury to an Australian industry ; but we do not see in this schedule an attempt to make those reductions. The amendment is so modest as to be, in the words of the Prime Minister, " only a seedling " - so modest that it should be acceptable to any one having an honest desire to grant preferential trade to Great Britain. It would not prevent the Parliament raising duties for the protection of any industry in danger of being swamped by imports from Great Britain. Under it the reduction of duty in favour of Great Britain would amount to only one-tenth ; although the reduction granted by Canada amounts to one-third. It would mean that in respect of goods liable to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 30 per cent, the foreigner would pay 33 per cent., and the Britisher 30 per cent. ; on goods dutiable at 15 per cent., the foreigner' would pay16½ per cent., and the British 15 per cent. ; and on those dutiable at 10 per cent., the foreigner would pay11 per cent., and the Britisher only 10 per cent. A man who is prepared to say that such a preference would endanger Australian industries must have a very vivid imagination. The Minister might well accept the proposal. If he did, we could then proceed to discuss the schedule. The amendment is not necessarily antagonistic to the motion. I should much prefer not to see duties raised as proposed against the foreigner. If it is desired to raise them in this way, the Tariff Commission which has been dealing with the whole question of Tariff reform, and has involved the country in considerable expense, should be asked first to submit recommendations on the subject. To bring in proposals relating to such items as timber, hops, candles, and others mentioned in the schedule is to cut into the work which the members of the Commission have done, and to deprive us of recommendations based on the evidence which they have 'heard. I believe that these proposals are fragmentary, and to a great extent purely illusory, and that if this Parliament had two years instead of two or three weeks to run, they would not have been brought forward in their present form. </para>

                        <para>- There are importations valued at over38,000,000, including spirits, narcotics, bullion, and specie, with which the schedule does not deal; but preference is to be given to imports of only a little over 2,000,000 worth. This preference, too, in many cases is almost illusory, and practically non-existent in most. What we on this side propose, though not very much, is a concession in regard to all British goods upon which <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties are levied, and, if adopted, will enable us to know at the end of two or three years whether we should continue this policy as likely to be mutually advantageous to the mother country and Australia. I am not one of those who declaim from every platform about the great services that we owe to the mother country, while taking care to vote always to keep British goods out of Australia, and to hamper British trade as much as possible. Recognising our enormous obligations to the mother country, I regard the amendment as an earnest of our desire to assist her in a practical way. No doubt the amendment will be negatived, because the Government are using for party purposes the Imperial sentiment, which is cherished by a majority of Australians, while they do not wish to give Great Britain any real preference. I hold this view, notwithstanding the repeated declarations of the Prime Minister, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports,, and others, that there are certain items upon which they are prepared to reduce duties. </para>

The concession proposed by the honorable member for Parramatta is so slight that the giving of it would not seriously interfere with the fiscal policy of the country, while it would be an earnest of our desire to help the mother country. </para>

                        <para>- The treatment which this subject can receive at the present time, only a few weeks before the dissolution of Parliament, is not such as a great Empire question deserves. That is shown by the manner in which the Minister of Trade and Customs introduced it. His frequent absences of late may have prevented him from studying the subject in a way which would have enabled hum to deal with it fully and lucidly. He has been attending some functions in the country - circuses, perhaps - and jumps into this arena with a sort of" here-we- are-again " expression on his face, asking us in the most light and airy fashion to deal in a few hours with the whole question of preference between Great Britain and Australia. The Prime Minister would have opened the discussion in a very different manner. The Minister of Trade and Customs could not help letting us see that he thinks all the time. of number one, and is determined that Australia shall have the full feast, the mother . country to receive only such crumbs as may fall from the table. His leader would have led off in glorious language, telling of what we owe to Great Britain, and indicating his sense of our debt of gratitude. </para>

                        <para>- I could more readily approve of a scheme that proposed to do both than a scheme which proposes merely to raise the duties against the foreigner. If we, first of all, impose such duties upon articles that we think we can manufacture! as will exclude British imports, we shall make no concession by increasing the imports against the foreigner. We can, however, give preference by reducing the duties upon British goods. The Minister anticipates that Great Britain will at some time impose duties upon her foodstuffs - the support of her poorer classes - in order that she may obtain from us, not a real concession, not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Chamberlain has said, a great reduction on our protective duties, but an increase of duties against the foreigner. The Minister fell into the same fallacy as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain. Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> in the first portion of his Glasgow speech, argued that the imposition of a duty upon foodstuffs would permit the products of the Colonies to displace the supplies now derived from foreign countries. He proposed a preference of only 3d. per bushel upon corn, but . he thought that would help largely in the direction indicated. In the second part of his speech - just as the Minister did in two sentences to-day - he argued that the foreigner would pay the increase of duty, and that the people of Great Britain would not suffer owing to any increase of prices. </para>

                        <para>- If the foreigner is the outsider, and pays the duty, there can be no preference to Australia in the British market. If the Australian is the outsider, and he pays the duty, he will lose any preference conferred by the duty. Nothing could be more clear; and I am surprised, not that the Minister fell into a mistake, but that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> with his clear mind, should have put forward two such contradictory self -destructive arguments. If in return for some trifling advantage, we ask the people of Great Britain to place upon their shoulders - already heavily weighted with the cares of Empire and the necessity of maintaining enormous military" and naval establishments - the extra burden of -a duty on foodstuffs, we need not pretend that we are endeavouring to extend any benefit to them. What we want in connexion with this question is more honesty. We should not try to get the best of each other, nor attempt to obtain something without giving a proper return. Only an honest attempt will succeed, because the leading men of Great Britain are not fools. We should put forward,^ proposals on lines that will be beneficial to both parties. It is the absence of honesty in connexion with this proposal that induces me to oppose it. Now, what is this magnificent effort at preference? Out of a total of £38,000,000 worth of imports, it is proposed to give Great Britain preference in regard to £2,500,000. Of this proportion, only £961,000 worth comes from foreign countries, and only a small part of the trade which these 'imports represent can possibly be transferred to Great Britain. Probably not 10 per cent, of the foreign import trade in the articles mentioned in the schedule will be "diverted into British channels. Whilst we are making loud professions, which ring, not only from one end of Australia to the other, but from here to Great Britain, and through the United States and the Continent, we find when we come to business that a magnificent satire upon preference to the motherland is put before Parliament. A proposal that touches only £961,000 worth of foreign trade out of £38,000,000 worth of imports into Australia is all that we have to consider. It is astonishing that of the articles which are left untouched our imports from foreign countries are far larger in proportion than are our foreign imports of the articles, in respect to which it is proposed to give preference. Does this indicate sincerity ? I venture to say that, whilst these proposals may be quoted by those who support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> policy as affording evidence of the desire of Australia to enter into reciprocal relations, those persons who have hoped that Australia would really do something for the motherland will be bitterly disappointed. There are the most extraordinary variations in the preferences proposed to be given, and I should like to have some explanation in regard to them. New Zealand and Canada give the mother country a preference by reducing their duties by 33&amp; Per cent. Instead of adopting that simple plan. Ministers propose to give a preference which varies widely in regard to a number of items. For instance, upon ammunition and cartridges it is proposed to give a preference of 10 per cent., whereas with regard to revolvers, pistols, &amp;c, the preference is to be only 7^ per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Then, again, in regard to rifles, n.e.i., and shot guns, the preference proposed is 5 per cent., whereas upon military rifles the preference is 10 per cent. In regard to a number of items, the duty is increased by 10 per cent.,, but upon paints and colours the preference to be given amounts to 25 per cent. What is the cause of these variations? Upon strawboard, an article used largely in manufacturing operations within the Commonwealth, it is proposed to increase the duty by 50 per cent. Why should this extra protection be given to the Broadford mill? Instead of that establishment having been closed down bv the reduction of the duty when the Tariff was brought into operation, operations have been extended. Yet it is proposed to increase the duty on the foreign article by 50 per cent. I am informed that strawboard is not manufactured in Great Britain, and that, therefore, the preference proposed to be given can confer no benefit upon the mother country. Then an extra duty of 20 per cent, is imposed upon paper bags, whilst the preference in regard to pickles, sauces, &amp;c, amounts to 25 per cent. Again, on starch, an article which needs no extra protection, an impost representing an increase of 25 per cent, is to be levied. All these variations tend to complicate matters, and, in conjunction with the other proposals with regard to preference for New Zealand, will convert our Tariff into a Chinese puzzle. We shall have one set of duties for New Zealand, and another set for Great Britain. Then the Tariff Commission is about to recommend a number of alterations, and we have higher protection threatened by the Ministry. We are being asked to deal in a most zig-zag, unequal fashion with the items in the Tariff. No reasons are given for these inequalities. We have preferences given bv means of increased duties in the case of Great Britain, and partly by reductions of dutv in the case of New Zealand. Our Tariff will very soon be a labyrinth which no one can thread, and as a </para>

                        <para>- The plan which has been adopted by the Government marks such a departure from that which has been followed by other portions of the Empire, which extend a preference to the mother country by the simple expedient of reducing their duties to the extent of 33J per cent, upon British goods, that I expected the Minister would have assigned reasons for it when he submitted this proposal. In amy case, between the alterations which are threatened in the direction of increased protection and alterations which the Tariff Commission may recommend, what are we coming to? A state of confusion which is really absurd. Upon some items we give a preference of 15 per cent, to New Zealand, whilst upon the same items we extend a different preference to Great Britain. It is time that the Government faced the Tariff question from its beginning to its end, and submitted a scheme which would provide a simple method of giving effect to the ends which they have in view. Unless they do that, confusion must grow worse confounded. I feel sure that little or nothing in the direction desired will result from this proposal. Canada and New Zealand have granted a .much larger measure of preference to goods from the mother country than is here proposed; but, instead of developing British trade, there has been a decline of that trade proportionately to that done with other countries. What is the reason for this? In the first place, both New Zealand and Canada - and we are following their example - endeavoured so to protect their manufacturers against Britain itself, that when there was no concession made to British goods in respect of the duties levied under the ordinary Tariff, the higher duties imposed against the goods of other countries proved ineffective. What is it that controls the trade between countries? When one country can produce an article better than can another - whether if be in the shape of raw material or of other products - it necessarily attracts from other countries a larger share of the trade in that article. When a country occupies that position, as Britain does in respect of some of her goods, no preference is needed. It enjoys a natural advantage, which, after all, is better than any preference. But when one or two, or it may be several, countries can produce an article equally well, then any preference - unaccompanied by a previous exclusion of goods by means of protective duties - will operate in favour of the country to which that preference is extended. If a country cannot produce an article at anything like the cost at which it can be produced by other countries, any preference which may be given to it will be absolutely ineffective. That is the experience of the United States and of Canada. The latter extended a preference to the goods of Great Britain largely for the purpose of reducing the increasing imports from the United States. But the Dominion did what we are doing - she practically destroyed a great deal of the value of that preference by levying, such high duties upon a great many English manufactures that they could not get access to her market, even though there were higher duties operative against the foreigner. </para>

                        <para>- It did not result in a relatively larger consumption of manufactured goods from Great Britain than from other countries. The reason is not far to seek. It is to be found in the fact that in many articles the United States of America is in the position of having such natural advantages that she is able to compete even against the preference. In the other case in which Great Britain and the United States can compete upon an equality - the former may derive some advantage from the Canadian preference, but that advantage has not overcome the increasing quantity of other goods entering Canada. </para>

                        <para>- As regards the trade of the United States, of America and Canada, I do not think that any bonuses affected it. I speak of the United States because the great object of Canada in making a concession to Great Britain was to check the largely increasing portion of her trade with the United States. A large proportion of the articles mentioned in this schedule come under the heading of those which cannot be affected by the preference. In the matter of arms and ammunition a great deal depends upon the patents or upon the particular make. Although we may impose a duty upon that class of goods coming from foreign countries, if a particular make is preferred by the user, the extra duty will be paid, and Great Britain will not receive the benefit of the trade. The same remark is applicable to many articles, such as bicycles, tricycles, and vehicles. The trade in these is largely controlled by patents or by the popular fancy for a particular make. These goods will continue to be imported from 'the sources of supply, principally, Canada and America, in spite of any preference which we may give to the mother country. Then the proposal of the Government in respect of boots and shoes represents either an' additional protection, or it is intended to divert trade. I venture to say that the boots and shoes imported from the United States - that is the country outside of Britain from which they principally come - will not be very materially affected by the additional duty proposed. Those boots are largely puichased, because they are of a special make. Most of them are of a high price. The same objection can be urged in respect of watches, clocks, chronometers, compasses, ships' chronometers, telescopes. &amp;c- Some of these articles are controlled by patents, and others are preferred because of their extra power, efficiency, or strength. If they possess those points of superiority they will continue to be purchased from the source which now supplies them, even if they cost more money. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has made a mistake. I am not the right honorable member for East Sydney. and I have not to find reasons for all his "opinions. Had the honorable member entered the Chamber a. little earlier, he would have heard me state that I would support a proposal to extend a real preference to Great Britain, and I think that the right honorable member for East Sydney has said the same thing. He will support a real preference being extended to the mother country in the shape of a reduction of duty. A number of the items enumerated in the schedule as drawing, mathematical, and surveying instruments, are purchased from a particular source, because they are the most suitable articles which can be obtained. Consequently a large number of the so-called preferences which appear upon the face of this schedule fall to the ground. 1 venture to say that if, under this proposal, 10 per cent, of the961,000 worth of trade mentioned by the Minister is diverted from foreign countries to Great Britain, it is all that will be accomplished, and to accomplish that - according to the Minister's own admission - the people of Australia will be mulcted, not only to the extent of the increased cost of some articles imported, but in the additional , £64,000 which he expects to annually collect under this schedule. The proposal is a sham one. It avoids the great bulk of the articles we are importing, and does not take into account imports to the value of 35,000,000, which are drawn proportionately to a larger extent from foreign countries than are the imports to the value of , £2,500,000 per annum with which it is proposed to deal. I feel satisfied that the scheme, as submitted, will be evaded, especially where the preference against foreign imports is considerable. Foreign goods subject to the higher percentages, will, in many cases, be introduced in parts into Great Britain ; the whole work of manufacturing will be practically done abroad, but the process of assembling these parts will take place in the "United Kingdom so that the complete article will be entitled to the preference granted to British imports. The proposal, as it stands, opens the door to such practices. Let me conclude by saying that, if we desire to estimate the extent of the Ministry's affection for the mother country - the affection so strongly demonstrated by these proposals - we have only to recall to mind their action when the Tariff was under consideration. At that time, we were constantly told that duties proposed from one side of the House would not be sufficient to shut out " the foreign article. " </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. When we inquired what foreign articles Ministers had in mind, we were often told that they were goods produced by the pauper labour of Great Britain. That was the country aimed at, and hit more frequently than any other by the proposals of the Ministry. Are we now to accept the statement that their attitude has undergone a change, that they have acquired a sudden regard for the mother country, and are going to give her some real concession that will enable her to find a limited entrance into our markets ? The belief that their attitude has undergone such a change is dissipated as soon as we glance at this schedule. When we examine it, we find at once that although their words to-day are different from what they were a few years ago, their intent is the same. I hope that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta - a proposal to give a real, although slight concession to the mother country - will find support, and that the Committee will agree to give a genuine advantage, however small, rather than make the mother country, the unreal, offer of the so-called concession which the Government have submitted. </para>
