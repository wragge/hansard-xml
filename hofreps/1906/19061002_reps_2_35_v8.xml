                        <para>We are not going to enforce its provisions very strictly at the start, the object being to give those interested time to understand the working of the measure.

I should like to know, further, whether the Minister&#39;s statement is an admission that he finds it impossible to administer the Act which he himself introduced? </para>

                        <para>- It is quite true that I made the statement quoted. I also made a similar statement in Melbourne before I left for Sydney. I do not intend, as the honorable member suggests, to &#34; wink the other eye &#34; when attempts are made to evade the Act. We are making a most important departure in connexion with a number of exports and imports, and I do not wish to take any undue advantage of those who may not be sufficiently acquainted with the regulations. If the regulations are broken without intent, the officers of the Department will explain what ft is necessary to do to comply with the Act. Unless the regulations are deliberately broken, no extreme action will be taken until a full opportunity has been given to all persons affected to make themselves acquainted with the working of the measure. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is not quite correct in saying that the retention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> in the service after he has reached the retiring age creates a precedent. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd, the Postmaster-General in. South Australia, was retained for some time after he had reached the retiring age. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> is to be retained for another year, in the public interest. The Public Service Commissioner has furnished the necessary certificate. There are many reasons which actuated me in recommending this course, and- 1 shall be glad to communicate them to the honorable member in detail if he wishes it. </para>

I wish also to know whether he has seen the statement, in this morning&#39;s newspapers, that an influential section of the German press is urging upon the Government of that country- the advisability of making reprisals in connexion with the proposal to increase the duties upon German goods imported into the Commonwealth, and whether he thinks that the action taken by us is calculated to promote friendly feelings between ourselves and that nation? </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure whether we receive the most favoured nation treatment from Germany, but know that .many important articles of export from Australia are not allowed to be carried to Germany in the subsidized &#39;German steamers sailing from our ports. I may point out that when the United States last revised its Tariff a number of protests were received from other nations to -which the United States Government replied that the course they were pursuing was not an unfriendly act towards the nations affected, but in the discharge of what they conceived to be a duty to their own people. </para>

When liquor is sold to a private who does not present an order from an officer, the man in charge of the canteen is required to charge a price equal to the aggregate number of nobblers that the bottle contained. All privates who produce a written authority obtain liquor in bottle at the same price as the officers. The Minister has placed on the Library table papers which will give the honorable member this information in detail. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I wish honorable members to clearly understand that we export largely to South Africa, and import very little from it. Consequently, under this agreement, our export trade will be afforded a greater opportunity for development than it has hitherto enjoyed. The exports of the items mentioned in the schedule from Australia&#34; to South Africa for 1905, were valued at &#163;2,040,000, and the total imports of the same items into South Africa for six months amounted to &#163;4,482,000, which is equivalent to &#163;9,000,000 for the year Assuming that the proportion of imports for six months would be approximately doubled in twelve months, I should like honorable members to understand what they are compared with the total import into South Africa. Australia exported to that country&#34; &#163;207,000 worth of butter, which represents nearly half its total import. In the matter of cheese, our export was practically nil, as against ,&#163;172,000 worth of imports. Of flour, we exported .&#163;310,000 worth out of &#163;474,000 worth imported. Of wheat, we exported ,&#163;680,000 worth out of ,&#163;900,000 worth imported. In jams and jellies our export amounted to about one-quarter of the imports. In leather, our exports were valued at &#163;46,518, as against ,&#163;153,000 worth of imports. Of frozen meats, we exported ,&#163;520,000 worth out of a total import of nearly ,&#163;2,000,000. I have supplied these figures with a view to assisting honorable members to follow the schedule which has been placed in their hands. The effect of our proposal will be to give to our export trade to South Africa a fillip which it has not previously&#34; enjoyed. The country has agreed to reduce its duties upon our exports, and we have consented to decrease a number of the duties hitherto collected upon its imports. At present, however, the reduction of our own duties will -affect us only very inconsiderably. Under the agreement we shall gain nearly everything, because our importations from South Africa do not amount to very much. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point. Under cover of this Bill the Commonwealth may seek to acquire land for alleged public purposes, not defined clearly by the Constitution, but which, in the opinion of the Government of the day, are within the limits of the Constitution. In this way disputes may occur and give rise to much litigation, to determine what are public purposes under the Constitution. That is one reason why it is advisable to clearly define in the Bill itself for what public purposes lands are to be acquired. If that step be taken there will be no room for doubt, and no excuse for litigation to settle such points. If the Government simply desire at present to acquire lands for certain public purposes clearly defined by the Constitution they ought to provide accordingly in the Bill. So far as I can see, the power of the Commonwealth is limited to acquiring land in respect of which Parliament has power to make laws. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that the Commonwealth will have power under this Bill to acquire lands, and, if it thinks it desirable, to mine upon them, as long as the High Court is not moved to intervene. Then the High Court itself may decide that the Constitution does not debar mining from the definition of &#34; public purposes,&#34; because it is not specifically excluded in the definition. There may be some provision in the Constitution that I have overlooked, but I have not been able to discover any section prohibiting the Commonwealth from exploring land for minerals. If the Commonwealth Government acquired land for the purpose of a Customs house or some other public building, and excavations upon it revealed a mineral belt, would there be anything to prevent them from working that belt, or leasing the land for mining purposes? </para>

                            <para>- So far as I can see, there is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth from acquiring land for special purposes, and subsequently diverting it to purposes that were not contemplated at the time of the passing of the Bill. That is why I think the rights of the States to all minerals that may subsequently be found upon such land should be preserved. We have power to acquire land for the erection of Customs houses, defence works, postal buildings, lighthouses, Federal Courts, astronomical or meteorological observatories, docks, and other works of public utility or convenience for carrying out the administration of the Departments and the Government of the Commonwealth. But there is nothing in this Bill or the Constitution that would prevent us from either working lands so acquired or leasing them to others desirous of working any mineral deposits found on them. Dealing with the treatment of the States, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> proceeds to point out that - </para>

                        <para>Again, let us see how this State is treated in respect of compensation. Take the case of land alienated by the Crown to a private individual, with reservation of minerals. His interest in the land is consequently exclusive of the minerals upon the land. If the Commonwealth acquires that land by compulsory process, a notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of such acquisition vests the land in the Commonwealth. (See section17.) The legal estate therein, with all rights and powers incident thereto or conferred by this Bill, are vested in the Commonwealth. Section 18 provides that, on the publication of this notification, the estate and interest of the person entitled to the lands is converted into a claim for compensation. Section 27 provides that the owner shall be entitled to compensation ; thus, in the case- stated, that private individual may be compensated for his interest in the land, minus the minerals. There is nothing in the Act to enable the State to step in and establish a claim in respect of these minerals; and the general purpose of the Bill would seem to be, in the first place, to vest the property and the minerals in the Commonwealth, to enable them 10 work these minerals subsequently without providing for any compensation to the State. It is absolutely essential that a provision Be inserted in this Bill reserving the right of the State to all minerals known to exist or to any minerals that mav be discovered in the future. It is no part of the policy of the Commonwealth to cary on mining operations, and the giving of this &#34;power may lead, in the course of time, to the Federal authorities acquiring mineral-bearing areas belonging to this State and working them on socialistic lines. </para>

Si far as a certain section of the Legislature is concerned, efforts are being persistently directed towards the attainment of socialistic ends, and we who are opposed, to Socialism must see that safeguards are inserted in the measure to prevent it from being, used to further schemes which were never contemplated when the first Bill was drafted. What I propose will nol&#39; alter the character of the Bill or interfere with any vital principle; on the contrary, it will emphasize its aims and purposes, and strengthen, rather than weaken, it. If the Minister does not propose to amend the Bill, I shall move to do so with a view to securing the recognition of State rights to the minerals in any land which may be acquired.

                        <para>I have been instructed by the Municipal Council of Sydney to call your attention to the far-reaching provisions of the &#34; Commonwealth Lands Acquisition Bill &#34; lately called the &#34; Eminent Domain Bill,&#34; which has passed the Senate and is now before the House of Representatives. The power conferred by the Bill to compulsorily take and resume lands extends to the Crown lands of the several States of the Commonwealth, and the words &#34; Crown lands,&#34; under section 5 of the Bill, include land the property of a State whether reserved or dedicated for any public purpose or not. </para>
                        <para>The principal public parks in the city of Sydney are now controlled by the council, and Crown lands, as defined above, would appear to include these. The council has incurred a capital expenditure of many thousands of pounds in improving and otherwise beautifying these parks and installing electric lighting therein, and annually expends large sums of money in their lighting, upkeep and improvement. </para>
                        <para>Apart from the question as to the expediency of empowering the Commonwealth to compulsorily take from a State its Crown lands (upon which, and other aspects in the Bill, I understand that the Honorable the Attorney-General of New South Wales has written a lengthy minute and addressed same in circular form to the members of the House of Representatives), the council and the ratepayers of the city of Sydney may suffer great injustice if the Bill passed in its present form, inasmuch as the Commonwealth may resume the whole or portions of the public parks under the control of the council, and there appears to be no provision in the Bill for compensation to the council in such an event. </para>
                        <para>There is certainly a provision in section 19 that, in regard to land dedicated for a public park, either House of Parliament may, within thirty days after a notification of resumption has been laid before it, pass a resolution that the notification shall be void and of no effect, but there is no provision for notice being given of the resumption or intended resumption to the council or other trustees of the parks, who in that capacity represent the public. </para>
                        <para>I therefore suggest, that if Parliament desires to give the Commonwealth power to resume the public parks in any State, it should amend the Bill by extending the time within which Parliament may render the notification void, or provide that notification of the resumption shall be given to the council or other trustees for the time , being of the parks. </para>
                        <para>The council will be obliged if you will take steps to have the Bill altered, so as to present less objectionable features. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Is there any objection to providing for the notification of resumption asked for in that letter? It is only reasonable that the Sydney Municipal Council, or other park trustees, should receive a notification of an intention on the part of the Commonwealth Government to resume park land. </para>

He may remain in office a very long time, though I hope not, but he cannot live for ever, and the views of his successor may be very different from his own. We cannot pay regard to the views of the Ministry in office in considering proposed legislation, but must apply general principles. When provisions are seen to threaten public rights and interests we must provide reasonable safeguards against mischievous elements in &#34;them. </para>

Although the Minister says that there is no &#34;desire on the part of the Commonwealth to acquire park lands, it is not very long since it was proposed to erect barracks on a piece of land which was part of the area originally dedicated as a commonage reserve, if, indeed, it was not actually portion of Moore Park, Sydney. </para>

                        <para>Again, the existing Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act of the Commonwealth, No. 13 of 1901, section 5, provides that, in the case of any Crown land- of the State purchased under that&#34; Act, the Government of the State may grant such land in the name of the King to the Commonwealth. Section 6 of the proposed Bill provides that the Governor of a State, with the advice of the Executive Council, may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of any State, sell or lease &#39;to the Commonwealth any Crown land of the State which is required for a public purpose. This last-mentioned section is clearly a violation of the terms of the Imperial Act, iS and 19 Viet., ch. 54, which conferred the Constitution on New South Wales. Section z of the Imperial Act states the entire management and control of the waste lands belonging to the Crown shall be vested in the Legislature of this Colony. Moreover, I think this same section is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution Act of the Commonwealth, because section 61, sub-section 31, provides for the acquisition of property from any State. I am strongly inclined to read &#34;State&#34; as meaning the Parliament of the State and not the Executive Government. </para>

                            <para>- If the Bill merely re-enacts the existing law, it is very strange that so much concern should have been displayed in nearly all the States, and particularly in New South Wales and South Australia. The impression is that States rights are in danger of being seriously invaded. In Adelaide, public feeling has been so greatly excited that one of the largest petitions ever presented to this House was placed in the hands of the honorable and learned member for Angas. </para>

                            <para>- Yet the Minister wishes us to believe that this is a perfectly harmless measure. Only last week a Ministerial supporter in the New South Wales Assembly moved the adjournment of the House in order to permit of a discussion upon this measure. The Attorney-General of New South Wales, who took part in the debate, re-echoed the fears which have been expressed by a number of honorable members during the very disjointed debates which have taken place in this House. The Attorney-General, who was supported bv the deputy leader of the Opposition, used these astonishing words - </para>

                        <para>He regarded the question as a very serious and far-reaching one, which affected the community as a whole. The vital question was the public interest, and he would tell the House what the Government had done to protect it. He regretted that the course which the Government took, although it was prompt, had produced no effect. The Government had received the ordinary courteous Ministerial reply - &#34;Your recommendations will be considered &#34; - and that was all. The State&#39;s representations had apparently been, absolutely ignored. The Bill was entirely unnecessary. </para>

A number of representatives of New &#39;South Wales have received letters pointing out that the Bill is a serious menace to the rights of the citizens of that State. Among others who have protested against its provisions are the members of the Sydney City Council, who consider that their control over the Sydney Domain and other public reserves will be seriously interfered with. A similar feeling exists in Adelaide and Hobart. The Commonwealth desire to obtain power to take over certain lands for the purpose of erecting Customs houses, quarantine stations, post-offices, and defence works. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the honorable and learned member for Angas is perfectly right in urging that specific provision should be made in the Bill that public reserves shall not be interfered with. The complaint which has been received from Adelaide coincides with that which has been urged both in Sydney and in Hobart. I do not pretend to possess the necessary legal knowledge to enable me to determine whether the Bill will have the&#34; effect which the Attorney-General of New South Wales apprehends. But I do know that alarm is being occasioned in the different States, and I have vet to learn why the Minister could not rely upon the provisions of the principal Act. </para>

                            <para>- It will be difficult for the Minister to do that, seeing that the keen eyes of the Attorneys-General of the States, have not been able to discover them. The States fear that the Bill is intended to enable the Commonwealth to arrogate to itself powers which are not conferred upon it by the Constitution. They apprehend a struggle between State rights and Commonwealth power. I &#34;cannot vote for the measure unless some amendment of the character indicated by the honorable and learned member for Angas be embodied in it, and unless State rights in respect to any minerals found upon land acquired by the Commonwealth be preserved. To my mind, the Government are blameable for the scant courtesy which has been accorded to the Attorney-General of New South Wales in connexion with this Bill. </para>

                        <para>When the Bill was before the Federal Parliament objections were drawn up by him and forwarded to each of the New South Wales members, pointing out, among other things that the Bill would give power to the Commonwealth to filch park lands in the heart of the city. He also made representations to the Prime Minister and suggested certain amendments which should be made in the Bill in the interests of the States, and to protect the States against possible invasion by the Federal Government. That communication was acknowledged, but apparently the amendments suggested were not going to be given effect to. </para>

At any rate, the fact is undeniable that alarm is being created by this Bill in the different ent States - alarm which, I trust, the Minister will be able to .dispel. Earlier this afternoon, the honorable and learned gentleman admitted that the measure was not important. If that be so, why should it not be removed from the business-paper? </para>

                        <para>.- This Bill very properly originated in the Senate, because it seems to me that, underlying it, there is an attempt to interfere with the separate privileges of the States. I am aware that considerable attention has been paid to the wishes of the States by the Government, but I do think that the measure is deserving of our very closest consideration. </para>

                            <para>- It is unfortunate that the measure should have been introduced in the closing hours of the session. It is quite true that it merely proposes to deal with properties which are acquired by the Commonwealth for purely public purposes, but, as the honorable and learned member for Angas has repeatedly pointed out. the municipalities, and especially the metropolitan municipalities, are very seriously exercised in mind as to how it will affect them. I am glad to learn from the Minister that it is not proposed to interfere with the mineral rights at present possessed by the States. </para>

                            <para>- And very properly sp. The Bill involves numerous legal difficulties concerning which I am  not qualified to speak. In Committee, I shall certainly support the proposal which has been outlined by the honorable and learned member for Angas. We must allay the suspicion entertained by the States and by many of the municipalities, that under this Bill we shall interfere with properties which they possess, and that we shall be clothed with coercive powers which are not contemplated by &#34;the Constitution. &#39; It is quite true that an interpretation may be read into the measure which would permit land to be acquired for purely experimental purposes. For instance, it might be held that land acquired for the purpose of establishing a great socialistic colony had been acquired for &#34; public purposes.&#34; I wish to clearly indicate that I shall oppose any proposal which has for its object the enlargement of the powers of the Commonwealth in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite aware of that. No doubt an appeal to the High Court would set matters right. This Parliament appears to be setting the individual States bv the ear. bv arrogating to itself powers which they are unwilling to concede. With an earnest desire to see the Legislature performing the magnificent work which has been committed to it, I say that we should seek to avoid disturbing the harmonious relationships which ought to exist between the Commonwealth and the States. I am perfectly satisfied that at the Conference of Premiers which will be held in Melbourne next week it will be conclusively shown that the States are opposed to the passing of such measures. At the present stage I merely desire to indicate my position, and to express the hope that the Minister will recognise that the amendment which has been outlined by the honorable and learned member for Angas is deserving of very serious consideration. I regret that another branch of the Legislature which was specially created to safeguard the rights of the States should have subordinated those interests to party considerations. That, I think, is an evil which must inevitably create dissension between the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to occupy many minutes in debating this Bill, because I recognise that constituted as it is it is idle to address any argument to the House. I wish to say, however, that, in my judgment, it is wrong to seek to push this measure through the House at the fag end of a Parliament, a large number of the members of which have had to leave to prosecute the campaign now upon us. Parliament ought not to be sitting at the present time. The Government seem to be infinitely more anxious - no doubt for political purposes - to place a number of measures upon the statute-book than to secure the. welfare of Australia by allowing members ample time and opportunity to carry on the election campaign. At the fag end of the Parliament, and with not half as many honorable members present as is necessary to constitute a quorum, we are discussing a proposal affecting the fundamental differences between the functions of the States and those of the Commonwealth. There could be no more important proposal than this, but there does not appear to be the slightest interest in it on the part of honorable members. If this attitude will contribute to the confidence reposed in the Parliament and Government of the Commonwealth by the various States Governments. I do not know how to beget confidence. I can conceive of nothing which can so tend to destroy the confidence of the States in the Commonwealth as the treating of such matters as those now before us in this perfunctory w av. There is nothing more calculated to destroy that feeling that ought to exist between the States and the Commonwealth. The States have every reason to complain of the scant courtesy we pay them, and of the cavalier way in which we are treating their requests. They certainly have a right to object to the way in which we propose to take to ourselves powers which they consider rightly belong to themselves. It seems nowadays to be an accepted maxim in this House that there should be no discussion of important measures. As soon as an important proposal is submitted the House empties itself, and remains practically empty as it has been during this afternoon. It is time for the States to look after their powers and privileges when they are treated in this way by the Commonwealth Parliament, which is set to guard their interests as sacredly as it guards its own. The Minister said that in moving the second reading of this Bill he explained the reasons why it ought to be passed. I have read his speech, and can find only one or two vague hints that some of the sections in the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act are not so clear as they might be. The honorable and learned gentleman, however, has not pointed out any section that is defective, and requires to be amended. This Bill comprises sixty-three clauses, and is not merely designed to remedy the defects of a former Act. It seems to mean the enactment of a new Lands Acquisition Act. If that is not the case, why should we find in this measure so many machinery and other clauses? When we have a Bill of such &#34;dimensions brought before us, the least we can do is to give it the attention it deserves. The number of honorable members present should be sufficient to make it worth one&#39;s while to discuss it as it ought to be discussed. But in this Legislature parliamentary discussion has been absolutely destroyed. That is one of the outstanding complaints that the electors have a right to allege against the conduct of this Parliament. The Minister tells us that there is no justification for the scare on the part of the States in connexion with this Bill. Their Attorneys-General, however, are as keen, and, I believe, as sincere and industrious in the performance of their functions as is the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or the Minister in charge of this measure, and I cannot believe that they have all been seized by an empty scare. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that the Attorneys-General of the States would have taken action to put down the scare regarding this Bill if they had not: believed&#39; that there was something in it. They are charged with the duty of guarding State rights, and I should not imagine that they would permit to continue a scare for which there is no foundation. We find, however, that those members of the States Parliament who have dealt with this question ha.ve expressed themselves warily. The fact remains that in nearly all the States there have been agitations and protests against some of the provisions of this Bill. Many of its provisions are certainly debatable. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth has addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the Attorney-General of New South Wales, a communication in reply to his memorandum of protest. It &#34;does not appear, however, that that statement has convinced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> that his former assertions were erroneous. As a matter of fact, he still stands by most of them, and does not consider that an answer has been furnished. After looking over the memorandum prepared by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, I have come to the conclusion that it is not an adequate reply to the criticism that has been launched against the Bill by the Attorney-General of New South Wales. It has been compressed into the smallest possible space, although that in itself would not be an objection if the substantive matter of the argument were such as would commend it. I venture to say, however, that in that reply difficulties are brushed aside&#39; and overlooked in a way that is not likely to satisfy any one whose special duty it is to guard the interests of a State. I do not think that the statement ..made to-day by the Minister of Home. Affairs that this Bil! carries upon its face the fact that, under it. lands are to be acquired only for public purposes, is conclusive. The title of the Bill does not govern all its provisions. The Minister would not contend for one moment that the whole contents of a measure, when it has to be interpreted, must be read absolutely in the light of its title. Bills have been passed the contents of which have absolutely belied their titles. Such an occurrence would argue nothing except that they had been dealt with in a slovenly and clumsy fashion. Is it not a fact that points of order are taken which sometimes result in the destruction of a Bill, because its contents do not conform to the title? But because in this case the title of the Bill is all right, the Minister would have us believe that the Bill itself is satisfactory. Apart from the title, there is hardly a provision in which the term &#34; public purposes&#34; appears. If its clauses are to be limited to the acquirement of land for public purposes, why should we not remove all ambiguity, and make the Bill what the title declares it to be? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned gentleman says that the Constitution saves us. It may save us from the consequences of many of the laws we have passed.. Many people hope that it will, and are appealing to the High Court to test the constitutionality of many measures hurriedly passed by this Parliament. Is it reasonable* however, that we should rely upon anything of the kind? If we have to rely on the High Court to interpret the Constitution, why should we not adopt the Canadian practice, and first obtain from the Court a definition of our powers with respect to any matter in which we are in doubt, instead of legislating in the dark, and making all sorts of blunders in the belief that they will be corrected by that tribunal, and that the Constitution will prevent us from going far wrong? In spite of the Constitution, some strange things occur - things to which it is absolutely opposed. The existence of the Constitution does not constitute an argument in reply to my assertion that the powers that we take under the Bill should be explicitly defined in it. Unless clause 13 is amended- </para>

The Court would say that the fact that the title of the Bill did not square with the body of it, simply argued that the whole measure had been clumsily drawn and passed. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently it is of little concern to honorable members generally that the Government purpose to acquire land from the States without consulting the State authorities. We cannot wonder that the State authorities criticise the Commonwealth harshly. We give them every excuse for doing so, by the inattention which we bestow on the measures coming before us. By clause 62 the Governor-General is expressely authorized to grant leases or licences for mining purposes, in regard to any land the property of the Commonwealth. . Clearly, then, it is proposed to acquire the minerals under the ground as well as the surface of the land needed for any public purposes. In the second place, it must be intended thar the Commonwealth may mine in such land or authorize private individuals &#34;to do so. It seems impossible to escape the conclusion that, under this provision, the Commonwealth may arrange for mining on its own account. The expression &#34; public purposes &#34; in the title will not hinder that, because mining is a public purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I have already heard it argued in this Chamber that incidentally and impliedly the Constitution gives the Commonwealth power to take over and operate business enterprises of many kinds. I have heard that argued by the Attorney-General. Any difficulties could be got over bv making the powers incidental to powers plainly conferred by the Constitution. It is argued that there are implied powers in the Constitution which gc verv far, and reach .to nearly every commercial relation. Are not candidates already advocating the enlargement of the powers of the Commonwealth, with a view to allowing it to enter upon industrial enterprises? Within the last fortnight I have read that two candidates standing in the interests of the Government are advocating the nationalization of mines by the Commonwealth. Therefore, the provisions of the Bill assume a seriousness in the eyes of the authorities of the States which they would not otherwise have. If another Parliament like this were elected, it might not be long before these powers were taken, whether given by the Constitution or not. Already, on more than one occasion, this Parliament has not scrupled to exercise powers of doubtful constitutional validity, and a statement bv the Attorney-General that the exercise of certain powers might be constitutional, might be enough to secure parliamentary sanction for certain enterprises. Therefore, the States do well to be cautious. </para>

                            <para>- If they were returned in sufficient numbers to carry their opinions into effect it would matter very considerably, just as it would be a serious matter if a large number of members were returned pledged to bring about the nationalization of mines. I referred to the subject &#39;to show that it is not beyond the range of possibility that an attempt may be made to secure the nationalization of mines, and to exercise other similar powers. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to fellow the honorable and learned member for Angas in this matter. In my opinion, his amendment meets the case. With regard to mining, I think that it cannot do harm to make it clear in the Bill that the Commonwealth has no intention of undertaking mining operations, but leaves control of mining to the States. However, it is of not much use to address the House in regard to the provisions of the measure, because only the slightest interest seems to be taken in the discussion. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to refer to one or two points raised by honorable members opposite. To repeat what I said in introducing the Bill, the present Act has been re-drafted on the advice of tha law officers of the Crown to improve the phraseology, to make it simpler, and at the same .time effect alterations necessary for administrative purposes. We are not seeking for new- powers, and the statement that we are attempting to filch powers which the Constitution does not give us is absolutely incorrect; no matter whence it comes. We are nor asking for any greater power than exists in the present Act with regard to the acquisition of either park lands or mineral properties. The opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the Attorney-General of New South Wales, has been extensively quoted by honorable members; but I am sure that if that honorable and learned gentleman would only reconsider the Bill, he would find that his criticism was not substantiated. I ask honorable members to exercise their own judgment after reading the Bill, the Constitution, and the reply of the Attorney-General to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade.</inline></para>

                        <para>The provisions of the Bill affect the State of New South Wales in precisely the same manner as they affect the other States - without discrimination of any kind. I am not aware that they are one-sided, except in the sense in which any provision for compulsory acquisition must be initiated by one side, and if necessary for the public interest carried through, notwithstanding the objections of another. But even here I am unable to detect any injustice, because the fullest compensation is provided for. The same principle is embodied by New South Wales itself in ils State Act for compulsory acquisition of land <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Public Works Act</inline> 1900). </para>

The sole power to make laws with respect to these areas rests with the Commonwealth itself. In administering the Act I was confronted with this position : In the State of Victoria no less than twelve or fifteen applications were made bv persons who desired to lease lands vested in the Commonwealth. The State Government could not deal with these matters, because the lands were exclusively under Commonwealth control. We had power to grant certain leases, but no express power to insure that any mining carried on upon our property should be conducted properly. The Victorian Government brought the matter before the Conference of Premiers.

                        <para>The matter has been before me. The position we find ourselves in is this, that where land is vested absolutely in the Commonwealth it becomes the subject of exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, but it seemed to me it was not desirable that the Commonwealth should retain large areas of land, containing within them great sources of wealth, and not put them at the disposal of those who could win the gold, subject, of course, to certain regulations. It did not seem to me that, as a Commonwealth, we could .introduce a Mining Act with conditions as to inspection, safety of mines, and so on. It seems more advisable for us, as a Commonwealth, to pass an Act dealing with the lands of that description of which we are in possession, and which belong exclusively to the Commonwealth. We can provide that the State laws in which the particular land is situated shall operate with respect to mining. The matter might then be administered by the State authorities; and, as regards royalties, there should be a mutual arrangement. The matter is receiving consideration at the present time. </para>

We say, in effect, that <inline font-style="italic">i\</inline> any individual wants to mine upon our lar.ds We will have to make an application to the Commonwealth for a lease.

                            <para>- My statement appeared to satisfy the States Premiers that we were proposing to treat them fairly, and all I am asking honorable members to do is to agree to the proposition that I placed before the Premiers. It is peculiar that the Attorney-General of New South Wales should refer to this section in connexion with his statement as to the Federal authorities working the mines on socialistic lines. That seems .to me to be an extraordinary view to take. </para>

                            <para>In the first place, section 14, which provides for the different modes of acquisition, simply speaks of land without qualification. Land, according to the definition of section 5, includes Crown land whether reserved or dedicated for any public purpose or not. Thus the Commonwealth may compulsorily acquire land belonging to this State which has been dedicated to one of the many public purposes known to our law, and, according to section 14. that acquisition need not be for a public purpose, as known to the Commonwealth Constitution. This same section empowers the Commonwealth to acquire land belonging to a private individual. That land may contain minerals, which were reserved to the Crown on alienation by the State. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>In reply to that, the Attorney-General points out - </para>
                    <para>The title of the Bill, and the whole tenor of its provisions, show clearly that it applies only to acquisition for public purposes, as defined in clause 5, that is to say, national purposes. It is quite unnecessary to repeat those words in every clause of the Bill. Clause 14, for- instance, is merely a clause, specifying the two modes of acquisition - by agreement and by compulsory process. It has no relation whatever to the purpose of acquisition. </para>
                    <para>The clause certainly applies to any land, without exception - as the corresponding section in the existing Act of 1901 does. </para>
                    <para class="block">The next point dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> relates to the sinking of pits, and the Attorney-General in reply shows that that provision is contained in every State Statute relating to the acquisition of land at the present time, and the clause is only a re-enactment of the present Act, section 49, sub-section 1. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> proceeds - </para>
                    <para>It will be seen from the sections quoted that the Bill will enable the Commonwealth to acquire mineral-bearing lands, and to mine upon them, and to receive all the profits resulting from the operation. </para>
                    <para class="block">In reply, the Attorney-General says - </para>
                    <para>If this criticism means that the Bill empowers the Commonwealth to acquire land for the purpose of carrying on the business of mining, I differ entirely. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable- member would listen more attentively he would know exactly what I &#39;said. In the first instance, the Commonwealth can only acquire land for public purposes. We take from the&#39; States grants containing their usual reservations. We have taken from New South Wales land down to a certain depth but we have no desire to acquire more land than we need for our Commonwealth purposes. The honorable member for Parramatta suggests that we should not reserve to ourselves the right to acquire the whole of a piece of landed property. But let us suppose that we wish to erect a very large building. We must of necessity acquire the land upon which to erect it, and the rights under that land. We cannot allow anybody to mine under that land, and thus destroy the foundations of our building. </para>

                        <para>I quite agree that a construction of section 14 which would extend its application to acquisition for other than a public purpose as defined, would make it <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> to that extent. But such a construction is, in my opinion, impossible, and the notion that the Commonwealth would ever attempt to take land for other than public purposes is not to be attributed to it. I cannot agree that when the Commonwealth has acquired land for a public purpose it has not full rights of proprietorship. The argument that it has not would apparently lead to the conclusion that the Commonwealth cannot <inline font-style="italic">(e.g.)</inline> give licences to depasture cattle on a rifle range. </para>

There may be several owners of several estates or interests in respect of the same area. Each is entitled to full compensation for his estate or interest.

If it acquires from the estate any interest reserved by the State, it must similarly compensate the State in full. </para>

                        <para>I fail to see the humiliation. The State is not &#34; sovereign &#34; as against the Commonwealth, within the sphere in which the Commonwealth has paramount legislative power. </para>

                    <para>The invariable practice is to treat before compulsory acquisition. But apparently the suggestion is that, if the treaty fails, no power of compulsory acquisition should remain, except by leave of the Supreme Court of the State. In other words, the determination of a question of Commonwealth public policy - the necessity of the acquisition - would be transferred to the State Judiciary. The mere statement of this proposition is a sufficient answer to it. </para>
                    <para>I do not understand the suggestion that the power to dispose of the land does not cover the case of returning it to the State. Under a precisely similar provision in the present Act, it is a frequent practice to return land to the State. </para>

                        <para>Clause 6 of the Bill, which from the beginning practically did nothing more than formally recognise and emphasize the power of the Stale to deal with its own lands, if it so wished, has, since its introduction, been altered to a form which may probably be thought even less open to objection than at first. The object of the clause was, and is, to avoid the necessity of compulsory acquisition where the parties voluntarily agree. </para>

                    <para class="block">To my mind, the Attorney-General has fully answered all the objections which have been raised. The doubts which have teen expressed are surprising, because whatever powers are alleged to be conferred bv this Bill in respect of the taking over of park lands and of the acquisition of mineral rights are contained in the existing Commonwealth laws. There was no cause whatever for the alarm which has been created. </para>

                            <para>- I am not responsible for the Constitution. I can assure the honorable member that this Bill, like the original Act, is intended only to provide for the acquisition of lands for public purposes as defined by the Constitution. It will give us only that power. The Commonwealth has never acquired lands for other than such purposes, and to try to restrict the power of acquisition within much smaller limits would be to seriously interfere with our power to acquire land for the purpose of erecting forts, and might lead to action which might interfere seriously with the foundations of some of our great buildings. We must have power under this Bill to acquire such lands as are necessary to preserve our public buildings. </para>

As a matter of fact, some of the States have already complained of our action in returning properties to them, and have asked us to fix a time after which it shall not be competent for us to return them. There is nothing in the point raised bv the honorable member. The Commonwealth, as a whole, has dealt fairly with the States. It has shown every consideration for States rights, and, above all, it has always conserved the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">Some doubts have arisen as to the preservation of the integrity of the park lands of Australia. I may say at once that no one has a greater desire to preserve to the people the parks of the people than has the present Administration. We realize that &#39; unfortunately the number of park lands in Australia is far too small, and that it would be a calamity if any of the parks of the people were taken from them, except in the very gravest national emergency. This Bill re-enacting the existing law, follows the somewhat similar provisions of the New South Wales Act of 1 900, which &#39; provides that when land is Crown land, or vested in any corporation for public purposes, dedication or reservation may be cancelled, and the land taken without a special Act of Parliament. We have followed that provision. Under the existing Act there has never been any attempt to compulsorily acquire park lands of any description. We have always regarded them as sacred. Trie point has been raised, however, that we should put the matter beyond all doubt bv expressly providing in the Bill, that our power to acquire land shall not apply to park or other lands set aside for the use of the people In these circumstances, therefore, I have submitted this amendment. The form which it takes is dictated bv the fact that we have to deal, not with one State, but with six. An attempt to define . the park lands of one State might not be sufficient to preserve the park lands of another. We therefore desire to have exactly the same cower as have the Governments of Victoria and Western Australia. The Government of Victoria have power by Executive act to set aside lands in the first place for temporary purposes, and, secondly, for permanent purposes. Lands permanently set aside cannot be touched except bv special Act of Parliament. The lands of Western Australia are also divided into two classes, and class A includes all parks and public lands which, having been once proclaimed, cannot be interfered with except bv special Act of Parliament. We think that we should adopt the same course, and obtain in the first instance from all the States a satisfactory definition of what are their park lands. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. And we should have a definition that will cover future reservations of lands for the use of the people. If my amendment be agreed to it will enable the Government to proclaim future park lands as well as those now existing. Park lands may be field by a municipality, but other park lands of equal importance, such, for instance, as the National Park of New South Wales, need to be preserved just as much as do the park lands of the city. There are national reserves for the preservation of the flora of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Un&#39;der this clause we shall have power to proclaim these lands so that they cannot be taken over for defence or other purposes, except by special Act. If we attempted to apply one definition to park lands generally we might tie our hands. What might be an adequate definition in one State might be injurious to others, and I therefore hope that the Committee will accept my amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- This seems to be a halting recognition on the part of the Government of the very important suggestions made to them by various public bodies since the introduction of this Bill. Apparently, with some reluctance, the Ministry have seen fit to give way to the views expressed, not only in the public press, but by very influential bodies, who have presented petitions to this House. &#39; I had the honour of presenting a petition from Adelaide to which there were no less than 8,338 signatures. These had been collected in the course of a few days, and when the petition was sent to me for presentation, I was assured that had time permitted the signature of practically every adult citizen of Adelaide could have been obtained to it. That was the impression of those who set out to secure the strength of numbers necessary to back up the appeal made in this petition to the reason of the House. The Ministry, whilst apparently giving way to this demand, take up a rather foolish &#39;attitude. With the pedantry of a schoolmaster, rather than with the policy of a statesman, they have proclaimed from the housetops that &#34; we, the great Commonwealth of Australia, ought to have these powers; we do not&#39; desire to exercise them,&#34; and they insist on this assertion of power, although at present .the susceptibilities of the States are touched, and very properly touched, by their inclusion in this Bill&#39;. The Minister said in the first instance that the Government had not the remotest intention of taking over the public parks, but that they must for the sake of the dignity of the Commonwealth provide in the Bill for the necessary power to do so. That was the attitude first adopted by the Ministry when the reasonable request was made that we should exclude from this Bill the power to take over by compulsion the dedicated lands of the States. I suggested a month ago an amendment which the Ministry opposed until last week, when, under additional pressure, the Minister of Home Affairs circulated an amendment in which it is proposed that this exemption shall be made, not by Bill, but by the Executive by proclamation. In other words, the park lands to be preserved under the operation of the Bill are to be declared, not by Parliament, but by the Minister for the time being. </para>

I am trying to keep within the lines of the requests respectfully made to the House, and backed up by petitions, and the Minister, while saying that he wishes to go further, purposes to do practically nothing. Because he cannot frame a definition which will do more than he is asked to do, he wishes to do at present nothing at all, his proposal being to settle the matter subsequently by a proclamation, which may or may not be issued.. I suggest that we should, so far as we can, define what we mean. If the Minister wishes to go beyond my definition, let him add his amendment to it. </para>

                            <para>- That has not been made plain. As the Minister does not provide for purchase by agreement, I have not done so. We have the inherent power to acquire land by agreement. We could not exercise against the State of New South Wales, for example, the power of compulsory acquisition except for purposes prescribed by the Constitution; but we could purchase from private individuals, or that State, enough land to carry on, say, the manufacture of tobacco until our power to engage in such an industry were challenged. The Bill, however, is to deal with compulsory acquisition. The Minister&#39;s amendment does not provide for the acquisition for public purposes of park land by agreement with the authorities in whom they are vested, though I should be willing to do so. I ask the Committee to accept my amendment with a view to excluding from the operation of the measure park lands dedicated to municipalities or townships under any State Act, or as a direct gift from the Crown. It preserves the dignity of the Commonwealth, because it does not say that its powers shall never be exercised. Under the Bill the mere issue of a proclamation is sufficient to divest park lands from the body in which they are vested, and to vest them in the Commonwealth. In my opinion, the acquisition of such lands should be by Act of Parliament, which would give opportunity for opposition, if necessary. </para>

My amendment is in the present tense, in conformity with the rest of the clause, whereas the Minister&#39;s amendment is in the future tense. A &#34;proclamation&#34; is defined in the Acts Interpretation Act as a proclamation by the Governor-General published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> so that the proclamation mentioned in the Minister&#39;s amendment is a proclamation of the Commonwealth, not of a State. A proclamation under a State Act would not avail against a Commonwealth proclamation. If the Minister&#39;s amendment is carried, it will rest with the Executive to give effect to it, and the people of the States desire that we shall provide in the Bill that certain dedicated lands and reserves do not come within its scope.

                            <para>- I looked at the definition covering the municipal park lands of Adelaide, and I think that the words which I have used are sufficient to embrace all the park lands connected with the townships and municipalities of the Commonwealth, though not a reserve like the National Park in New South Wales. I had no wish to exclude such reserves, and if the Minister wishes to provide for them he can do so, either by adding to my amendment, or by issuing a proclamation. I think that the amendment should be carried, in view of the very strong opinion which prevails that the Commonwealth should not be empowered to acquire park land. </para>

Why should the interests of the &#39;Commonwealth be paramount to the interests of the public of a State in a matter of that sort? Under that clause, the Commonwealth could acquire a pleasure ground or park land dedicated to the public under a State Act. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable and learned member and myself are at one in our desire to preserve the public parks of the Commonwealth; but we differ as to the terms of the provision which should be inserted in the Bill. I think that my amendment will meet the case fully and completely. I certainly could not accept one portion of the honorable member&#39;s amendment, because I am advised it would exempt large areas of waste lands from the operation of the compulsory clauses. In some of the States there are, in the neighbourhood of many townships, large commonage areas which are reserved for the use of the residents. If the amendment were inserted, we could not acquire a piece of such land for the purposes of a rifle range. </para>

We have permissive occupancy only, and we desire to have the right to acquire the properties if we think it necessary. As settlement increases and townships grow, these commons cease to serve the purposes for which they were originally reserved. In Queensland, many of them have recently been cut up and sold for fanning purposes. In every instance in which it has been necessary to acquire land, we have been most careful to see that no injustice was done. </para>

                            <para>- I have mentioned the principal points. It will be very difficult to adopt a satisfactory definition of lands which should be excluded from the operation of the compulsory clauses. I have looked into this matter very carefully, and I have come to the conclusion that if we adopted a hard-and-fast definition we should probably exclude from the operation of the Bill lands which we should have the power to acquire, whilst, on the other hand, we might take power to acquire lands which should be permanently reserved for the use of the people. </para>

                            <para>- No, but when we spend large sums of money upon rifle ranges, we should have some security of tenure, and the Department are making arrangements in that direction as far as possible. We might want to acquire for rifle range purposes some land which could not be regarded as park lands or recreation reserves, and I think that we should have the power to do so. I should like honorable members to look at clause 19, which provides that where Crown land is dedicated for a public park or for the recreation or amusement of the people, either House of the Parliament may pass a resolution declaring that its acquisition shall be null and void. Therefore, either House will have the power to set aside any acquisition that may be deemed improper. </para>

                            <para>- The Parliament which the honorable member describes would be composed of representatives of all the States, and probably the honorable and learned member would be one of its most notable ornaments. There would be nothing, to prevent a Parliament meeting in the bush from acquiring a proper knowledge of any case that might arise under this Bill. I am afraid that the amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member would hamper, rather than assist, the Administration. We are making an honest attempt to meet the wishes of the people whose fears have been excited by our proposals. I do not think that their interests are in any danger, but, perhaps, it is as well that their minds should be made eas\- </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister has, in the course of his speech, supplied the best of reasons for inserting the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Angas. Large areas of land are dedicated for recreation and other public purposes, and it seems to me that if the Minister will accept the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Angas, and thus limit the scope of the Bill, we shall be able to preserve to the people all park lands and reserves until we declare bv proclamation that some of them are required for public purposes. </para>

                        <para>. - When the Minister submitted his amendment, I thought that he had gone as far as possible to meet every possible objection which could be urged against the powers which will be conferred by; this Bill. I quite agree with those who suggest that in the absence of such an amendment there may be friction between the local governing bodies and the Department of Home Affairs. But from what I know of the very keen manner in which honorable members watch the interests of municipalities and of other public bodies likely to &#39;be affected by Federal proposals, I do not think - even in the absence of this amendment - that there is any chance of injustice being done by reason of the Commonwealth acquiring land necessary for the purposes of public recreation. In my opinion, the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Angas does not go so far as does that of the Minister himself. There are limitations about his amendment which &#60;lo not apply to the proposal submitted by the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what he thinks. But certainly the limitations proposed by the honorable and learned member for Angas apply only to reserves within a municipality or adjoining it, or to reserves adjoining a township. Now, it is quite possible that there may be reserves which do not adjoin a municipality, which are not included in it, and which do not adjoin a township. The amendment of the honorable and learned member for Angas would allow these to be acquired by the Commonwealth, whereas the Minister&#39;s proposal puts the matter in a simple form by declaring that the lands acquired shall not include park lands or any other lands which have been dedicated to the use of the public. I know of no provision which could be wider in its application than that. My experience teaches me that this Parliament is keener to preserve the rights of the people in respect of their park lands than are some of the States, Parliaments. It would be a great deal more difficult to persuade a majority of the Commonwealth Parliament to agree to the acquisition of any reserve in opposition to the wish of the people concerned than it would be to secure a majority in favour of that course in a State Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Upon that occasion they did. I mention the matter with a view to showing that the States Parliaments are more amenable to influences of that character than is this Parliament. Seeing that the Minister has gone so far as to exclude from the definition of &#34; lands &#34; not only park lands, but all&#39; other lands which may have been reserved, I am of opinion that the Committee should be satisfied. If we go further, we shall only complicate matters. </para>

                        <para>.- Personally, I believe that the Committee would act wisely if it limited the definition of the word &#34;lands&#34; to a specific schedule, which might have been attached to the Bill. If the whole object of the measure is to enable us to acquire from the States for Commonwealth purposes, lands which it may hereafter be found necessary to acquire, I do think that even with a limitation of the definition, we shall still have power to secure lands for purposes which are foreign to the original intention of the measure. For instance, it would be quite possible for us to obtain a large area for the purpose of carrying out a socialistic experiment. I therefore feel that the Committee would be justified in asking the Minister to attach to the Bill a schedule of the properties which it is proposed to take over. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind. I merely wish at this stage to repeat the statement I made on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, that there is a disposition to encroach upon the rights of the States, and to enlarge the powers of the Commonwealth in a direction which I think is at present undesirable. As a compromise has been arrived at which is fairly satisfactory, I shall not take the responsibility of suggesting an amendment ; but I wish to place on record my belief that the definition of the word &#34;land,&#34; even as proposed to be amended, will place in the hands of the Government of the day a power which was not contemplated when the Constitution was passed. I enter my protest, and signify my dissent from what I believe the unnecessary enlargement of our present powers. Although I recognise that the Ministry make this proposal in perfect good faith, I feel that hereafter this great power - notwithstanding the qualification to be imposed - may be used disadvantageously and for purposes altogether foreign to our intention. </para>

The amendment deals with commonage lands and reserves adjoining municipalities or townships. </para>

                        <para>. - I trust that the honorable member for Lang will not press his amendment. The Commonwealth Government have no intention of undertaking mining operations on their own behalf. We have at the present time power to acquire land expressly for public purposes, and many of the States insert , all sorts of reservations and conditions in their grants. We invariably enter into a voluntary agreement with them, and never resort, unless compelled to do so, to the power to compulsorily purchase land. In one or two instances the States Governments have asked us to exercise that powder, because, owing to the peculiar conditions associated with the negotiations, they have considered that they have not the power to give us the necessary grant. I have already pointed out that the power to grant mining leases was inserted in this Bill at the request of the States. The request was made originally by the Premier of Victoria at a Conference presided over by the Premier of New South Wales, and the provision was expressly inserted to enable mining operations to be carried on. From a departmental point of view; it will be a misfortune if this Bill is not passed. It is urgently needed to meet applications which we have received for the issue of mining leases in respect of land in this State, and which we are at present unable to grant. The amendment would seriously interfere with our powers. We must preserve the foundations of our buildings. Are we to say that the Commonwealth shall not take a grant from a State unless it gives that State the right to undermine Federal property? If we do anything of the kind, we shall place ourselves in an unfortunate position. Having administered the existing Act, I cannot advise the Commonwealth Parliament to pass legislation under which, if we took from a State a grant of land necessary for the erection of a great fort, that State would have power to, perhaps, mine under it for coal. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable member that it would not be sufficient. Under section 71 of the Victorian Mines Act 1897, it is provided that leases to mine under private land shall not be granted except at depths exceeding, in the case of a garden, orchard, or vineyard, 100 feet, and in the case of a city, town, or borough, or under a public building, &#38;c, 400 feet. Under the New South Wales Mining on Private Lands Act of 1894, no attempt is made to fix an arbitrary minimum depth for mining under land, power being given the Governor to fix the minimum depth in each case. The honorable member for Lang will see that it would be inadvisable to agree to the limitation he proposes. By arrangement with New South Wales, and other States, we acquire from time to time a depth of land that is merely sufficient for our own purposes. We have always met the States in a reasonable way. The honorable member has spoken of the sovereign rights of the States ; but what would be said of the sovereignty of a national Parliament which could not be trusted with the power to take steps to preserve the foundations of its own buildings. </para>

That provision has been inserted at the instance of the States, as the honorable member will see by looking at the report of the Premiers&#39; Conference.

Clause <inline font-style="italic">62</inline> very properly provides that any mining done on Commonwealth lands shall be subject to the conditions of the laws of the States, because it would be ludicrous to permit it to be done under laws which differed from those applying to the mining in adjoining land. While the Commonweal th should not acquire more land than necessary, when land is required&#34; for public purposes withn the meaning and intention of the Constitution there should be no reservation. All rights should pass with the transfer. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not sure that we should give to the Commonwealth all the rights which the honorable member for Kooyong thinks should pass to it under a conveyance of land. I find that at the Premiers&#39; Conference the Minister suggested that the right to mine should be leased out by the Commonwealth on royalty, and a mutual arrangement made between the States and the Commonwealth in regard to the matter. It was evidently contemplated that the Commonwealth should enter upon mining enterprises. But there is another question to consider, and that is the safety of some of the most important State enterprises. For instance, the catchment area of the Sydney water supply covers several hundred square miles, and it has often been suggested in the State Parliament that persons should be permitted to mine within it. It has been calculated that the minerals under the surface are worth something like ^20.000,000 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> but, hitherto, the State authorities have resolutely refused to grant permission to mine there. If the Commonwealth acquired part of that reserve, and permitted mining, the position might be serious. </para>

                            <para>- I hope so. But there is already great difference of opinion on this question, and the Commonwealth Government, being further removed from the scene, might be more likely than a State Government to yield to pressure, and allow mining, possibly to the danger of the water supply. The honorable member for Lang is trying to guard against that. </para>

                            <para>- It is well known that underneath the whole of Sydney there are large and valuable coal deposits. A shaft has recently been sunk to a depth of 3,000 feet in the electorate of the honorable member for Dalley, and a very valuable coal seam has been struck. If the Commonwealth acquired a large area of land in or near Sydney, and proceeded to exploit the mineral resources underlying the surface, the interests of the whole city would be affected. The honorable member for Lang desires that in respect to land acquired by the Commonwealth the States shall have reserved to them the mineral rights, so that they may exploit them in such a manner as they may think fit, or prevent them from being exploited if they consider that the public interest would be detrimentally affected. The Minister told us that the Commonwealth would not be* likely to interfere with the rights pf the States, but in the past many strange things have happened. Other strange things are likely to happen in the future in connexion with the exercise of two conflicting jurisdictions, based on other than friendly relations. I have no doubt that the Minister would make legitimate use of the Commonwealth powers, but we have heard some of his colleagues talking about what they would do with regard to the States and States rights if they had their way. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment. I am surprised that the Senate did not see that the rights of the States, of which they are the special custodians, were fully protected. I do not consider that there is nearly as much danger of an invasion of their rights as some of the States authorities seem to think. A large section of the public, however, appear to be very much exercised bv fears that the Commonwealth will endeavour to usurp powers to which they are not entitled, and they wish the Federal authorities to be kept strictly w thin their own domain. Much of the alarm which has been expressed is due to the impression that the Commonwealth might acquire, ostensibly for public purposes, large areas of valuable mineral lands, and proceed to exploit their mineral resources, without regard to the interests of the State in which the property was situated. The honorable member for Parramatta has mentioned the case of a coal mine in my electorate. Over &#163;250,000 has been spent in sinking a shaft to a depth of 3,000 feet. A valuable seam of coal has recently been struck at that depth, and within a very short time vessels of the largest draught will be loaded with coal at what is practically the pit&#39;s mouth. It is only natural that the States authorities should seek to prevent any interference by the Commonwealth with valuable mineral resources of that character. It may shortly become necessary to acquire large areas of land at Newcastle for defence purposes, and it is considered that the Commonwealth authorities might, unless some restriction were placed upon them, enter upon extensive coal mining operations there. Similarly, they might acquire land at Broken Hill or Cobar, and avail themselves to the fullest extent of the mineral resources of the property purchased bv them under the compulsory provisions of the Bill. I do not for one moment suppose that the Commonwealth will ever attempt to engage in extensive mining operations in any part of the Commonwealth, or that any undue advantage would be taken of any powers conferred by a Bill such as that now before us ; but </para>

                            <para>- I admit that it is; but we cannot altogether ignore it. The honorable and learned member and myself, as citizens of the Commonwealth, know very well that there is no danger to be apprehended, but the States authorities wish their position to be set forth in black and white. I believe that the proposed provision would be verv much like a &#34;chip in porridge.&#34; but it would at least restore the equanimity of the States , authorities. I believe that underlying the agitation in the States is the apprehension that the Commonwealth&#39; mav. under cover of this Bill, attempt to acquire large areas of land for the purpose of carrying on large national enter- prises upon socialistic lines. The Minister has seen his way clear to protect the interests of the municipal authorities who stand in the position of trustees in regard to land set apart for public purposes, and I think that he might also agree to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Lang. </para>

                        <para>.- I think it is desirable to press the amendment, because it is important that in the definition of the word &#34; land&#34; some such provision should be included. We should make it absolutely clear that it is not the intention of the Government to engage in mining operations. Subsequently, provision, can be made to extend the surface rights of any lands which may be acquired by the Commonwealth to any depth which may be considered necessary to insure the stability of any building which the Commonwealth may choose to erect upon them. In the absence of a clear definition of what the term &#34;public purposes &#34; embraces, it may be held to include purposes which at present are not in contemplation. I desire to preserve the rights of the States in respect of minerals, and for that reason I intend to press the amendment. </para>

I cannot see that the States are in any danger of being robbed of their mineral rights if the clause be retained in its present form. The lands which may be acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes cannot by any stretch of imagination include a wide area of mineral -bearing country.

                            <para>- The amendment of the honorable member would lead to all sorts of complications. If hereafter we were foolish enough, to contemplate passing a law under which the mines throughout the Commonwealth would be nationalized, we might require to do what is suggested by the honorable member. But I do not think there is the remotest danger of any such legislative enactment. I cannot see how such a Bill could be supported by any logical reasoning. But even if such a law were passed the amendment would simply mean that it would be neutralized by this anticipatory provision. If anything is to be done in the direction suggested by the honorable member, the Minister might endeavour to amend clauses 62 and 63. Under them, if minerals are discovered upon lands acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes, the State laws are to apply. But the Commonwealth will retain those lands. I have suggested that when minerals are discovered upon lands acquired by the Commonwealth, it might be better to prescribe that a lease of them shall be granted to the State concerned. That State could then provide that lands so leased should be subject to State laws. The minerals would thus be re-acquired by the State, and the profits, if any. would belong to it. But under the Bill in its present form, the Commonwealth would receive all rents or royalties for mining operations which are conducted upon lands acquired by it. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the honorable member not to press his proposal. There are many technical difficulties connected with the service of notice. Land proposed to be entered upon might be abandoned, or the owner of it might be away. Then, again, it might be held by trustees who were absent. No one would think of going upon a man&#39;s land without giving him notice, and, after all, this provision relates only to a proposed inspection that would not involve any serious injury to a property. I will consider the point raised by the honorable member, but I think that the proposed amendment is unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>.- This clause provides that where the compensation awarded is not more than the amount offered by the Minister in satisfaction of the claim, it shall bear interest only to the date when the offer is communicated to the claimant. That seems to me an unfair provision, because the judicial proceedings in an action for compensation may occupy months, and even years. . </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but nevertheless in excess of what is declared by competent authority to be the value of the land. Therefore, the claimant would get full value, and interest to the date of the offer of that value by the Minister. In any case, the loss of interest is not likely to exceed 3 per cent, for a period of two or three months, because we have given even the smallest Courts jurisdiction, and in some cases claims can be settled by magistrates. One of the reasons for the Bill is to allow of the speedier settlement of claims for compensation. </para>

                        <para>.- The clause provides for the payment of compensation to a State, at the option of the Governor-General, by the Commonwealth becoming responsible to the State for its liability for principal and interest in respect to part of its public debt. It may be that the responsibility should be to the creditors of the State, though I shall not dwell on that point. Apparently the clause is intended to apply to land which has become vested in the Commonwealth by virtue of section 85 of the Constitution, because clause 64 provides that any land which so becomes vested shall, &#34; for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have been acquired under &#34; it. But sub-section 11. of section 85 of the Constitution provides that the value of property acquired by the Commonwealth by reason of .the transfer of a Department, shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in as nearly as may be the manner in which the value of land or of an interest in land taken by the State for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the State. In view of that provision, I do not see how this clause and clause 64 can operate. Again, I do not know how we can vest in the Governor-General power to declare the mode of compensation, seeing that there is no provision in the Constitution enabling us to do so. The Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act contains provisions similar to those contained in the Bill ; but if I am not mistaken, they could not be used without the consent of a State Parliament. I very much doubt whether the clause could be enforced against a State. However, if it is futile, it can do no harm. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause is a re-enactment of the provision in the original Act. It was considered advisable to vest all lands in the Commonwealth asa corporation, and we are registered in all! the States as the corporation of &#34; the Commonwealth of Australia.&#34; I promise the honorable and learned member that I will look into the matter, and consult .the law authorities. </para>

Section 3 of the Constitution states that we are united in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia. It seems to me that all titles should be made out in the name of the Commonwealth, rather than in that of the King, because the King is only a part of the Commonwealth. </para>

The State could then deal with the sub-soil as if it were its own property. This would overcome the objections raised bv the Attorney-General of New South Wales, in which there is not, in my opinion, very much substance. </para>

The only point put before us by the States authorities was this : We have rifle ranges in the gold-mining districts. Men obtain mining leases &#39;upon adjoining properties, and work upon them until they reach the boundary of our property at which they are brought up standng. We were asked to provide means by which leases could be granted, so that the mining for metals might be carried on underneath the surface of the land under our control. The amount represented by royalties would be very small, and would in no case represent any serious loss or great gain to either of the parties concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. We did not insert it with a view to filch any revenue from the States. We quite foresaw that if we did grant gold mining leases some injury might be done to the surface, and that compensation would have to be paid. Our sole idea was to facilitate the granting of mining leases. If we passed an elaborate set of mining laws to cover the conditions prevailing in different parts of Australia we should be using a steam hammer to crack a nut, and we thought the best course to pursue was to allow the States laws to operate in respect to mining operations carried on upon land held by us. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the object of the honorable .member for Parramatta is to strike out this clause and insert another one which would vest the power to grant, mining rights in respect to Commonwealth lands in the Governors of the States, instead of in the Governor-General. If such provision were made, we should have two authorities exercising jurisdiction over the same property, and nothing would lead to more friction and difficulty between the States and the Commonwealth. Those who had leases of the surface would be in frequent contention with others who under the State authority had the right to mine below the surface. </para>

                        <para>. - I have considered the point referred to, and I think I can answer the honorable and learned member, by quoting the actual experience that has been gained in New South Wales. As a matter of fact, under the New South Wales Mining on Private Property Act two kinds of ownership are provided for. The surface may be owned by an orchardist or a farmer, whereas mining operations may be carried on below ground by other persons. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, speaking in a broad sense; but one title is granted by the Lands Department, and the other by the Mines Department - two distinct administrative authorities. There is no friction engendered there. The arrangement seems to work smoothly, and I do not see why it should not work equally smoothly under our Commonwealth conditions. As the Minister has pointed out, we shall acquire only small areas for rifle ranges, or upon which to erect our buildings. We shall not take over sufficient land to warrant us in interfering with its surface. Indeed, my object is to prevent anything being done to the surface, and to confine the operations of the States to the minerals which are beneath. The Minister has put the case in a nutshell. He said that sometimes a miner comes to one of our reserves, . or rifle ranges, and cannot proceed further because he has no right to do so. I wish to give him the right to conduct his operations upon land acquired by the Commonwealth so long as he does not interfere with the safety of our buildings. Subject to such a provision, it seems to me that no complications could arise from vesting in the States the mineral rights which are underneath any lands which may be acquired by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- There is not very much wrong with this clause, but I am sorry that the draftsman has not followed the lines which have been followed in some of our State Acts, which provide that when a surplus of land has been acquired, an option of six months shall be given to the person from whom it has been purchased. It seems to me that a similar option ought to be given in respect of lands purchased from the States. </para>

                        <para>.- I think it would be wise to insert in the Bill a provision of the character proposed by the honorable member for Parramatta. The Minister has already told us that in dealing with the States, it has been the practice to follow the course which is laid down in the amendment. But what may be the practice of the present Government may not be the practice of future Ministries, and, therefore, I think that it is advisable to safeguard the States in the way proposed. Seeing that the amendment accords with the practice which the Government have hitherto adopted, probably the Minister will offer no opposition to it. </para>

                        <para>. - I am afraid that the amendment is of a rather hard-and-fast character. Under it, the Commonwealth would, on request of the State, be compelled to reconvey any lands which it had acquired, and which it did not need; but the State would not be compelled to accept. It might easily happen that after we had acquired a piece of land for a post office, we might desire to effect an exchange for another piece which was more suitable for our purposes. The amendment would prevent that being done. Further, it would require us to hand back to the States any land which we had acquired in excess of our requirements for the same amount that we paid for it. In other words, its increased value would be ignored. </para>

                            <para>- I am very anxious to dispose of the Bill this evening. If the Commonwealth has any surplus lands to sell, and the States are prepared to pay the best market price for them, I can see no objection to giving them the pre-emptive right of purchase. At the same time, it does not occur to me that there is very much in the point which has been raised. In all our arrangements with the States in the matter of the acquisition of land, we have not attempted to bargain with them. Whenever we have a piece of land which they want, we re-convey it to them without any trouble whatever. </para>

                            <para>- No. The principle of give and take is observed. This subject was mentioned at the Premiers&#39; Conference, and the States asked us to fix a limit to the period within which we should be at liberty to hand back properties to them. The matter was dealt with in the recent report relating to transferred properties. </para>

If the Commonwealth pays money to a State, and the State hands over something to the Commonwealth, the trans action simply means a payment by one set of agents to another set of agents for the people of Australia. Too much is being done to show that we are distinct entities. As a matter of fact, we are one people. </para>

                            <para>- The position in the two cases is not the same. The Minister has pointed out that the Commonwealth and States Governments are dealing with the same people, so that what John Jones surrenders in his Commonwealth capacity, he still retains in his State capacity. It seems to me only reasonable that mv amendment should be inserted. </para>

A similar provision ought to be made in this case. I think that the position would be met by inserting after the word &#34;shall&#34; in the amendment the words &#34; unless such land is to be disposed of bv way of exchange for other land.&#34; . </para>

It is not one which has been idly drafted, but has been suggested by the Attorney-General of New South Wales after a careful consideration of the Bill. It is evident from his memorandum that the provisions of the measure tend to encroach upon the rights of the States, and as the Minister has asserted that he does not claim for the Commonwealth ownership in the minerals contained in land acquired by it, his opposition is unreasonable. </para>

If the Government is sincere in maintaining that it is not the intention of the Commonwealth to enter upon mining operations, or to lease its lands to private individuals for mining purposes, it has no good grounds for objecting to the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- By the State. I might point out to the honorable member that in New South Wales the State when alienating land reserves, to itself all mineral rights. This matter affects not only New South Wales, but all the States. It seems that one needs only to mention any matter in which New South Wales is interested in order to arouse the most bitter opposition and to cause the most un-Federal spirit to be displayed. We have heard a great deal about provincialism and the necessity for displaying a Federal spirit, but it seems to me that the people of New South Wales are expected to adopt a more unselfish attitude than those of any other State, and to make all sorts of sacrifices for the sake of the Commonwealth. I trust that honorable members, will consider this matter as one affecting the whole of the States, and that they will provide safeguards against any encroachment upon the State domain. . </para>

                        <para>.- If any special want of sympathy with New South Wales is displayed honorable members who represent that State are very largely to blame. They are always crying &#34; wolf,&#34; and honorable members sometimes have difficulty in realizing that a real grievance is being brought under their notice. I think that the Commonwealth should be placed in the same position as any other person who may acquire land. If the Commonwealth should by the expenditure of money . contributed by the whole community discover minerals upon Commonwealth property, any profits arising should certainly be applied for the benefit of the citizens of the Commonwealth as a whole, instead of passing into the pockets of the residents of the State in which the property was situated. It seems to me that the contention of the honorable member for Lang is absurd. </para>

                        <para>.- A passing glance at the amendment will suffice to show that it has been drawn up with unusual skill, and is of special importance. It bears the <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of the Attorney-General of New South Wales, who is fully qualified to express the wishes of the people of that State. Serious doubts and fears are entertained with regard to the powers now sought to be acquired bv the Commonwealth, and I think that we are fully entitled to place these before the Committee. The Attorney-General&#39; of New South Wales has sought to protect not only the rights of the State, but also those of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Where industrial matters are concerned, the honorable member is in favour of referring them to the High Court. The amendment provides that under no circumstances shall the Commonwealth acquire any right of the State to minerals on or in the land. New South Wales entered the Federation upon a definite understanding, and the Attorney-General of that State fears that the Commonwealth is now seeking to arrogate to itself powers which the Constitution does not confer upon it. </para>

                            <para>- The Attorney-General of New South Wales fears that the Bill seeks to accomplish, in an indirect way, what we cannot achieve in a direct way. The honorable member for Parramatta recognises that this is a serious matter, but, in view of the composition of the House, is not inclined to waste time in fighting it. I simply rose to make these few observations, and to add that I have yet to learn that it is a heinous offence for an honorable member to say a word on behalf of the rights of his State. I trust that the amendment will be pushed to a division. The proposal embodied in the Bill merely represents one of those pin-, pricks which so frequently arouse the resentment of the States against the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General of New South Wales has declared that we are endeavouring to &#34; filch &#34; from the States powers which we have no right to exercise. Honorable members must recognise that we ought not to infringe the provisions of the Constitution. Personally, I hope the amendment will be pressed to a division. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw it. Other Ministers would have recognised that courtesy, if nothing else, required an explanation from them; but the Minister of Trade and Customs has a method of his own. He does not attempt to argue, he &#34;bullocks&#34; through his proposals, sitting in his chair, and saying nothing, quite secure in the support of those who only grin while we on this side discuss matters. It seems to me that the amendment strikes a blow at the classification of brandy adopted by this House after a full debate. The Minister talks about being insulted, but he insults the Committee by his attitude. I cannot conceive of anything more calculated to bring our proceedings into contempt- </para>

                        <para>. - The paragraphs proposed to be left out have reference to the amount of spirit which wine-makers, are permitted to use for fortifying purposes. It was proposed to amend the Distillation Act by permitting wines to be brought up to a strength of 40 per cent. instead of 35 per cent. of proof spirit. It was represented that it was necessary to fortify wines to the higher degree for the purposes of export. In view of the fact that wines containing 40 per cent. of proof spirit are imported, the Senate&#39;s amendment would have the effect of discriminating to the disadvantage of the local wines.

That Chamber has altered the date after which no imported spirits &#39;shall te delivered from the control of the Customs for human consumption until it has been matured by storage in wood for not less than two years to the 30th day of June, next year. If honorable members will look at the next clause, they will find that the provision relating to the maturing of spirits distilled in Australia is suspended until the 1st day of January, 1908. I propose to make the period when the clause shall come into, operation uniform in the case of imported spirits and spirits of local manufacture. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, gin is usually one of the worst spirits distilled. It is flavoured with juniper, and is supposed to possess medicinal qualities on that account, but, as a matter of fact, the commonest spirit made from potatoes is put into it. Although it may be nearly chemically pure alcohol, I do not see why it should enjoy any advantage over other spirits in respect of its age. I object to a distinction being drawn between the two classes of spirit. In the Bill as it left the House a very liberal provision was made, about sixteen months&#39; notice being given of our intention to insist upon only matured spirit being offered the public. The statement that the maturing of gin in wood would cause discolouration is contradicted by men in the trade. They say that if gin be matured in casks that have contained dark wine it will be discoloured, but that casks which have not been used for other purposes may be used without any risk of the spirit being discoloured. I trust, therefore, that the Committee will adhere to its decision. </para>

                    <para>.- If it be true, as the honorable member for Bland has said, that, except in the matter of flavour, there is practically no difference between gin and whisky, there is something in his argument; but. without posing as an authority on distillation, I may say that, having read the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and the views of medical experts, I came to the conclusion that the best interests of the consumer would be conserved by allowing gin to go into consumption as soon as possible after being distilled. It has been pointed out by experts that, apart altogether from the question of discolouration, the juniper and other alleged valuable properties in gin would be lost if it were matured in casks that had been used for other purposes. </para>

                        <para>. - We propose to proceed to-morrow with the South Africa Tariff agreement, and then to resume the consideration of the business on the notice-paper. The date of the general elections will necessarily be determined by the time when we finish our work. I hope that we shall very speedily rise, but of course the longer our sittings are protracted the further the date of the elections is pushed off. I shall be able in a day or two to give the honorable member for Brisbane much more definite information. </para>
