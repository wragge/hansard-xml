        <para>DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE GEORGE McLEAY. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MENZIES</inline>(Kooyong - Prime Minister). - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> as honorable members know, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> died to-day at the age of 63 years. He was born in August, 1892, in the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. He first came into this Parliament as a senator for South Australia after the general election held in 1934. He was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. In 1937, he was Government Whip in the Senate, and from November, 1938, until October, 1941, he was the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He was a member of the Economic Cabinet and a member of the War Cabinet, and he held various other offices which I need not enumerate, such as those of Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, Minister for Trade and Customs, Postmaster-General and Minister for Repatriation. For a time he was Minister for Supply and Development. </para>
        <para>What I have said about it will illustrate to honorable members the extreme width of the experience that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> had even in those years. In 1945, he went to the United Nations conference in San Francisco as an assistant to the Australian delegation, and I &#39;am sure that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> will have happy memories of his congenial association with the late honorable senator on that occasion. He suffered, of course, from the vicissitudes of politics. He was defeated at the general election of 1946, but was re-elected at the general election of 1949, and since then, as honorable members know, he has been a prominent member of the present Government, and  Deputy  Leader of the Government in the Senate. </para>
        <para>The fact that George McLeay was defeated in 1946 and came back in 1949 is perhaps one of the indexes to his character and outlook. He was not easily permanently set down. I have never known a man of higher spirit, a man of more infinite good nature, a man who could .take all the knocks in argument, whether the argument was in the Cabinet room or on the floor of the Senate - take&#39; knocks, and give knocks, and always remain infinitely good tempered, leaving no wounds on his own soul, and certainly none on the souls of others; He was a very remarkable man, and his death, so unexpected, is a great shock to all of us. I think I should not be exaggerating if I said that George McLeay was one of those rare men who enjoyed the affection of political friends and foes alike. I certainly have never heard any one in this House, or elsewhere for that matter, say about him anything that was harsh, uncharitable or unjust. The truth is that he himself could not have made such a remark about any one else. He was incapable of being harsh, uncharitable or unjust. </para>
        <para>I hope that his widow, who is so well known to all of us, and his children will obtain some comfort from the knowledge of our feelings, and I am sure that our friend, his brother, the honorable member for Boothby, will appreciate how we feel on this occasion. It is very difficult, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> to say very much on these occasions, and so I move - </para>

        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">The Opposition party this morning, in a small way, paid tribute to his memory and extended the very deep sympathy of the members of the party to his family and friends. He was in many ways a remarkable man. He held many public offices and was never discouraged in the face of adversity. I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McLeay&#39;s  work and valued assistance in 1945 at the San Francisco conference. He was the soul of geniality, good fellowship and good friendship. Some of us used to call him &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickwick&#34;.</inline> He did not fail to resemble in some respects the drawings of Cruikshank  in the earlier Dickens publications. &#39;I think that what struck us all was his simplicity, his humanity, his kindness and the absence of guile from his disposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> was a lovable character and he made every one feel happy by  his very presence. We deeply regret his death, and I join wholeheartedly in supporting the motion that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has proposed. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to associate my colleagues of the Australian Country party and myself with the motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> We are indeed greatly allocked and distressed at the untimely death of our friend and colleague. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> was a very close personal friend of mine, and I think that every one who knew him counted him a friend. He was a very good Australian. He possessed a personality which attracted and held the affection of all with whom he came in contact in quite a rare degree. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> had, as the Prime Minister has explained, a very long record of service to this country, and a long and valuable record of service to the political party to which he belonged. </para>
        <para>George McLeay was a man with a very sane philosophy, who brought his sanity to bear obviously on the many difficult problems with which, in the course of his career, he was obliged to grapple. I was quite closely associated with our friend. He entered the Parliament at the same time as T did, following the general election of 1934. With him, &#91; was invited to accompany the present Leader of the Opposition to the first United Nations conference in 1945, and because of his experience as a former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, and his general interest in and understanding of the issues with which 1 am administratively concerned, he was asked to represent me during my various absences overseas on government business. Indeed, when I was ill and absent for some months a year or so ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> acted as Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, and since my return to duty he has accepted the responsibility of working in association with me on matters connected with my portfolio, in which he was so experienced and interested, and to which he was able to contribute so much. </para>
        <para>As I have said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> was a really good Australian. He was a man of good and firm judgment, and possessed a strong personality. He had always a quite obvious direct approach to issues, and was able with a rare gift to speak in a most outspoken manner, but never in my experience did he provoke an atom of bitterness by his nonetheless direct approach to these issues. So, he grew to enjoy the affection and respect, 1101 only of all members of the Parliament, but also of all other persons with whom he worked. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> had at all times a very clear sense of his responsibilities, and an undeviating firmness in the discharge of them. He had at all times a clear picture of the goal to which he was steering. It was always a good goal, related to what he conceived to be the Australian interest, and despite the extent to which he adhered to the national viewpoint, never at any time did he fail to have in mind the humanities of the situation. </para>
        <para>There was absolutely nothing at all mean in George  McLeay&#39;s  character. He was serious, and yet carried withal a certain joyfulness in his life. As I have said, and as both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said also, he inspired and held the affection of all of us. His political career was positive, useful and good; its results will remain to the benefit of this country. On my own behalf, and on behalf of my colleagues in the Australian Country party, I extend to his widow and family and to his brother very sincere sympathy in their sad bereavement. </para>
