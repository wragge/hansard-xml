                        <para>- -I desire to make a personal explanation. With the concurrence of the Government Whip I had a permanent arrangement with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Matthews)</inline> to pair with him, so that when, owing to his physical infirmity, he is not able to attend in the chamber, his party will not be deprived of his vote. That obligation I have scrupulously honored, but last night I inadvertently omitted to take the usual precaution of seeing whether the honorable member was in his place. Too late I realized that he was not present, and my vote was recorded. I immediately explained the matter to the Government Whip and the mistake was rectified after consultation with the Opposition Whip <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Penton).</inline></para>

His  vote was obviously an inadvertence, but by arrangement with the Government Whip the mistake was rectified by getting another ministerialist to pair with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. </para>

                        <para>- I, too, desire to make a personal explanation. Yesterday I directed a question to the Minister for Home and Territories regarding certain charges made by the Canberra Hospital for the treatment of a servant of this House. I have since learnt that I spoke under a misapprehension. Two servants of the House were in the hospital simultaneously, and the account for £14, to which I referred yesterday, was not in respect of only thirteen days treatment. I understand, however, that one of them, who is still a patient, is being charged at the rate of £4 a week for medical attention in a public ward. The charge is excessive, and I hope that the Minister for Home and Territories will give attention to the matter. </para>

                                <para>- I have been advised that the aviators expect to leave Suva on the last stage of the flight at 2 p.m. to-day. The <inline font-style="italic">Anzac</inline> is at present off Port Stephen and is steaming at the rate of 20 knots an hour beneath the line of the flight. It is anticipated that at the moment when the fliers pass, the destroyer  will be about 700 miles off the coast of Australia, and will be able to keep in wireless communication with Captain Kingsford-Smith throughout his trip, and render him a great deal of assistance. </para>

The time available for military study is limited, since the aspirant officer must consider his civil avocation; but such time as he is able 'to devote is already utilized to the fullest extent. </para>

                            <para>The present scheme of physical training in schools is in accordance with an agreement entered into during 1923 with State Governments, under which the Department of Defence provides a limited number of physical training instructors for the training of teachers. The staff employed is small, but as additional expenditure in this direction could not be incurred except at the expense of other urgent defence activities, an increase in the numbers of the physical training staff is not possible. The medical authorities at Army Headquarters consider that physical training in schools alone would probably not reduce the percentage materially, as physique depends largely on heredity, ante and post-natal care, feeding, environment, medical inspection, care of teeth, hygiene of the home, and public health. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause provides that the judges of the court and the conciliation commissioners shall be available for the conduct of voluntary arbitrations in industrial matters. It was inserted in response to what was believed to be a desire for greater opportunities for the holding of voluntary conferences between employers and employees but the proposal has been received unfavourably by both sides in industry. The employees are dissatisfied with the clause because they believe that its effect will be to undermine their organizations. There was, of course, no such intention in proposing the clause. The employers, on the other hand, are dissatisfied with the clause because they consider that it may gravely prejudice them should an application for a voluntary arbitration be made, and they refuse to entertain it. They believe that that might subsequently be used against them in the court. As both sides disapprove of the clause, and as it could operate successfully only with the co-operation of both sides in industry, I propose that it be negatived. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause provides for the making of representative orders, and ought to save a great deal of expense in proceedings before the court, particularly to trade unions. It will dispense with the service of court papers upon large numbers of respondents, as is the practice at present. Honorable members will understand however that the clause does not remove the necessity for the service of a log. That must be continued, because our legislative power is limited to conciliation and. arbitration for the purpose of dealing with disputes, and a dispute must exist before it can be dealt with. But heretofore much expense has been involved by the necessity for serving the court papers in a case upon, in some instances, thousands of respondents. The suggested new procedure will save some unions hundreds of pounds in the course of a year. </para>

The procedure provided for is that an order may be made upon any representative respondents and that service upon those respondents shall be deemed to be services upon all the respondents.

It is urged, and I think rightly, that every respondent should have a right to appear personally if he so desires. I therefore move - </para><quote>

                    <para>. -  This clause will no doubt answer the purpose intended by the Attorney-General. The chief object to be safeguarded is that nobody may be prejudiced in his rights, so far as can. be reasonably provided, by his not knowing anything about the matter. That is a position which might easily occur, particularly where country respondents were affected. I suggest to the Attorney-General that, in order to provide an additional safeguard, and solely with the object of ensuring that nobody's right shall be prejudiced owing to his being ignorant of the position, it would be a good plan if the application in the proceedings were served upon some of the representative organizations in the community. That would further guard against the claims of any one being prejudiced. I suggest that notices of applications should be served upon such bodies as the Employers' Federation, the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Manufactures, the Trades and Labour Council, and the like, in each State. This provision is more likely to affect individual employers than individual employees, and if notices were given as I suggest, it would make it. less likely that any person concerned would be left in ignorance of what was occurring. </para>

                    <para>. -  As honorable members are aware, a single industry may involve the employment of many crafts, and each craft may be subject to a separate award. The object of the amendment is to enable the court to co-ordinate " so far as possible," the hours of work, holidays and general conditions of the industry. I have already mentioned the McKay implement manufacturing works to show how complicated an industry may become. I said that that factory was subject to more than thirty awards and determinations, which in many instances prescribed, different holidays, rates of pay, hours of starting and stopping work, overtime and the like. That unnecessarily complicates the conduct of an enterprise. The object of this provision is to enable the court, so far as possible, to introduce uniformity into the industry. I have circulated an amendment to the clause with the object of removing ambiguities from it. The word " industry " is defined in the act as including not only an industry carried on by an employer, but also an avocation carried on by an employee. The intention of this provision is to affect only industries carried on by employers. I therefore move the following amendment: - </para>

                    <para>.- With the object of achieving uniformity in the awards governing an industry, there can be no quarrel; but there are some considerations in relation to this provision which the Attorney-General might take into account. The wording of the provision is dangerous from my point of view, for it would make it mandatory upon the court to " so far as possible " bring about uniformity in an industry. I take it that the word " shall " is mandatory, if it is possible to introduce uniformity. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that we should try to get as near to uniformity as possible in an industry, but there is a grave danger that a provision like this may upset existing conditions. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> referred a day or so ago to the timber industry, and said that although one section of it had had a 44-hour week for six years, a single judge had, by an interpretation, obliged the whole industry to work 48 hours weekly. I do not suggest that that case is analogous to those contemplated by this provision, but it shows how easily existing conditions in an industry may be upset. The Arbitration Court is not keen on upsetting existing arrangements, and we should not make it mandatory for it to do so. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not take exception so much to the amendment as to the proposed new section itself, and the administration of the act. I agree that it would be a good thing to have uniformity as regards hours, holidays and general conditions in an industry; but, unfortunately, we have not power to bring about that desirable state of affairs. One of the principal objections to the present system is the provision in the act requiring three judges to sit to determine a question of hours. All other claims brought before the court are dealt with by one judge; but, whenever a claim involves the question of hours, three judges are necessary to determine it. Why should there be this discrimination in arbitration matters? Surely if one judge is capable of determining other matters in dispute, he is capable of determining the hours to be worked in an industry. I invite honorable members to recall what happened some years ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins was  President  of the Arbitration Court. It was believed generally that he intended to award 48 hours in industry, so the Government of the day introduced and passed legislation providing that any claims involving the question of hours must be determined by three judges. Trouble in this, matter has occurred in connexion with the timber workers' case. For many years part of that industry was working 44 hours a week and, notwithstanding that employers had accepted the decision of the judge and that the . industry had been working 44 hours for some years, one judge, by his interpretation of the award decided that the whole industry should work 48 hours. </para>

                        <para>- That was not the issue. We have been tinkering with our industrial legislation for many years, and whenever it is apparent to . that section represented by honorable members opposite that the administration of the law is not in the interests of their side, legislative action is taken to alter it. We are now amending the Arbitration Act, and I regret that the Government has made no provision in the bill to permit one judge to deal with the question of hours, though, as I have just stated, one judge by his interpretation of an award has over-ridden the decision of three judges on this question. The principal trouble in connexion with the Arbitration Court has been caused by the delays in getting claims heard. Some industrial organizations have had to wait for eighteen months or two years before their claims have been brought before the court, the excuse offered for this state of affairs being that there are not sufficient judges to cope with the work. And yet the Government does not propose to amend the provision requiring three judges to sit to determine the hours to be worked in an industry. If this matter were left to the decision of one judge the three judges could sit separately and deal with the claims of three organizations, instead of as at present sitting together to hear one claim in which the question of hours happens to be involved. </para>

                        <para>- The Government gave an undertaking during the last election campaign that an inquiry would be made into this matter with the object of securing uniformity. That promise was not honored. We were told that three judges would ' be appointed for this particular purpose, but honorable members will recall that one case which was decided in favour of 44 hours was not accepted as a test case and therefore uniformity was not brought about. The Government took no notice of that decision because it did not suit the general body of employers, and iri this amending bill the Ministry is not proceeding along the lines of equity and good conscience. The provisions have been so drafted as to benefit one side only. The debate has clearly indicated that special consideration is to be given to the side represented by honorable members supporting the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I say it because everything that has happened during the debate supports my view of the measure. We on this side have allowed several clauses to pass without debate, thus indicating that we are not against the principle of arbitration or those provisions of the bill which in our opinion are equitable. I agree that it is most desirable to secure uniformity in regard to hours, holidays and working conditions, but I object to the provision which requires three judges to sit to determine every claim, in which the question of hours is involved. We have no guarantee that if we pass this measure, the Government will appoint three judges to determine whether the hours to be worked in an industry shall be uniform throughout </para>

                <para class="block">Australia. Why should this issue be singled  out  from all others that are brought before the Arbitration Court? The question of hours should be dealt with by one judge when he is hearing other claims. Notwithstanding that we have four Arbitration Court judges, there is a long list of claims waiting to be heard, and immediately the question of hours is involved three of the judges must sit in one court to determine it. Experience has shown that this issue is involved in almost every claim that is brought before the court, and because of the provision in the act that three judges shall sit to determine the question of hours there is serious congestion in the court. This is creating a feeling of dissatisfaction amongst members of industrial organizations. </para>

                        <para>- The Government led the people to believe that it would appoint three judges to deal with the question of hours on a test case; but, as I have stated, it took no action when a decision was in favour of 44 hours. Such action is calculated to destroy the faith of the people in the principle of arbitration. This measure imposes penalties on one section of the community only, and it contains no provision to expedite the work of the court. Take the position of an industry the employees in which have filed their claims in the arbitration court. There may be a number of questions at issue including the question of hours. Although their conditions in general may  require urgent revision, their case may not he heard for eighteen months or two years. When it does come before the court, their circumstances may have altered considerably. The Government does not attempt under this provision to remedy that anomaly, Section 18a of the act requires that any question affecting standard hours must be considered by three judges of the court sitting together. In that case the work of the court will be considerably hampered because other urgent cases must necessarily be left in abeyance. I take strong exception to what is being attempted under proposed new section 25a. I have no objection to uniformity in relation to hours; my point is that we cannot enforce this provision until such time as greater powers are vested in the Commonwealth Parliament. Today we have State instrumentalities working side by side with Commonwealth instrumentalities, and as a result employees in industry are working under different conditions, and the manufacturers of one State have an advantage over those of another State. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. I do not see how we can bring about uniformity in working conditions without greater powers. Even when the full arbitration court gives a decision as to standard hours, it is not accepted by the Government as applying to all industries. It applies only to the industry concerned. On the last occasion on which the three judges sat as a full court, they fixed the standard hours at 44 hours a week. The Government has made no attempt to extend that standard throughout Australia. I venture to say that it would have taken some action in that direction had the court fixed a standard of 48 hours. This Government is making no attempt under this legislation ito facilitate the hearing and adjustment of the grievances of the workers of this country. </para>

                    <para>. -  A judge has power to deal with the question of hours, subject, however, to section 18a of the act, which provides that no award increasing the standard hours of work in any industry, or reducing them to less than 48 hours a week, or less than the existing standard, whatever it may be, shall be made " unless the question is heard " by three judges. That is, of course, an endeavour to obtain uniformity in industry. The proposed new section 25a, with which this committee is now dealing, does not affect that subject. It provides that so. far as is possible and proper there shall be uniformity in an industry in relation to hours, but this provision is subject to section 18 a of the act, which limits the power of a single judge in relation to standard hours. But awards are regularly being made varying the hours in industry, to the extent of determining the time of beginning and leaving work, smokos, overtime, and the total hours of work a day or week. All those orders are normally made by one judge, but any question affecting the general standard hours in an industry- whether the standard shall be increased or reduced must be heard by three judges sitting together. This Parliament has, therefore, intimated that no single judge can increase or decrease the standard hours of work in an industry. </para>

                        <para>- The court ascertains that, and, up to the present, there has been no difficulty in operating section 18a in this respect. As a rule, there is in all industries a normal standard Of hours. First of all, this Parliament has decided that any question affecting the general standard of hours shall be considered, not by one judge, but by three judges sitting together. In the same way this Parliament has decided that a single judge shall not have power to reduce the standard hours of work in any industry to less than 48 hours a week, or where the standard hours of work are less than 48 a week, he shall not reduce that standard. The object of that legislation was to remove from a single judge the power to increase or decrease the standard hours of work, and obviously there is a good deal to be said for that principle. Proposed new section 25a, with which we are now dealing, has nothing to do with that subject. It provides that uniformity in an industry shall be attained so far as possible, and it is a direction both to a single judge and to three judges sitting together. It, therefore, does not affect the subject to which the honorable member for Hunter has referred. </para>

Whether the proposed new section 25a is adopted or not it does not affect section 18a. I rose really to reply to the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley).</inline> Nearly every award that is made involves an alteration of hours. All questions affecting hours do not have to be decided by three judges. .  Mo3t  questions can be, and are, effectively dealt with by a single judge. The only question that must be determined by three judges is an increase or decrease in the standard hours of work in an industry. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has referred to the 44-hour case, and he complains that the Government has not taken any steps to make the court's decision in that  ca3e  effective throughout Australia. I would inform him that the Government has no power to legislate on the subject of hours or to introduce a standard of 44 hours a week or any standard number of hours in the industries of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is being done under proposed new section 25a,  so  far as the Commonwealth is able to do so. This provision invites the court to provide, as far  a3  possible, for uniformity in an industry. The 44-hour case was chosen by the parties concerned as a test case to enable a general discussion to take place on the subject of a working week of 44 hours. It was not chosen by the Government or by the Attorney-General. Both sides approached me, and asked me to intervene to enable them to get  a  discussion and a decision on the question of 44 hours in that particular case. The discussion took place and a decision was given, which has proved unsatisfactory, in some degree, to one side. </para>

                    <para>.- Proposed new section 25a relates to uniformity in awards. I take it that, with that ideal, honorable members have no quarrel. 'It is obvious, however, that there may be considerations which may make uniformity impracticable and even undesirable. The subject raised by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> while of the greatest importance, hardly concerns this provision. It involves the very debatable point whether or not it should be reserved for a full court of three judges, including the Chief Judge, to determine an increase or a decrease in the standard hours of work. I do not forget that, when that principle was first introduced in 1919 by the Hughes Government, the Labour party opposed the amendment on the ground that it contemplated a new policy designed to encumber the procedure of arbitration and involving the necessity of going from a single judge to the Full Court, with consequent delay and expense As a matter of fact, the Labour party was instrumental in securing that the amendment should not apply to cases that were, already pending before the court. Of course, speaking candidly, it is impossible to view these questions without  having at the back of our minds all the time the temperamental tendencies of the different judges on the bench. It would be affectation for unions or members of this Parliament to pretend that they do not have those facts in view, although they cannot be considered legislatively. I am very much concerned about this clause from the point of view that I raised in connexion with the timber workers' case. In that case, as I have already pointed out more than once, the judge effected a radical change in the number of working hours merely by the act of interpreting an existing award in a manner in which it had not been previously interpreted. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Minister will find that he is wrong. I must speak subject to correction; but my recollection is that the application to vary the award was an application to vary Judge  Lukin's  new interpretation of the award. My recollection of the facts is that the case came' before Judge Lukin as a substantive plaint for an award in the industry generally, and the question of hours in respect of the plaint went to the Full Arbitration Court for determination. The Full Arbitration Court postponed consideration on the question of hours until February next, for reasons which I have more than once stated, with an intimation that the judge should proceed to consider the plaint generally. In- those circumstances the judge set out to inform his mind as to what the existing award really meant. </para>

                        <para>- That is not my view. I have read the matter fairly carefully, and I understand that the parties were quite at one as to what the award meant. They were not at one as to what they wanted, because one side wanted 44 hours throughout the whole industry, and the other side wanted 48 hours. While it is true that they desired a change in the <inline font-style="italic">status quo,</inline> I submit that there was no argument at that stage as to what the award meant. It meant 48 hours in the country mills, and 44 hours in the city timber yards. That was the view, I suggest, that was adopted by both sides, and had never been questioned, although an effort had been made, I think, on three different occasions to have it altered. The view that Judge Lukin took was, that the order made upon the decision of the Full Court in 1922 was not consonant with the award itself, and that the award of 1922 meant practically 48 hours throughout the industry. The judge gave that interpretation, and that interpretation stands. I may say that it is causing a great deal of unrest in the timber industry. I do not wish to be a prophet of evil; but in this matter there are all the elements of very serious industrial trouble, because the organization says that this is a case where industrial unrest has been induced by differences of opinion among lawyers, that is, among the members of the court. That being so, I should like the Attorney-General now to consider the matter, because we cannot give directions to the court. I am not asking that that should be done, or that we should protest against the judge's exercise of his discretion; but I say that where two parties are working .on a common understanding as to what an award means, and have continued along those lines for a period of years - in this case, six years - the judge, according to equity and good conscience, and without the restraint of the laws of evidence, should endeavour to bring about and maintain peace in industry. I suggest that it was a dangerous and indiscreet exercise of his power to take up this award and apply to it a meaning and interpretation which none of the parties had applied to it in the past. I cannot take the responsibility of proposing an amendment to this clause; but I now suggest for the consideration of the Attorney-General - and this is a matter that comes peculiarly within the province of this Parliament  - that he might propose an amendment to this clause, so as to make it impracticable for a judge of the Arbitration Court, by interpretation, to take upon himself functions that really belong to the Full Arbitration Court, and increase the hours above the standard hours being actually worked. I submit for the careful consideration of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> and the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ley),</inline> who are lawyers, that it is undesirable in the public interests that, where the parties are working together in what I have described as a common understanding of what the award means, it is undesirable that a single judge of the Arbitration Court should re-interpret that award, give a fresh interpretation to it which is not solicited, and thus increase the standard hours by the mere act of determining what in his view an original award meant, his view being different from that of the other learned judges and different from the view accepted by both parties. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. They had acted upon the interpretation, ever since 1922 that it provided for 48 hours in the bush sawmills and 44 hours in the city timber mills, where not only Australian but also imported timbers are cut. That is the determination which is now disturbed, and which is raising all this trouble. While we have a right to express our opinions, we have no right to give a direction to His Honour as to what the meaning of an existing award is or should be. </para>

                    <para>. - I am - certainly prepared to consider the point that has been raised by the honorable member for Batman. It appears to me that if the law, which provides that increases or reductions in standard hours shall be made only by three judges, is to be maintained, it is undesirable that any such decision should be effected by an interpretation of an award made by one judge. Prima facie that is the view which I take ; but I do not want to speak with absolute finality upon the matter because I shall have to consider it from all its aspects before E bring any proposal before the committee. My impression at the moment, however, is that to that extent there is a good deal of weight in what the honorable member has said. At the same time it must be recognized that his statement is very different from that of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> who has objected to these matters being brought before three judges. The honorable member for Batman considers that they should come before three judges, and I am inclined to agree with him. I do not wish to diverge from the general principle to which I have alluded and to discuss a particular case. I have sent to my. office for the papers connected with this matter. I read them as recently as Wednesday night, and it seemed clear to me that the interpretation was given in the course of a decision upon an application for the variation of an award. At the moment I am not in possession of facts which enable me to say what interpretation the parties had placed upon it in the past; but from the terms of the judgment it was plain that when the matter was argued before the court on the last occasion they differed in their interpretation, because the judgment states that a special day was set apart for argument in relation to interpretation. I admit that that is also consistent with the possibility that until recently the parties agreed in a particular interpretation of  the award. The point which the honorable member for Batman has raised is an important one. It affects section 18a. I should like to have the opportunity to consider the desirability of introducing a new clause to deal with this specific matter. </para>

                    <para>.- The difficulty can be overcome only by the introduction of a new clause, and I am glad that the Attorney-General is prepared to give that matter his consideration. I, however, should like to show how real is the necessity for this action. Whether wittingly or unwittingly a judge of the Arbitration Court has been responsible for creating trouble, that will probably become very serious, in an industry. Honorable members know sufficient of human nature to realize that men do not lightly give up something that they have had for six years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, as  president  of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, granted the whole of the employees in the timberworkers' industry a 44-hour week. That then became the standard number of hours in the industry. In 1921 three judges were appointed and were asked to deal with the question of hours. They determined to increase to 48 the number of hours to be worked in one section of the industry and to retain 44 hours in another section. The argument on that occasion was that the sawmills which produced logs in the bush had to compete against timber which was imported from overseas. For six years the sawmilling industry in the cities worked 44 hours a week because it was engaged in sawing up all kinds of timber, both imported and locally produced; and the mills in the bush, which produced timber in competion  with the imported article, worked 48 hours a week. In 1922, both employers and employees made application for a variation of the award. The unions wanted a 44-hour week all round and the employers a 48-hour week to apply to the whole of the industry. There was no difference of opinion upon the fact that 44 hours obtained in one section and 48 hours in another section of the industry. The Full Arbitration Court refused to disturb the existing conditions. In 1923, a further application was made for a variation of the award, and again the Full Arbitration Court decided to maintain the position as it stood. Another application by both sides in 1926 was refused by the Full Arbitration Court. It will thus be seen that on three different occasions the court considered that 44  hours obtained in one branch of the industry. In 1927, a general case was submitted to the court for a complete variation of the award, including the question of hours. The employers asked that 4S hours should apply in all branches, and the employees asked for 44 hours. The Full Arbitration Court adjourned the question of hours until February, 1929, and asked Judge Lukin to hear the remainder of the claim. The first thing which Judge Lukin did was to interpret the award which had stood for six years. In his judgment he interpreted it to mean something entirely different from the meaning which had been accepted by both sides for six years. I am not attempting to argue that his interpretation was either right or wrong; what I am pointing out is that a very unsatisfactory position has been created. I understood the Attorney-General to say that the interpretation was given upon an application to vary the standard of hours. </para>

                    <para>In performing this function of interpreting the present award in reference to its provisions as to standard hours, I am ascertaining the meaning of the Full Court's order of 22 September, 1922, incorporated in the present existing award, according to what I think is the intention and meaning thereof. In doing so I must consider myself restricted to the judgments pronounced by the Full Court and the terms of the order made thereon, and cannot allow myself to be influenced by any exercise of my own judgment of what I conceive to be "fair and right," or even by what may have been accepted in the past by both or either of the parties as to its true meaning. The judgments and the order speak for themselves, and I must interpret them accordingly. </para>

                <para class="block">I draw particular attention to the statement that he had not to consider what was fair and right, or what both or either of the parties had accepted as its true meaning, but had merely to interpret the award. That may be strictly and legally correct. We on this side, however, wish to prevent any one judge from interpreting the question of hours to mean something different from what has been accepted, and thus upset an interpretation of the Full Court, affirmed on three occasions. We do not raise here the question of whether there shall be one or three judges; but we do say that if the law lays it down .that only three judges can deal with the question of hours, no one judge should by an interpretation upset the accepted interpretation of the award made by those three judges. This is a serious matter, end if it is not remedied trouble is likely to occur with considerable frequency. I ask the Attorney-General to consider my representations when he is framing a new clause. </para>

                    <para>.- I am gratified to hear the Attorney-General say that he intends to do something to rectify for the future the anomalous position that has recently arisen in the Arbitration Court because of an interpretation given by Judge Lukin in the timber workers' case. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Brennan) and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> have already given the details of this case and spoken of the consternation that his Honor's interpretation has occasioned among the workers in the timber industry. No body of workers has been more loyal to arbitration than the members of the Timber "Workers' Union, and it is regrettable that anything should have arisen to impair their confidence in and good feeling towards the Arbitration Court. It is also regrettable that during these proceedings harsh words have been uttered that are likely to create estrangement. That is not the spirit that ought to be fostered by us. Honorable members opposite have said repeatedly that the purpose of this bill is to tighten up the provisions of our Arbitration Act and remove any anomalies that now exist in it. We doubt the wisdom of some of the suggestions that have been made, though I regard this as a wise proposal, but the difficulty that has arisen in the timber workers' case bids fair to create . pronounced dissatisfaction with the Arbitration Court and bring about an unsettled condition of affairs in the timber industry. This situation, should be dealt with. When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> asked for confirmation of the statement the honorable member had made that the employers were in agreement that in regard to certain branches of the timber industry a 44-hours week certainly did apply. I can assure the honorable member for Fawkner that this belief was firmly held by the employers. After the Full Court in 1923 has determined that the hours as fixed by the Full Court in 1922 should stand - those hours were 48 hours a week for bush workers and 44 hours a week for city workers - the employers in Sydney and Melbourne obtained legal advice as to whether the interpretation given in 1923 was sound in law. I am informed by an official of the Federal Council of Timber Workers that the opinion of eminent counsel, including that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon, K.C., was that the interpretation given by the Full Court in 1922 and confirmed by the Full Court in 1923 was in accordance with the terms of the award. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> J. Burge, who is an executive officer of the Federal Council of the Australian Timber Workers' Union and who has appeared as an advocate for the union in certain cases, particularly the case heard in 1925 before Deputy-President Webb, has written to me, and the following is an extract from his communication : - </para>

                    <para>The employers in Melbourne and Sydney obtained the advice of eminent counsel, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon, K.C., was one of them, and they interpreted it the same as we did. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I have no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burge</inline> has frequently been in consultation with the advocates for the employers when adjusting minor features of the award. At any rate his communication indicates that counsel consulted by the employers concurred in the opinion that the interpretation given by the Full Court was sound. In 1925 the South Australian branch of the Timber Merchants' Association briefed Messrs. Wright and Skipper, a legal firm in Adelaide, to secure a variation of the timber workers award, to have drivers exempted from the provisions of the award relating to hours. It is a logical deduction that these Adelaide employers and employees generally in the timber industry were convinced that city workers were entitled to a 44 hours week, as the variation, I emphasize, was only concerning the drivers employed in the industry. When the Adelaide case came before Deputy-President Webb in 1925, he dismissed the plaint, saying that the workers mentioned in it were included in the timber workers award and could not be exempted. Not being a legal man I venture my opinion with some trepidation, but I am, I think, capable of stating a common sense view of the decision given by Judge Lukin. The trouble among the timber workers has arisen out of an interpretation given by Judge Lukin of an award originally made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in 1921 and further reviewed and interpreted by the Full Court in 1922. If Judge Lukin had undertaken to review and interpret the award of 1921 on an application for a variation I could have understood his action; although even in that case the wisdom and propriety of the action might have been seriously challenged, in view of the Full Court's decision to defer 'their determination in regard to hours until February next year, and it seems to me that Judge Lukin went out of his way to do more than was required of him. When considering the making of a new award governing wages and hours, he took the most unusual course of interpreting the award of 1921, and, it must be noted, quite unsolicited by the representatives of either employers or employees. It is difficult to see how he can reconcile his action with that of the Full Court which preferred to leave the consideration of the matter until February next. I am grateful that the Attorney-General intends, by legislation, to provide for future cases of the kind. I trust that he will carry out his expressed intention by having a new clause inserted in the bill, so that the repetition of such a proceeding will be impossible. When decisions have been given by a higher court, they should be secure against reversal by any judge who is subordinate to that tribunal. But while the amendment which the Attorney-General has promised will deal with future cases, it will not, unfortunately, remedy the position to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>- If a judge says that all those engaged in working on the metal side of an industry, or on the woodworking side, ought to be placed in one union, it is likely to lead to dissatisfaction amongst the men. In an industry such as the McKay Harvester Works, some men are engaged in work which is more unpleasant, or more unhealthy, than -that being done by others, and this may be a quite sufficient reason for their having a shorter working week. We must guard against the possibility of the judges doing anything which might have the effect of driving the employees into one great union. If the workers feel that they cannot carry out the award of the court, and still keep intact the customs and practices established by long usage, they may be forced to join with others in one great union. I do not wish to see anything done which will take from the workers their right to maintain the customs and traditions which they have enjoyed in the past. </para>

                    <para>.   -  It would appear that I am being asked to introduce legislation dealing not only with what may happen in the future, but with the judgment in a particular case which has already been disposed of. It is proposed that this legislation shall declare that the judge who determined the matter had no jurisdiction to do so. I am not prepared to introduce legislation of that character. It would be a very dangerous practice indeed to interfere retrospectively with private rights. Legislation of that kind was objected to very strongly by the Opposition in 1920, when section 18a was under consideration. At that time the Opposition was very definite on the point that accrued rights should not be disturbed. What were regarded as accrued rights on that occasion happened to be on the side of the employees. Now it happens, and in the same industry, that the accrued rights are on the side of the employers. Speaking generally, the rule is that we must legislate for the future, and not for the past. It is open to either party concerned to apply for a variation of the award, and an amendment has already been made in section 18, which enables a judge to refer such a matter to the full court of the Arbitration Court. Up to the present it has been possible only for a judge to get another judge of the court to sit with him in hearing a dispute, but with the amendment which has now been passed it will be possible to apply for a variation of an award, and to have the matter heard by a full court of three judges. </para>

                    <para>.- As the amendment applies only to the basic wage, I am extremely doubtful that even .with that limitation the proposed section will be acceptable to trade unionists. The matter of "working hours also must be considered. Hours are dealt with by three judges, and. I assume that before they make an award they will have to investigate the economic condition of the industry. Although a fairly full investigation preceded the last award in regard to hours, this proposed section apparently gives a definite instruction to the court to investigate the economic conditions of the industry in regard to which any award is to be given. Such inquiries will occupy a great deal of time. The timber workers have a case before the court at the present time, and this proposed section is an instruction to Judge Lukin to take into consideration the probable economic effect of any award which  may be made. It is true that he is expressly forbidden to interfere with what has been the practice in fixing the basic wage; but there are other factors of importance to the workers. The basic wage may be £4 12s. 6d., but ever since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins presided in the Arbitration Court it has been the custom to fix over and above the basic wage a certain margin for skill. That margin may be 2s., 3s., or 3s. 6d. The engineering industry covers several grades of work, highly skilled, skilled, and unskilled. If the judge does not, of his own volition, investigate the economic position of an industry before he makes an award, the employers' representatives will certainly ask him to do so. In connexion with plaints by the Australian Workers Union, the pastoralists, on several occasions, asserted that the industry was not strong enough to support the claim which the union had made, but the union was able to convince the court, without a detailed investigation, that the position of the industry was sound enough to support the award asked for. Because of the past usage of the industrial courts we have been able to maintain the basic wage. We have had to put up a fight on many occasions, but it has always been recognized by the judges, both of the State and of the Federal courts, that the basic wage should not be interfered with merely because an industry is in a bad economic condition. The gold-mining industry of Western Australia is in such a bad condition that it cannot pay the basic wage, but that is no justification for its claim that the employees in that industry should accept less than the basic wage in order to keep the industry in  existence. Our claim is that that procedure is economically unsound. The Government has wisely decided in connexion with our wine, dried fruits, canned fruits, sugar, cotton, and many other primary industries, that if they are not in a sound economic condition, the employees are not to be compelled to subsidize them by accepting a lower wage. The nation comes to their assistance, and they are subsidized by the granting of bounties. The basic wage is maintained, and probably those conducting the industries have available a margin by which they can </para>

                <para>Ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Blakeley.</inline> reward skill. This clause, even with the amendment of the Attorney-General, will break down conditions which have been long established in Australia. I am extremely doubtful whether any judge of the Federal Arbitration Court is the best investigator of the industrial or economic conditions of an industry. As an illustration of the difficulties that will be experienced, I cite the position of the Australian Gas Employees' Union. There are many gas companies throughout Australia, the majority of which have employed modern methods of company management, and have watered their capital. The Australian Gaslight Company of Sydney has watered its capital so frequently that the consumers of gas in Sydney are paying a very high percentage on capital which i3 merely a book entry. It is probable that, by the exploitation of our great coal wealth electricity may become so cheap in Sydney and its suburbs that the earning capacity of the Australian Gaslight Company will decline very considerably. The operation of this clause would make it fairly easy for that company to prove that, on its nominal capital, it would be impossible to continue to pay dividends of 6, 7, or 8 per cent., and still maintain the basic wage awarded by the court. Is the judge, when making his economic investigation, to take into consideration the watering of stock that has occurred?Is he to make a minute investigation of the history of the company and its disposition of capital, or is he to be compelled to accept only the latest balance-sheets of the company? This Parliament has been called upon to assist the boot, motor tire, gelatine, glucose, rice, and other industries. An investigation of the conditions prevailing in many of our industries has revealed that, whereas the co-efficient of labour, so far as it concerns industrial wastage, may be taken as five, the corresponding co-efficient of inefficient management is 30. I and many other honorable members visited a number of factories in Australia, and I have never yet visited one which, in my opinion, was efficiently managed. In almost every instance obsolete methods were in operation; and one saw men carrying loads on their backs, o.r wheeling material in trucks or wheelbarrows, when  up-to-date automatic carriers should have been employed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member. Probably the incapable management that I have observed is responsible for the low profits which give many concerns an excuse to appear before the Arbitration Court and claim that the economic conditions of their industries do not permit them to pay the prescribed basic wage. That throws the responsibility upon the judge to determine whether the industry is efficiently conducted or otherwise. It would be * futile to ask Judge Lukin, Judge Dethridge, or any other of the judges of the Federal Arbitration Court to determine whether those industries were paying too much. I admit frankly that my knowledge of industrial economics is due only to my practical experience in industry. I also admit frankly that if it came to the solution of technical problems in an industry I should be quite at sea. The judges of the Federal Arbitration Court are not sufficiently scientifically trained to investigate the industrial conditions of industry. I have dealt with two factors governing the economics of industry, the watering of stock, associated with the financial history of a company, and the prevalence of inefficient management, both of which should be considered by the Arbitration Court. A third factor is the effect of the fiscal policy of the country upon industry. While we are constantly dealing with fiscal matters, and must necessarily acquire some knowledge thereon, very few of us would be competent to investigate an industry if we were without the assistance of experts. </para>

                        <para>- I shall give the honorable member an illustration. The case of the timber workers is now before the court. It has been found that the present costs of felling, carting, sawing, and breaking up timber are too high, and that has an adverse economic effect upon the community generally. No matter how true that may be, the employees in the industry should not be penalized because the industry is not in a flourishing economic condition. It is entirely unfair and inequitable to expect a small section of society to carry the responsibility for the inefficiency or lack of protection of an industry. It must be realized that many causes may affect the prosperity of a particular industry. But if this clause means anything, it means that the wages of the workers in a languishing industry may be reduced to such a point that the industry may show a profit upon its operations. If we desire to set up the principle that industries must pay, we should make the whole community responsible. Even with the amendment foreshadowed by the Attorney-General this provision would be dangerous, for although the basic wage might be protected, there would be no protection for the margin of skill, or for many other conditions such as  smoke-ohs  annual holidays, bonuses, and so on, which are involved in claims submitted to the Arbitration Court. No matter how the Attorney-General may tinker with the proposed section to meet the views of the Opposition, it will remain objectionable. I hope that it will be rejected. </para>

I incline to the belief that it would be better to drop it altogether than to amend it as proposed. My first reason for saying that is that the basic wage was fixed originally not by Parliament, but by the Arbitration Court. If this amendment is agreed to, Parliament will, so. far as I know for the first time, confirm the principle upon which it is ascertained. In other words it will unnecessarily and at a singularly ill-advised moment, enter a province which up to the present has been left entirely to the Arbitration Court. </para>

                    <para>The tariff has constantly increased during the last 25 years, until now it is three  times  as high as it was originally. What are the reasons for the great increase? I think that the famous dictum of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, in giving judgment in the Arbitration Court in the Broken Hill Proprietary case, has a great deal to do with it. I do not propose to criticize adversely a judgment of the Arbitration Court. I wish merely to point out the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' judgment. He not only laid down  the doctrine that industry ought to pay a living wage, but he added to that declaration of new law the corollary that an industry which could not comply with the obligation to pay a living wage ought npt to exist. In my opinion, that is- not a sound economic view, and I entirely disagree with it. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">To illustrate my argument I instanced the mining industry, which is to-day in a distressed condition throughout Australia. Many mines have been forced to cease operations. Unfortunately, the ill-effects of the policy of which I complain have not been limited to the mining industry. The principle propounded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, whether sound or otherwise, has been pushed to the point at which it has caused many industries to close down. Many others, which remain in operation, are being kept alive only by tariff protection or bounties. How many industries have we in Australis that could stand for six months if our customs duties and bounties were removed? It is high time that we began to consider the economic effect which our arbitration policy is having upon industry. Notwithstanding the conditions to which I have referred, applications are continually being made to the court for higher wages and shorter hours, and the cost of living is being increased to the consumers and to workers not under awards. Many workers are out of employment, and many are either voluntarily or involuntarily working short time. It ia generally admitted that we have more unemployment in Australia at present than is usual for this time of the year. We appear to be getting farther and farther from world conditions, while other countries are struggling to. get back to normal. In addition, the financial stringency is affecting the Government, as certain, honorable members on this side, of the chamber last year prophesied that it would, Their prognostications in that, respect are being realized with alarming rapidity, although we have had a series of good seasons, I have, no desire to. paint a mournful picture, but it is wise, that we should not ignore adverse conditions, or bury our heads, in the sand. It is extraordinary that in circumstances like these we should even think of providing that the Arbitration Court should, not take into, account the probable economic effect of its awards upon industry, at least in relation to the basic wage. I submit- that Parliament should do. nothing to prevent the court from varying or reducing the. existing wage, if that is essential upon economic grounds. Industries have been forced out of existence in Australia by continual increases in wages, and the future of others is, for the same reason, being imperilled. </para>
                <para>The basic wage is the amount considered' by the court to be necessary to maintain a man with a wife and three suppositious children in reasonable comfort; but it is well known that a great many employees throughout Australia have neither wives nor children.

                <para class="block">The reply to that is obvious. If the" obligation is not to vary with the children, there is no more . reason why we should lay down the principle that the basic wage should be paid on the assumption that a family consists of five, than that we should lay it down that it should be the amount necessary to maintain a bachelor. If the number of children is to be taken into account, why should three be fixed as a fair basis ?

                <quote>
                    <para>The sufficiency of the country's production to pay a supposed wage varies primarily with the number of workers in the country. The present basic-wage system distributes the total wage-share of production on the supposition that each worker has a wife and three children. I have shown that this amounts to postulating the existence of 2,100,000 workers' children, whom we know to be nonexistent. ' But the existence of children requires the existence of a given proportion of adult male workers to produce wealth for them, the ratio being in Australia ten male workers for every nine children. If, then, we "invent" 2,100,000 children, we must invent also about 2,330,000 adult male workers to produce the necessary wealth for them. Thus the present basic-wage system distributes the wages-share of production as if our total population was 12,000,000, instead of nearly 5,500,000. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I do not wish to misrepresent the Minister. "When he interjected, I was about to ask, following on his statement which I have just quoted, will he say that such a wage for an unmarried man must be on the basis of a family of five persons, and will he say that it will be better for industry to cease rather than allow the employees engaged in it to accept a reduction in wages, even if temporarily and voluntarily? As a matter of fact, many employees in a number of industries have been prepared, as I personally know, to accept a reduction in wages temporarily when it has been made clear to them that the industry could not carry on under existing conditions. In certain instances they have joined with employers in an application to the court for a reduced award, preferring lower wages temporarily to the prospect of unemployment through failure of the industry. Suppose than an industry does go out of existence. Is this a good time for an undertaking which possibly cannot afford and might not for a few years be able to afford to pay existing wages, to cease and throw perhaps 1,000 persons out of work? "What other avenue of employment is available to men who may suffer through the failure of their industry? </para>

                <para>Professor Jethro Brown and others have said that these principles are ethical rather than economic. I am not quarrelling with these principles from the point of view of ethics, but I submit in all seriousness that industry is governed by economic factors, and that if it ignores them, unquestionably it must suffer. According to a principle which the Attorney-General has laid down in his second-reading speech, the court is to retain the basic wage, but is not necessarily obliged to have regard to other factors. Apparently the economic standard as regards the ability of industry to pay wages is not to be considered, but the attention of the court can be applied to hours or conditions of labour, piecework, bonus-work, travelling time, and other allowances additional to normal wages. These are only subsidiary details of the same problem, of which wages is the chief factor, and I say therefore that since wages and hours are inextricably associated, it is difficult to consider them apart. I think that I can claim that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is, perhaps unintentionally, a supporter of my view.

                <para class="block">Can any honorable member point, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> any particular industry in which wages as a factor are separate and distinct from hours and conditions of work? I suggest, therefore, that the Prime Minister recognizes the economic factor in industry, and apparently realizes that the position has become, or is becoming, uneconomic. For my part, I have always held that it is preferable for three men, in times of stress, to work for two-thirds of the wages received by them in normal circumstances of prosperity, than that one should be out of employment. It is strange that such an obvious view should require to be emphasized, or that any one should see anything unusual in it. </para>

                        <para>- Very early in its history the Arbitration Court laid it down that the standard which must be adhered to was the level of comfort of the employee, considered as a man with a wife and three children. The economic factor, as the Prime Minister has said, was entirely disregarded. Adherence to the principle laid down was perfectly safe so long as there was plenty of money in industry to pay the wages, and so <inline font-style="italic">long as</inline> Parliament <inline font-style="italic">waa</inline> prepared to grant tariff increases and bounties to industry. The Attorney-General says that some honorable members appear to doubt that the basic wage is in principle economically sound. Of course, it is not sound. No one with a knowledge of political economy can suggest that it is. It may be very desirable, and ethically a good thing, to aim at the maintenance of the basic wage; but no one can suggest for a moment that it is economically sound. We have only to consider what must happen if, in times of financial  stress, wages are pushed up to a point beyond the ability of employers to pay them and maintain their industry. Unemployment then is inevitable. It should be obvious to all that if an industry is called upon to pay too much it must eventually break down. </para>

                <para>Personally, I am not opposed to the principle of compulsory arbitration. I approach the discussion of this subject from a point of view entirely different from that of some other honorable members. I have supported compulsory arbitration ever since my entry into Parliament, although at that time there was a considerable outcry by the Single Purpose League, among other bodies, for the abolition of the system, and I take a certain amount of pride in the fact that at the referendum about two years ago the percentage of votes in favour of both propositions submitted to the people was greater in my division than in any other division in South Australia. I am not against paying good wages, or even higher wages, provided that they are earned; but that involves the question of production and results. If a man, by piece-work or some similar method, obtains better results, I should not object to him receiving a commensurate wage. There are strong indications that the arbitration system is breaking down because of the weight of the employees' demands, which, long ago, made the industrial position economically unsound, particularly with regard to competition with outside countries. This has now affected the internal position of Australia -to such an extent that the loss of production and lack of employment have become greatly accentuated. I urge the committee, if it wishes to continue the arbitration system, which, after all, is embedded in the structure of Australian industry and the abolition of which would cause great dislocation in industry, not to support the proposed amendment. If honorable members do not wish this system to crash, but, on the other hand, wish it to live; if they desire to avoid increased loss of production, loss of employment, and an increased cost of living, I urge them to consider this provision well before tying the hands of the Arbitration Court in such a way as to make it powerless to prevent economic disaster. I am not making an attack on the basic wage ; but I have not hidden the fact that I think that the method under which it has been calculated has always been wrong. The basic wage has hitherto been determined by the Arbitration Court, and, if necessary, the court should be able to vary it. This is a singularly ill-advised moment for this committee and this Parliament to step in and interfere in a matter which has always been the prerogative of the court itself. The distinctions and exceptions which have been suggested by the Attorney-General will, if accepted, mean so much of a ratification by Parliament of the general principles under which the Arbitration Court has hitherto made its awards, that it . would be far better to withdraw the whole provision. As it was originally drafted I thought that it would at least enable us to return to some degree of financial sanity. </para>

To-day the court has to be guided by equity and conscience, as to the merits of the case with which it is dealing, but under this provision the court, when determining an award or agreement, is compelled to take into consideration the economic condition of the industry concerned. The Attorney-General has suggested a proviso to ensure that the proposed new section shall not affect the procedure of the court in fixing the basic wage.

                        <para>- He verified what has been in the minds of honorable members on this side since the. introduction of the bill. We contend that it has been deliberately drafted for the purpose of handing over holus bolus the control of the workers of this country to the employers. The Attorney-General has. proposed an amendment to take the sting out of this provision, but the honorable member for Boothby is opposing it on the ground that there should, be no interference with the  court  by compelling it,  when fixing wages and conditions, to take into consideration the economic position of the industry concerned. He went further and stated that there should be no basic wage; that the court should fix the wage on the merits of the case. What would be the result of that? It would mean that the employers in industry could go to the court and produce evidence of an unsound economic position, in the light of which the court could not fix even a living wage. The honorable member for Booth by is agreeable to that. He said that half a loaf is better than none, and that, if it were necessary, two-thirds of the ruling wage should be paid to the workers. </para>

                        <para>- What would be the position of the industrial workers if the law were as he proposes? Would not his proposition break down working conditions? Would it not mean asking a man to work for less than the wage on which he could reasonably support his family? What chance would a man with a large family have if he were receiving two-thirds of the basic wage, the cost of living remaining unchanged? It would be absolutely impossible for him to live. The amendment proposed by the Attorney-General will certainly take some of the sting out of proposed new section 25d, but at the same time I am entirely opposed to this provision. It should not be inserted in the bill at all unless we get right down to bedrock when considering the economic position. The honorable member for Boothby has admitted that the profits of industry have never been taken into consideration by the court when fixing wages. I made a similar statement the other day, but the Attorney-General contradicted me. Now the honorable member for Boothby has confirmed my statement. </para>

                        <para>- Let us get down to bedrock if the court, when making its award, is to take into consideration the economic effect upon the community. There are two parties to arbitration, the employers and the employees, and the system should apply equitably to both. First of all an investigation should be made to ascertain the amount of capital invested in industry and the amount of watered capital. During the war few companies failed to prosper, and since then, instead of paying dividends of from 12 per cent, to 20 per cent, their capital has been continually watered; in some cases, to the extent of 100 per cent. Take the Colonial Sugar Coy. and the extent to which the value of its shares has increased during the last ten or twelve years. Even though the capital has been watered time after time, the industry is still paying large dividends. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Boothby referred to the miners; but if their wages were reduced that would not provide work for other men, because the present production of coal is more than sufficient for our requirements. Take the position of the Caledonian Company. For years it has been paying big dividends, and particularly was that so during the war. Now it is dismissing men and closing the mines. The same thing applies to other mining companies. We cannot take action against these companies because we have not the power to do that, and besides, by penalizing the companies, we should penalize persons who have, after years of toil, invested their small savings in these companies, probably purchasing shares at greatly enhanced values. </para>

                        <para>- That has not hitherto been done. Even if we passed legislation to compel a company to disclose its financial position, and ascertained that half its capital is watered, we could hold no one responsible. We have never attempted to legislate to prevent the watering of capital. This Parliament has not full powers to legislate in regard to companies and corporations, and for that reason I supported the recent referendum. This provision is absolutely . unfair, in that it proposes a complete departure from recognized practice. Even if the amendment foreshadowed by the Attorney-General is carried, will it protect the skilled worker ? The court when fixing the basic wage has always allowed a margin for skill. If the economic effect of an award on the industry, affected is to be taken into consideration, and if the court is to determine the basic wage, what protection will there be for skilled workmen? What inducement will be offered to parents to have their sons taught trades, if they find that no more will be paid for skilled labour than for unskilled work? To-day the court is expected to deal with any matter that comes before it, from the point of view of equity and good conscience; but it is proposed under this clause that it shall take into consideration " the probable economic effect of an agreement or award in relation to the community in general, and the probable economic effect thereof upon the industry or industries concerned." We know that the industries are usually quite able to look after  their  own interests; but we must see that the scales are held fairly between all parties, and particularly must we safeguard the interests of the general community. Companies concerned in various commercial undertakings can inflate their capital at any time, and on the general community falls the burden of providing their profits. </para>

                        <para>- But I do say it. The court would take the economic position into consideration, and it could declare that in view of the amount of capital invested in an industry and the returns being received, that industry was not in a position to pay a certain wage. Then the court might reduce the wage of the skilled worker down to the level of the basic wage. My contention is that Parliament has never made provision for dealing with the economic position of an industry from its inception. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Looking through the register, one notices that some companies have watered their stock to the extent of one-third, although they made exceedingly good profits for a long time. Those who suffer most as the result of this watering of capital are the workers in the industry, and. there are no means of ascertaining whether the action taken is justified. It is often said that coal is too dear. That complaint frequently comes from Victoria, which purchases a good deal of coal from NewSouth Wales. The high cost is supposed to be due to the increased wages that the miners have received; but although the price of coal has gone up on two or three occasions recently, the miners have received no increase in their wages. If the economic position is to be considered here, surely, is scope for such an inquiry. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I am glad that the honorable member agrees with. me. The working man should at least have a decent return for his labour. The honorable member for Boothby spoke of the basic wage having been fixed at an amount calculated to keep a man, his wife and three children in decent comfort, and he argued that single men were receiving that wage. Taking every factor into consideration, we find that since the war period a man with a family is in a much worse position now than when the basic wage was fixed. It is remarkable that parents with three children can live on the basic wage. If they resided in the Federal Capital Territory, most of their income would be absorbed in house rent. The judges of the Arbitration Court, with the powers that have been conferred upon them, have no doubt acted in what they consider to be the best interests of the general community. They have dealt with the matters that have arisen for their consideration from the point of view of equity and good conscience; but under this bill it is proposed to make the Arbitration Act resemble the criminal code. We should leave the judges of the Arbitration Court to give even-handed justice to the contending parties in industry for the purpose of preventing strikes and lockouts. But peace in industry cannot be obtained by proposals such as those found in this measure. If our efforts are directed towards dealing with one section only - the industrialists - allowing them to be left entirely to the mercy of the employers, we shall depart from the principles of equity and good conscience, because this measure will be based on criminal law, and we shall see workmen cast into prison for trivial acts connected with their daily employment. When industrial arbitration was introduced it was not expected to prove a panacea for all industrial troubles; but it has minimized them. ^ To-day less working time is lost in Australia than in any other part of the world. In Great Britain, where compulsory arbitration does not operate, three working days are lost for every one day lost in Australia. </para>

Why should we pass provisions that will have the effect, probably, of inducing the industrial organizations to repudiate arbitration? Requests are received from the employers in almost every State that the act should be repealed. This bill is calculated to achieve that object, because the organizations will not register under the act as proposed to be amended. As soon as they have a taste of its provisions they will withdraw from the court. We should try to fashion the measure so that it will be acceptable to both parties. An act that favours one section will enable extremists to cause grave industrial trouble. The workers will be stirred to indignation, and will revert to the strike and the lockout. Direct action can never bring permanent good to the workers, because, after they have been on strike for two or three months, hunger forces them to give way. For that reason I have always heartily supported arbitration. </para>

                        <para>- The great majority have. I have pointed out that arbitration has minimized industrial trouble, and I have shown that fewer working days have been lost in Australia than elsewhere. That is an indication that the community has gained considerably by having had legislation to deal with these matters. In very many industries there has not been a single dispute. The coal industry is different from all others. </para>

                        <para>- Not at present; but it is quite possible that it may be extended. Can we justify the practice of providing one set of conditions for the coal-miners, under the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act, and altogether different conditions for every other industrial worker in the Commonwealth? I do not think that we can. We must be consistent ; and if the principle under discussion is embodied in our arbitration law something of the kind will inevitably follow in the case of the Industrial Peace Act. This clause is quite unnecessary. The section as it stands meets the situation. Under it the judges are allowed to come to a decision upon the merits of any dispute that may be brought before them. I have heard it argued during the last couple of days that the judges can be trusted to deal with every case on its merits, and that they will not do what we claim can be done under this bill. </para>

There is not a member of this committee who desires that that shall be done. Throughout this debate it has been the practice of honorable members opposite - carried away, perhaps, by too much partisan zeal - to claim that they, and they alone, are interested in the working mau. No claim could be more ridiculous or absurd. Possibly every honorable member who sits on this side has either relatives or friends among the working class. Some of us have sprung from the loins of working-class people, and we recognize that in a generation or two our children or our children's children may go back to the working-class ranks. It does not follow that because honorable members opposite are members of the Labour party they represent more truly than we do the views of the working men of this country, or are actuated to any greater extent by humanitarian instincts. We are as vitally concerned as they in the well-being of the working men and women of Australia. That is as much our concern as theirs, and we are prepared to accept the responsibility, and to act upon it. </para>

                <para>For many years I was solicitor to the Charters Towers Mine Owners' Association. It was then my duty to deal with industrial arbitration matters under the old Industrial Peace Act of 1912 and Wages Board Act of 1908. Both of those measures were introduced by Liberal governments in the State of Queensland, and were the first acts of their kind to be put in operation in that State. When an application, was made for an award to regulate the conditions in the mining industry, I, as solicitor to the Mine Owners' Association, was directed to file an answer to the claim of. the workers, I said that </para>

At that time solicitors were permitted to appear in the court. I was asked whether I claimed that the wages which were being paid in the industry were sufficient. I said that I did - not contend for one moment that the men were being paid a wage which compensated them for either the work they were doing or the risks they were taking. I was then asked what was the reason for my appearance in the court, and what was the nature of my defence. I said, "I am here to submit to the court the balance-sheets of the companies whom I represent, and to show what profits are or are not being made in the industry. I wish then to ask whether it is better that the men should accept such wages as the industry can afford to pay or be awarded a nominally higher wage, which actually they will not receive because there are not sufficient funds with which to pay it." The court took the view that the industry could stand a very substantial advance in wages. J had many friends among the miners. I was sorry that that decision had been arrived at, and told them so. I said, " I venture the opinion that in five years' time the mines in the Charters Towers, Ravenswood, Cape River, and Kangaroo Hills districts will have closed down." I was wrong. There were about 70 mines working when I uttered that prophecy; at the end of five years there were still two. left. </para>

                        <para>- One of the prominent factors in the stoppage of those mines were the conditions which were then imposed upon the industry. The wages certainly were not adequate. I would not work in the industry for what the men received. But the question was, whether it was not better for them to accept those wages until they could obtain other work that would provide them with better conditions. Of what use  nominally,  is it to have a wage of £1,000 a year and actually be out of employment ? Ability to pay is a factor which must be considered. Say what we may, do what we will, the fact is plain that from industry must come all wages. </para>

That is not the case. Our existing conditions have been brought about by a process of social evolution. Many of the advantages that we and our children enjoy have resulted from the application of science to industry, and not from any legislative enactment. As science and industry develop we progress by gradual stages to better and still better things. I trust that we shall never cease striving to improve the conditions of those who are near the breadline so that they may get further away from it. That cannot be achieved purely by legislative enactment; it must come as a result of the productivity of industry. If we disregard economic facts, and cause industries to be shut down, our last condition will be worse than our first, and we shall bring upon our people a disaster unparalleled in our history. We must look economic facts in the face, and act accordingly. </para>

                    <para>.- While the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> was speaking the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> interjected that this matter does not affect coal mines. If that is so, it is remarkable that the representative of the Coal Owners' Association has displayed a lively interest in the measure ever since it was first introduced. He lias missed hardly any of the debate, and no doubt has been in collaboration with members of the Government during its passage through committee. The coal mining industry will be affected by this bill, because the measure will give the owners what they want. The Industrial Peace Act will be scrapped and the coal-mining industry will be governed by the Arbitration Act. The representatives of the coal mineowners and the owners themselves have frequently declared that wages must be pressed down; and that employers associations generally want this particular provision in the bill is amply demonstrated by the circular issued by the Metal Trade Employers Federation. Frequent reference has been made to this circular during the course of this debate. Although the Attorney-General proposes to add the proviso that there must be no interference with the basic wage, he makes no provision for maintaining the margin of skill, and the demand of the controllers of industry to-day is not so much to reduce the basic wage as it is to take away the margin for skill and press the skilled man down to the basic wage. The speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J</inline> ohn Heine,  President  of the Metal Trade Employers Federation, was so pleasing to the federation, that it has gone to the expense of having it printed and circulated. Speaking of the conditions of industry <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Heine</inline> said - </para>

                    <para>The result is that there is a great deal of unemployment in the metal trades - unemployment for which the manufacturers refuse to take any particle of blame. The employers have told both the arbitration judges and the unions that there can be no expansion in the metal trades industry while it is shackled to old-fashioned ideas and the fetish that all machinery and metal parts must be " made " by a skilled mechanic in opposition to the " manufacturing " methods adopted by Australia's competitors beyond the seas. </para>

                <para class="block">That statement bears out my assertion that a demand is being made that the Arbitration Court shall not treat many branches of the metal trade as skilled labour. The passing of the bill now before us will not only have the effect of depressing the basic wage; it will also bring the skilled labourer closer and closer to the basic wage, by depriving him of the margin now allowed to him. Honorable members opposite have had a great deal to say about economic soundness. But we want a better definition than  we hara  had from them of what they mean. One would think after hearing the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. DuncanHughes),</inline> that economics are an exact science which can lay down definite standards. As a matter of fact economic conditions are defined according to conflicting schools of thought. What I may think is economic soundness, the honorable member for Boothby may regard as economic lunacy. Coal-mining is an industry that the honorable member would claim is likely to go out of existence because of the economic unsoundness of the wages now being paid to coal-miners. The coalmining industry of Australia cannot be brought into a position which will enable it to compete with the product of other countries by reducing the wages of the miners. How could we reduce the wages of our miners to enable them to compete with Dutch convicts, who are hewing coal in Borneo at Id. a day, or with coalminers in other countries who hew it for ls. a day? How could we even reduce the wages of our miners to enable our coal to compete with South African coal which is subsidized by the South African government at the rate of 8s. 6d. a ton? If we were to try to bring about economic equality in wage conditions we should need to reduce the wages of our coal-miners to the extent I have indicated; but even then we should not succeed in enabling our coal to compete with the output of other countries. According to the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. G. Francis)</inline> it is better for our miners to have half a loaf instead of the whole loaf. When the honorable member was talking of the economic unsoundness of the mining industry to-day he did not remind us of what the mine-owners have done in the past. He did not tell us how they kept the miners on a bare pittance and made enormous profits on millions of pounds of fictitious capital. </para>

                <para class="block">I am <inline font-style="italic">sorry</inline> that I have not them with me to-day. But I can call to mind dozens of mining companies that have made enormous profits. There was one company which had a capital of a few thousand pounds in 1908. Between that year and 1920 it was reconstructed four times, until to-day it has a capital of £2,000,000, although not a single penny of additional capital has been taken in since 1908. That company still wants its miners to work at a living wage to earn profits on a capital of £2,000,000, which has been earned by the industry itself. Honorable members who talk about economic soundness should base their arguments on concrete facts. There is not an industry in Australia to-day that is economically sound from a capital point of view. Every company is over-capitalized. Six million people are expected to carry industries with huge capitals, stock being superimposed on stock until each concern is economically unsound. Take the position of the coal-mining industry once more to show how economically unsound it is through over-capitalization and not because of the wages paid to the workers. If the miners worked for nothing our coal could not be sold in the markets of the world to enable a profit to be made on the huge amounts of capital on which dividends have to be paid. The reduction in cost that would be brought about if the miners worked for nothing would not exceed more than 3s. or 4s. a ton, whereas to enable our coal to compete with the coal produced by the cheap labour in other countries to which I have already referred, the cost of production would have to be lowered by 10s. or 12s. a ton. "Women and children still work in the coal mines of Japan. Do the honorable members for Boothby and Kennedy want our women and children to work in our coal mines? Do they want the conditions that apply in Borneo to apply in Australia? Yet if they want our industries to attain that economic soundness to which they have referred, those conditions would need to apply in our coal-mining industry, and in many other industries. If economics were an exact science, they would teach us that if the human being is to be enabled to support himself and propagate, the huge profits now made by capital must come down. It is absurd for the honorable member for Kennedy to talk about half a loaf being better than the whole loaf in a country like this, which ought to be providing comfortable means of living for tens of millions instead of 6,000,000 people. That its population is not greater than it is to-day is due to the stupid " economic soundness " the honorable member would have continue. We are told that if the basic wage does not come down, industries in this country must go out of existence. The same cry that industries would go out of existence was raised when Wilberforce tried to have slavery abolished. The indignation was great when the demand was made in Great Britain, that little children should no longer be harnessed like donkeys to wagons in coal mines, or strapped to machinery in factories and flogged by brutal bosses to keep them awake, or douched with water if through exhaustion they fell asleep. The cry was raised that it would be economically unsound to take the women and children out of the coal mines and factories of Great Britain. When the people of India were dying like flies from famine and a humanitarian member of the House of Commons asked the British Government to send corn to its starving subjects, the Prime Minister of that day said that it would be against the laws of political economy to do so, and that the Government must not interfere with the rights of the merchants trading with India. Those are the present-day economics of the honorable members for Boothby and Kennedy. Is it a state of affairs they would like to see in Australia? If we are to deal with this matter on those lines, on the ground of sound economics, I say " Devil take them. We do not want them in Australia." I support the full judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, when he said that if an industry could not pay a progressive and living wage, it could not justify its existence. What are we considering in this matter? Is this a national Parliament, concerned with the well-being of the people as a whole, or are we like benighted savages worrying ourselves about things which really do not matter ? The one thing that really matters in Australia is the welfare of our people. Are we going to make the man a slave to the machine? Are we going to build up- national wealth by the labour of half -fed workers? If that is the result of the economics preached by honorable members opposite, it is worse than paganism, because' under paganism the slaves were at least fed properly. This clause reverses the whole process of arbitration in Australia, and is directly contrary to what people have come to expect of the arbitration system. </para>

                        <para>- Let the honorable member forget about Queensland; we are discussing Australia now. Even honorable members opposite will admit that the arbitration system was introduced as a protest against the revolting conditions which had existed in industry. The industrial organizations throughout the country accepted arbitration, and registered under the court, because they knew that no matter how searching or objectionable might be the inquiries made into their mode of living, there was at least the certainty that if it were established that £4 10s. a week was necessary to enable a man to live in decency, that amount would be given to him. That principle was observed in the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and in the awards of the wages boards, and has been regarded as sacred up to the present time. If the workers had not believed that their rights in this direction were secure, they would never have accepted the arbitration system at all. The principle will be destroyed, however, if sub-section 25d becomes law. If this provision becomes Jaw, arbitration can be made an instrument to re-introduce into this country the same terrible conditions which it was designed to remedy. It is absurd to say that these provisions will not, or cannot, affect the basic wage. In New South Wales the basic wage has been fixed at a figure which will provide a bare living for a man and his wife; in some of the other States it is designed to provide a living for a man, his wife, and two children. In order to provide for the children in a home, the system of child endowment was introduced in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>-.- If it is only proposed to deal with hours under this provision, why not say so? The honorable member for Barton must remember that under this clause the court may deal with wages as well as working hours. In any case, there is very little chance that the court, as at present constituted, would entertain any application to reduce the working week to 36 hours. </para>

                        <para>- A judge dealing with wages would not be empowered to deal with hours. When any alteration in the length of the working week is under consideration, the matter must be dealt with by three judges. Under this clause the court may, in considering the basic wage, take as its guide the wage fixed in New South Wales, which, as I have said, has been based on the needs of a man and his wife only. If the basic wage in another State has been fixed on the needs of four people as against two in New South Wales, it stands to reason that it will probably be higher than that in New South Wales. Therefore, this clause can, and does, make provision for the basic wage in other States than New South Wales being reduced. The proviso says - </para>

                <para>In all seriousness I ask honorable members opposite, who prate so much about the need for immigration, do they propose to support a piece of legislation which may have the effect of putting a premium on race suicide ? If the basic wage fixed makes no provision in the Australian home for the Australian baby, it is placing a premium on race suicide, and making it an economic necessity for the working man. That is not a desirable thing. Perhaps honorable members opposite may consider it sound economics, but I do not. I am voicing the opinion of 99 per cent, of the industrial workers of this country,  whether they belong to what is called the " reds, " or to any other section, when I say that arbitration, if this clause becomes law, will be merely a sham, a delusion, and a snare, and the workers will have nothing to do with it. I recognize what arbitration has done for the workers in the past, but I believe that they will be better off without any arbitration at all than the sort we shall have if this provision becomes law. In saying that the country will be better off without arbitration, I believe I am also expressing the opinion of many honorable members opposite. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archdale</inline> Parkhill, in a pamphlet which he issued in  1922,  said that the fundamental difference between the Nationalist and Country parties was that the Country party stood for the abolition of all law as between the workers and the employers. I believe that this clause has been designed in order to bring about what the members of the Country  paTty  want, and I hope that it will be defeated. </para>

                        <para>- All we care to understand is that industry is being held up, and, as far as I can see, neither the Government, nor the Opposition, is taking any action about it. I regret that the Attorney-General has proposed an amendment which practically exempts the basic wage from the court's investigation of the economic effects of any award it proposes to make. There was some hope that an unrestricted investigation of that kind would improve the conditions of industry. As the honorable member for Boothby pointed out, in certain industries some wages might be better than none. I have always believed in good wages. While  chairman  of Public Works Committees, I always urged that the Commonwealth should set an example by erecting the finest buildings; but I wanted value for the money spent. So in industry we must have value for the wages paid. Is an industry to be called upon to pay wages which it cannot afford, and thus be forced to close down and create further unemployment? For the present uneconomic condition of Australia high wages and arbitration court awards are not alone responsible; the financial and economic policy of successive Governments has been a factor. Through these several causes the cost of production in many industries which would have employed large numbers of people has been increased to such an extent that they have been obliged to close down, and the consequences have been felt by the whole community. My intimate acquaintance with the mining industry showed me the great value that accrued to the whole community from one working mine. It is usually accepted that one miner supports about five other persons throughout the community. Accordingly, when a great enterprise like the Mount Morgan Mine, in Queensland, is forced to close down through excessive cost of production, and  2,000  miners are  rendered idle, about <inline font-style="italic">10,000</inline> other people in the community are directly affected. If that mine were in the United States of America, where wages are even higher than in Australia, it would be still working. The arbitration laws are linked up with the tariff, and the Navigation Act. I do not desire to make the conditions of the worker worse than they are. Working people comprise the majority of my constituents, and who but they return me to Parliament ? But I believe in economic liberty. Arbitration, particularly under the Commonwealth Act, has proved a failure. Amongst the wharf labourers, the seamen, and the coal-miners, there has been nothing but turmoil since the act commenced to operate. Unless the court takes into consideration the probable economic effects of its awards upon the community it will continue to create unemployment. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> referred to the watering of the capital of mining companies. I believe that Parliament should take drastic action to prevent companies from trying to pay dividends upon watered stock </para>

                        <para>- It could be done only through the company law. Unfortunately, this Parliament has evaded many of its responsibilities, and neglected many things to which it could have attended with greater advantage to the community than has come from its intrusion into spheres that more properly belong to the States. There was some hope that arbitration might prove effective if the judges were told to consider not only the two parties in a sheltered industry, who might find it mutually profitable to collaborate in getting wages increased, but also the general community. Extravagant conditions are all right for those engaged in industries that can pass on the increased cost; but they are not all right for the public that has to pay. Compare the driver of a baker's cart with the miner; which works the harder, and which gets the higher wage? I have said on previous occasions that high wages alone will not kill any industry ; they are detrimental only when associated with a false economic policy.

                        replying, said that the outstanding result of arbitration had been to increase the cost of living and to make wages increases mere illusions, thus rendering it difficult to work in competition with other countries. The courts created clas- consciousness, which soon led to envy and suspicion, and engendered an atmosphere inimical to the interests of the workers.

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition said in a recent speech that the effective wage today is 5 per cent, less than it was in 1922. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> in placing the whole of the blame for the present position of Australia upon the Arbitration Court; the Navigation Act with the abnormal tariff also is responsible. It gives to a select few conditions that cannot be given to all workers. If we could extend the same advantages to all sections of the community - not only the members of trade unions, but also the people battling in the back-blocks - I would not object. </para>

                        <para>- At a meeting in my electorate a man asked me if I thought that £8 a month was a fair wage to be paid to a British, seaman. I replied that that was not his concern or mine; that the British seamen and owners should be allowed to settle their business relations without the interference of a few bolsheviks- in Australia. Then I asked him which of two men was the more important to the community, the man who worked on the land or the man employed on a coastal ship. He replied, " The man on the land." I then said, " What wages do you pay to the man employed on your farm." There was a roar of laughter, and the interjector sneaked out of the meeting. The chairman's explanation was that that individual was paying only 35s. a week to his labourers. I have been told that the wages of the firemen employed by one shipping company average £33 a month. Is it fair that men on a ship should get £7, £8, and £9 a week, and men on a farm only 35s. ? Unfortunately, the Arbitration Act, the Navigation Act, and the customs tariff give to some sections engaged in sheltered industries extravagant conditions such as cannot be given to others. Only the high prices we have received for our wheat and wool, in .conjunction with the lavish expenditure of borrowed money, have enabled us to carry on. If we had less arbitration and more conciliation by direct negotiation between employer and employee, the effective wages in Australia to-day would be higher than they are. Men should be paid as much as they can earn. </para>

There are too many appeals - from the conciliation board to the State Court and from the State Court to the Federal court. As I said in a previous speech, I greatly admire the simplicity of the Canadian scheme. Since 1904 we have introduced amendment after amendment, and this bill, which itself is a huge measure, is to be superimposed on an already voluminous statute. We are getting deeper and deeper into the bog. There was a small gleam of hope that economic conditions would be considered when making awards, but that is destroyed by the amendment of the Attorney-General. I hope that the honorable gentleman will see his way to withdraw his amendment. The proposed section was of some value, but it will be valueless if this amendment is passed. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not know whether the Government is prepared to accept my advice, but I strongly urge it to delete this proposed section and the amendment of the Attorney-General from the bill. I should like to find somebody who can give a satisfactory definition of the word "economic." I have studied various dictionaries in the Parliamentary Library, and can find no definition that enlightens me as to its application in the proposed section. I fail to see how the judges will have the remotest chance of defining the term when they are called upon to do so. It has a remarkably broad meaning. It refers to the economics of the individual, " of or pertaining to the management of a household, or of a private estate or income." Then there is its application to " the management of the affairs of the government or community with reference to its source of income, its expenditure, the development of its natural resources, &amp;c." Again, it is defined as " the science that investigates the conditions and laws affecting the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth, or the material means of satisfying human desires." I am confident that, when the first case comes before the court under the amended act the judges will be so overwhelmed with the magnitude of the problem that it will be years before they can arrive at any determination. The judges will merely shelve the problem and leave it unsolved. The court could not do better than adhere to the finding of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, whose determinations are regarded with great respect throughout the world. When he went to Great Britain he was entertained by the Bar, at the Inner Temple, where he made some profound observations which greatly impressed me. Economic problems have the attention of the leaders of thought in all countries, but still the true meaning of the word " economics " as it applies to the subject with which we are dealing remains obscure. I shall give an illustration of my experience in industrial economics. Had I invested a sovereign in the Nobel Explosives Company Limited when I left England in 1874 I should, up to the year 1924, have drawn £7,500 in dividends on that investment. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Mond, a financial magnate in Great Britain, consolidated the activities of the great chemical and explosive industries in Great Britain, which now have a huge capital. If the concern existed ii Australia and the judges of the Arbitration Court were asked to determine the probable economic effect of an award on that industry, on what basis of capitalization would they proceed to examine affairs? Some years ago the capital of that concern was £1,500,000. To-day it is something like £28,000,000. Let me bring the matter nearer home. The wealthy Colonial Sugar Refining Company was founded by the Faithful family with a small original capital. How would the judges view its position to-day? Again, the prosperous firm of Anthony Hordern Limited had its beginning in a small draper's shop kept by Anthony Hordern, senior. I suppose that when the Horderns passed that huge business over to its present proprietary ownership they were satisfied to regard the capital of the concern at about £1,000,000 or £2,000,000. To-day <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon is at the head of the new proprietary concern, which has a capital of £7,000,000, and I shall show how <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> regards its economic capacity to pay wages. Recently one of the firm's employees, who had served the business faithfully for 45 years, asked to be relieved of his duties, and intimated that, when any old employee left the firm in similar conditions, it had been the custom of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Hordern to provide him with a small pension. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> , Sheldon manifested considerable surprise at the request, and said " This is not Horderns now; it is another business." Parliament should not bring ridicule upon itself by passing a provision of this kind. How could any judge be expected to state the true meaning of it? That is a riddle which no man or body of men can solve. The trouble is that while judges are trying to find an answer to it the workers will be suffering in every way. Abusive speeches such as those delivered by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> do not help one to consider a subject like this dispassionately. It appears to me that honorable members opposite are totally unfitted, because of their environment, to examine questions from the point of view of the working classes, for many of them began life in comfortable homes. Others have benefited by the developments that have occurred in recent years in Australian industries. Some of them, for instance, are interested in the wool industry, and know that whereas a few years ago a sheep yielded a fleece of only about 4 lb., the average weight of a fleece to-day is about 8 lb. Not long ago wool brought only 7d. or 8d. per lb., but to-day it brings about four times that figure. Some honorable members opposite are wheatgrowers, and they know that while yean ago wheat sold for as little as ls. 9d. a bushel it brings more than 5s. a bushel today. There has been no comparable change in the circumstances of the workers. As a matter of fact, conditions for them have become more severe. If a worker of 50 years of age is unfortunate enough to lose his job in these days he finds it practically impossible to get another. That is a consideration the Arbitration Court could  well take into account. Another indication of our changing economic conditions is that big building contractors nowadays sub-let practically all their work, and directly employ very few men. Plumbing, painting, carpentering, and other building operations are sub-let to small men. To state these facts is to show the absurdity of expecting the Arbitration Act to take all into account. When I was a young man I was advised to read for the law. I could have been engaged in one of the principal law chambers in Phillip-street. But it would be impossible for any man, however well educated he might be, to understand the meaning of this provision. The whole proposal is stupid, ridiculous, and absurd. Economic considerations are far too comprehensive to be taken into account by a court charged with the simple duty of fixing wages and working conditions. For example, how could an Arbitration Court judge estimate the effect of stock watering? He might know very well that many of our big business undertakings were to-day seriously over-capitalized ; and that it was the height of absurdity for commercial men to pay £2,000 a foot for land; but he could not take such considerations into account in fixing wages. When the employers finds that they have made a mistake in the conduct of their business, their first move is to attempt to reduce the standard of living of their employees. This matter should not be left at the discretion of the court. The clause should be eliminated. Parliament itself should be the authority to determine the economic conditions of industry. I can well imagine what will happen if the Arbitration Court makes awards that are unacceptable to the big firms of employers in Sydney, and how the resultant litigation will profit the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ley)</inline> and such legal firms as Norton Smith and Company, Minter Simpson and Company, and others, whose clients appear so often to take a delight in beating their employees to their knees. I shall oppose these provisions to the utmost of my power. They are designed to destroy the standard set up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins when he was  President  of the Arbitration Court.  His  awards were models of equity, and were endorsed by all sections of the community, who realize that employees have every right to the best that industry can give <inline font-style="italic">thom.

                    <para>.- The clause under discussion is of transcendent importance. If it is agreed to, it will have a widespread effect upon industry in Australia, because it will affect directly the living conditions of the people. No subject that can engage our attention is more important than the standard of living. To put this matter in its true perspective, I quote the following passage from the opening remarks of the Attorney-General when moving the second reading of the bill in December last. He said - </para>

                <para class="block">This means that circumstances which were regarded formerly as the governing factor in determining working conditions in industry have become so well established that there is not now the same need for legislative restraint upon industry. Apparently the Attorney-General is prepared to allow the court's functions to include decisions concerning the conditions governing industry, and to permit the court to say whether it is possible for a certain industry in the circumstances in which it finds itself to pay a stated rate of wage aud concede conditions of employment which may he regarded as fair and reasonable. I should not like the conditions in some industries that are within my knowledge to be governed by the employer's ideas of what should constitute an economic basis. Perhaps I may be permitted to speak particularly of the conditions in the engineering trade, for the reason that I served my time in that industry, and was also employed in it for some years. I know that certain engineering firms would be unable to pay even the basic wage to engineers if the amount which had to be paid were determined by the economic effect of that wage on industry generally with existing plant, methods and management. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot follow the honorable member for Lang. I take it that the clause means that the court will determine what wages can be paid in an industry in the circumstances in which that industry stands at that moment. It is generally admitted that we are enjoying a fair standard of living in Australia, and I submit that if inefficiency in management is disclosed the employees ought not to be made to suffer, but there is certainly this possibility. </para>

                        <para>- If the law required all employers to bring their plant and equipment up to the highest point of efficiency, and if the returns were equitably distributed between employees and employers, I should say it would be a step in the right direction. But, as we all know, a wage standard set down as the minimum to be paid in industry invariably proves to be the maximum. Very few instances have come within my knowledge of employers recognizing their obligations towards employees in this respect. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave)</inline> - The situation which has been developing for the last few weeks in connexion with the coastal shipping services of Australia has caused the Government an increasing measure of anxiety, and I am sure has occasioned much concern to every member of this House, as well as to the people of Australia generally. Although the dispute has brought about a serious dislocation of trade the Government has been very reluctant to take any action because from day to day a settlement has appeared to be possible. The Government now feels that the position cannot be allowed to continue any longer. The efforts which have been made to bring about a settlement seem unhappily to have been abortive. The machinery of the Commonwealth Arbitration and Conciliation Court has been invoked. Almost as soon as the dispute arose there was a conference between the ship-owners and the Marine Cooks' Union, the union concerned. That conference was presided over by the Conciliation Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart.</inline> Unhappily, no result came from it. There has also been a hearing in the court itself. At that hearing the Marine Cooks' Union declined to give any undertaking that it would observe any award of the court, and as a result, the award which its members enjoyed was cancelled by the court. The matter has been taken up by the other unions of Australia. They have brought pressure to bear upon the Marine Cooks' Union with a view to bringing about a settlement. Those efforts also have failed. Only yesterday there appeared in the press a report of a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duggan,</inline> the  president  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in the following terms - </para>

Duggan)</inline> said to-day that the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes was not one of the functions of the A.C.T.U. It was recognized that all disputes of an interstate character should be handled by a central authority in conjunction with the unions concerned.

                <para>As a result of the unfortunate shipping holdup which has taken place, there has been a progressive dislocation of the economic and commercial life of the community, and untold suffering has been inflicted upon thousands of citizens of the Commonwealth who are in no way concerned with the present dispute. While the Government does not desire to express any opinion at all upon the merits of this trouble, it considers that it has an obligation to the whole of the people of Australia to fulfil; that it should not be possible for any section of the community to prevent one of the great vital transport services from functioning, with disastrous results to so many innocent people. The Government consequently feels that, to try to ensure that this service shall be restored at the earliest possible moment, it must utilize all the powers that the Parliament has entrusted to it. Accordingly, it proposes to exercise the powers which have been entrusted to it under section 30j of the Crimes Act, and a proclamation will be immediately gazetted declaring, in the terms of that section that, " there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance, prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States." After that proclamation has been made, the Government will take every step within its power under the Crimes Act, or any other act of this Parliament, to prevent any person from interfering in any way with the re-establishment of these services. </para>

                    <para>My Government has been watching with grave concern the serious development of the industrial dispute between the Marine Cooks' Union and the Australian ship-owners. This has now resulted in a practical paralysis of the shipping transport trade of the Commonwealth. Legal and constitutional means for the settlement of the dispute exist; but those who have caused the trouble refuse to accept these, and have also repudiated all attempts at settlement made by the representatives of other trade unions. This disastrous attitude ie causing serious loss and injury to the whole community, and is throwing thousands of people out of work. The Commonwealth Government feels that this state of things must be brought to an end. i have communicated with the ship-owners calling upon them to resume the running of their ships. The Government has issued a proclamation under section 30j of the Commonwealth Crimes Act that "there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States." My Government intends to use all the power it possesses under the law to insure that no person shall be permitted to interfere with the resumption of this allimportant transport service. i would invite the co-operation of your Government to that end, feeling sure that you will recognize that it is our joint duty to terminate as early as possible the present disastrous condition of things. </para>

                    <para>My Government views with profound anxiety the paralysis of the coastal shipping trade of Australia, due to the dispute between the  Marine  Cooks' Union and the shipping companies. The present position is that coastal shipping communication has practically ceased, negotiations for settlement have proved abortive, and the intervention of the other trade unions has failed. i do not propose to canvass the merits or demerits of the dispute; it is sufficient to say that legal aud constitutional means for the peaceful settlement of it exist; but those who have caused the trouble refuse to accept them and have repudiated all attempts at settlement. The main concern of my Government, apart from the enforcement of Commonwealth law, is that an end should be made of the hold-up which is dislocating the industries of the country, and causing, and must continue increasingly to cause, loss and unemployment to thousands of people who have nothing whatever to do with the dispute. We have come to the conclusion that definite steps must now be taken in the interests of the whole community to end the present situation. My Government proposes, under the powers given it by Parliament, to issue a proclamation undo!- section 30.j of the Crimes Act 1912-1928, that "There exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States." The issue of this 'proclamation will enable the Commonwealth Government to take drastic proceedings against all persons who interfere with the carrying on of this essential transport service, and the Government will take all possible steps to secure the enforcement of Commonwealth law and the punishment of offenders. The Government now asks yOU to take whatever steps are necessary to resume the running of your ships. i have already communicated with the various State Governments, inviting them to co-operate with us by rendering all assistance within their power to protect the community from any further injury and loss. i would suggest that your representatives in the various States should inform the State Governments of any action you propose to take to ensure the resumption of this essential transport service, feeling confident that every State' Government will give full protection under its laws. </para>

                        - The first intimation that I received of the Prime Minister's intention to ask leave to make a statement respecting the coastal shipping dispute, was at one minute before 8 o'clock to-night. A regard for the ordinary courtesies of Parliament should have demanded the giving of a little more  notice  to the Leader of the Opposition, because this side of the House, in common with honorable members opposite, share the anxiety expressed by the Prime Minister in regard to anything calculated to hold up the transport or the trade of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister came to the House to-night with a considered statement, and prepared telegrams, and having submitted them, called upon the representatives of both sides to express their views. At least an opportunity might have been given the Opposition to put a considered statement of its views before the chamber.

                <para>I have no word to say against the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister, in so far as they refer to the desirability of bringing about peace in industry, and ensuring the continuance of the transport services of this country. I share with every other honorable member the desire that that shall be done. T do not wish to traverse the merits of the case any more than does the Prime Minister. I am not prepared to champion the action of the marine cooks in their original attitude, nor am I prepared to excuse the attitude of the ship-owners who have developed this dispute into a lockout, and extended the trouble. However one may condemn the precipitate action of the small body of men engaged as cooks on the boats, if there is a desire for peace in industry, why did the ship-owners, when those men were defeated, and offered to return to work on the old conditions, impose new conditions. </para>

                        <para>- They did. When these men admitted defeat, and wrote to the ship-owners offering to return to work, the ship-owners, knowing that the marine cooks were defeated, and that there was a considerable public opinion against them, seized the opportunity to upset the roster system  which had been in operation for ten years. The cooks offered to go back on the old conditions, and submit the roster system to arbitration. If that offer had been accepted, we should not have had the position which exists to-day. I am not standing behind the cooks in their original attitude, because I believe that, the dispute did riot warrant the holding up of the essential services of the country. I go further, and say that their attitude in refusing to' accept the invitation of the properly accredited representatives of the trade-union movement, does not meet with my approval, or that of any honorable member on this side of the House. That, at least, is a clear and definite statement of our attitude. </para>

                <para>So far as the step taken by the Government is concerned, I absolutely oppose the declaration that any action by employers in refusing employment to employees, or any action by employees in refusing to work should be regarded as a criminal act. That meets with my opposition. A lockout or strike is not a criminal act. It may be reprehensible; it may cause a lot of trouble; but unless there is an overt act of a criminal character by individuals, the mere act of refusing to accept or to offer employment is not criminal. </para>
                <para>On a matter of principle such as this, one has to take a definite stand. The Opposition as a party is not opposed to the Crimes Act as a whole, but is opposed to the particular section that has now been put into operation. The Prime Minister, in a speech in Melbourne recently, took up a statement made by me in this House, in which I said that I considered that the Crimes Act should be removed from the statute-book. He knew, however, that I referred only to the particular provisions relating to industrial disputes. Should we not, he said, deal with certain acts of a criminal nature, which he named, under the Crimes Act? I have never denied that, we should. The act embodies certain sections that every honorable member supports, because they deal with criminal acts ; but we on this side objected when the bill was before Parliament, and object now, to classing refusals to work or to offer work as criminal offences for which those found guilty shall be liable to imprisonment or deportation. </para>
                <para>Having taken that stand on the Crime's Act - having, objected to the inclusion of that provision when the measure was before the House - I object, in the name of this party, to its application. I admit the difficulties that present themselves. I recognize the seriousness of the situation, which is liable to extend ; but I do not believe that this country has exhausted all the methods available for settling the present dispute, short of the application of the Crimes Act. I do not think that the Government has exhausted all the means at its disposal. </para>

Speaking for myself and for honorable members on this side generally, we certainly have not proclaimed from the house-tops what we have done; but we have got into close touch with the accredited representatives - the responsible officers - of trade unionism, and have expressed our views to them. In these views they have concurred, and have made very considerable efforts in the direction of securing peace. I regret exceedingly that their authority in the trade union movement has been defied by the Marine Cooks Union; but that would not justify me, in agreeing to what I think is in its very essence a wrong principle, and saying that the Crimes Act should be applied if men refuse to work, or the ship-owners refuse to give them work. </para>

While I do not consider it the function of the Government to dictate to any court, I certainly do consider it a function of government to indicate to the court what the Government thinks is its duty in certain circumstances. That is where I think the Government has failed. I believe that both parties to the dispute could be forced into the Arbitration Court, and could be dealt with under the Arbitration Act if they evaded or broke the law.

                    <para>- Prior to the dinner adjournment I was endeavouring to impress upon the committee the difficulty that would be experienced in applying the proposed new section 25d, which provides that the court, before making an award, shall consider its probable economic effect in relation to the general community and the industry concerned. I pointed out that this provision would prevent the employees from receiving a fair share of the fruits of production. At least two honorable members opposite referred to the mining industry. If the economic position of that industry were taken into consideration, I presume that the " mining companies would be expected to carry on their operations profitably, having regard to the market prices obtainable for ore at the time. It is safe to assume that only employees would suffer; they would be expected to accept a reduction in wages. I have before me authentic returns relating to the operations of mining companies at Broken Hill up to the end of 1924. I find that the total value of the output up to that time was £120,810,033 ; the bonuses paid amounted to £26,341,574, and the authorized capital of the various companies was £7,823,000. But those figures do not represent the full financial standing of those companies. During a long series of years they enjoyed great prosperity. When they were taking out rich ores they paid their shareholders handsome dividends, and put substantial sums to reserves. I find that the Broken Hill South Company, in the last period recorded at the end of 1926, paid a dividend of 65 per cent, to investors, and over the previous period of three years the dividends averaged 50 per cent. The company also amassed in reserves no less than £1,270,183. The Broken Hill North Company occupied an even more favorable position. During the last period to which I have referred, it returned a dividend of 95 per cent., and over the three years the dividends averaged 70 per cent., while £1,813,926 was placed to reserves. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which, of course, has interests other than mining, returned dividends over the three years averaging 5 per cent. ; but its reserves amounted to £2,687,708. In determining the wages paid to the workmen employed in the industry, will regard be given to the huge reserves that have been built up, or to the vast profits made in times of prosperity? I say emphatically that it will not. Every effort has been made to keep the miners' wages down to the lowest possible margin, and in many cases they have been begrudged even a living wage. The greedy shareholders have now picked the eyes out of those mines, and have fattened as the result of the labours of the miners, who have had to face many perils in the course of their employment. Now that the metal market is less favorable than it formerly was, and the ores won are not so rich as they used to be, it is desired by the companies that the workers should submit to standards equivalent to the prevalent depression and uneconomic position of the industry. It is upon this that the court will be compelled to base its decisions and as it applies to the mining industry so it will apply to others. We could not stand for a principle of that description. Chief Judge Dethridge recognizes that a man is entitled to at least a living wage. Commenting upon the claim of the Merchant Service Guild of Australia for increased wages, he said - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Every worker should be entitled to a living wage. In some cases the result may have been that some men have got more out of the industry than they have put into it; but the court has said that if they are willing to work they should get the living wage, even if they do not give adequate economic return. But, when it gets to the higher grades of labour, the court has not said anything of the kind. The court has said, " As far as we can we will give those higher grades of labour what their skill justifies." I can only measure what their skill justifies by what in the past it has been the practice to give them. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">If the principle which underlies this clause is applied, the Chief Judge and every other judge of the court will be prevented from recognizing the margins of skill that have been observed in previous awards of the court, because they will be compelled in framing an award to take into consideration the economic circumstances which have been created, not by the worker, but by the inordinate greed of the owners, who as a rule demand from industry more than they have a right to expect. We frequently hear it stated that different industries cannot afford to pay the basic or living wage ; but I learn from the <inline font-style="italic">Investors' Guide</inline> that there are in Australia 271 companies or corporations whose dividends are- higher than any bank rate of interest. In many instances they are returning very substantial dividends on watered capital. Only seventeen companies are not paying dividends, and, with one exception, they have fairly substantial reserves. Will labour share in this treasure gained from industry ? No ; it is only in time of depression in trade that cognizance is taken of the economic position. If the worker received an appropriate share of the wealth which he produces he might be able to survive a period of depression; but that, is denied him. When a union makes a claim for an adjustment of wages and conditions the court will be required to take into consideration the economic position of the industry; and it will not be either entitled or prepared to increase the rate of wage above that sought in the log, even although the economic position of the industry -might fully justify such an order. It is deliberately intended that economic circumstances shall operate in only one direction, that of wage reduction. That is unfair and unjust to those who are the principal factors in industry. In the extreme view of the economic relation of the two units in production or service it may be logically advanced that labour could produce the essentials of community service without the aid of those who invest their capital merely for what they can get out of industry; but, on the other hand, those who have command of capital cannot carry on without labour. I say this merely to show the value and the absolute dependence on labour. It is anomalous to call upon the labourers in industry to suffer loss that is occasioned by either the avarice of the shareholders or the inefficient or unscientific methods that are employed. I cannot, therefore, endorse the principle which the clause expresses. We must recognize, also, the possibility of its undermining seriously the principle of affording our industries adequate protection against foreign competition. I believe that certain employers would be prepared to dispense with a margin of tariff protection so long as they can secure lower rates of wages, and thus reduce the cost of production. The whole of the burden would then be borne by the labourers in industry. While we assist different industries by means of the tariff and the payment of bounties, we should insist upon their being placed upon the most efficient basis. If the captains of industry are not prepared to take action along those lines they do not deserve the consideration which they seek from this Parliament from time to time. Before there is any interference with the standard of conditions enjoyed by the worker to-day we should compel those who are receiving such big rake-offs from their investments to disgorge a little so as to maintain the industry during a period of partial depression. We should certainly make it possible for the labourers in industry to share adequately in the benefits it confers. I should be an unworthy representative of those who are wealth producers if I did not endeavour to protect them from what I regard as a very serious intrusion upon their rights, meagre as those rights are. My experience in industry is shared by many of those who are engaged in a capacity similar to that which I have filled as a worker. I know that the worker in the great majority of cases lives only from week to week,  or fortnight to fortnight.  His  wage or salary is sometimes mortgaged before the week has expired. That surely proves that he has only a bare existence, and deserves a more substantial and generous proportion of the wealth which he produces. The basic wage to-day does not provide for more than the most frugal sustenance. Many persons who have given good service to industry are to-day walking the streets because industry is unable to meet the situation in which it is placed on account of the unscientific methods that have been adopted. Whenever there is depression the champions of the employers and the investors want the sacrifices to be visited upon those who are least able to bear them. We should not be doing our duty if we supported the principle enunciated by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> and the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes).</inline> The honorable member for Boothby argued that it was better to have half a loaf than none at all. It is very poor consolation to be given only half a loaf when one is confident that industry can afford a full loaf. </para>

                    <para>. - I find myself out of agreement with some of the sentiments that have been expressed during the debate on this clause. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> said that the closing down of the Mount Morgan mine was responsible for the services of 2,000 men being dispensed with, and that that action affected very seriously no fewer than 10,000 persons. He also argued that the withdrawal from circulation of the amount which those men received in wages made a big difference to the community. That is quite true. I remind him, however, that about 700,000 persons are employed in Australia in protected industries, and that if his ideas in regard to the tariff were given legislative expression 3,500,000 people would be seriously affected. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly, but there is a great deal of efficiency displayed, and I understand that the adoption of the De  Bavay  process has meant millions of pounds to the owners of the mines. I quoted figures the other day to show that an independent tribunal of engineers and experts in the United States of America had examined seven great industries in that country and had come to the conclusion that 70 per cent, of the lack of efficiency in those industries was due to employers and managers, and only 15 per cent, to the workers, the remainder being attributable to other causes. According to my reading, Germany stands industrially to-day, as it did in the pre-war period, as the moat highly organized country in the world, and I believe that in this respect the United States of America stands second. If 70 per cent, of the inefficiency displayed in the United States of America is due to the employers and managers, and only 15 per cent, to the employees, I shall be interested to know what the respective percentages would be if a similar investigation were made in six of Australia's leading industries. </para>

That means that he would rather have individual bargaining with his workmen than collective bargaining; he would rather have a number of men competing for each job offering. An opportunity such as that would be a golden one for the employers desirous of taking advantage of the fact that there are practically 100,000 out of work in Australia at the present time. The absence of all restrictions would permit them to engage men under any conditions they chose to impose. Of course, I do not think that some honorable members sitting behind the Government would go so far as that.

I do not say, however, that that is a proper attitude for him to take up, because having accepted the invitation of the Government to take part in the delegation, I think he should have remained with the delegation until its report was completed, even to the dotting of the last " i " or the crossing of the last "t." Of course, a minority report was submitted. </para>

                        <para>- I know, but there were some so-called representatives of Labour on that commission who did not represent the sentiments of the industrialists of Australia. I propose to make a quotation for the purpose of showing that it is not desirable to scrap our arbitration awards and substitute for them the United States of America system of conducting industry. But even in America there are some men, such as Henry Ford, who believe in treating their employees with consideration. Henry Ford recognizes that, under modern conditions, men are merely cogs in a machine, and in order to give them some respite from their monotonous occupation, he works them only five days out of the seven. The book from which I quote is called <inline font-style="italic">An Australian Looks at America</inline> by Hugh Grant Adam, associate editor of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> He states - </para>

                    <para>Useful evidence as to whether the present industrial prosperity of America is due to the practice of a new principle of co-operation between labour and capital should be found in the figures showing the division of national income among the people of the country. If there is co-operation in earning, there must surely be co-operation in payment, or it is not co-operation at all. I take the latest figures published by the Bureau of Internal Revenue in Washington. An analysis of these figures shows that the increased revenue of the last twelve months has increased the number of captains of industry who have an annual income of  fi  ,000,000 or more  from  three to seven. It has added 9,000 to the number of near-rich whose income is over £10,000 a year, and it has put one-sixth of all the taxable income of the nation into the hands of 30,295 people. In other words, the increase of industrial prosperity has led to a greater concentration of wealth in the hands of a few. This does not afford much evidence of increased cooperation between capital and labour, as  shown  by the distribution of profits. </para>
                    <para>However, I mistrust conclusions based on statistics, even when those conclusions are my own. Let us get right down to specific cases. If the spirit of co-operation is a big working factor in American industry, I should have found it, for I did not go about America with my eyes shut and my ears closed. I spent my days in visiting factories, and my evenings in talking with employers and employees. The only sort of co-operation I found was the sort of co-operation that was established between the tiger and the young lady from Riga when they returned from that famous ride. You will remember that the young lady from Riga was inside the tiger. </para>
                    <para>The argument I heard was, " Co-operation between labour and capital makes the country industrially prosperous. America is industrially prosperous. Therefore America has cooperation between labour and capital!" America is enjoying many of the conditions that might be expected to result from the enthusiastic co-operation of labour in the business of profit-making. Labour works hard, at great speed, and for long hours. It does so because the pace is set by the employers, and it has no alternative but to keep up that pace or get out. That is the extent to which labour co-operates with capital in America. This cooperation has been brought about by the weak position of the individual worker in the absence of labour organization. </para>

                <para>It is not true that industrial unrest has been more rife in Australia than in other countries, nor is is true that more time has been lost through labour troubles in recent years than in previous times. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Year-Book</inline> publishes a graph which shows the comparative amount of unemployment for the last five years as compared with previous years, and it may be seen from this that from 1921 up to the present time unemployment as the result of labour troubles has been less than during any previous period.

                </continue>
                <para>I am prepared to admit that this clause is somewhat modified in its effect by the amendment moved by the Attorney-General. Without that amendment it would have been neither more nor less than the placing of dynamite under the citadel of Labour. I do not think there has ever been an industrial upheaval in Australia so severe as the maritime strike in the 90's, and the disturbances which followed it. We do not want to return to the conditions which brought that trouble about. On the whole, we have reason to be proud of the way in which the Australian workers have comported themselves. While there has undoubtedly been an industrial disturbance now and then, the great majority of the workers have been going on peacefully with their jobs day after day. It is wrong to say that the Australian workers, as a body, are guilty of go-slow tactics, and of not doing the fair thing by their employers. The present condition of Australian industry is a glowing tribute to the efficiency of the Australian workers. Conditions in this country are probably as good as anywhere in the world, but we should not be content with being merely as good as other people; we ought to be better. </para>
                <para>This bill will not make for industrial peace. No man can put his foot on the neck of an Australian workman without that workman resenting it in the most unmistakable manner. 'The other day the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> who, by the way, would do better if he made his speeches in this Parliament instead of to the Women's National League, referred to the provision in this bill for a secret ballot. He said that he would not only give votes to the workmen, but to their wives as well. My experience is that when there is any industrial trouble, the womenfolk are the last to give in. Although they suffer most, they are by no means the first to yield. Some of the provisions in this bill are altogether too harsh. </para>
                <para>Clauses which impose fines and imprisonment are not  reconciliable  with conciliation provisions. The two things are contradictory. The one is the welding of the big stick, the other is the holding out of the olive branch. The Registrar of the Arbitration Court could give some information to members of this Parliament as to what has been done by conciliation in the direction of maintaining peace in industry. Thousands of men are  working  under agreements which have been registered in the Arbitration Court, and which were arrived at simply by meetings between the representatives of employers and employees. I do not like this clause, nor the bill as a whole. Some of the clauses have been introduced at the suggestion of the trades union, and they naturally meet with our approval. But some drastic clauses to which we object very strongly have been already passed. The Government will never succeed in bringing about industrial peace by a measure of this kind. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot allow the proposed section to pass without voicing my opposition to it, and trying to get from the Attorney-General some explanation of what is meant by the direction to the court to consider when making an award its probable economic effect in relation to the community in general, and upon the industry or industries concerned. It is true that he has moved ari amendment which excludes " the practice of the court in fixing the basic wage " from the scope of such an investigation; but I am not so much concerned about the practice as about the basic wage itself. How will it be affected by this proposed section? Section 25 of the act reads - ' </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In the hearing and determination of every industrial dispute, and in exercising any duties or powers under or by virtue of this act, the court or the Chief Judge shall act according to equity, good conscience, and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms, and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform its or his mind on any matter in such manner as it or he thinks just. </para>
                <para class="block">In my opinion that section gives to the court all the power it needs to investigate the position of any industry in regard to which it is asked to adjudicate. It is told to act. according to equity, good conscience, and <inline font-style="italic">tha</inline> substantial merits of the case. To the earlier additions to that section no serious objection can be offered; they no doubt are born of experience, but the proposed section now before us is in a different category. As soon as the bill was circulated honorable members on this side of the chamber recognized this as a dangerous provision directed against the basic wage. The Attorney-General has said that the proviso he has moved will preserve the basic wage; but I am afraid that, in practice, the court will be influenced by the direction given in the earlier part of the proposed section now before us. I regard this as a deliberate attack upon the wages, hours, and standard of living of the workers. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> admitted that he does not approve of the present method of fixing the basic wage.  His  statement that it would be preferable that three men should each receive two-thirds of the basic wage rather than that two should receive the full amount and one be unemployed, is founded on false reasoning, because if the basic wage were reduced to two-thirds of the present amount two men would still be doing the work on that basis, and the third would remain unemployed. The only gain would be to the employer, who would be getting the same amount of labour for two-thirds of the present cost. The honorable member also questioned the fixation of the basic wage on the basis of a family of five. The court was asked to fix the wage upon the most just and equitable basis, and it is too late to attempt to alter the practice in the direction of depriving the workers of any benefits they now enjoy. I do not say that some alteration may not be necessary if a national insurance scheme is brought into operation, but nothing may be done which will take from the worker that to which he is entitled in the judgment of the court acting according to equity and good conscience under section 25. If the proposed section is put into operation for the purpose of breaking down the workers' conditions in that way there will be more industrial unrest than at present. Organizations will refuse to register under the act, and will depend upon their strength to win what they want by direct action. I have tried to imagine the considerations which would weigh with the court when studying the probable economic effects of its awards. I can imagine it being asked by the employers to have regard to the capital invested in the industry, overhead charges of every description, holidays, superannuation, workers' compensation, and so on. The workers will naturally object to these factors being taken into account by the court when fixing the remuneration to which they are entitled for their labour. I hope that the court will maintain the standards that have already been set up, but I fear the results of this proposed section. I am not satisfied with the benefits that accrue from the act even in its present form. I contend that the worker who makes an indispensable contribution to industry is entitled to a little profit from his labour over and above the bare cost of living. Every man who invests his capital in industry does so with the object of drawing out dividends. The average wage paid is the basic wage, and the man has to be exceptionally skilful if he is to receive a higher payment. </para>

I spent seventeen years of my life working in a factory, and I had practical knowledge of the conditions that obtained. When I began I worked a 56-hour week, I never received one penny in overtime, and every holiday that I had was at my own expense. My worst period of the year was Christmas time, because I was always in debt after the enforced holidays. When my boss heard that I was connected with politics he would have been pleased to shift me with his boot, but I anticipated him and left before he had the opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable member wants to get back to them. After I had been seventeen years in that factory I received only 39s a week - and I was a married man. I was not a dud, because I was shifted from the factory to the warehouse, and even at this moment I could take up my tools and work with any man in the industry. I was doing the best class of work in the shop. Whenever a new line was introduced it was my job to finish the first dozen, and the price was fixed on my time. I weighed the material and did the whole job. After I left that man had a strike, which lasted for one week, and he went down on his bended knees and asked for that which he had hitherto opposed, a wages board. When that wages board made its first award it fixed the wage at £2 12s. 6d. a week, for the job that I had received 39s. To-day men doing the same job received £5 2s. 6d. That man had apprentices who were bound to him for five years. At the end of their third year they were put on half piecework, and were paid half the rate that the piece-work men were paid, for the same job. Being young and vigorous - and foolish - some of those apprentices turned out more work than the journeymen, and were paid only half their rates. </para>

                        <para>- I know the system well. I have seen men go to work in the middle of the week, and, by superhuman efforts, still draw a full week's wages at the end of the week. The boss would then make every endeavour to cut their wages down. He would take a rivet out of the handle or door of portable washing coppers and cut a couple of shillings off that job. I do not wish to pillory any particular industry; but I have personal knowledge of the one of which I speak. I know that in a boot factory, the rates paid to clickers, heelers,  solers  and upper fixers are cut down until the men have to go as quickly as the automatic machine, otherwise they are not wanted. If a boot employee should " kill " a boot while it is in the machine that boot has to be raffled amongst the employees, as the employer will not bear the loss. Frequently our coal miners are abused for having put the darg in operation. Actually they set themselves a task which is a fair thing both for the employer and the employee. Yet they are charged with practising job control. The employer for whom I worked for so long employed a great number of boys, who were given a task and told that they could go home when it was finished. Some of them would get away at half-past three to four in the afternoon, after passing through a physically exhausting process. At that time none of the machines was protected, and should a piece of tin jam in one, the boy, in order not to waste time, would put in his hand to free it, without stopping the machine, and off would go a finger. Almost every week boys were taken to the hospital, permanently  mained  because of the operation of that vicious system of payment by results. That employer had a standing advertisement for boys in the newspaper. Honorable members should keep those facts in mind when advocating that pernicious system. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that interjection. I am told that the auctioneers earn more for selling the wool these days than all the men earn who shear the sheep. A shearer receives 40s. for shearing 100 sheep. The sheep yield, on the average, 8 lb. of wool each. The wool sells, on the average, at ls. 6d. per lb. On a selling commission of 5 per cent., the auctioneers would, therefore, get £3, as against a shearer's £2. I think that substantiates my statement. </para>

                    <para>.- It is not necessary for me to debate this clause at length in order to make my position clear. The Attorney-General said that he had been in consultation with trade union representatives in the preparation of this bill, and that they made  a number of suggestions. Very few of those suggestions have been adopted. One was that the Attorney-General should eliminate from the act the provision permitting lawyers to appear in the Arbitration Court in any circumstances. It is generally agreed that their appearance in the court adds to the cost of arbitration. Frequently they introduce into industrial questions legal issues that really do not touch the merits of the case in question at all. We should have been content to allow the section to stand and would not have objected to lawyers appearing with the consent of both parties; but this clause provides that they may appear by leave of the court or by consent of all the parties. We take strong exception to this proposed amendment of the section. We believe that arbitration proceedings should be removed as far as possible from all legal technicalities, and that those who appear before the court should not have to incur unnecessary expense. With all due respect to members of the legal profession, I say that whenever they are briefed in a case their appearance adds to the cost and very often delays the hearing. There is nothing in the cases that come before the Arbitration Court to call for the assistance of trained legal minds. As a rule the court deals only with questions of fact, and the representatives of the employers and the employees, being conversant with all phases of the industry concerned, are able to state their position with perfect clarity. The representative of the employer is a man selected from the particular industry that is appearing before the court, either as a claimant or a respondent, and the representative of the union has a full knowledge of his industry. It is true that certain lawyers are specialists in arbitration procedure, but they are not specialists in a particular industry, and therefore they must be briefed by the parties in the case. Representatives of employers and union representatives may not be able to place the facts before the court as logically as a trained legal man would do, but they can state them clearly enough to enable the judge to decide on the evidence. The trade union movement desires the Arbitration Court to be freed of all legal atmosphere. Under exist ing conditions lawyers may appear only by the consent of both parties, and I think they are entitled to be heard whenever there is a claim for a variation or an interpretation of an award. As a matter of fact, the suggestion was made to the Attorney-General to so amend this clause as to provide that the consent of both parties should be obtained before lawyers could appear in any case whether it concerned an original award, a new award, a variation of an award, or an interpretation of an award; but instead of that this clause opens the door wider for the admission of lawyers into cases. We, therefore, take exception to the provision, and shall vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.- Clauses 17, 25, and 26 all deal substantially with the same subject-matter, and have relation to Federal awards, State awards and State laws. Clause 29 provides for conferences between judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and State industrial authorities, and clause 32 requires the Commonwealth Court to consider whether any matter before it would better be dealt with by that court or by a. State tribunal. Clauses 29 and 32, therefore, are designed to secure that the Commonwealth Court shall, before taking any action to deal with a dispute, consider, if thought desirable, in conference with the State tribunals, whether it is a matter which should be handled on a Federal or a State basis. One of the difficulties in Australia to-day in industrial regulation is the duplication and overlapping of awards, and these two provisions, together with those which we are immediately discussing, are designed to reduce that overlapping and duplication to a minimum. The application of clauses 29 and 32 should ensure that the Commonwealth Court shall deal only with matters which, in its opinion, should be dealt with by it upon a federal basis, and not by the separate States upon the basis of facts relating to each of them separately. That being so, the group of clauses that is now before the committee provides for the supremacy of Federal awards in cases with which the Commonwealth Court deals after having taken into consideration the matters to which I have referred. One of the most important things to obtain in Australia to-day is to secure as far as possible a single source of industrial regulation. If there is only one tribunal dealing with an industry both employers and employees know where they are; but if there are several tribunals ' making awards or determination in an industry, then chaos and misunderstanding arise. These sections are in part a redraft of existing provisions of the act. Clause 17, for example, is a redraft of section 20, which was intended to provide for what clause 17 provides. This section sets out that if it appears to the court that any State industrial authority is dealing, or is about to deal, with an industrial dispute, the court may, in the prescribed manner, direct that authority not to deal with the dispute, and thereupon that authority shall cease to proceed in the matter of the dispute, which shall be dealt with by the court. That is the existing law. The section, however, applies to an industrial dispute, and that means an interstate industrial dispute, according to the definition in section 4 of the act. A State court never does deal with the whole of an interstate industrial  dispute, and, therefore, to meet the position, the words, " or with part of an industrial dispute" have been put into the proposed new section, Further, the existing section relates directly only to a dispute, and not to a matter in which an award has been made. Accordingly, the clause  provides that when a State industrial authority is dealing with a matter which has been dealt with in an award of the Federal court, the Federal court shall have power to prevent the State industrial authority from proceeding further in that matter, on the principle that there should be one rule - a single source of industrial regulation - for each industry. </para>

                <para>All attempts to arrive at a political division in the Federal and State industrial spheres have failed. Various attempts have been made at Premiers' Conferences and by referenda in the past, and it has been impossible to arrive at any subdivision of industries between the Commonwealth and the States for the purpose of industrial regulation. The only method of dealing with this subject, unless either the Commonwealth or the States completely abandon the' field, is to  encourage provisions such as these, indicating to the court that it should particularly consider whether a matter should be dealt with federally, before it deals with it at all, and that once it is in the hands of the Federal court it ought to stay there. There should be no other authority dealing with the matters to which the award refers. That also applies to clause 17. There, again, it is provided that the Federal court may direct the State court not to deal with that matter. The history of the relations between Federal and State awards is quite interesting. I do not propose at this hour to delay the committee by going fully into it. There has been a very acute controversy on this subject in the courts, and the views and contentions of the parties to industry have changed in accordance with what they have conceived to be their interests from time to time. In the year 1909, the High Court decided, in what is known as the Whybrow case, that if a State award was inconsistent with a Federal award, then the Federal award prevailed, and the State award was void to the extent of the inconsistency. With the particular test of inconsistency there laid down, I need not trouble the committee. It was further decided in the Whybrow case in 1909, that if there was inconsistency between a Federal award and a State law, then the State law prevailed. In 1926, however, in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Clyde Engineering Company</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Cowburn,</inline> generally known as the 44-hours case, Whybrow's case was reconsidered, and the rule was then laid down that if a State law was inconsistent with a Federal award, then the State law had to go by the board. It was also held that if a State law dealt with the same matter as a Federal award, but in a different manner, there was an inconsistency between the State law and the Federal award. Clause 17 and clause 26, which is now before the committee, are a legislative recognition of the principles laid down in the cases to which I have referred. They are based upon the principle that if we are to have a Federal Arbitration Court making awards in interstate disputes, then these awards must be the rule of law in each of the States to which the interstate dispute extends. If - any other rule is adopted there may be a Federal award made for four States, and the State Parliaments or State industrial tribunals may independently operate by cutting out little bits, or adding little bits, in the four several States. Any action on those lines is the sure way to confusion, expense, duplication, and general loss, and the infliction of unnecessary and artificial burdens on industry. These new sections, accordingly, lay down the rule that, while care must be taken in determining whether a Federal award shall or shall not be made in a particular dispute, when that Federal award is made it shall be supreme. But how is the ordinary citizen - the employer or the employee - to find out whether, in the eye of the law, the awards are inconsistent, or deal with the same matter? Up to the present time the only means of ascertaining that has been by some one becoming either the willing or unwilling victim of a  prosecution  and finding out what is right and what is wrong after a prosecution in the police court and a review by another tribunal. Clause 26, however, provides a procedure whereby any person interested can obtain an authoritative ruling from the Arbitration Court as to whether he is bound by the Federal or by the State rule. It introduces the proposed new section 30a in these terms - </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It is considered that the State authority should have the opportunity to argue the matter before the Federal court. Accordingly notice must be given to the State Attorney-General of any application under the section. It is desired to omit the proposed new subsection 3 because, upon a further consideration of similar provisions in other acts, and indeed in another section of this act, it Was thought undesirable to give even the appearance of an attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to deprive any person of the right to contend, in any proceedings in which that person was concerned that the State law or award was valid. I hope I have made it clear that these provisions are all part of a system, the object of which is to remove instances of overlapping and duplication and to ensure that there shall be one rule instead of several rules, or - what is almost as bad - the uncertainty which at present exists as to whether there are or are not several rules.

                    <para>.- The four clauses which have been enumerated by the Attorney-General are remarkable in that they set out to do certain things, and then go no further. Clause 17 takes the power to order State authorities to desist from dealing with a case that is either being dealt with or is about to be dealt with by the Federal court. That court, however, merely makes the order, and there leaves the matter. I do not know for what reason the section has been dropped which provided that, having ordered a State authority to desist, the Federal court should then proceed to deal with that matter itself. Although it may prevent a State from dealing with any matter, there is no guarantee that the Federal court itself will take it up. </para>

                        <para>- The section to which I refer provided that the court should deal with the matter. Four principles are involved in the four clauses; and the Attorney-General has used to its fullest extent his capacity as a lawyer to catch the State authorities both coming and going. It would appear that he, his advisers, or his urgers, have in mind the necessity to deal in a friendly manner with a friendly government or with the industrial authority of a friendly government. Clause 17 apparently deals with the industrial authority of a hostile government. Section 20 of the principal act, which is repealed by clause 17 of the bill, was embodied in the arbitration law for a certain purpose ; but because of the howl for uniformity, and for the elimination of duality and overlapping of awards, by employers throughout Australia, the Attorney-General has introduced this new provision. First of all he lays down definitely what a State authority shall or shall not deal with. Then clause 25 makes certain something which already is obvious, by giving it legislative expression. That which has already been laid down in such a manner that no protest has been evoked is made articulate in the bill. There is no doubt that Federal awards and laws prevail over those of the States. Clause 26 introduces an entirely new provision. I can imagine the legal fraternity licking its chops in an anticipatory fashion because of the invitation which is being broadcast to the employers of Australia. A man who employs only ten persons in a small, obscure factory, established for the purpose of manufacturing dolls' eyes, glass paper, or something of that description, can approach the Federal court, and, so long as the industry is interstate in character, that court must make the declaration which is sought. There are very few industries that are confined within the boundaries of any one State. The Attorney-General went a step further in this clause; but, apparently as an afterthought - either of his own volition or because of the prompting of other people - decided that it -was just a little too brutal and that the wind should be tempered to the shorn lamb. Therefore, it was magnanimously agreed that the Attorney-General of the State against which the action was being taken must be given 28 days' notice of the intention to apply to the Federal court for a declaration that the matter which the State had dealt with, either by legislation or through its industrial legislation, was invalid, under section 30a of the Commonwealth act. But as there might be some State industrial authorities under the control of Tory governments, there is a fourth prong to thi3 pitchfork; Clause 29 enables the  judges of the Federal Arbitration Court to confer with a State authority. They can have quite an amicable yarn together and decide what is to be done with the parties who will come along - whether their cases shall be heard by the Federal court or by a State authority. Although the matter in dispute may be interstate in character, an arrangement may be made between the Federal judges and the State authorities which will prevent a union from having its case heard by the court to which it is entitled to go. These four principles which I have mentioned have been lying dormant in the Federal Arbitration Act, but they have been given fresh life by the Attorney-General and his advisers in order to make one last endeavour to eliminate the overlapping of awards. I think that the federal law should prevail. Most of us agree with the principle for which the Labour party stands, that of the supremacy of the Federal Parliament in all matters; but I must enter my protest when I find that discrimination is to be made between one State authority and another. The recent Labour Government in New South Wales, against the wishes of certain employers, set up an authority presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington.</inline> It was probably one of the factors which led to the re-clothing with more verbiage of the provisions of the Commonwealth act that I have mentioned. And it is just possible that certain recent happenings in South Australia may have some bearing on clause 29, which gives the Federal arbitration judges power to confer with a State industrial authority. I am extremely doubtful of the ethics of catching the States coming or going, as the case may be. It may be pleaded that every possible avenue should be explored in the desire to bring about industrial peace, but I am distrustful of these provisions. </para>

                        <para>- No; but if the employers and employees generally in an industry are content to continue under the State industrial authorities, why should it be possible for a small minority engaged in that industry to take the whole of that industry, whether it likes it or not, into the Federal Court? Where an industry is" working amicably under an award, I think it should be allowed to continue working under that award. Ultimately, I believe, the whole of the industrial legislation of the Commonwealth and all its industrial courts will be under the control of the Commonwealth Parliament, but until that can be brought about some power must be left to the States to carry on the work which ultimately we desire to have transferred to the Commonwealth. This Parliament has not legislated in many directions covered by State legislation. Queensland and New South Wales have their Hut Accommodation Act and their Rural Accommodation Act. It would be a very easy matter for the pastoralists of Australia to submit to the Federal Arbitration Court a plaint touching lightly on accommodation ; and under the provisions of clause 26, immediately the Federal Court took cognizance of it, all the legislation of the New South Wales and Queensland Parliaments dealing with accommodation for shearers and rural workers would be altered. Is it fair that, although the Commonwealth Parliament lacks the power to legislate in regard to a particular matter, it can, through the Federal Arbitration Court, prevent the States from enforcing their legislation in regard to it? Upon action taken under clause 26 it is quite possible for certain conditions to be laid down in a Federal award which come into conflict with the factory legislation of the various States, and all State legislation that is in conflict and inconsistent with that award, is immediately superseded. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that it was expensive, but under this clause irresponsible persons are given power which I do not think they should possess. I agree that every person should have certain rights, but this is an invitation to individuals who may be carrying on an obscure business in one State, but have a branch in another, to upset not only State awards, but the industrial legislation of the State itself. The Factories Acts passed by the various States might be affected by such a clause as this. Take, for instance, the Scaffolding Acts, which have been passed by the State legislatures, and the regulations for the safeguarding of machinery which have been built up gradually over a long number of years. When a case comes before the Federal Arbitration Court dealing with conditions for labourers on buildings, or those engaged on the construction of water conservation and irrigation works, this clause would enable the whole thing to be thrown into the melting-pot, even those matters which have been previously settled by State legislation. The Attorney-General, and members on that side of the chamber, virtually say to the employers and employees, " Go to it," and if they accept the invitation there is going to be endless litigation, which will result in industrial chaos. I am entirely opposed to these four clauses. I shall not ask the Attorney-General to withdraw them, because I know quite well that such an appeal would be useless, since they are the result of propaganda which has been carried on for some time and which is in the new provisions which it is proposed to insert in the bill. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause which it is now proposed to pass, and which, in one form or another, has found expression in previous legislation, originates in that wise provision in the Constitution, which lays it down that whenever the laws of a State are inconsistent with the laws of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former, to the extent of their inconsistency, be invalid. Most people applauded that provision when it was made part of the Constitution, and they possibly also applauded, as I did, the judgment of the High Court, which asserted the superiority of a Federal award over an inconsistent State law. In other words, in the Glyde Engineering case it adopted a new reading of the law as laid down in Whybrows' case. I point out, nevertheless, that the Federal principle involved the concurrent rights of legislation in the Commonwealth and in the States. That has led to a certain amount of what is known colloquially as overlapping. This overlapping has become, to some extent, a bug-bear in the minds of honorable members opposite. </para>

More than once he has stood for the local power of the States to govern themselves and legislate freely, and has resisted the encroachment of the Commonwealth Parliament upon State powers. I mention that, not because I am in agreement with those who may be grouped together as State-righters. I have always advocated strongly the granting of full Commonwealth powers. When the last referendum was before the people I had to face some severe criticism from many people, including some of my own political friends in certain of the States, for what I conceived to be my consistent stand in regard to the extension of Commonwealth powers. I still stand for them. May I place on record in the presence of the Attorney-General what the existing law provides for? Section  20  of the principal act reads - </para>

                <para class="block">My concern is with the addition " or deals with any matter dealt with in ". It does not follow that because the Federal court has dealt with a matter, it has dealt with it finally and exhaustively to the exclusion of a State Parliament or a tribunal created by a State Parliament which might conceivably give attention to a phase of the matter not dealt with or only partially dealt with by the Commonwealth Court. Surely it is a rather drastic action to oust the State jurisdiction because the matter with which it wishes to deal has been already dealt with in an award or order or determination of the Federal court. It is curious that I should have to urge this view upon almost empty benches opposite. </para>

For my part, I stand for the concurrent rights of the States and local autonomy while the present federal system stands just as I believe absolutely in the superior rights of the Commonwealth when there is a clear conflict between the two jurisdictions.

Although I strongly support the paramount right of the Commonwealth in its own domain, and have advocated an extension of the Commonwealth power, I say that the Federal system of legislating must at present be concurrent with that of the States. I believe in the exercise of local government by local authorities, whose power shall be concurrent with that of the Commonwealth authority, except when the two are in absolute conflict. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has expressed his antagonism to the clause, and I am inclined to agree with him. The existing case law, founded upon the Constitution, is sufficiently definite to assert the paramount right of the Commonwealth in the event of overlapping and the Attorney-General is now trespassing dangerously upon the concurrent right of the State to legislate upon a matter of local concern of which it may have special knowledge, and with which the Commonwealth may not have dealt effectively or, at any rate, not exhaustively. </para>

                    <para>. - The questions raised by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> are important and warrant the attention of the committee. I shall explain briefly the reason for proposing to insert in section 30 the words " or deals with any matter dealt with in ". Under that section varying decisions have been given by the High Court. Different opinions have been expressed as to the meaning of the word " inconsistency ". In Whybrow's  case three judges supported one view and were opposed by the opinions of two other judges. In the latest authority on the meaning of the word - the decision of the Full High Court in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Clyde Engineer- . ing Works</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Cowburn</inline> - five judges took another view of " inconsistency," and two judges dissented. "With the word "inconsistency" left standing by itself in the proposed section, without any attempt to clarify the law and express the intention of the legislature, the position is that we have two varying decisions of the High Court - one, three to two, and the other five to two - upon the meaning of the word " inconsistency " itself. "With that position it is the responsibility of the committee to deal. I put . it to the committee that it is unsatisfactory, when we are dealing with the bill, to leave the law in that state. It is for that reason that it is now proposed to adopt what is in substance the view of the majority of the judges in the later case, by providing that where a Federal award deals with a matter which is also dealt with by a State award, and there is inconsistency, the Federal award shall prevail. I answer the very relevant remark of the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> by inviting his particular attention to the words " in relation to the matter dealt with." It is only so far as the two awards deal with the same thing in a different way that the Federal award is given supremacy. The honorable member will admit that no difficulty arises if they both deal with it in the same manner. But the honorable member puts this point: The Federal award may not deal with the matter exhaustively. There may be other aspects which are dealt with by the State award. And he suggests that it is surely wrong to provide that because a Federal award deals with aspects A, B, and C, of the matter a State award should be invalid in relation to aspects A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. I do not regard the section as producing that effect. The words of the section will be - </para>

                        <para>- These difficulties are bound to arise when trying to draw a line between competing rules within the same area. They arise at present in a very difficult form because the only criterion is that of " inconsistency," and the meaning of that word has been differently defined in the decisions that exist at present. The phraseology adopted in the proposed section is in line with the majority decision in the latest case, and I suggest that the answer that I have given to the honorable member for Batman meets the case. I agree that the application of the principles necessitates very careful analysis. The question cannot <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> evaded, and these questions must arise so long as there are two sources of law in relation to industrial matters in Australia. The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> cannot solve the problem by in a sense professing that it does not or ought not to exist. These difficulties do exist. Either this Parliament is going to leave the matter as it is without making any endeavour to clarify the position or it is going to lay down a definite rule. </para>

                    <para>.- I have no wish to interpose at this late hour in such an interesting discussion between two legal luminaries, because I am quite satisfied that they have converted themselves each to the other's way of thinking. But they have not solved the problem facing the industrial world. I instance the problem which beset the pastoral industry about two years ago, when the award was being revised. The Federal court, that is said to transcend all the State court awards, made an award for 39s. a 100 for shearing. The State court in New South Wales dealt with the matter subsequently, and granted an award of. 45s. Of course, the shearers shore at the State award rate. And how helpless was the Federal court, that trans.cends the State court, to make its award operative! Why should courts be set up to fix wages and determine conditions if the men are to be allowed subsequently to take the law into their own hands? In the case to which I have referred there was no strike. The men simply determined that they would accept the Stat* award. </para>

                    <para>.- The case to which the honorable member for Wannon has referred simply proves that the minimum wage fixed by the courts does not always become the maximum. When tradesmen in a certain calling are scarce, they can command more than the wage fixed by the court. I wish to make it quite clear that the Labour party stands for the Federal court having complete power. We say that Commonwealth awards should prevail, but that power should be delegated in certain circumstances to the State courts. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Batman expressed the view of the Labour party on this subject. I do not pretend that I am able at the moment to deal with every aspect of the subject. We stand for the federal court prevailing but we claim that that is provided for under the existing law. If there is difficulty in the mind of the judges as to the meaning of the word " inconsistency " we might clear that up. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that it goes a great deal further than that. It must be remembered that there are State laws affecting industry other than those which fix wages. There is, for instance, the Shearers' Hut Accommodation Act, ' various mining acts, and so on. I am afraid that if this provision is agreed to it may place it within the power of the Commonwealth Court to render some or all of those State measures inoperative. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Legislation of this description cuts both ways. I agree that if a reactionary State government passed legislation detrimental te the workers it would be possible, if this provision were enacted, to veto it. I submit, however, that the existing provisions are sufficient to meet the needs of the case in that respect. I advise honorable members opposite who are strong advocates of State rights, to think carer fully before they vote for this provision; otherwise they may do a great deal to interfere with the sovereign rights of "the States. I am not an advocate of State rights in the sense that some honorable members opposite are. I have always maintained that as we have adopted the Federal system, we should make the Federal Parliament supreme, and delegate to the States such -powers as we deem advisable. But if this provision is agreed to, the Arbitration Court may invalidate important State legislation which is not covered, or only partly covered by Federal enactments. The Commonwealth Court might, in the hearing of a claim, refuse certain requests of the employees which are already granted in State awards, and hold that by refusing the claims, it has dealt with them, and so is justified in over-riding the State legislation. It must be remembered that the ideas of men are progressive. Many things are provided in current arbitration awards which were not thought of years ago. I believe that in the last shearers' award the Commonwealth Court directed that certain utensils should be provided. Such a thing would not have been dreamt of years ago. </para>
