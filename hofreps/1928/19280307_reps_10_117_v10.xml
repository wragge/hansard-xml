                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Buchanan was invited to Australia by the Commonwealth Government to report upon the harbours and ports of the Northern Territory, and his services were made available to the individual States. He reported upon various ports and harbours, but no action has been taken by the State authorities upon his report. I have communicated with- them, asking whether they desire a conference or the taking of other steps to obtain co-operation between them and the Commonwealth in the development of the ports and harbours of the Commonwealth. </para>

It is a matter of serious importance, and as the time at our disposal today under the Standing Orders  -  1¾ hours - would not enable us to discuss it adequately, I ask leave to withdraw my motion. </para>

The subject of the motion of the honorable member for Ballarat is also the subject of motion No. 3 on the notice-paper for to-morrow, and as it is one of very great interest to honorable members, I propose to move when it is called on that the time for the discussion of the motion be so extended as to allow a full discussion. The proceedings, however, will be in the hands of honorable members themselves. I do not wish the House to be under the 'impression that I, as Leader of the Government, have been trying to dictate what time shall be taken in the discussion of this subject on private members' day. </para>

                        <para>- This matter has received consideration. Complete action by the Commonwealth could only be effective in co-operation with the States, as large quantities of firearms are already in the country and control of their use is entirely a State matter.- The honorable member's previous representations on this subject have not been unheeded, and recently two importations of dangerous weapons have been refused admission and sent back to the country of origin. One of these consisted of a pocket knife attached to a barrel and so constructed as to throw chloroform and temporarily disable the person aimed at. The other was a shipment of powerful air pistols, which threw a leaden slug and which the New South Wales Police Department considered a very dangerous weapon. Action in these cases was taken under the proclamation prohibiting the importation of dangerous weapons. </para>

                    <para class="block">United Kingdom manufacturers use combings and low-grade wools for making felt hats, and in the past purchased their requirements in the market where they could obtain the cheapest wool, no matter where it came from, and it is presumed that these manufacturers will still continue to purchase wool in the cheapest market irrespective of origin. The cry of detriment to the Australian wool-growers has apparently been raised to obscure the real issue, which is an endeavour on the part of certain British manufacturers to be allowed to use in the manufacture of their hats foreign materials of a class or kind which can be obtained in England, and to obtain entrance of their products into Australia under the British preferential tariff. One large English company, whose Australian representative was formerly very active in this matter, has advised the Customs Department that it has found a source of supply of suitable trimmings in the United Kingdom, and the department has knowledge of other United Kingdom manufacturers who are using United Kingdom trimmings in the manufacture of hats, and are thus able to comply with the law relating to British preference. </para>

                        - No such decision has been given by the Customs Department, nor is the matter governed by a regulation. The action taken by that department in regard to Australian wool is in accordance with section 151a of the Customs Act 1901- 1925. Paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of that section prescribes that goods which are not wholly manufactured in the United Kingdom from United Kingdom materials and/or listed raw materials must have not less than 75 per cent. of their factory or works' cost consist of United Kingdom labour and/or material. The present difficulty has arisen regarding wool felt hats, and could be readily overcome by all United Kingdom hat manufacturers using United Kingdom trimmings. Some of them are actually doing so and qualifying for preference. Under these circumstances, it is not proposed to amend the act. This matter has been more fully dealt with in a reply made to-day to the honorable member for Brisbane.

The aim of the Government is to secure expert advice and opinion on matters connected with trade between the United Kingdom and Australia and on developmental projects in Australia in which the two countries might co-operate. The investment of capital from outside Australia is a necessity if we are to achieve that measure of development which we all hope for.It is considered that, apart from the other advantages to be derived from consultation between the delegation and Commonwealth and State authorities, including the Development and Migration Commission, and Australian business men, the knowledge obtained by the individuals comprising the delegation will be of immense value in educating public opinion in Great Britain and must re-act favorably for Australia. It is felt that in the circumstances the question of the ability of Australians to undertake this work does not arise. </para>

                            <para>The object of the Commission was to place before public servants the position as it actually exists. The Commission has an extensive programme of works to carry out, hut its financial resources are limited. It is, therefore, undesirable that the large sum of money invested in cottage construction should remain locked up indefinitely, and this could be avoided if officers, who are permanently stationed in the Capital City, would, as speedly as practicable, become owners of houses instead of continuing as tenants. </para>

The intimation by the Government was that it did not desire any public servant to suffer financial loss caused by or due to his transfer to Canberra, that it would, therefore, arrange for the formulation of a scheme to deal with the question of the disposal of the Melbourne homes of public servants, and with the question of obtaining homes for them at Canberra, and also that it had under consideration the making of regulations to govern the transfer to Canberra of the families and effects of public servants. In all those respects, the Government made provision for the protection of public servants against loss. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am now in a position to inform him that I have been advised by the Federal Capital Commission that an arrangement has been made whereby a private motor vehicle registered in the Territory may pass freely throughout the State of New South Wales at any time, provided that the driver is a bona fide resident of, and is licensed in, the Territory, and that he has properly affixed to his vehicle the official number plates issued in the Territory. This concession does not extend to commercial motor vehicles, for which a special arrangement, involving the payment of fees, has been brought into force by the State authorities. It has been decided to make reciprocal arrangements, and the Federal Capital Commission has suspended temporarily the provisions of section 26 of the Motor Traffic Ordinance so that all New South Wales licensed drivers and registered private motor vehicles may pass freely throughout the Territory while the licence and certificate of registration issued in New South Wales are still in force. Consideration is now being given by the commission to the question of proposing an amendment of section 26 of the ordinance to remove the necessity for drivers of private motor vehicles to obtain visiting number plates and to report to the commission upon entry into the Territory. I may add that further efforts will be made to effect reciprocal arrangements with the other States. </para>

                    <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report, viz.: - Sydney - Erection of School of Public Health. </para>

                <para class="block">In accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Health, which reported to the Commonwealth Government in 1925, it is proposed to establish at the Sydney, University a School of Public Health. The reasons for which the school is considered desirable are :  - (1) The absence of any properly equipped adequate training school in Australia for graduates specializing in public health; (2) the fact that the Australian Institute of Tropical Medicine, which is located at Townsville, has an insufficient supply of clinical material and is so far away that it is very difficult to send officers there for training; and (3) it is essential that all medical men appointed to any of the tropical dependencies of the Commonwealth should have a proper training in tropical medicine. Because of distance and lack of clinical material, this is somewhat difficult at Townsville. Sydney is the natural base and, because of the shipping constantly coming from tropical areas, there is actually more clinical material at Sydney than at Townsville. The considerations rendering the establishment of such a school urgently necessary are the rapid developments in the field of public health, the fact that it is now necessary for graduates to proceed to England to obtain proper training in public health, and the very great need for a proper scientific centra in Australia for tropical medicine, especially having regard to Australia's tropical possessions. The arrangement proposed is that the Commonwealth Government shall erect, equip, and maintain the school on a site as close to the ordinary Medical School as the University can find practicable. The site which the building is intended to occupy is a prominent one in the University group close to the Physics School lately erected. Simple brick and plaster construction to harmonize with the Physics School will be employed, and the building will be partly two, and partly three storeys high, with tiled roof. The estimated cost is £30,000. I lay upon the table plans and papers relating to the project. </para>

                <para>.- Whilst I agree that the proposed school is essential to the health of the Australian people, I think the House is entitled to know approximately what will be the annual liability of the Commonwealth, which I assume will be required to defray all costs, as I understand that the Sydney University's responsibility ceases with the provision of the site. What will be the outlay on equipment, and the annual cost of salaries and general maintenance ? </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed to spend £30,000 in erecting a School of Health in as close association with the Sydney University as possible. I wish to know . whether the Sydney University authorities have undertaken to provide the Commonwealth with a site for this institution, how it will be staffed, and what will be the total annual expenditure by the Commonwealth? I am not opposing the motion, but I think that the House should know what arrangements have been made in connexion with the erection of a new School of Health. </para>

                <para>.- I should like to have further information regarding the erection of the School of Health, and more particularly its administration. Is the Health Department to administer it as it does the school established at Townsville, which I venture to say would have been a success had it functioned under any other administration than that of the Health Department, with its hide bound and impossible regulations. I freely admit that a school of health would serve a wonderful purpose if conducted on right lines, and possibly in Sydney, where better clinical material and staff would be obtainable than perhaps in the North of Queensland. I should like to know whether the Sydney University or the Department will control the school, or whether for that purpose, an independent body consisting of men with a knowledge of public health and its application to tropical diseases, will be constituted. </para>

I feel sure that the reports of the Public Works Committee are looked upon by honorable members as very important documents and are read by them with great interest. It will be the committee's responsibility to investigate thoroughly each of the aspects that the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has mentioned and to present its report to the House. There will then be ample time to examine the evidence, and if the reference is recommended the Minister for Works and Railways must ask for the approval of Parliament before the work can be proceeded with. I think that honorable members will be wise to leave this reference in the hands of the committee. </para>

                    <para>[4.9]. - It has been recognized for some time that some training school is needed in Australia for the study of tropical diseases, and the Sydney University has consented to give us a very fine site upon which to erect a school for this purpose for medical students from all over Australia. In England it was found impossible to make even London, the seat of a -school for the study of tropical diseases. The needed clinical material was not available there, and the school was eventually established at Liverpool. The British Government is responsible for that institution, but certain schools and hospitals bear a proportion of the expense. That institute ;is now the finest school in the world for the study of tropical medicine. We hope at the school proposed to be established at Sydney to train not only medical men but also inspectors of health. It is absurd to send men with no knowledge of health matters at all to the tropics to demonstrate to the inhabitants the value of specific health instruction, and it is therefore intended in future not to allow medical men to act as health officer nor to allow inspectors of health to be appointed to work in the tropical portions of Australia unless they have qualified at the School of Health. The expenses of. maintaining the institution and its staff will be borne by the Federal Government. We are fortunate indeed in having obtained such a magnificent site close to. the Sydney University It is probable that members of the staff of the University will be voluntary teachers at the School of Health. It has been recognized for some time that the tropical school pf medicine at Townsville, although it ha* served its purpose in the past, is not now meeting our requirements. From the statistics available it is evident that the clinical material available at Sydney is greatly in excess of that available at Townsville, and as the Townsville school is not suitable for the carrying out of the enlarged programme that is intended, we propose the establishment of a new school at Sydney. As the honorable member for Lilley has said, the Public Works Committee will obtain all the evidence necessary to determine whether the erection of the school is a reasonable proposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I shall give briefly the'? history of this financial provision. When federation took place it was generally, recognized that the States had to depend largely for revenue upon customs and excise receipts, and the States, to safeguard themselves, be-, fore entering  into  federation insisted upon some provision which would protect their finances. In consequence, provision was made in the Constitution - section 87, known as the Braddon blot - whereby three-quarters of the customs and excise revenue should be paid to them. Provision was also made under ^ section 94 for the payment of all" surplus revenues to the States, plainly indicating that at the inception of federation the States .were very cautious concerning the financial provisions of the Constitution. The Braddon blot operated for ten years, and at the end of that period it was open to this Parliament to make other financial arrangements with the States. During that time many public men in the Federal sphere were endeavouring to arrive at some financial arrangement which would be satisfactory both to the Commonwealth and the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, when Treasurer in 1905, proposed that the Commonwealth should take over State debts, but beyond suggesting an equitable adjustment, he gave no practical solution of the problem. In 1908, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne proposed at a Premiers' Conference that a council of finance should be appointed  to control borrowing  and that a sinking fund  should  be established for State  and  Commonwealth debts." He also proposed that Parliament should make in perpetuity a grant towards interest and loans, and £ per cent, sinking fund, on future loans to be met  by  the Commonwealth Government. The  Premiers  of the States re-  fused to accept the proposal. They wanted a fixed annual sum and a proportion of the increase in customs and excise revenue. A conference was held in March, 1909, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> then Prime Minister, attended, together with the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> then said that he had no proposals to make on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, that he was there by invitation. But after a discussion he stated that in his opinion there should be some arrangement made whereby the Federal Government could take over State debts and thus permit of one borrowing authority. Nothing tangible resulted from that conference. The States wished to retain the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 25s. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> went out of office shortly afterwards. A further conference took place in Melbourne, at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> then Premier of New South Wales, occupied the chair. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was Prime Minister at the time. After considerable discussion it was decided that the Commonwealth should continue the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 25s. to the States,' and that it should be embodied in the Constitution. The proposal was referred to the people by referendum in 1910 but was rejected by them, wisely, I think, because they did not wish to tie the hands of this Parliament, in view of the possibility of the Commonwealth having to take over the responsibilities of the States. Subsequently the Surplus Revenue Act was passed, providing for the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 25s. to the States, which was recently withdrawn. That, briefly, is the history of the matter up to the present time. </para>

                    </continue><para>In 1926, at a premiers' conference, the Government suggested the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and the States rejected the proposal. It will be remembered that the Treasurer advocated that the Commonwealth should evacuate the field of direct taxation, leaving it almost exclusively to the States; that the Commonwealth should relinquish the whole of the land tax, 40 per cent, of the income tax, the entertainments tax, and the probate duties. The Treasurer was insistent that it was essential that that be done. He condemned the system  of two taxing authorities. Much discussion took place, and the Treasurer issued his ultimatum to the State Premiers. It certainly was an ultimatum, because the Government took upon itself to lay down conditions which it said the States must accept. ' Failing their acceptance, the States were to be deprived of the benefits of the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Act. It was evident at that stage that a deliberate attempt had been made by the Government to compel the States to come to some new arrangement. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yes. But on that occasion the States were given no option. What was the result? The States rejected the proposal, and rightly so, because it meant, in effect, that every State government would be compelled to double its taxation. No government, whether Nationalist or Labour, could do that and continue in office ; the first time it appealed to the people it would be defeated." Could one imagine a State Treasurer . raising the whole of his taxes by means of direct imposts without his government receiving an unfavorable answer at the election. The people would not be concerned whether the increased taxes comprised Commonwealth and State dues. They would notice that additional taxes were being imposed by the State government, and it would become highly unpopular. The States recognized that fact, and refused to accept the Commonwealth proposals. Keen controversy occurred in this Parliament, and the matter was widely discussed in the press throughout the country. Little support was found for the Government's proposals, notwithstanding the fact that the Treasurer, in introducing the States Grants Bill on 4th June,. 1926, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at page 2677, referred to- </para>

I have drawn attention to views voiced by honorable members opposite to show that the Government's own supporters were absolutely against its proposals at that time. The result of the discussion in this House was a hurried caucus . meeting of the ministerial party. The Government was obviously placed in a most difficult position, having practically a majority of its own followers objecting to its proposals. At that meeting, the Prime Minister appeased the wrath of his followers by suggesting that, if the measure were allowed to pass the second-reading stage, effect would not be given to it until such time as a further conference had been held with the States. A compromise was arrived at, providing that another proposal should be submitted to the States, and that is virtually the proposal contained in the present agreement. My point is that, under pressure from its own supporters, the Government was compelled to retreat from the position that it had assumed. It had to save its face, as far as possible, and, therefore, it assured its supporters that a further conference would be held, thereby preventing interference with the States' receipt of the equivalent of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant. The Government told its supporters that they could rest assured that some scheme would be formulated that would probably be acceptable to the States. A further conference was held in June and July of last year, and the proposals now embodied in the bill were put forward. They are altogether different  from those formerly submitted to the House, which were opposed not only by the honorable members to whom I have referred, but also by the whole of the newspapers that usually support the Government. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Quite so. The new proposals were brought before the State Premiers in conference, and they accepted the revised agreement. I believe that they were very astute men. They knew that they were being offered something worth having, and they readily accepted it. The Government was compelled, owing to its foolish action in the first place, to offer something that would be beneficial to the States over a given period. It had to extricate itself from the position in which it had been placed owing to its own bungling. The present agreement provides that 5s. per £100 shall be paid into a sinking fund on account of all new State debts. This means that, if the agreement is ratified, the Commonwealth will have io provide half the amount paid into the sinking fund for all future State debts. </para>

The average increase of the States' debts over the four-year period, 1921-25 was £32,000,000, but I shall take it as £30,000,000, in order to have round numbers. The total payment that the Commonwealth Government would have to make into a sinking fund to meet new State debts for a period of 30 years would, therefore, be £34,875,000. That statement is based on the assumption that the States continue to borrow at a rate like that at which they borrowed during the years 1921 to 1925. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- It allows for an increasing amount. The Commonwealth Government would also .pay a fixed contribution of £7,585,000 for a period of 30 years, making a total of £227,550,000. It 'would also contribute 2s. 6d. per £100 to a sinking fund for the whole of the existing State debts, amounting to £801,0.00 per annum, and to £24,030,000 in 30 years. The Commonwealth Government would further pay, in 'increased interest on transferred properties, £163,865 per  annum,  or £4,915,950 in 30 years. The total payments by the Commonwealth under the new scheme, for the period of 30 years, would be £291,370,950. The average increase  of  population per annum in Australia is approximately 130,000. This would involve steadily increasing payments to the States by the Commonwealth if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system were continued. The total increase 'in <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments for 30 years, by reason of the increase in population, would be £75,362,500. The present <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments-i <inline font-style="italic">'</inline> amount to £7,735,000, which, over a period of 30 years, would mean a payment by the Commonwealth to the States. of £232,050,000. The total payments for 30 years under the present <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system, taking into consideration the anticipated increased population, would amount to £307,412,500. The following tables will give a comparison of the payments for which the Commonwealth would be liable under both schemes, at the end of different periods : - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has anticipated my remarks. My tables show that, over an extended period, the Commonwealth Government will derive benefit, but that over periods up to, but not including: twenty years, the State Governments will benefit to a greater extent than they do to-day. I have no doubt that that is what has influenced the State Premiers, particularly as this Government has repealed the Surplus Revenue Act, and the States are practically at the mercy of the Commonwealth Government. It is not customary for Parliaments, either Commonwealth or State, to look for a long way ahead ; five or six years seems to suffice, and for a short period the proposed scheme no doubt has attractiveness for the States. </para>

Those who have held the reins of government in the Commonwealth sphere have always appreciated the necessity for making provision to enable the Commonwealth Government,  if  necessary, to take over any big financial responsibility from the States. If the States are relieved of huge financial advantages and  responsibilities,  it is a natural corollary that adequate provision must be made to cover the future financing of these by the Commonwealth. An agreement such as is now proposed ties the hands  of  the Commonwealth Government because to alter it after it had once been put into the Constitution would require an amendment of the Constitution. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The people would not have much say in the matter. If the amendment of the Constitution were not agreed to, this proposal would be null and void at the end of two years, and the States would have their payments cut off, because the Surplus Revenue Act has been repealed. That would leave them entirely in the hands of whatever Commonwealth Government happened to be in power, which would be unjust. As was stated by the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> the action this Government has taken is like putting the cart before the horse. Had the Treasurer not rushed in with this legislation, we should have been able to discuss the situation adequately, and arrive at a suitable conclusion. It is to be regretted that honorable members opposite, the majority of whom do not see eye to eye with the Treasurer as to this scheme, did not take action in caucus to have the proposal delayed until some amicable agreement could be arrived at with the States. If we are to continue the tradition of "One people, one destiny," we must settle these affairs amicably. It was not intended, when federation was instituted, to interfere with the finances of the States in this fashion. I pay a tribute to the State Premiers, who are very clever men. The . Commonwealth Government took the first trick in this game by repealing existing legislation and holding a bludgeon over the States, but the States took the next trick and compelled the Commonwealth Government to grant something much better than was originally offered. For some considerable time many honorable members opposite have endeavoured to whittle  away the financial advantages of the States. The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> when Treasurer, made a proposal that the payment to the States should be reduced by 2/6 yearly, until the grant reached a minimum of 10s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Other honorable members opposite have held similar views, so that the State Premiers are to be congratulated on having obtained something considerably better than was originally offered to them. </para>

                            <para>- Everybody can put his own interpretation on it. I believe that we should view the matter, not from a party, but from a national stand-point. We should endeavour to solve this important problem in a way which will do justice both to the Commonwealth and to the States. I have indicated plainly that in my opinion this agreement constitutes a good bargain for the States. It may not apply equitably all through, but I am speaking in general terms, and I am convinced that it will be of benefit. The right honorable gentleman, in his last policy speech, stated that an inquiry would be held into child endowment, and he left the impression with the electors - whether he intended to do so or not - that the Government was prepared to bring in a child endowment scheme. We have also to face the question of unemployment insurance. There is no escape from it. Also, we must have widows' pensions. We cannot have widows'" pensions in one State and not in another ; the system must be made uniform. If the right honorable gentleman carries his promises into effect regarding child endowment, it does not matter what scheme is adopted, it will cost a great deal of money. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman said that he would have an inquiry made, and the inference was that if there was a report in favour of a child endowment scheme, such a scheme would be introduced. Child endowment would costa great deal of money, and if we relieve the States of the cost, we ourselves could not carry out such a policy under the present proposals.We are giving too much away. We have to rely chiefly on the customs and excise for our revenue. If we are to have an effective protective policy, the revenue from these sources will fall year by year. Revenue has gone down considerably during the last eight months. If we lose revenue from customs and excise we must make it up somewhere else, and we shall have to pay more for the next fifteen' or twenty years than we are paying now. It is necessary that we should be seised of the seriousness of the position. It is a problem we must face irrespective of party interests, and we must remember that the State Governmentshave equal rights with the Federal Government. We must also remember that we are all one people, and that whatever taxation is imposed, or whoever imposes it, the money comes ultimately out of the pockets of the people. </para>

I believe that the establishment of such a council is a very desirable thing. With other honorable members on both sides of the House, I have advocated that there should be only one borrowing authority in Australia. I have stated that the practice of six States and the Commonwealth all borrowing in the same market was injurious to the people, inasmuch as it meant competition amongst ourselves, and an increase in the rate of interest. Because of that I have pledged my word to the people, not only in this House, but also outside, that Iwouldsupport any proposal for the establishment of a single borrowing authority.This measure provides for such an authority, and that has the effect of breaking down much of my opposition to other portions of it. It must be patent to all that great benefit will be derived by Australia from having only one borrowing authority. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- It has to be borne . out by experience it is true, but I think it will be found that we shall get better terms when only one authority is operating. on the market than when there are seven. In regard to the, constitution of the council, however, I do not know whether there is sufficient protection afforded for the interests" df the Commonwealth. There is, I think, room for amendment when the bill gets to the committee stage. The measure provides for the establishment of a loan council, consisting of a Commonwealth Minister and six State ministers.. A majority forms a quorum for the  purpose of  agreeing on a borrowing policy. If. the members of the council fail to come to a unanimous decision, the matter will be determined by a majority vote. That is the point concerning which I :am in doubt. It is provided that the', Minister representing the Commonwealth shall have two votes and a casting vote; that is, there will be three Federal votes as  against  six State 'votes. Therefore, it is necessary to have at least two States with the Commonwealth in order to obtain &amp; majority for Federal proposals, even when the Federal representative exercises his casting vote. This means that the States can block any proposals of the Commonwealth regarding the amount to be borrowed. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer admits that the amount to be borrowed may be determined by a majority vote. The Premier of South Australia stated at the  conference that  the Loan Council would probably restrict the borrowing of the Commonwealth more than that of the States. The  Commonwealth  he said, was prepared to have loan expenditure reviewed by a council consisting mostly of 1 'State representatives. Personally, I do not contend that the Federal Government should have equal voting power with the States; but it. is clear that, under the present arrangement, the States will have control of our borrowing. From past experience it has been found that, in regard to any matter affecting themselves the States generally work together; so that they would be in a position to decide the borrowing policy of this country. </para>

Suppose it advocated that £5,000,000 should be borrowed, while the State representatives thought that £20,000,000 should be raised. They, by their votes, could decide that £20,000,000 should be borrowed. </para>

                            <para>- The time has arrived when we must be very careful in regard to our borrowing. I am not against borrowing for reproductive works, but there has been altogether too much borrowing in the past, and that has done much to bring about the difficult position in which we find ourselves to-day. There has been too much borrowing overseas when, we should have been borrowing on the local market. At the present time we owe £1,000,000,000. The amount of our indebtedness is constantly increasing, notwithstanding the fact that we have established sinking funds. Although we have' these sinking funds we are still borrowing much faster than we are reducing our' indebtedness, so that the debt is constantly piling up. This  enormous  and growing debt has, I believe, much to do with our present adverse trade balance. Even for the six months- of the present- year we have an adverse trade balance of over £9,000,000. </para>

For instance, the agreement is made binding for a period of 58 years. Are we justified, as public men, in tying the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament for 58 years ? Supposing that after fifteen or twenty years we find that this scheme is unworkable, that it is unjust to the Commonwealth, and we desire to effect an alteration, it will be impossible to do so unless with the mutual consent of all the parties. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I should not wish to be a party to any proposal for amending the Constitution for the purpose of breaking an agreement into which we had entered. If we were to go to the people with such a proposal, I believe that they would turn it down. The people of Australia have too much- honour to do a thing of that kind. We are at the present time considering possible amendments to the Constitution. The Prime Minister informed us some time ago that we were to have a constitutional session last year. In place of that there was a commission appointed for the purpose of going into the subject. I submit that here again we have put the cart before the horse. What is the use of appointing men at considerable cost to the country to make exhaustive inquiries into our Constitution if we now enter into an agreement which ties the hands of this Parliament for 58 years ahead? What can a commission do regarding the amendment of the Constitution unless it takes the financial position of the Commonwealth into consideration ? Is that not the keynote of everything? If we agree to this part of the Government's proposals we shall undoubtedly make impossible of acceptance for at least 58 years any financial recommendations that the commission may make. Surely we will not tie our hands in that fashion! If the Government did not intend even to consider the recommendation of the royal commission it was guilty of a wilful waste of public money in appointing it. We should have had a constitutional session to deal with these matters. Everybody knows that the adoption of federation hinged upon the drafting of a satisfactory financial scheme. If the. commission recommends that certain powers should be transferred from the States to the Commonwealth .j tl </para>

                            <para>- If we take over child endowment, the payment of widows' pensions, any scheme of unemployment insurance, or the whole system of industrial arbitration, it is quite clear that we shall be committed to a far heavier expenditure than that which we have to meet at present. To that extent the States will be relieved, but the commitments of the Commonwealth Government will be seriously increased. Supply we ought to await the commission's report before we tie our hands. Professor R. C. Mills, Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the Sydney University, - has suggested in evidence before the  Constitution  Commission that any re-arrangement of financial relations should be made for a term of only ten years. It is remarkable that most public men seem to favour a period of ten years in which to try out any. new scheme of financial relations. </para>

Surely we shall not put ourselves in an even worse position by hastily determining this matter. If this scheme is approved an amendment of the Constitution will be necessary. Would it not be far better, therefore, to defer action on this single issue until we are able to give full consideration of every aspect of constitutional reform which will be brought under our notice in the report of the Royal Commission? We shall act intelligently if we hold our hands' at this stage, and do not make a decision which might bind the nation in regard to its financial relation with the States for the next 58 years. Let us leave it an open question. If we do not intend to take any notice of the reports of the royal commissions which are appointed, we should abandon the policy of appointing them.

                        <para>.- The bill now under consideration is the outcome of one of the most successful financial conferences held since federation. I congratulate the Prime- Minister not only upon the result of the conference, but also upon the manner in which he has fulfilled the promises .he made to this House when the States Grants Bill was before it. The press in most of the cities of Australia has made approving comments on the outcome of the 'conference.  and the State Premiers have also expressed themselves as well pleased with what was done about it. It is true that a prominent newspaper in the electoral division which I represent accused me, after I had explained the intention of the States Grants Bill, of having sold Tasmania. I replied that, if I had done so, it was at a very satisfactory figure. A. condition precedent to the acceptance of an agreement of this description was the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. </para>

During the debate in 1909, it was suggested that the expanding efforts towards nationhood demanded an alteration in the federal interest. The only income which the Federal Parliament had then was the indirect revenue through customs, and the States were concerned as to what their position would be after the ten-years period, during which they would be receiving from the Commonwealth a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 25s.

JACKSON. - I. am not criticizing either the honorable member or the protectionist policy; I am merely trying to recall what were the thoughts of  honorable  members of this Parliament in 1909 in regard to the future financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Throughout that debate there was a feeling of absolute uncertainty as to the ability of the Commonwealth to continue the payment of \: 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States after the expiry of the ten-years period.

                            <para>- That was unnecessary. It is clear that members of the Federal  Parliament  were convinced in 1909 that the Commonwealth was not obliged to make any payments to the States after 1910. '.The present right honorable member ,for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had no doubts  about that, because he interjected when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was speaking, We are perfectly entitled to take the lot, and yet the Prime Minister calls this freedom !" He and the other members of the Labour party believed that it was possible for the Federal Parliament to retain the whole of the customs revenue, but an offer was made to pay to the States 25s. per head for a further ten years, and thereafter until this Parliament should otherwise provide. Some honorable members of this Parliament think that the time. to provide otherwise has now arrived; my own view is that the re-arrangement should have been made some time ago. I entered this Parliament at a time when the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> was suggesting the gradual reduction of the payments to the States until this liability was reduced to 10s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> and I said then, "Hands off the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments until some other arrangement is substituted. </para>

                            <para>- Because I think the Commonwealth should guard its finances jealously and yet be just to the States I favour the agreement which is now before the House. The debate in 1909 centred on the probable customs revenue, and it is well to note what proportion the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment bore to the total revenue of the States from their Customs before federation. In Western Australia it was 23 per cent.; New South Wales, 94 per cent.; Queensland 39 per cent.; Victoria, 63 per cent.; Tasmania, 44 per cent.; and South Australia, 69 per cent., or an average of a little more than 55 per cent. In the first eight years of federation, Western Australia received from the Commonwealth 81s. 3d. per head of its population, but if that State had been working under the same arrangement as the other States, the amount would have been 61s. per head as compared with 36s. each for New South Wales and Queensland; 32s. for Victoria; 31s. for South Australia, and 29s. 3d. for Tas' mania. Those figures indicate how serious to the States was the reduction of the payments, and also how much better they will fare under the agreement in this bill. ' In the first three years of the operation of the new arrangement the Fisher administration received about £8,000,000 additional revenue, made up by increased customs and the lesser payment to the States. The difference between the surplus revenue that would have been returned to the States, and the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> meant a loss to the States of nearly £2,000,000. From 1905 to 1908, customs revenue represented <inline font-style="italic">Ti</inline> per cent, and direct taxation 26 per cent, of the revenue of the States, and the proportions are. about the same to-day* <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, who then represented Flinders, Went to Considerable trouble in the i909 debate to prove that in new countries in which the population was increasing and development had to proceed, receipts from customs increased more per head than in older countries.

                    <para>Under the system of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments some of the States, Tasmania in particular, suffered more than others. Tasmania suffered through the customs leakage during the ten years' period, and as a result Parliament made it a grant of £900,000. In view of what has transpired since, it  is doubtful  whether that amount was- sufficient. That it has not been sufficient is shown by the fact that since then that' Sta'te has had to seek further assistance from this Parliament. New South Wales, under that arrangement, received in eight years about £9,500,000 more, than if she had been handling her own tariff on pre-federation lines. Under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system the large States received an advantage and the smaller States suffered a disadvantage. * This discrepancy cannot now obtain. During, the last few years the population of Tasmania has been drifting away through no fault of its own, although we have endeavoured, by the expenditure of public money, to forge ahead with a developmental policy. Unfortunately people., were not attracted to Tasmania, principally because of its separation from the mainland. We have had continual shipping trouble, and until transport is made absolutely certain Tasmania will continue more or less to be a financial drag upon this Parliament.

I heard the Premier of Tasmania, when opening a fair at a technical school in that State say that the Federal Government had treated Tasmania very well indeed in respect of the agreement, and that he had no cause for complaint. </para>

                            <para>--It will be all right for the States for 58 years, but supposing we arrive at the time when we shall have no money with which to meet our obligations, what can we do? We must either impose additional .taxation or ask the States to do it. There may come a time when we shall be forced to increase taxation or to re-enter other fields of taxation. It is all very well for honorable members to say that the States have been bludgeoned into accepting the agreement. The original proposal put before the States was disliked by them because the evacuation of the field of income taxation by the Federal Government would have thrown upon the State Governments the responsibility of imposing new taxation. One of the State Treasurers said that any government that did that would become very unpopular. The States do not mind if the Commonwealth becomes unpopular. However, a satisfactory arrangement has been made between the Commonwealth and the States. It is a good arrangement, and although not all that could be desired, is at least a long way in advance of any previous proposal. The present arrangement will ensure to the States an amount equivalent to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, which a previous Leader of the Labour party in this House said he would be prepared to ensure for all time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> when referring to the establishment of a loan council said that he did not think it would be necessary to alter the Constitution or to pass any act. He believed that the wisdom of the people would compel the States to float loans through a body set up by the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I wonder what he would say if he knew of some of the things that have taken place within the Labour movement. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> said that the Commonwealth could not stand a burden of £2 5s. a head outside of ordinary expenditure. We find that to-day invalid and old-age pensions amount to about 25s. a head. What I am most concerned about is whether we shall be able to continue the proposed arrangement. Will the customs revenue continue as at present ? Will there be savings in respect of loans, and, if so, will the Federal Treasurer have sufficient money with which to meet the sinking-fund payments to the States, which, after all, do not comprise a tremendous sum; at any rate, not as much as the Leader of the Opposition has contended ? Will the interest on war debts be reduced, irrespective of the saving that will be made by having one borrower instead of seven borrowers. Will the peak for war pensions be reached in 1931, as the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation has stated in this House on more than one occasion? Another most important question is whether the Commonwealth can afford the extravagant expenditure noticed in and around Canberra at the present time. The Government, will be faced in the near future with an insistent demand from lessess  in the Federal Capital Territory for a revaluation of their land. Without a revaluation I do not see how some of these lessees will be able to carry on. Already the owners of buildings have had to compromise with tenants by reducing their rents. If the expenditure on the Federal Capital continues at the present rate, it will make an inroad into the .revenue that will he Ward to withstand. On the other hand, I think that I am safe in assuming that the population of Australia will increase more rapidly in the next ten years than it has in the past decade. That should add to the revenue received through the customs, and, if necessary, the revenue duties could in some cases be slightly increased. Then, too, perhaps a saner industrial policy than that now in operation will be adopted. That would result in improved living conditions, and an increase in the number of taxpayers. </para>

                            <para>- I did not suggest that. I expressed the hope that a saner industrial policy would be adopted. Every effort should be made to have one taxing authority, and that preferably should be the Commonwealth. We could then obtain uniformity, and overcome the trouble now experienced in all the States in regard to the aggregation of incomes. Administrative savings, too, could be effected, and these should not be overlooked. Our concern should be for the general taxpayer, because, after all, he elects the Parliaments of both the States and the Commonwealth. The framers of the Constitution strove hard to induce the Federal and State Parliaments to work hand in hand. Unless my memory is at fault, a Labour conference was held in Perth, at which it was proposed to withdraw the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and use the money for the socialistic schemes of the Labour party. </para>

                    <para class="block">Tasmania is paying .into a sinking fund at the rate of 1 per cent.; but this, under the agreement, is reduced to 7s. 6d. per cent., to which, the Commonwealth will contribute 2s. 6d., Tasmania gaining thereby about £69,000. That will be satisfactory if the savings in regard to the sinking fund of any of the States are used for the reduction of taxation rather than as .a lever for floating further loans for works that may mot- be of a reproductive character. From Tasmania's point of view, the present agreement is much better than the old <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> arrangement, and the fact that the Labour Premier of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> is satisfied with it is sufficient to remove any doubt I may have had about it. He and his cabinet wish this Parliament to pass the bill so that we can go to the people at the next election and support the embodiment of the agreement in the Constitution. In spite of press cri'ticism, the people of Tasmania, generally, appreciate what this Parliament has done for them: The Government's proposals are quite generous, and, as I have said at the outset, they give effect to what the Prime Minister assured the House was the intention of his Government when they were submitted. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes nearly 40 years ago said that he was prepared to trust to the good faith of the Federal Parliament. This financial problem has not yet been solved; but, under this bill we are going a long way towards its solution. I trust that the House in its wisdom will pass the measure, and give the people an opportunity to say at the next election that the present agreement between the Commonwealth and the States shall become part and parcel of the Constitution. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> said that the Parliament might have to break its bargain. Well, we have tried several times to secure an alteration of the Constitution; but there is no suggestion of breaking a bargain. The Constitution belongs to the people. They alone  can make and unmake it. Surely we can trust the people, just as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes was prepared to trust the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>,- It has been w,ell said.. -that .this' is' probably one of the most important bills that has 'ever come before' the Parliament. It is important not only because it alters the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, but also because it will indirectly change the whole of the political machinery of the Commonwealth. Therefore, the measure is one to which honorable members must give weighty consideration. It should be thoroughly dissected, because the final issue whether the agreement is to be accepted will rest with the people themselves when the referendum is taken. If the people are to vote intelligently on a complicated matter of this description, it is necessary that it should be discussed from every point of view. In order to understand the change proposed to be made, we should compare this agreement with the financial arrangement that it is supposed to displace. "We recall that the object of the original plan, which was embodied in the Constitution under the Federal pact, was to allay fears that then stood in the way of the realization of federation. These were almost entirely due to anxiety on the part of the States as to what would be their ultimate financial position. All the delays that occurred in drawing up the Constitution were due to the difficulties in devising a scheme to make the States financially safe. It was necessary to have an arrangement that would provide some measure of financial stability. I am one of those who believe that one of the original promises made to the States has not been fulfilled. The real cause of the reluctance of the States to enter federation was the variation of opinion among the people as to whether a federal or unified system of government should be adopted. At that time, the overwhelming opinion was in favour of a federal system, and, so much so, that, in the consideration of a model for the Constitution, the Federal Convention decided to adopt the American system. But it was significant that a provision not found in the American system was also embodied, namely, that relating to the return to the States of surplus revenue. So anxious were the original contracting States as to their financial future that they insisted on putting that additional safeguard in the Constitution, and that was the final arrangement that brought about federation. The reluctance on the part of the States to give too great financial power to the Federal Parliament has often been stigmatized in opprobrious terms. It has often been said that federation was needed to get rid of the parochial and Little Australian attitude displayed on the part of the States; but I do not think that that was a fair accusation. One might as well say that a person was narrow-minded if he were not a socialist. If one's individualism is based on a desire for personal gain and greed, then he is very narrow-minded; but if it is due to a conviction that an individualist system of society is soundest and best, then he adopts npt a narrow but a broad view. If the States raised their objection to federation simply out of a petty desire for their own aggrandisement, they would have adopted a Little Australian attitude. There are, however, many people who think that the soundest policy, especially in a democracy, is that the government that has the spending of public money should be as close as possible to the people who have to raise it. They also believe that a sound system of control can be obtained only by a large proportion of a State's activities being directed by the State Parliament. If the objections of the States are based on arguments of that nature, they cannot rightly be called parochial, but must be accepted as being in the interests of Australia generally. That is the point of view that I adopt. If it be thought that I am over accentuating the State rights, I remind honorable members that I do not do so from a parochial point of view, in the desire to exalt the States over the Commonwealth, but because I believe that a judicious division of the State and Commonwealth activities must prove to be the soundest policy for Australia. If everything is concentrated, in the sphere of the Commonwealth Government, that government will become so unwieldy that a process of decentralization must inevitably follow. It is on that ground of sound political policy that I take my stand. We must consider whether this proposed scheme is likely to prove acceptable to the people of Australia when submitted to them; whether it is in their best interests; and whether we can conscientiously advise them to accept it. Perhaps public opinion has changed. It may be that to-day a system of unification is more acceptable to the people of Australia than it was 29 years ago. I do not think so. If such a scheme is to be introduced - although I believe it would prove objectionable - it should be introduced openly. It should be brought to light with all its ramifications. The whole machinery of the unificatory system should be laid bare for the examination of the public. They should be given the opportunity of saying whether, at this stage, they prefer to surrender the opinions they previously held with regard to federation. A system of unification should not be introduced by indirect means, as I believe is proposed in this bill. No easier way could be found to bring about unification than through the control of finance by the Commonwealth, such as is contemplated in this measure. Ever since federation the surplus revenue provision has been the chief obstacle in the path of those who desire to bring about the centralized control of Australian politics. Successive attempts have been made by different Federal Governments to rid themselves of that provision. I need refer only briefly to the Braddon clause, which returned three-quarters of the customs revenue to the States. It was distributed on a population basis, and, for a certain period, a special arrangement applied to Western Australia. Then we had the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> scheme also on a population basis. Now we have before use another proposal, granting less than did the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> scheme: first a fixed grant and then extra amounts to be paid to. the State Governments on the basis, not of earning capacity or of population, but of their debts. It seeks to introduce a very serious change in the financial relation of the Commonwealth and the States. The other schemes were at least based on the revenue-earning capacity of the people, and revenue was returned to those who contributed according to the population which contributed. That practice is to be abandoned. Any gratuitous help - though I believe the alleged gratuitous help to be entirely mythical - that will be granted by the Commonwealth, will be greatest to those States which borrow the most. The thrifty are to be penalized to assist the thriftless. </para>

                    <para>The proposals fall under three heads. First of all, there is the fixed payment for 58 years on the basis of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment for the year 1926-27. Secondly, there is' the contribution of 2s. 6d. to the sinking fund on existing debts, and the increased interest on transferred properties. These two items, I think, amount to £960,000 a year. Thirdly, there is the contribution of 5s. to the sinking fund of all future debts. I have had prepared for me by the Commonwealth Statistician a table making an exact comparison between the amount which each State will receive under this fixed payment for 58 years, and the amount which they would have received under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, making allowance for a uniform increase of population during that period. These figures are extremely interesting, and I propose to read them so that they may be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I shall read first the figures which show the payment at the rate of 25s. a head for 58 years, then the payment for 58 years if the subsidy specified in the agreement is continued ; and lastly, the difference in the amount which the States will receive. For New South Wales, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment would amount to £336,000,000. Under the proposal in this agreement, the corresponding payment would amount to £169,000,000, or a difference representing a loss to the State of New South Wales during that period of £167,000,000. Victoria would have received out of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments £190,000,000, but will receive under these proposals £123,000,000, representing a loss of £67,000,000. Queensland would have received £132,000,000, but will now receive £64,000,000, thus losing £68,000,000. South Australia would have received £72,000,000, but will now receive only £41,000,000, or £31,000,000 less. Western Australia would have received £73,000,000, but will now receive £27,500,000, thus losing £45,500,000. </para>
                    <para class="block">Tasmania would have received £20,000,000, but will now receive £15,500,000, representing a loss of £4,500,000. The total amount which would have been received by all the States under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system would have been £823,000,000; but the amount payable under these proposals will be £440,000,000, or £383,000,000 less during the period of the agreement. Reduced to a percentage basis, the losses of the various States work out as follows: - New South Wales, 50 per cent. ; Victoria, 35 per cent.; Queensland, 51 per cent.; South Australia, 43 per cent.; Western Australia, 62 per cent. ; Tasmania, 22 per cent. The three States which will suffer most are Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales, in that order; then Victoria and South Australia, and Tasmania last. Those huge losses and those figures represent the comparative position of the States under the old <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment system, and under the proposals which it is proposed to substitute. </para>

                            <para>- It does seem strange, and I am quite unable to account for it. I wish to make myself perfectly clear on this matter. In the statement I have submitted, I have simply taken the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments as compared with the fixed payments which it is proposed to substitute for them. The Treasurer, no doubt, will say that I am not taking all the payments into account, and that brings me to the second heading, the amount of the 2s. 6d. per cent, payment to the sinking fund, and the increased rate of interest on the valuation of the transferred properties. That amounts to about £960,000 a year, which is equivalent to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment on a population of 768,000. Under the normal rate of increase in Australia we should have that increase in five years. It is true that for five years the States will receive more than they would under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, to the extent of £960,000 in the first year; but the amount will be constantly diminishing, so that at the end of the five-year period, under normal circumstances, it will be wiped out by the increase in population. That means, therefore, that while the States will receive slightly more for five years, at the end of that period they will start off from scratch with the fixed payments. </para>

                            <para>- That is the third heading, and I shall deal with it presently. It is on the basis of these <inline font-style="italic">payments that it is</inline> alleged that the States will be better off under the new arrangements than under the system of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. Let me point out just to what extent they will be better off. They will be better off for a period of only five years, and not, as has been stated, for fifteen or twenty years. As compared with the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, that increase will be wiped off in five years' time. In other words, the decapitation of the States has not been abolished; it has been only postponed. There is only a reprieve, and meanwhile the condemned person is expected to eat a hearty breakfast. During those five years, on the supposition of an increase in population of 768,000, the Commonwealth Government will, on the basis of present revenue production, receive an increase in revenue of no less than <inline font-style="italic">£8,000,000</inline> in the last of those ' five years so that the sum of £960,000 paid this year, and the succeeding diminishing, amounts paid during the next four years, must be set off against the additional revenue of £8,000,000, which will be received in the fifth year. I come now to the third heading, under which the Commonwealth claims to be assisting the States, the contribution of 5s. per cent, to the sinking fund of all new debts. That is a rather mythical advantage. Let me ask who it is who really pays. The subject is referred to is if this money was paid out of the Commonwealth purse out of grace and goodwill to the States. I suggest that it will really be paid by the States themselves, and it comes about in this way. The interest on all State loans is taxed by the Commonwealth.  We know quite well that when the interest on' a loan is taxable, that fact affects the rate at which the loan can be floated. If a loan is being floated by the Commonwealth on behalf of the States, and it is known that the interest payable on the loan will be taxed by the Commonwealth, the rate which the State will have to pay for the loan will be determined by that fact. </para>

                            <para>- We are speaking now of what it is proposed to do under the Loan Council. The effect of this measure will be that loans for the Australian States will have to be paid for at a higher price. Either there will be a larger discount, or a heavier rate of interest will have to be be paid to compensate for the taxation of interest. To illustrate to honorable members how this scheme will operate, I have had three or four suppositious cases worked out. These indicate in round figures the contribution which will be made by the Commonwealth, and how it will effect returns from the loans. On an income of £746, derived from bond interests, the Commonwealth would receive in taxation £19 6s.11d., and contribute to the sinking fund £35 10s. The actual contribution would thus be not 5s. but 2s. 6d. On an income of £1,200 derived in the same way, the Commonwealth would collect £37 5s. in taxation, and contribute £2811s. 6d. to the sinking fund. It would thus show a gain of £811s. 6d. on the transaction. On an income of £5,000, the Commonwealth would collect in taxation £913, while it would contribute to the sinking fund £238, making a gain of £675 on the transaction. Let us for a moment look at the matter from the company tax aspect. Companies, as honorable members know, are larger contributors to loans and are taxed 1s. in the £1. They would therefore pay 5 per cent. in taxation, of which the Commonwealth would contribute only¼ per cent. to the sinking fund, thus making a gain of 4¾ per cent, on the transaction. </para>

                            <para>- That is perfectly true. A great deal will depend on the rate of interest that will be paid for the loans by the States, and that is governed largely by whether or not the money is subject to taxation. Indirectly, it will be found that the extra rate which the States will have to pay will largely compensate the Commonwealth Government for its sinking fund contribution. I submit that the three cases I have stated set out the relative position of the States and the Commonwealth under this agreement. It may be said that all the State Premiers have accepted these proposals, and that their action has been endorsed by every State Parliament except that of Western Australia ; but should that affect us very much in our consideration of the situation? Had the State Governments any real choice in the matter? I take it that as the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments have been taken away, they could only be restored by a referendum. The Commonwealth Government has given two main reasons for pressing its policy in respect of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. It has stated that these reimbursements to the States "were uncertain, foi the reason that any Commonwealth Government could at any time refuse to make them,, thus leaving the States- at the- mercy of the Commonwealth. T.oi show us that- this- statement of the ease was well founded it took away the payments itself.. The Premiers  were  thus in .a cleft stick. I can&gt; see several reasons why they agreed' to., accept this . proposal. They knew that for the first five years of the agreement their financial position would be eased. The shoe would not begin to pinch until after the expiration of that time, and- in- the ordinary course of. events they would not be personally concerned with' what happened after that. Their burdens would have shifted to other shoulders. </para>

                            <para>- I do not; but that was a reason that was mentioned, this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition, and it has some substance in it. Failure to accept the agreement would have forced the Premiers into a very difficult position. If they had rejected it they might have found themselves- without any money from the source from which they% were accustomed to receive the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. Probably they felt that even if they took the responsibility of accepting, the agreement they- would still have behind, them their parliaments, and the parliaments would have behind them a still more important body, the people of the Commonwealth. The proposal would need the sanction of the people at a referendum before it could become effective,, and the Premiers probably felt that if the scheme were placed before the people and rejected something better would be substituted for it. They were forced to make the best of a bad bargain. Another factor which may have had a bearing on the position is that five of the six States were controlled by Labour administrations. It is. well known that Labour policy is favorable to -the financial supremacy of the Commonwealth. The Labour . Premiers hold . unificationist ideals,, and they may have seen- in this scheme a way; to make some- progress to wards their goal. But I suggest that constitutional' alterations of such a character should be brought about in a regular manner. This scheme is not inconsistent with the unificationist, ideals of the Labour party.. It may be argued that the fact that Labour administrations were in power- in five; of the six States at the time the scheme was ratified is evidence that the people generally favour Labour's Federal financial policy. Such a contention would not impress me. State political parties rarely win an election on a big. federal- issue.. It is generally admitted that State elections turn on State issues. Consequently,. Labour supremacy in the State parliaments is not evidence that the people: generally favour Labour Federal, financial policy. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> probably realized,, like the other State Premiers, that for the next five: years. New South. Wales would be well off under the agreement, and he would not be greatly concerned with what might happen subsequently. He also- may have had in mind that: the people generally will have an opportunity to vote on the issue. The fact that the State governments have accepted the scheme does not absolve us from the duty of studying it carefully and forming our own opinions upon it. I submit that the adoption of the agreement will ultimately mean a heavy loss of revenue to the State. That will cause an increase in direct taxation by the State governments. Every government must of course bear the odium for imposing taxation, but I do not think that any government should be forced by a super-government to impose taxation which is not absolutely necessary. </para>

                    </continue><para>I wish to make a few observations at this stage  on the Loan Council. Our attention has frequently been drawn to the advantages of having such a body in existence. It has been said that it is economical to have . only one borrowing authority, and that the Commonwealth should be able to secure money at more advantageous terms than the States. We have been told time after time that when seven, borrowers are competing on the money market interest rates must necessarily be higher than would otherwise be the case. It must be admitted that our interest rates are not satisfactory. There appeared in the financial columns of the <inline font-style="italic">New York Herald Tribune,</inline> on the 24th October last a comparison of Australian and other credits. It showed that Australian 5 per cent, loans maturing in 1955-57 were selling at 97$, while Canadian 5 per cent, loans, maturing in 1952, were selling at 106$, or 9 per cent, better. On the same date, the Great Northern Company advertised an issue of 4£ per cent, bonds at £99, yielding 4.55 per cent., while we have to pay 5 per cent. The Federal Land Bank also advertised a 4 per cent, issue at par yielding 4 per cent. The same newspaper gave particulars on the 22nd October last of certain Ontario Province 4^ per cent, bonds, which were bought by brokers at 99.03 per cent., and re-offered the next day to the public at 100.25 per cent. It also stated that Canadian Dominion bonds were quoted on the basis of 4.4 per cent, to the investor. . </para><interjection>

In order to ascertain whether one borrower can obtain better terms than seven, let me give a comparison of the average rate of interest paid by the Commonwealth and the States in 1927.

There is a reasonable explanation of that fact, which also serves as criticism of the proposal to have one borrowing authority for the whole of Australia. If a large loan is placed on the London market, it may not be wholly absorbed. Trust funds becoming available' from time to time gradually accumulate on the market, and with an amount of money awaiting investment, a loan may be floated successfully. This clears off the accumulations, but funds begin to mount up again, and a further loan can be placed. If, during the year five or six loans synchronize with these accumulations, better terms can be obtained than if the whole of the requirements for the year are sought by one big application. </para><interjection>

As I understand the agreement the Loan Council will not interfere with the sovereign rights of the States to borrow. Therefore, if a State approaches the Loan Council with a borrowing programme, that body will not tell the State that it has no right to borrow so much. The procedure is that when all the States have stated their money requirements, the Loan Council determines how much the market can absorb. Only in that way does it limit the borrowing power of the States. If the Council goes upon the market and is unable to get the full amount for which the States have asked, the . money actually raised is divided between them on the basis of the previous five years' borrowing. But, by consent of the Council, individual States may go upon the money market. In other words, my contention that it is better for individual States to go upon the market at different intervals than for a Loan Council to apply for the whole requirements of Australia at once, is admitted in this agreement. </para><para class="block">Therefore, the only function of the Council is to determine the absorption power of the market. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- That may be true of the market price, but I am referring to the rate at which the loans are floated. The last three Commonwealth loans have been left .on the underwriters hands. We know that the proportion of the loan that is left in the hands of the underwriters is worked off a week or so later, when the market eases, at an improved rate. The Commonwealth, however, does not get an advantage from that. My argument relates to the actual receipts by the Commonwealth, and not to subsequent quotations upon the market. </para>

                    </continue><para>I desire to remind the House how the operations of the Loan Council will affect Western Australia, not because I wish to make a special case in regard to my own State, but solely because I know more about it than about other States. I ask honorable members to consider these facts in relation to their own States. Western Australia has to face a very great developmental problem, and a vigorous loan policy is necessary if the country is to go ahead with its small population. For some years it has been borrowing at an average rate of £3,500,000 per annum. That it has not been over-borrowing is clearly shown by the market rates for its loans/ which are lower than those of any other State. It is clear that the lender realizes that the money is being spent on general development. Suppose that Western Australia has to go upon the market upon the conditions determined by the Loan Council. If there is an  insufficiency of  money to meet the requirements of all 'the-j States and the ;Commonwealth, Western Australia will have to take ' its. proportion of the total net borrowings on the basis of its borrowing for the previous five years. ' If Western Australia is to get anything like the £3,500,000 a year which has been found necessary for its developmental programme, the Loan Council will have to borrow for the whole of Australia about £40,000,000 a year. Borrowing to that extent would be so excessive as to be quite improbable, and to limit the requirements of a particular State with urgent developmental problems by the requirements of the other States, is not fair. The effect of this policy will be to retard Western Australian development, although that State is now well able to raise on its own account, at reasonable rates, all the money necessary for its progress. </para><para>The argument has been advanced that these proposals should be accepted by the less developed States, because their needs can be met by special grants from the Commonwealth, and that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments having been withdrawn, the Commonwealth may from time to time make special grants to meet the requirements of particular States. The smaller States do not want charity, and such a system of doles would not be fair to the larger and more developed States. One expression used by the Prime Minister surprised me. He said that "he did not admit that the States, had any moral right to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, but if moral right were to be recognized, he considered that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments were wrong because they did not take from the rich to give to the poor. He said that he desired to deal justly and generously with the States, but the richer States are not likely to consider the treatment he proposed just and generous, and how could the poorer States be persuaded that they were being justly and generously dealt with in view of  the enormous losses to their revenues shown by the figures I have quoted. Surely we should not legislate on that principle. The representatives of the larger States have a perfect right to protect the interests of their constituents, and to use their voting power in this chamber to get for them a due proportion of the revenues, which are available. I do not reflect upon the representatives of other States, or question their desire for the development of other parts of Australia, but it is contrary to the experience of human nature to expect the representatives of large States to vote to the smaller States large grants to the detriment of their own constituencies. In politics everything is determined by votes, and any such proposed grants would be voted upon by members according to the interests of their consitituences. Therefore, the promise made by the Prime Minister is not only illusory, but unreasonable, and commonsense tells us that it is not to be relied upon. Let us have a just and proper distribution of the moneys available and not depend on illusory promises of this kind. The Prime Minister said that the States have no moral right to the surplus revenue, and expressed thankfulness that that claim had now been settled by the States Grants Bill. But justice and generosity can only be settled on a basis of moral rights. If there are no such rights, there can be no justice. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments were attacked because they were said to embody a vicious principle, in that one authority was raising money to be spent by another. That is not a proper statement of the case. There is but one set of taxpayers, and they determine how much of the revenue contributed by them shall be spent through the Federal branch of government, and how much through the State Government, </para><interjection>

In any case, the vicious principle which the Government denounced is to be embodied in this agreement for 58 years. The Prime Minister said that this agreement would not advantage the Commonwealth, but. that every proposal involved more money being paid by the Commonwealth than if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments were continued. I have given figures which show that in the 58 years in which the agreement will be current the Commonwealth will benefit to the extent of £383,000,000 or an average of over £6,500,000 per annum, How can it be said, therefore, that there is nothing in these proposals by which the Commonwealth will advantage itself? </para>

If that is desirable, let it be brought about in a proper way, but not in an irregular way through financial strangulation, as is now proposed.

I do not claim to be versed in the intricacies of high finance, as are perhaps other honorable members, but at the same time I ask this House to hesitate before it passes this bill lest a grave injustice be done. The Leader of the Opposition this afternoon counselled this House to move with caution, especially in view of the fact that a Constitutional Commission had been established to make inquiries throughout Australia, and to report upon constitutional questions. The action of the Government in introducing this measure at this juncture is premature and ill-advised. The Treasurer has on other occasions caused this Government considerable embarrassment. The amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition should secure the endorsement of all honorable members who desire to deal equitably with the States.

                    <para class="block">That amendment should certainly commend itself to every fair-minded member, no matter what party he represents. The Treasurer at the Premiers' Conference of 1926 endeavoured to secure the endorsement of State representatives to proposals that, if given effect, would have revolutionized the financial standing of the States as well as of the Commonwealth. His proposals met with decided hostility from the State representatives, the Australian press and the public generally. The Treasurer, recognizing that the State Premiers were adamant in their attitude, endeavoured to bring them to submission by introducing into this House last year legislation providing for the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments as from the 1st July, 192S.  His  object was to compel the States to accept some alternative proposal. The State Governments had no desire to depart from the system of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, although it was readily acknowledged that readjustments were necessary. They were quite satisfied with the principle, although the Prime Minister had stated that it was not an equitable scheme.

                        at least, was ready to declare that the proposals were not agreeable to New South Wales.  His  attitude was that, since this Parliament had repealed the legislation under which the

                        payments had been made, he felt that in the absence of some similar arrangement, the State finances would be brought to confusion because of uncertainty for the future. Therefore, he had to accept the  arrangement under protest.

                    <para class="block">Then followed a statement that I find it difficult to reconcile with his previous remarks. He went on to say that if the Government's proposals were adopted, the Commonwealth would have to pay £823,000 more to the States than would have had to be paid under the <inline font-style="italic">per. capita</inline> system. The suggestion was that the proposals were not advanced for the benefit of the Commonwealth, but, at the same time, we find that the States have no desire to accept them, preferring a continuance of the financial relations obtaining prior to the repeal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system. If the finances of Australia are not likely to be so flourishing in the .future as they have been in the past, how can the Commonwealth afford to give an extra £823,000 to the States? When a person thinks that fortune is not going to favour him he treads cautiously. It baffles me to know how the Prime Minister can say that there is a possibility of serious decline in Commonwealth revenue, and at the same time generously administer to the requirements of the States to the tune of £823,000 more. I had expected some honorable member opposite to remark - " What about your own Premier in South Australia? He agreed to the Commonwealth's proposals very readily." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler</inline> is of the same political complexion as the Prime Minister, and I fancy that there was a desire on his part to show a measure of political patronage when 'he -gave utterance to these words - -tol </para>

Under separate cover, I forward copy of the report of the committee appointed to report to the Government upon the disabilities arising out of federation suffered by South Australia. The report clearly states the case for South Australia, and summarizes the position by estimating that South Australia is entitled. to a grant of £750,000 per annum from the Commonwealth to compensate it for such disabilities. It is unnecessary for me to point out the importance of this matter to South Australia as a whole, and I have to invite your co-operation in giving the greatest publicity to South Australia's claim on all possible occasions. As a representative of South Australia in the Federal Parliament I feel sure you will give this matter your urgent attention, and that you will take every opportunity of bringing the claims of South Australia before the Federal Government, and also before the Federal Parliament generally. </para>

                    <para class="block">I  may  mention that in July, 1927, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler</inline> was in possession of the evidence of the South Australian Royal Commission, of which he himself was a member. In : the early part of 1927 it thoroughly investigated all the disabilities suffered by that State, and its report supported the contention that I am advancing in favour of South Australia. The present Premier was at that time Leader of the Opposition. The commission was instituted  at  the instance of the Hill Labour Government, who were alert  to  the disability suffered by South Australia and sought  to  remedy the matter. In July, 1927, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> as Premier, attended the Premiers' Conference, he did not say one word about the disabilities of his State; but on 11th January last he suddenly awoke to the fact that the loss suffered by his State under federation amounted  to"  £750,000 per annum'. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler</inline> has shown a lack of foresight and business acumen. If there was a moment when the position of South Australia  should have-  been made  clear to the Commonwealth, it  was at the  Premiers' Conference, when the new proposals were submitted. Although it is well to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler's</inline> belated admission of the financial disabilities of that State, at least two of the State Premiers pointed out at the conference that heavy increases in State taxation would be required. The New South Wales Premier intimated that an extra £1,000,000 would have to be raised from the taxpayers in his State, if the present proposals were accepted. In South Australia the people are paying heavy penalties for the lack of foresight shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler.</inline> Heavy imposts have been made by the State Government, and they are retrospective in regard to the income of last year. I very earnestly ask this House to institute inquiry and afford consideration to the present claim of South Australia for £750,000 for special disabilities suffered under federation. It . has been said that the new proposals submitted to the conference by the Prime Minister, and embodied in the present bill, will provide increased grants to the States over a period of from fifteen to twenty years, after which, for the further period stipulated in the agreement, the payments will gradually decrease, and will certainly be much less substantial than those made to the States at the present time. I do not contend that such an advantage to the States now exists, but I base my argument on the statements of honorable members opposite. If they be well-founded .and represent the correct angle from which to regard this problem, I am confident that posterity will view with considerable scorn the action now contemplated by this Government. It is proposed to introduce a scheme whereby future generations will be adversely affected. If that scheme had a uniform application throughout its life of 58 years, our political honour and .consistency could not be challenged, but it has not. After twenty years the States will receive a lesser income from the Commonwealth than they do at present. There should be a full investigation into the. potentialities of the proposed scheme. The  adjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States bodies has always presented difficulties, and we should pause before committing the people of Australia to an agreement which will operate for 58. years. An agreement with a maximum life of two decades should be the limit to which we should commit the people. The Commonwealth Government does not possess authority to enter into such an agreement without first obtaining the permission of the people. I agree with the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when he said last year - </para>

                    <para class="block">It cannot truthfully be contended that we have secured such an agreement or authority. I wonder how honorable members occupying Cabinet positions would like their own private financial affairs to be governed by conditions such as the Commonwealth Government now seeks to impose upon the States. I am confident that they would not, without a struggle, be prepared to permit any one to obtain an advantageous bargain from them, under duress. Honorable members should apply similar principles to their public life, wherein they are required to safeguard the welfare of others. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment's . should have continued until this Government received the permission of the people of Australia to alter the Constitution and provide for a different form of agreement with the States. -Until that is done this1 Government is not justified in committing the people to an endorsement of this agreement. Greater credit would have accrued to this Government had it first submitted the proposals to the people, and then, after securing the necessary authority, met the State Premiers and discussed matters in the endeavour to arrive at an amicable arrangement. That would have brought about a better understanding as to the future financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. Instead, the Commonwealth Government has taken a high-handed attitude, discontinued the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and forced a less attractive alternative on the States. I do not wish it to be, thought that I adopt merely a parochial State attitude. It is my desire that the Commonwealth Government shall possess the widest legislative powers, that it shall govern wisely and ' efficiently for the people of Australia, and that it shall work amicably with the States, entirely free from the many constitutional, difficulties that now confront it. This Government promised, when in Melbourne, that the first session in Canberra would be a constitutional session. It has failed to honour that promise. Such a session would have  afforded an excellent opportunity to bring the State Premiers of Australia into our counsels. Then those existing difficulties which are agitating our minds, and involving costly litigation, could have been reviewed and, perhaps, adjusted. In order to excuse itself for failing to keep its promise the Commonwealth Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into the Constitution. That commission is now obtaining valuable evidence as to the necessity for an alteration of the Constitution. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> reminded this House that it is quite possible that the action now contemplated by the Commonwealth Government will very seriously embarrass its deliberations in the future when considering recommendations emanating from the proceedings of that commission. "Whilst I have not an unqualified confidence in the- commission, I consider that they may be justifiably influenced and assisted by the valuable evidence garnered from the many learned authorities throughout Australia, and have a sincere and honest desire to improve the status which this Parliament should have in administering the affairs of the country. I feel that we should be well advised to wait and fortify ourselves with this knowledge. We should be able then to legislate with better effect than now. Therefore, I ask the House to consider very seriously what the possibilities might be if we press this legislation at the moment, and do not give' heed to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that we should defer consideration of the bill until we have had an opportunity to. .review the report of this commission. i-I. counsel this Parliament that, before we ratify the agreement, at least the added powers desired to give effect to it should be sought from the people of Australia, and their endorsement of the proposals obtained. It would then be proved that we are desirous of trusting the people, thai we recognize them as being the true masters of the situation, and that we are governed by their will. The reason that we have, in the immediate past, found it so difficult to obtain from the people additional powers under the Commonwealth Constitution, is that there is a grave fear that the powers sought will be abused, as the actions of this and of preceding legislation have indicated. There has been a desire on the part of this Government to intrude unduly on what are really State matters. When it has not been strictly unconstitutional to take direct action, the Government has used indirect methods, and has thereby alienated the sympathy of the States. Thus, when increased powers are sought by the Commonwealth there is a feeling of. diffidence in granting them for fear of the unfair manner in which those powers might be used. I hope the date is not far distant when the various State Parliaments will be very limited in their powers, and when we, as a national parliament, will exercise a greater degree of control over national affairs than we do at present. It is because I wish to see that condition of affairs brought about, and because it is desirable that we should inspire the States with confidence in our good intentions, that I ask the Government and members of this House to accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition and to postpone this legislation until we have in our hands the. evidence and report from the commission which is at present inquiring into the Constitution of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is no valid reason why we should press on .with this matter at the present time. I was greatly impressed by the speech delivered by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann). Mr. Maun</inline> made a very, strong - and very definite statement, based upon figures supplied by an expert and responsible member of the Public Service. That statement differs very greatly from the statement which was made by the Prime Minister when he introduced this bill The honorable member's statement is so serious that it should be replied to by the Government. When he was moving the second reading of the bill, the Prime Minister said that the various States would benefit under these proposals, that they would, in fact, for a period of twenty years, be in a better position that under the existing <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> capita system. It was not denied that during the second part of the 58 years the benefit would be slightly  in the other direction. The honorable member's statement, based on figures supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wickens,</inline> is a startling disclosure, aud the Government cannot refuse to give it very serious consideration. I know that the State Premiers have consented to the terms of the agreement, but I know, also, that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> principle was withdrawn by this Government before it began to deal seriously with the State Premiers.

                        <para>A federation in which the federal authority is not interested in the solvency and prosperity of the States is such a thing as we ought not to consider for a moment. In fact, our first duty to-day is, and I think I can go further and say that the first duty of the Federal Parliament of the future will be to conserve the interests of the States. . . . The success of federation itself must depend on the success of every State in it, and, therefore, in arguing for the strength and financial stability of the States, I am arguing not for that which is parochial, but for that which is essential to the success and strength of the Commonwealth itself..... I do not know a Treasurer, or a budding Treasurer, who would be willing to go back to his colony and advocate any system of federation which did not provide for the return of practically the whole of the sum now collected from customs and excise to the States from the Federal authority. </para>

                                Symon was not. But a Constitutional Commission was appointed by the Government, and is in session now. "Was it appointed for fun or to do real business? It is doing real business. I had the good fortune to spend the greater part of two days listening to the evidence being taken in South Australia. Some of it was very valuable, and the commission was greatly impressed. I know that it was impressed also by its visit to Western Australia. I have no doubt that this body will do good work, and give an honest verdict. It may not be improper to mention at this stage what I consider an anomaly and an injustice. Most of the commissions appointed by the Government are supplied with shorthand writers, who provide them with verbatim reports of the evidence. Some of the evidence thus recorded is not of very much consequence. The Constitutional commission comprises brainy men, who have been appointed by the Government to deal with the most serious business that this Parliament could remit to any authority, and I am told that it is not permitted to have a verbatim report, but is expected to select for printing the more important of the mass of evidence submitted to it. I sincerely hope that the Government is not responsible for this act of parsimony.

On the first campaign I spent three or four weeks with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, one of the brightest men at the Convention, and one of the best statesmen that Australia has ever known.

The war and other contingencies have made the capitation grant of . greater necessity to-day than ever before. Tasmania would have been dead' and forgotten before now had it not been for federation. It is the small States that need the capitation grant. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> gave this House some startling figures, which were totally at variance with the Government's figures. He made a serious statement, and it should be replied to by the Ministry. Why does the Commonwealth want all the revenue? The State governments have to settle people on the land, and to supply essential services. I am exceedingly glad that the decision on this vital question does not end here. The proposals before they can be incorporated in the Constitution have to receive the endorsement of the people, and I have ten times more faith in the people than in this Parliament. </para>
