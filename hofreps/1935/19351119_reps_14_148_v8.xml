                    <para>. - I vise to a question of privilege in connexion with a matter which I conceive to be an invasion of the privileges of Parliament. In order that the business of the House may be delayed as little as possible, I shall state it as succinctly as Ican. I propose to conclude by submitting a motion founded on the provisions of the Standing Orders of this House, and more specifically in the terms employed in the eleventh edition of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Erskine</inline> May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> particularly at pages 71 and 72, and generally elsewhere. </para>

                <para>The matter arises out of two incidents which occurred in committee, one on the 7th November and the other on the 14thNovember last. It refers to the fiction of the  Chairman  ofCommittees <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> in reflecting uponan honorable member improperly, in terms that are notin accordance with the facts, and in violation of the privileges of Parliament. </para>
                <para>The short history of the matter is, thatlast Thursday evening the  Chairman  of Committees took certain disciplinary measures against an honorable member of this House. That honorable member in due course apologized. The  Chairman  of Committers then said- </para>

                        <para>-I am aware, sir, of the popular fallacy well known to lawyers, that it is always safe to slander  a person by innuendo so long as the name of that person is not mentioned. The words complained of could refer only to me. Having had the misfortune to be named in circumstances, as I think - well, I shall not refer to the circumstances having had the misfortune to bc named, a happening that rarely occurs to mo - twice only, I think, in a parliamentary experience of 25 years, I apologized, and the apology was accepted. In accordance with the practice, if not the settled rules and regulations of the House, and certainly in accordance with the good taste generally displayed by honorable members, the matter should never have been referred to again. I have said that <inline font-style="italic">there</inline> was not a scintilla of foundation or justification for the statement that I attempted to impede the progress of business after I had apologized. I may add, sir, that&#34; the record bears me out in that assertion; nothing will be found in it to indicate the slightest disorder on my part. It is true, sir - and this is a very important point to be observed &#39;by the uninitiated who interject, possibly by reason of want of knowledge and lack of experience in these matters - that I moved a motion, that motion being that the honorable member who was then addressing the Chair &#34; be not further heard &#34;. I acted within my rights, I suggest, in moving that motion. I submitted it without any sign of disorder, and without employing any words other than were actually necessary. After I had apologized, until I submitted that motion I said and did nothing whatever. I submit that I was obviously within my rights, and that I acted in compliance with the Standing Orders, lt is worthy of mention, sir, that the  Chairman  of Committees, who has made this unfounded charge against me, accepted the motion without demur, and put it to the committee. It was divided upon, and I am happy to state that every member of the Opposition then in the chamber, including my leader, supported it. T am always prepared, as one must be, to submit to the discipline of this House, even though in my judgment, at any particular time, it may be arbitrarily or vindictively enforced. I am not alleging that it, has been, but am merely stating that I feel myself bound in any circumstances . to sui,mit to it. But I am not prepared to submit without protest to aspersions on my character which are unsupported by fact. I am not habitually, or even frequently, disorderly; and I am just as jealous of my reputation in this House, of which I have been a member for a much longer period than has the  Chairman  of Committees, as that honorable gentleman is of&#39; his; perhaps more. I; suggest that the revival of the matter at all was in bad taste, and against the practice of the House; but possibly that is a question for the  Chairman  to decide for himself. The real importance of the matter, sir, as it affects the House as a whole, is that the  Chairman  of Committees, having made a foundation of his unfounded charge against me, proceeded to lay it down as a canon of practice that in the future he would exercise greater discipline upon honorable members because of what I was .incorrectly alleged to have done. In that way the  Chairman  of Committees threatened to set up a stricter standard of conduct for honorable members generally. I now move - </para>

                    <para>That in the opinion of this House, the  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Prowse, on the 14th instant, offended against the privileges of the Parliament by reflecting from his place, as  Chairman  of Committees, on the conduct in Parliament of an honorable member in terms which were  not in accordance with the facts nor on other grounds justifiable. 1 have to add -that, keenly as I feel this matter, if the honorable gentleman, who occupies a responsible position which requires him to maintain order in committee, will even now show such respect for order and for my good name as to rise in his place aud express regret and apologize to me - even though this motion will no longer bo within my disposal, but will be in the hands of the House - I shall be prepared to accept his apology with better grace than &#39;he displayed when he accepted mine. Having said that, I leave the matter with the House, conscious that if 1 abuse my position by formulating a charge against the  Chairman  of Committees, I am answerable to this House, just as the honorable member is answerable. I have no fear, and I ask no favour in this matter. </para>

An examination of the <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> report of the proceedings of Parliament on the day to which reference has been made will show that the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> merely raised a number of points of order under the Standing Orders of this House. The honorable member has had many years of experience in this Parliament, and even those opposed to him politically must admit that during those years the honorable member has rendered valuable service to Australia and has always conducted himself decorously. Because of his long experience, and also of his legal knowledge, the honorable member for Batman is probably the best authority on the Standing Orders sitting on. this side of the House. It would be no exaggeration to say that he is more conversant with the Standing Orders than axe most of the members supporting the Government. A most unfortunate state of affairs will arise if members are to be castigated for having taken action which they believed to be in the best interests of the House. The incident to which reference was made by the  Chairman  of Committees, in the absence  of the lion oracle member for Batman, was thought to he closed. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records that the speech of the honorable member for Batman was largely a series of extracts from various standing orders, and I am as yet unaware of any standing order which provides that the reading of a standing order is out of order.

                <para>Honorable members who were present in the committee when the incident, to which reference has been made, took place will realize that the mover of the motion now before the House has not stated the position correctly. There was nothing splenetic in my reference to a previous incident. I had&#39; named another honorable member, who thereupon sought to offer an apology and escape the censure of the committee. In accepting .his apology, I informed the committee that it would not be wise to make a practice of allowing a member to escape punishment when he had gone to such lengths as to justify his -being named. I also intimated that the immediate past  Speaker  of this House had made it clear that, w&#39;hen he named a member, there could be no escape from the consequences. I did not wish it to be understood that the Chair could exercise leniency to the  extent of sacrificing the dignity of the committee. I did not mention the honorable member for Batman, and I do not think that I said more than was within the knowledge of all members who had been present in the committee and had seen what really happened on the earlier occasion. In order to give strength to my remarks, I referred to &#34; an honorable member &#34; who had been named the previous week. The honorable member for Batman now says that he merely moved &#34; That the -honorable member for Barker
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline>
                    be not further heard.&#34; The Chair, as well as those honorable members who were present at the time, know that that was not all the honorable member did. I suggest that, had I acted strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders, I could have named the honorable member again. I shall say no more at the moment except that I was very sincere in what I said at the time. My only object was to carry out my duty as  Chairman  of Committees, an honour which this House has conferred upon me, and to maintain the dignity of the Chair. The honorable member for Batman
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline>
                    knows, as all other honorable members know, that, according to the

                <para>Standing Orders, all interjections are disorderly. In fact, on that particular occasion, he drew attention to Standing Order 58, which sets out, in effect, &#39;that all interjections are disorderly, yet proceeded to castigate the Chair along the lines indicated and to make disorderly interjections; I thereupon named him under the very Standing Order to which he himself drew my attention. I am quite content to leave my position in this matter rest in the hands of honorable members. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not propose to say much on this matter; indeed, I will not touch at all on the incident which occurred prior to the naming of the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> in respect of the conduct of either the honorable member or the  Chairman  of Committees. However, I emphasize that it is not correct to say that the honorable member for Batman, after apologizing to the Chair, did anything disorderly in committee. In this respect I think the memory of the  Chairman  of Committees is at fault. I pride myself on having an accurate memory. I was present at that particular time, and I challenge the  Chairman  of Committees, or any one, to indicate a single sentence which the honorable member for Batman uttered at that stage of the proceedings, that would justly bring down upon his head the charge which has been made. I say nothing whatever regarding the incident that occurred before the honorable member was named. I say that after his apology was accepted &#62;the honorable member for Batman uttered no words beyond those contained in the motion which he moved: &#34;That the member for Barker be not further heard&#34;. I am prepared to stake my reputation that what I have said is the truth. </para>

                    <para>. - Like most honorable members I was not aware that this matter was to be raised. A short time before the House met I was given to understand that some question of privilege would be raised, but had no knowledge whatever of its nature. &#34;We cannot settle this matter on party lines. It should be considered on its merits. I feel sure, however, that debate at this  juncture &#39;would  not bring out the actual facts, because a number of honorable members now present were, like myself, absent at the time the incident occurred. I suggest that this debate should be adjourned. Such a course would give honorable members more time for reflection and to examine the actual facts associated with this matter, and would not prevent this discussion being continued at a later date.

                    <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I desire to inform honorable members that a wireless message was received last night from Air-Commodore Sydney Smith, Air Officer Commanding at Singapore, expressing the opinion that further air search for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Kingsford Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pethybridge</inline> is not likely to be of value. Two Royal Air Force flying bouts and nine bomber aircraft have been employed continuously during the past ten days on this duty, and Qantas aircraft and an aeroplane piloted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Melrose</inline> have also assisted on various days. All possible courses between Rangoon and Singapore, including all islands off the west coast of Malaya, have been thoroughly searched many times, and many nights have been made over the jungle areas. In these circumstances, the Government has regretfully been forced to agree with Air-Commodore Smith that no useful object would now be served in sending any special aircraft from Australia to take part in the search. Air-Commodore Smith has informed the Government that hs proposes to continue the ground search organization in the difficult country for a further period as he considers that this method is more likely to yield results. The Qantas reserve aircraft at Singapore will be placed at his disposal to aid ground parties or to perform any other special duty on which it would usefully be employed. </para>

                        <para>- On a previous occasion I dealt with every phase of tha question which has been raised by the honorable member. I pointed out that the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties was on his way back to Australia, and would arrive here very  shortly. The honorable member asks what authority was vested in that Minister? He was given authority to negotiate in respect of trade treaties, but not to finalize any. The authority to complete and finalize treaties must always rest with the Cabinet. No treaties have been concluded, and nonewill be until the Minister presents his reports to Cabinet. Decisions on those reports will be made by the Cabinet. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be somewhat difficult to direct a. commission of such a character as to how long it should take in its deliberations in respect of the important questions with which it will be called upon to deal. Once a com mission of the kind has been appointed, and great care has been taken to select appropriate persons to conduct the inquiry, such a matter should be left in its hands. I feel that if it could not be trusted in regard to the time to be taken in its deliberations, it could scarcely be trusted to handle the big question referred to it. </para>

                        <para>.- In all probability this bill would have been disposed of on Friday afternoon but for what I can only describe as an unfortunate proceeding on the part of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> at the moment in charge of the House. Across the table he gave me the definite assurance that, after the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> who had been discussing a proposed amendment which, from the viewpoint of the Opposition, involved a matter of principle, had resumed his seat he would immediately report progress. But, instead of doing so, he did not rise at all. The  Chairman  immediately put the proposed amendment, and I was the only member present who supported it. The honorable member for Hunter on concluding his remarks had left the chamber. As there was only one &#34;Aye &#34; there was no division, although honorable members on this side desired that the amendment should be divided upon. Had it not been for the definite statement of the Minister for Defence that he would report progress immediately the honorable member for Hunter resumed his seat, I would have directed the attention of the  Chairman  to the state of the committee, the committee would ha&#39;ve been counted out, and the bill would have lapsed. </para>

I was not present in the Committee at the time, and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> was in charge. But there must have been some misunderstanding of the situation on his part, because honorable members on both sides recognize that whenever that Minister gives an undertaking he invariably carries it out. I shall bring the remarks of the Loader of the Opposition under the notice of the Minister for Defence who, no doubt, will explain the position from his point of view. </para>

Immediately I had finished speaking to the amendment I was called out of the House.

                    <para>.- Instead of making the position more definite, the Senate&#39;s amendment, in certain circumstances, makes it more difficult. Sub-clause 10 of the bill clearly states that the members appointed to represent publicly-owned abattoirs and freezing works on the Commonwealth Meat Export Control Board &#34; shall be the persons for the time being holding the following positions : &#34;. Then follows the list of specified positions which entitle certain persons to membership of the board. The sub-clause, as worded when it left the House of Representatives, is open to the same difficulties as I can foresee in. the amendment. Each of the specified persons is to he the nominee and the appointee of the various bodies mentioned. Sub-clause 15 of clause 5 reads - </para>

It means that there are &#34;two conflicting authorities. In the first place, the meat commissioner is the servant of the State Government, but the periodof his office as a member of the Meat Board will also be subject to the determination of the Governor-General. In one sub-clause, the bill gives power of dismissal to the Governor-General, but another sub-clause limits the personnel of the board to specific persons. There is no power to appoint a successor to any State representative discharged from the service of the Meat Export Control Board. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member has directed attention to something that possibly could happen but it is very improbable that it would. The question that has been raised is what would be done to replace a representative of an institution who might happen to be dismissed from the board, but I do not doubt that, if such a thing happened, reference would be made back to the State authorities of the offence or neglect which was considered sufficient to justify his removal from the board. In all probability, the offence or neglect would be sufficient to justify his removal from his position in the State Service. Unless, however, there were very sound reasons for removing a representative of the description cited, no action would be taken to declare a seat vacant. If it did happen, however, under sub-clause 16 of clause 5, the Governor-General has power to nominate some one else to fill the position for the balance of the terra for which the discharged officer had been appointed. That sub-clause provides - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> has raised a most important point regarding the representation of State undertakings. When the committee was discussing another very important amendment submitted by the Opposition it was argued that the representation which it claimed should be given to an important section of the industry, namely the employees, would, to a large extent, be provided for under the sub-clause with which we are now dealing. It was said that freezing works and abattoirs, where the great bulk of the workers is engaged, would get some voice in the conduct of the board&#39;s affairs and thereby provide a channel of representation for the workers. It may quite easily happen in the discussion of the circumstances regarding the conduct of the export of meat from publicly-owned undertakings that opinions expressed by a representative of one of those organizations may conflict with opinions expressed by others who have personal interests to serve. It is possible that the member whose opinions conflict with those of private interests may, as the result of agitation, be removed from office without the consent of the State authorities. The Governor-General should have no right by exercising such authority to be able to remove from office representatives of large public undertakings. It is conceivable that, if he did so, he would be acting in opposition to the desires of the State governments concerned. After all, the board will be the direct channel through which the State governments will have a voice regarding the exportation of meat. The point raised is vital, and we should be supported by all honorable members, irrespective of the States from which they come. </para>

                    <para>. -  The aspect mentioned by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> had escaped my notice. I quite agree that the clause quoted by me does not cover the nominees of public institutions such as the abattoirs of the States to which reference is made in clause 5. Subclause 13 of that clause states that where any member is required to be appointed pursuant to a nomina tion by any association or body of persons, and no nomination is received by the Minister on or before the time fixed, the Governor-General may appoint such person as he thinks fit. It seems that there is no provision in the bill other than the powers conferred on the Governor-General, for the filling of a vacancy in the event of the removal from office of a member of the board representing publicly-owned abattoirs and freezing works which deal with meat for export. </para>

                        <para>- Some persons may consider that he is the best authority in the Commonwealth on beef export, but I differ from thorn. Associated with the Ministers who attended the meat conference in London was the  chairman  of the Queensland Meat Industry Board, and he was prominent throughout the negotiations regarding chilled meat. He established the organization provided in Queensland for the control of the industry, and has directed his attention to the improvement of the lot of stockproducers in that State. Therefore, the majority of the meat producers in Queensland would hold a different view from that of those in South Australia as to the highest meat authority in the Commonwealth. In the event of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pope</inline> ceasing to be a member of the board, why should the nomination to fill the vacancy be made by a body in South Australia? There appears to bo a set of special circumstances in South Australia which the Minister has not explained to the committee, but with which, I am sure, the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker),</inline> who moved the amendment, is familiar. I should therefore like to hear the opinion of that honorable member on the amendment made by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- Until quite recently the freezing works at Port Adelaide was a section of the Government Produce Department, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pope</inline> is the general manager. The Government Produce Department not only bought livestock on its own account and had them slaughtered and exported, but also slaughtered stock on behalf of a number of private exporters. Recently, however, the constitution of Municipal Abattoirs was altered by act of Parliament and they were combined with the freezing works under one management. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pope</inline> then ceased to be the manager of the export freezing works at Port Adelaide, which handles the bulk of the slaughtering and freezing of meat for export, but his department still retained control of the much smaller government freezing works at Port Lincoln. In my opinion he is the most acceptable man to represent the slaughtering and export interests of South Australia on the Australian Meat Export Control Board, but his department, although it has some interest in the control and supervision of meat for export wherever it is slaughtered, no longer has the management of the big freezing plant atPort Adelaide. I do not know who will be. the successor of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pope.</inline> Actually, it is now more directly concerned with dairy produce and fruit than with meat. In view of these circumstances I moved an amendment to provide that after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pope</inline> ceased to be manager of the Government Produce Department his successor to that office should not automatically replace him on the Australian Meat Export Control Board, but that the representative of the slaughtering and freezing interests in South Australia on that board should be nominated by the Abattoirs and Export Board. The  chairman  of this concern is appointed by the State Government, while half of the representatives are elected by the producers, butchers, and other sections of the export and local meat trade, and the other half by the consumers. A person chosen by that board would better represent the killing interests of South Australia than would the manager of the Government Produce Department, whoever he might be at that time. The amendment inserted by the Senate is intended to clarify that position. The provision for the Governor-General to remove members of the Export Control Board on the recommendation  of the board is designed to safeguard the position that the board will be absolutely controlled by British and Australian interests. Although the phrasing might not be particularly plain, it is just as well to retain the provision providing for an alteration of the membership of the board on the recommendation of the board by the action of the Governor-General. </para>

                    <para>. - I supported the amendment when it was previously considered by the committee. It has not altered the intention of the act in any way; nor has the amendment to that amendment, suggested by the Senate, which is merely a verbal one to make the position clearer. The original intention of the measure was to give the processing industry in each State a representative. Thus, the meat-works of Queensland are represented by the  chairman  of the Meat Industry Board; the commissioner controlling the metropolitan meat industry is the representative of the Government of New South Wales; and the general manager of the Wyndham meat-works becomes a member of the board on behalf of the Government of Western Australia. The Senate has not amended that representation. But the circumstances in South Australia are peculiar. The representative provided for in the bill happens to be the general manager of the Government Produce Department. I agree with the reason which actuated the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> in moving his amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pope</inline> is an authority with regard to meatnegotiations and is generally recognized by the industry as being an outstanding man in the trade; but the honorable member for Wakefield, foreseeing the apparent danger of a future general manager of the Produce Department knowing nothing about the subject of the export of beef, suggested that, after the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pope,</inline> the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board, as in the other States, should have the right to nominate a person to the vacancy. The effect of the Senate&#39;s amendment is to make the provision more elastic as regards the choice of a representative after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pope</inline> relinquishes the office. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> lias raised an interesting matter, which the Senate might have been much better employed in endeavouring to clarify instead of devoting its attention to the amendment of the honorable member for Wakefield, inasmuch as no provision is made for the appointment to the board of any person appointed to fill one of the positions mentioned in sub-clause 10, who has been removed from office by the Governor-General. The Minister has suggested that the difficulty may be covered by sub-clause 13 of clause 5, which gives the Governor-General power to make an appointment when no nomination has been received. Clause 6 provides that the board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession, but it will not have perpetual succession if a member of the Meat Export Control Board does not represent one of the State meat exporting interests. There does not appear to be anything in the bill to ensure that continuity of State representation of meat exporting industries which is contemplated in clause 6. </para>

                <para>In the case of South Australia, it is provided that the person holding a certain position at the commencement of this act, shall be a member of the board, but when he ceases to occupy that position another body shall have the power to nominate his successor. South Australia is the only State to have that privilege. The wording of the clause is clear. Persons holding certain specified positions within a State are to be appointed as members of the board, but if removed from office by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the board, they  may still retain their respective positions in the States, and there is no machinery whereby they can be replaced. The Meat Export Control Board may recommend the removal from the board of the representative of New South Wales, but the Government of New South Wales may say that it still proposes to retain him as the Metropolitan Meat Industry Commissioner in New South Wales. There would thus be conflict of opinion between the two authorities. If the bill is allowed to pass in its present form, and provision similar to that made in respect of South Australia is not made in connexion with the other States, one State may be entirely disfranchised, because of difference of opinion between the Export Board and the authority employing a particular commissioner. The Minister suggested that the position could be overcome by some other person being appointed by the Governor-General. But, according to the bill, nobody can represent New South Wales on the Meat Export Control Board who is not the person who for the time being holds the position of Metropolitan Meat Industry Commissioner in New South Wales. No other person would have any more right to sit on the board than I would have, because only specified individuals are to have the right to represent specified State instrumentalities. I do not know whether the amendment proposed to be moved by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> is preferable to mine, but I do not wish a position to arise whereby a representative of a. certain State may be removed from the board and there is no power under the act to replace him. </para>

The possibility of a. position arising such as that mentioned by the honorable member for Dalley (Mr.Rosevear) is very remote, but at the same time it could arise. The member representing the Metropolitan Meat Industry of New South Wales could be removed from the Meat Export Control Board, and there is no provision in the bill, as it is framed at present, to appoint a successor.

                        <para>- That sub-clause deals only with members of the board other than government representatives, who may be removed from office by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the board. The honorable member for Dalley has suggested that although one of the representatives of Government abattoirs or meat works might be removed from the board by the Governor-General, he might still retain his State position and in that event there would be no provision for the nomination of his successor. The amendments which I have foreshadowed will overcome this difficulty. </para>

                <para>- I regret that I was unavoidably absent last week when the discussion took place on the second reading of the bill. I am surprised that the contingency mentioned by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> was not discovered earlier in the debate. Personally I would prefer an amendment on the lines suggested by the honorable member to those foreshadowed by the Minister, because as one who attended the Canberra conference, which drafted the broad outlines of the bill, I know the general feeling was that the public utilities in the various States should be directly represented on the board through the management. It was felt that in this way the small producers, whose stock is processed by these works and who desired to export on their own account, would have representation. </para>

                        <para>. - If the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahoney)</inline> will look at paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> he will find that there is provision for &#34; one member in respect of each State to represent the stock producers of the State.&#34; Under paragraph e there is provision for the appointment of &#34; one member in respect of each State which exports more than 15,000 tons of meat annually.&#34; That, I admit, would not include Tasmania, but under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> the Commonwealth will nominate one representative to .take care of all Commonwealth interests on the board, and there will also be one member to represent co-operative organizations which export mutton and lamb, as well as one. representative of the pig industry, so Tasmanian producers are not without representation. I remind the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisken)</inline> that the bill gives effect to the decision of the Canberra conference that the persons for the time being occupying the positions of managers of State abattoirs or meat works should be members of the board by virtue of their positions and because of the knowledge which they possess of the meat industry generally. The amendments which I have foreshadowed will enable successors to be nominated in the event of any one of the persons mentioned being removed from the board while still retaining his position under a State government. I would point out that the removal of such a person from the board would only follow some offence which would be of such a serious nature as to ensure his removal from his position under the State govern ment, so the contingency mentioned by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> is extremely remote. Only in the event of any one of them being removed, would a successor be nominated by the Government of the State in which the person- removed was operating. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is quite logical in the point that he raises; hut it would be almost impossible to meet that point in an act of Parliament. He is really suggesting that the measure should provide that the  deputy  of the person removed, or some one else connected with the meat works, should be appointed iu his place. The honorable member must realize that that would be a dangerous condition to impose upon any State government. I am absolutely convinced that if it should so happen that the manager of any one of these works did anything to justify his removal from the federal board, such action would also bring about his removal from the State organization. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members must be reasonable, and recognize that a member could be removed only on the recommendation of the board, which would have to be accepted by the Minister, and referred by him to the Governor-General in Council. It must be admitted that the offence would need &#39;to foe very serious to justify the &#39;removal of any member ; and if it were so serious, it would undoubtedly mean his removal from the State organization which he was representing. Under my proposal, in the event of the State government or the State authorities overlooking the reason for his removal from the federal board, and allowing him to continue in office within the State, the State shall then have the right to nominate his successor. I do not think that it would be advisable to limit the discretion of the State govern-  ment as to whom it should nominate in the event of a representative being removed, because I am convinced that it is unlikely that a representative would be removed by the federal &#39;board for a reason other than one which would justify his removal from the management of the State instrumentality. So that every State would be in a similar position, I urge the committee to agree to the deletion of the amendment made last Friday in relation to South Australia, thus restoring the bill to its original form, the substitution therefor of a provision for the nomination by the Government of South Australia of a successor to a person removed from the board, and the adoption of the amendments I have outlined to paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b, c</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">d.</inline></para>

                    <para>.- It would seem that at last the position is being clarified. The point raised by the honorable member for Dalley (Mr.Rosevear) relates to a (matter that obviously was in need of correction, and it is remarkable that it passed unnoticed both in this chamber and in the Senate. But for the amendments made by the Senate, the matter would not have come again before honorable members. It would appear on the surface that the action now being taken by the Minister will meet the position. I point out, however, that there is a great deal of verbiage, of the meaning of which it is obviously impossible for honorable members to have a correct appreciation. Therefore, in order to make sure that we shall not become more involved, I suggest that the Minister have typewritten copies of the amendments placed in the hands of honorable members, or at least present those amendments in such a way that we may properly understand them. I revert to a point that I raised by way of interjection. The proposal of the Senate provides that each member appointed to represent publicly-owned abattoirs and freezing works dealing with meat for export shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General. That is similar to the provision which relates <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the representative of the Commonwealth Government. But sub-clause 15 of clause 5 provides that members other than the government representative may be removed from office by the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the board. It would seem to me that the provision that each member shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General could, with wisdom, be deleted, and that sub-clause 15 should be altered to read &#34; Members of the board other than the government representative, may be removed from office by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the board, or for any other reason.&#34; The provision for the easy removal of publicly-appointed individuals, while other members can be removed only on the recommendation of the board, is inexplicable. As the board is being appointed for the benefit of the community as a whole, and not for the particular benefit of any institution, I suggest that full power be given for the removal of any member of it by the Govern or-General . </para>

                    <para>.- I draw attention to the position that is now being created. The suggestions of the honorable member for Dalley (Mr.Rosevear) are more in keeping with the principles of the bill. As the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisken)</inline> has pointed out, the intention was that this board should represent primarily the producers in the industry, and that the members appointed under the provisions of sub-clause 10 should represent publiclyowned abattoirs and freezing works. If an amendment similar to that now before the committee is proposed in relation to South Australia, the Governor in Council of that State would be given the right to nominate a representative to the Governor-General in Council. That State might adopt a collective policy of marketing, and because of conflict &#39;between the State and Commonwealth Governments, the Commonwealth authorities might see fit to remove the State representative from the &#39;board. Thus, instead of having true representatives of publicly-owned companies, who would watch the interests of the producers, the men appointed might represent the exporters. I foresee the possibility of the meatexporting trade being controlled by big interests such as Vestey&#39;s or Swift&#39;s. If we make provision whereby the persons to be appointed to the board may be other than the nominees of the producers, there will be a danger that men representing the big exporting and exploiting companies will be appointed to the board. </para>

I do not feel disposed to support it. I suggest that provision be made for each of the bodies referred to in the proposed new subclause (10) to nominate the successor to its representative should he be removed from office. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> I suggest that the words &#34; or a nominee of the commission &#34; be added, with a similar suitable addition to paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b, c</inline> and ti, so that in each case the person to be appointed shall be a nominee of the body mentioned therein.

                    <para>. -  The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> seeks to retain the right of the various bodies mentioned in the proposed new sub-clause to direct representation on the board. The provision will come into operation  only in the event of any of the persons mentioned in the several paragraphs being removed from the federal board. The honorable member&#39;s suggestion that we should make the body whose representative has been removed from the federal board responsible for nominating his successor would increase, rather than decrease, the difficulty. For instance, should the  chairman  of the Queensland Meat Industry Board be removed from the federal board, but still retain his position on the State board, complications would arise if the State board were asked to appoint his successor. It might happen that, in that event, the Queensland Meat Industry Board would re-nominate the same person, and as his nomination would obviously not be acceptable to the Federal Government, further difficulties would arise. Moreover, the State board might refuse to nominate a successor, thereby leaving a vacancy on the federal board. My amendment makes the Government of the State concerned responsible for nominating a successor. I repeat that it is most unlikely that any vacancy will occur in the manner suggested, but in that remote contingency surely we can depend on the State Government to nominate a person both capable of carrying out the duties and acceptable to the industry. I appeal to honorable members not to increase the already great difficulties, but to accept my amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- It would appear that the proposed new sub-clause was framed to provide that certain interests should be represented on the board. The amendment should be consistent with that intention. The per-  sons mentioned in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> should remain on the board until removed by the authorities which appointed them. A member of the board who is not carrying out the wishes of those whom he represents will not long remain their representative. It seems to me that whereas the original intention was that certain bodies should have direct representation on the board, the amendment destroys that intention. </para>

                    <para>. - This is one of the most important provisions of the bill. Obviously, the intention of the Government i3 to provide against the control of the meatexport industry by big proprietary interests, and that is why it stipulates that co-operative companies or State utilities should be represented on the board. Now we are being asked to give to a State government the right to nominate a person who may not be acceptable to the instrumentality he is to represent. We should not interfere with direct representation on this board of the exporting organizations that have been established in each State. That is one of the original principles of the bill. Why should we allow the Premier of South Australia, for instance, to nominate somebody to represent any cooperative body on this board? In reply to rue the Minister said that the real object of this amendment is to overcome the point raised by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> that the bill, as it now stands, does not provide for the appointment of successors to members who may be removed from the board-; but sub-clause 13 provides that if a nomination is not forthcoming, the Governor-General shall have power to make an appointment. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable member for Dalley raised his point the Minister quoted a clause which he immediately admitted did not apply, but then said that all the necessary powers in this connexion were embodied in subclause 13. The Minister now says that there is no provision in the bill to cover the position. I said at the time that it seemed very doubtful whether such power was embodied in the bill, and that an amendment should be brought forward to clarify the position. The amendment proposed now by the Minister seems to ignore a feature of the bill in that it will deprive public bodies concerned with the export of meat of the right of direct representation on this board. He can make sub-clause 13 broad enough to overcome the position that would arise if a board did not nominate a successor to its  representative  who had been displaced from the board, but first of all we should give all of the bodies concerned the right to make such a nomination direct. I am in favour of this measure provided the rights of the industry to direct representation are fully recognized, </para>

                <para>I believe this would get over the present difficulty. It is not sufficient to say that the displacing of a representative is a remote possibility. The possibility exists, and we have to devise ways and means of replacing a representative who may be removed from the board. If we do not do so a whole State may be disfranchised so far as representation on the board is concerned. The suggestion made by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> seems to be the fairest way of arranging for the nomination and appointment of successors. It was that in the event of a representative of a certain body being removed from the board, that particular body, and not any outside authority, should have the right to nominate a successor. If the Minister amendment be adopted, a State government might make a purely political appointment, even -with the object of causing discord on the &#39;board. Honorable members will agree that harmony on the board won&#39; d best be ensured if the body directly concerned, and not any outside body, is given the right to nominate successors to displaced representatives. The Minister has admitted that these particular interests should be represented on the board. If one of their representatives is removed, I cannot see any reason why his successor should not be nominated by the body which the displaced man had represented; I ask for your direction, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> as to whether I would be in order in moving, at this stage, the addition of the new paragraph which I have already mentioned. If the Minister proposes to move an amendment to each of these paragraphs, considerable repetition of discussion will be inevitable. Probably, much time would be saved if, instead of amending each paragraph separately, a comprehensive new paragraph were added, as I have suggested. </para>

                    <para>. - I have endeavoured to explain the position which would arise if the suggestion outlined by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> were accepted. If the general manager of the meat-works at Wyndham were removed from the Australian Meat Board, what authority should appoint his successor ? The honorable member for Wide Bay suggests that the controlling authority at Wyndham should do so, but I point out that there is only a general manager in charge of those works. What other authority than the Government of Western Australia could nominate a successor to this particular representative? In New South Wales, a commissioner controls the abattoirs. In the event of his removal from the Australian Meat Board, what .authority, other than the Government of New South Wales, would nominate his successor? </para>

                        <para>- There is no board; a commissioner is in charge of the abattoirs. If the meat industry of New South Wales is satisfied to trust the appointment of the commissioner to the State Government, surely the Commonwealth Government can rely on the same Government, whatever its political complexion, to nominate a fit and proper person as successor to the New South Wales representative on this board. If we cannot trust. State governments, irrespective of politics, to nominate the right person to this board, whom can we trust? The State governments act on behalf of all sections of the community, and representatives of all of them at the Meat Conference held in Canberra agreed to this basis of representation on the Australian Meat Board. To meet the point raised by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> I have had my amendment drafted by the Crown Law officers to provide that, in the event of one of these representatives being removed from the board - a very remote  contingency - the Government of the State concerned shall nominate his successor. If he is removed from the State instrumentality, then his successor on that body will automatically take his place on the Australian Meat Board, but should a representative who is removed from the Australian Meat Board retain his Stale position, it will be competent for the &#39; State government to nominate his successor. The points raised by the honorable members for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> and Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> and other honorable members, will be met by cbe amendment now before the committee. - </para>

                <para>This is the usual motion precedent to the introduction and enactment of the annual hill to prescribe the rates of income tax. It sets out the rate of tax proposed to be levied on assessments for the current financial year. When the motion has been  passed, I shall introduce a bill to give effect to it. It is customary for the discussion on this subject to occur when the motion is before the Committee of &#34;Ways and Means, and the subsequent passage of the Income Tax Bill is usually formal. It is proposed to reduce the special property tax from the present rate of 6 per cent, to 5 per cent, for reasons which I set out in the budget speech. The consequent reduction of revenue is estimated to he about &#163;200,000 a year. This calculation is based on the 1934-35 income. </para>
                <para>Division A of the motion deals with the rate of tax on income derived from personal exertion. The formula set out in both division A. and division B is that which has been in operation for several years. It was evolved originally by Professor Giblin when he was Commonwealth Statistician. The rate of tax in respect of income from personal exertion is unaltered and begins at 85 per cent, of 3d. in the &#163;1, and it increases in a straightline curve - a term apparently contradictory but well understood by taxation experts - until the taxable income from personal exertion reaches &#163;6,900 a year. When that point has been reached the rate of tax is 76.5 pence in the &#163;1. Thereafter the rate of tax is uniform. </para>
                <para>Division B deals with the rate of tax on income derived from property and it starts at, roughly, 3d. in the &#163;1 and increases in a straight-line curve until a taxable income of &#163;3,700 is reached, at which point the rate of tax is 90 pence in the &#163;1. Thereafter the rate remains stationary. The rate of tax is the same is that which operated last year. </para>
                <para>Division. C deals with the rate of tax in respect of taxable income derived partly from personal exertion and partly from property. It is designed to meet the case of a man with a composite income. For example, if a man&#39;s total income were derived half from personal exertion and half from property, the average rate of tax over the whole would bc midway between the rate applicable to personal exertion and that applicable to property. </para>
                <para>Divisions D, E and l7 are self-explanatory. </para>
                <para>Division G deals with the rate of tax payable by an individually-owned part nership, and has to do with cases in which <inline font-style="italic">mata fides</inline> have been established, as, for example, where a man has brought in some dummies as associates, and has attempted to establish that income which is actually his own personal income is income from a partnership. Division G enables the Commissioner of Taxation to deal with sham partnerships in such a way as to exact the total amount of taxation that would be payable if no sham partnership existed. </para>
                <para>Division H relates to the rate of tax payable by severally-owned partnerships, which are, in fact, sham partnerships. </para>
                <para>Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 relate to the special property tax and the means of collecting it, and are designed to implement the procedure that has been adopted by the Commissioner ever since the special property tax has been in operation. Provision is made for a reduction of the rate of tax from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent. The special property tax is one of the most onerous of the special taxes imposed some years ago. Two years ago it  was  intended to reduce the rate of this tax from 10 per cent., at which it then stood, to 5 per cent., but the Government had need to obtain additional revenue for a special purpose, and it could not at that time reduce the rate below 6 per cent. This is a very small reduction in respect of tax which  I  think is universally agreed to bo particularly onerous. </para>
                <para>Paragraph 5 provides that the averaging provisions which apply to income tax generally shall not apply to the special property tax. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> is framed in order to cover income derived by persons such as artists visiting this country, whose stay extends over parts of two financial years. This paragraph is inserted to provide that the rate of tax paid by such persons shall be the rate applicable for the period of their residence in this country notwithstanding the fact that they arc here for portions of two financial years. </para>

                    <para>.- The Opposition does not propose to delay the passage of this bill. This legislation re-enacts the existing legislation dealing with the income tax rate with the exception of the special tax  levied in respect of income from property which, -under this resolution, will be reduced to 5 per cent. Otherwise the incidence of the income tax adopted by Parliament a year ago remains unaffected. I would like to say, however, that although last year no reduction was made, the reduction of &#163;200,000 which is conceded by this resolution to those with incomes from, property is not the first reduction affected. Income tax collections during the last three years have been steadily falling. In 1931-32 the yield was &#163;13,481,982; in 1932-33, &#163;10,878,718 ; in 1933-34, &#163;9,314,768 ; and in 1934-35, &#163;S,761,619. Although the yield from income tax is progressively falling it must be acknowledged that the incomes derived from property in Australia should be substantially increasing from what they were at a nadir of the depression. Three years ago, when the problem of Australian finance was very acute, incomes from property and personal exertion were substantially lower than they are at present. As a matter of fact, within practically four years there has been a decline in the proceeds of income tax, from nearly &#163;13,500,000 to approximately. &#163;8,750,000. The rates of tax in operation in 1931-32, including the company rate of tax and the rate of the special tax on property income, were re-enacted for 1932-33. The Parliament felt that it could not afford to collect less from income tax than in the preceding year. In 1933-34, however, substantial reductions were made; the personal exertion rate was reduced by 15 per cent.; the company rate was reduced from ls. 4.8d. to ls. in the &#163;, and the special tax on income from property was reduced from 10 per cent, to 6 per cent. The Government now proposes to reduce the  last named  tax to 5 per cent. The 1933-34 rates again operated for 1934-35 and, substantially, with the exception of the special tax on property, the same rates are to apply for the current year. The effect of this resolution will be that less call will be made on the taxable capacity of Australia than by other taxation which this Parliament has imposed. I have mentioned in the discussion of other bills how the revenues of the Commonwealth are being increasingly derived from indirect taxation. Direct taxation has fallen from &#163;2 17s. 7d. in 1930-31 to &#163;1 14s 5d. in the last financial year. That represents a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> reduction of direct taxation by &#163;1 3s. 2d. On the other hand indirect taxation has increased by about &#163;2 2s. a head. I think it has been sufficiently established that direct taxation is levied entirely upon those who have the capacity to pay. Only with very great reluctance, there fore, should this Parliament contemplate an increase of the revenue from indirect taxation at a time when it faces a. steadily declining revenue from direct taxation. Furthermore, the fact must be borne in mind that the ordinary transactions of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the first four months of this financial year showed an excess of receipts over expenditure of &#163;1,990,000. Of this amount customs and excise provided an increase of nearly &#163;1,1S0,000 over the budget estimate for that period. Thus, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution by the citizens of Australia to this Parliament in the present financial year is well over &#163;1,000,000 more than was estimated in the Treasurer&#39;s budget speech. The inequality in the incidence of taxation, direct and indirect, is a matter which this Parliament must face because, incontestably, it is wrong for the Parliament to be refusing to restore, shall we say, invalid and old-age pensions while, at the same time, making these remissions of direct taxation even to the limited degree involved in this resolution. It is true that the reduction is less than &#163;250.000, and that that sum would not provide adequately for such other contingencies as certain honorable members have in mind, but nevertheless I direct the Treasurer&#39;s attention to the remarkable increase of the proceeds of indirect taxes during the present financial year. As I have said, it exceeds the estimate by more than &#163;1,000,000. I know the honorable gentleman may say that revenue received during the first four months is not necessarily an indication of the receipts for the complete year ; but I can imagine that had there been a fall of &#163;1,000,000 during that period the Treasurer would be so apprehensive of the trend that that indicated, that he would be asking Parliament now to take cog-  nizance of it. Property tax remissions which, have been made during recent years have been much more substantial than the &#163;200,000 proposed by this resolution. In 1932-33 the value of the flat rate exemption was &#163;500,000. That concession continued in the succeeding years. In 1933-34 the reduction of the special property tax from 10 per cent, to 6 per cent, gave an additional relief of &#163;880,000. Those remissions were repeated in the next year, and will continue this year, plus a further remission of the special property tax to the amount of &#163;220,000 ; thus making the total relief for four years &#163;4,S60,000. Although one may urge that taxes upon capital are unwise, yet the incidence of taxes on the well-to-do is less severe than is that of the indirect burdens imposed on the poor. Professor Giblin has pointed out that taxation on capital does not apply to those who have no income from capital. The tax is applied not to capital, but to income from capital; it is not imposed upon house property but on the income derived from that property. &#34;While it can be urged that when introduced the property tax was onerous, the substantial reductions of it which have been made are in marked contrast to the treatment meted out by this Parliament to other sections of the community who, equally with those with incomes from property, were called upon to make special sacrifices during the period of financial emergency. I have no more to say other than to urge the committee before finally disposing of this matter not to entirely overlook what I regard as the fundamental unbalance of the sources of Commonwealth revenue. &#34;While, on the one hand we are continually burdening the &#39;community by the imposition of indirect taxation, regardless of the individual competence of the citizens to pay, on the other hand we have a continuation of the programme of remissions of direct taxation, which definitely is imposed only on those able to pay; if they have no taxable income they do not pay the tax. This Parliament has to consider that aspect of the matter. In any event I submit that before the Parliament contemplates further remissions of direct taxation it ought to consider its obligations to those who have acknowledged claims upon the Commonwealth - claims which were subjected to special pruning some years ago because of the difficulties of the financial situation. Surely we ought not to reduce taxes on those who have incomes from property and relatively can well afford to contribute to the public revenues until we have first assured that those who have no income from any source and are dependent upon this Parliament - the aged and the invalid - have secured to them the rate of pensions that applied before the special emergency legislation was introduced. </para>

                    <para>.- Under the Income Tax Assessment Act an exemption of &#163;50 is allowed for each child under the age of sixteen years. In normal times this is fair enough, because usually by the time a child reaches the age of sixteen, or even before then, he has taken his place in industry. One effect of the depression, however, is that youths have found  it  exceedingly difficult to obtain employment with the result their parents have had to continue supporting them. This has placed a severe strain upon the resources of many families, especially as the earnings of the head of the family have, in too many cases, been reduced  as  a result of wage-cuts. In the circumstances, the exemption might well be extended to cover&#39; children over the age of sixteen who are unemployed, and still residing with their parents. The unemployment of youths is a serious problem in Australia to-day, and the concession I have suggested would be some relief to parents. The existing tax on some property owners may be onerous, as the Treasurer has said, and I know something of that from discussions which I have had with those concerned; but in a large number of  case3  property owners are among the more fortunate member* of the community, and the case in relation to them has been well put by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> We should remember that the reductions of social services which took place during the depression really represent a form of taxation. The aged and the afflicted have been called upon to pay a special tax, even now amounting to 2s. a week, which represents a very large proportion of their total income. Thus, the emergency tax levied upon them is relatively much higher even than that which property owners are called upon to pay. I trust that the Government will pay some heed to my suggestion, so that the weight of taxation may fall as equitably as possible on all sections of the community. </para>

The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> said airily that it would mean a loss of only &#163;200,000 to the revenue, and while that may be so for the present year, further similar reductions will no doubt result in further losses. In the opinion of the Minister, the property tax is most onerous; probably he considers it iniquitous, but to my mind it is nothing of the sort. </para>

                        <para>- In declaring my opposition to that part of the bill which seeks to relieve the more fortunate classes of the community of taxes amounting to &#163;220,000 a year, I emphasize that that proposal is indicative of government policy. Despite the promise made when the Financial Emergency Bill to implement the Premiers plan was before the Parliament, that when conditions improved the most hard-pressed sections of the people would be the first to be given relief, the Government has pursued an opposite course. Admittedly, as the Treasurer has pointed out, the super tax on income from property is onerous, but it is preferable to taxes which bear harshly on the less favoured classes. The super tax at least collects revenue from the people who have the capacity to pay ; and as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, it is levied, not on capital, but on the income from capital. The person who derives a small income from property is not nearly so seriously affected as are persons with incomes ranging from &#163;30,000 to &#163;50,000 a year. Some of the latter class pay about 65 per cent. of their income in taxes, and I do not think that that is justified, but at the same time, their incomes can support the burden. For that reason remission of taxes to the wealthy is not justified. When asked to reduce sales tax and other indirect taxes the Treasurer said that the budgetary position would not permit of such concessions. Yet the sales tax has a much worse effect on industry than has the property tax, because by restricting consumption it retards recovery. It cannot be claimed that the property tax has that result, and it should, therefore, remain in operation until the incidence of the sales tax is lightened. The &#163;200,000 which it is proposed to remit to the landed interests could well be diverted to the payers of sales tax. </para>

                <para>A survey of the policies of non-Labour governments throughout Australia - the State governments are following the same course as the Commonwealth Government -would show that the interests which support these governments are receiving bonuses, while the poorer interests, whose burdens are crushing, are being ignored. Before asking Parliament to remit a huge sum to the property-owners, the Government should restore invalid and old-age pensions to their pre-depression level. I heartily support the plea of the Leader of the Opposition that the Government should do this overdue justice to the aged and indigent. I also support the contention of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> that the Income Tax Assessment Act should he amended by extending exemptions granted in respect of children. At present the exemption ceases when a child reaches the age of sixteen years, but in recent years many children have remained dependent on their parents long after passing that age. The &#163;220,000 that is being remitted to wealthy property-owners could be better absorbed in either extending the exemption age or in increas-  ing the amount of the exemption for each child. This concession should be given at least 10 taxpayers whose taxable income does not exceed &#163;250. </para>
                <para>I join with the honorable member for West Sydney and the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> in appealing to the Treasurer, who is so liberal in handing out largesse to his wealthy friends, to consider this suggestion. The income tax is a hardship to people who receive low salaries, and who have to support unemployed children. I am definitely opposed to the proposed further remission of the special property tax, and I intend to vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the proposal to make further remissions to the payers of the special property tax has been made at the present juncture,  In  view of the difficulties which the ordinary working man is encountering to-day, he at least deserves some consideration when tax remissions are being granted. I had hoped that the budget speech would include a reduction of the sales tax at least to 2$ per cent. I would have favored a reduction to 1 per cent., or better still, its discontinuance. The public to-day is .shouldering a very heavy burden of taxes, and the further we get away from the period of depression the more should the great mass of the people share in the remissions of taxes. Indirect taxation, particularly the sales tax, increases the cost of living, hampers the small business man in every direction, and! brings no benefit. I think, to the master class. </para>

                        <para>- I am emphasizing the effect of indirect taxation on the community generally, and protesting against its continuance when the Government can afford to reduce the rate of the special property tax by 1 per cent. In view of the fact that many of the difficulties associated with the wheat industry appear to have been solved, I was hopeful that the budget would contain provision for the remission of &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000 of taxes. I know that the sales tax. was on a previous occasion reduced by 1 per cent., hut primary industries have received remissions of taxes in every direction. The remission of &#163;220,000 to the payers of property tax gives to those who can afford to pay a present which might well have beet bestowed in another direction. The property tax does not inflict so much hardship as does the sales tax, which has to be paid on articles of food and clothing which the poorer sections have to purchase daily. I do not suggest now that the Treasurer should retrace his steps by amending the present budget, but, in considering the financing of the Commonwealth&#39;s operations next year, at least as great consideration should be given to the working class as has been given this year to the primary producers. Not only have the primary producers had a wide range of their purchases exempted from the sales tax, but the primage also has been lifted from many of their requirements. They have received remissions of taxes in other directions. I feel justified, therefore, in making a plea on behalf of those who are contributing annually large sums to Consolidated Revenue by way of sales tax. Prosperity is returning, and with it many concessions are being given to those who have money and I am of the opinion that larger concessions could be granted to the workers. The latter are entitled to a greater share of the benefits which accompany better times; therefore,, the burdens of indirect taxation should be eased. For that reason, while I do not intend to oppose the bill, I counsel the Government, to pay more attention in future to the needs of the masses. Members of the Government party do not hear much about proposed remissions until they see them in a bill in the House. Every part of the Commonwealth is looking to the Government to honour its pledge to remove the emergency taxation, particularly the sales tax, at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with those who have protested against the remission of taxes to the wealthiest section of the community. I agree with the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane),</inline> that in this measure Parliament is granting relief to those who can afford to pay taxes. People with substantial incomes can reasonably be expected to pay taxes. If the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> is able to grant relief, it should be given to those people who are least able t.o bear the burdens. To-day people who find difficulty in meeting the ordinary commitments of life are compelled to pay indirect taxes on everything they buy. I recently suggested to the Treasurer that, before the end of the financial year, he would discover that the revenue would be considerably in excess of that for which he had budgeted. That prophecy has already been fulfilled, yet we are now asked to pass a bill for a reduction of the taxes of a section of the community which can well afford to pay them. </para>

                    <para>. - I urge upon the Government the necessity for further reduction of the super tax on property income. A few weeks ago, reference was made in the budget speech to the improved condition of the export industries, which is largely the cause of the improved budgetary position. This tax is one of the heaviest burdens imposed on industry, and particularly export industries. The best way to effect a reduction of interest rates would be to reduce the rate of tax on property income, which is one of the chief costs of many of our major industries. Consideration should be given to the abolition of the super tax. </para>

                    <para>.- I join in the protest made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> and other honorable members,, against the Government&#39;s proposal to reduce the taxes of that section of the community which is well able to meet the imposts levied  upon it.  Property-owners in industrial areas have recently increased their earnings by raising rentals. I cannot agree with the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McClelland)</inline> that the tax imposed on income derived from property has the effect, under present conditions, of limiting industrial expansion. Listening to his reasoning, one might imagine that industry was languishing because of lack of capital, rather than because of the difficulty experienced in obtaining markets. A few days ago we were discussing the need for adequate markets for surplus production. The troubles of industry to-day are due, not to a need for the stimulation of production, but to inability to sell the surplus goods produced. The tax on property income, like every other impost, whether direct or indirect, is eventually paid out of industry, and the workers are, therefore, naturally interested in any proposal to remit taxes, or to give relief from taxes to any section that is not entitled to such assistance. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has spoken lightly of the proposed remisison of the amount of &#163;200,000 ; but, in my opinion, this relief could well have been given to a more deserving section. For instance, the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> recently submitted certain amendments when we were considering the sales tax imposed on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life which are largely purchased by the workers. I was amazed to hear the remarks of the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane),</inline> who habitually makes pious protests that are never backed up by his vote in this chamber.  His  speeches are attempts to delude his electors into believing that he is fighting on their behalf. </para>

                <para>It may be contended that injustice will be done to small property-owners by refusing to sanction the proposed reduction of the tax on property income. As a matter of fact, this section will not be materially benefited by this legislation. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> was correct in saying that those who will be most assisted are those who have incomes running into many thousands of pounds a year, and who depend entirely on the income derived from this source. I refer to those who have lived on the backs of the community  for many years. I realize, however, that the action of the Government in introducing this measure is quite consistent with its general course of conduct; it has always been a class Ministry, which represents only on&#169; section of the people, and is prepared to do all kinds of oppressive things which are detrimental to the interests of the workers, in order to grant relief to its wealthy supporters. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> gave me many attractive opportunities to open up a discussion on sources of revenue generally, but I shall resist that temptation. On this and on a previous occasion the honorable member referred to the varying proportions of indirect taxes to the total revenue. I remind him that only during the last twenty years has federal income tax been levied. I also point out that direct taxation is the sole source of revenue to which the State governments have access. Quite rightly they have exploited that field during the last live or six years, in order to achieve as far as possible, balanced budgets. The result has been that Australian citizens, in either their State or their Federal capacity, have had their direct taxes substantially increased. The Government is quite ready to defend this small reduction of a tax which is admittedly an onerous one. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The point was made by the Leader of the Opposition that comparing the taxes imposed on incomes derived from personal exertion with those levied on property incomes, there is a distinct difference in favour of the former, from the taxation point of view. It was also remarked that the curve of taxation in the case of property income is a very steep one. I do not think it can be claimed that those who have large incomes are escaping their proper share of taxation. Several honorable members, led by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> have advocated increased deductions on account of children; but I point out that that is a matter for consideration in connexion with the assessment bill, and not the rates bill with which we are now dealing. Honorable members who hold that view will have a good opportunity to elaborate it when the new uniform </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> asked for further information regarding divisions A and B, which relate to the rates of tax upon incomes derived from personal exertion and from property, respectively. No doubt he was led to ask for it by reason of the fact that there is a one-step formula in regard to personal exertion income, whilst in respect to property income there is a three-step formula. The consideration of this matter takes us back into the history of taxation, and to the time when the &#34; curve &#34; was a series of steps. Through alterations by successive governments, these steps had become very irregular, and about four years ago it was decided, at the instance of Professor Giblin, to smooth out the line; but this was not possible without imposing excessive obligations upon certain taxpayers. We have now what I described earlier as a straight-line curve; the phrase created some amusement, but I am impenitent. I can assure the honorable member, however, that no departure has been made from the formula of last year. </para>

                        <para>.- Insofar as this measure gives some relief to the widows and widowed mothers of A.ustralian soldiers, as defined in section 4 of the War Service Homes Act, it has the support of the Opposition. I hope, however, that the Minister will include a provision to give the bill a retrospective effect. Many widows have lost their homes, and the Minister should see that every one is re-instated. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The principal purpose of this bill is to ensure that widows and widowed mothers are enabled to remain in their homes for the rest of their lives, and a feature of the measure is that the Minister will administer its provisions. Consequently, the Minister, who is responsible to Parliament, will be enabled to take a humanitarian view of the various cases which are brought under his notice. The bill provides that where a widow or widowed mother is unable to continue payments in connexion with the home, the total amount of the instalments may be paid out of the trust fund to liquidate her obligation to the War Service Homes Commission. </para>

                            <para>- In another part of his speech the Minister said that the debt of the widow is not being increased. In respect of a widow who is unable to pay anything off her mortgage to the War Service Homes Commission, the Minister&#39;s contention will be found to be incorrect. Let us assume that the widow owes &#163;600 to the commission on a war service home. According to the Minister, the average rate of repayment is &#163;1 a week, including interest and principal. To meet her payments to the commission, therefore, she would in effect, be obliged to borrow &#163;52 a year from the trust fund, carrying an interest rate of 4 per cent. Consequently she would pay interest on two amounts - one on the original loan from the commission, and the other on the money borrowed from the trust fund, at a rate of 4 per cent. I admit that this is an everyday business transaction. But assuming that at the end of ten years the widow dies or  wishes  to dispose of the property, instead of her equity being increased, as the Minister stated in his second-reading speech, it will actually be decreased. If a widow owed &#163;600 and was not in a position to pay anything, a sum of &#163;52 a year would be taken from the trust fund to be paid to the commission. Of this amount, in the first year approximately &#163;24 would be absorbed in interest, and &#163;28 would be paid off -the principal. The interest would, presumably, be paid on the principal outstanding. At the end of ten years, the principal would have &#39;been reduced by approximately &#163;340, leaving an amount of &#163;260 still owing to the War Service Homes Commission. If the widow had, in effect, to borrow &#163;52 a year for ten years from the trust fund to meet her commitments to the commission, she would be obliged to pay interest on that loan, and her liability in this respect at the end of the period mentioned would be &#163;520 plus &#163;114 interest, making a total of &#163;634. Thus, after ten years, the widow would still owe the commission &#163;260 on the original &#163;600 that she borrowed, plus &#163;520 from the trust fund on which &#163;114&#39; in interest had accumulated - a total liability of &#163;894. She would also have paid &#163;185 in interest on the &#163;600 originally borrowed from the War Service Homes Commission and she would owe &#163;114 in interest on the &#163;520 borrowed from the trust fund. These figures reveal that interest payments on the money borrowed from the Waa- Service Homes Commission and from the trust fund, would absorb approximately &#163;300. Even if the widowwere able to pay a few shillings a week, her equity would be practically nil, as the property would depreciate with the passing of the years and <inline font-style="italic">its</inline> value would not &#39;be comparable to the sum originally paid for the home. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that some advantage is derived from that provision, but the equity does not increase, as the Minister led the House to believe. As to what should be regarded as the income of a widow, the Minister should give a more explicit explanation. He referred to income as &#34;pensions, contributions from her family, or other sources&#34;. In what way will the Minister differentiate, for example, between the wages that the children may receive and what he considers they should pay to their mother? In many cases, the widow may not have as much control over her children&#39;s wages as the Minister might expect. Consequently, it would not be fair to assess an amount on, say, the earnings of a family irrespective of the amount received by the widow. </para>

                            <para>- There are cases in which the children will pay practically nothing. It all depends on how sympathetically the Minister administers this act. I propose now to refer to the case of a widow who is desirous of relinquishing her property. After all expenses have been met, she may have a balance of &#163;100 to her&#34; credit. In such an event, would the Minister pay the widow the full amount due to her, or would she have to wait until the new purchaser paid it off in weekly instalments? This bill will apply to .those widows of returned men who are purchasers of homes and not to those widows who are recognized as being only tenants, although they may be living in the identical home that their husbands had contracted to buy. I shall cite a case in point. A soldier contracted to purchase the home and when he died his illness had so enfeebled his widow that she did not take out letters of administration. Consequently, the house reverted to the commission after a given period. At the time of the husband&#39;s death, no arrears were owing on the dwelling. The -man had deposited &#163;15S in order to borrow &#163;700, and had spent another &#163;30 on improvements not provided for in the plans. The widow arranged to rent the house as a tenant at 10s. a week. In September last, legal proceedings instituted against ber culminated in an eviction warrant being issued. The arrears of rent were less than &#163;50. </para>

                            <para>- Morally the woman has an equity of approximately &#163;150, but because of her ignorance of legal, procedure, she lost the home and was evicted. The commission denied thai she is or was a purchaser, and according to the letter which the Minister forwarded to her friends, any one in a similar position would not be entitled to relief under this measure. Many widows have surrendered their rights voluntarily to become tenants on the commission&#39;s terms, and have economised in every way to retain a. home which is of some sentimental value to them. I should like the Minister to say whether the measure will be extended to widows whose husbands were purchasing war service homes regardless of whether the widow is or is not to-day recognized as the purchaser. However, as the bill gives some relief to the widows of returned soldiers and widowed mothers the Opposition intends to support it. </para>

                        <para>.-There are several phases of this measure to which I wish to direct the attention of honorable members. The Minister has not explained why it is proposed to appoint the Commissioner for a term of seven years instead of three years as previously. I agree with what the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has said regarding the effect of this measure upon widows whose husbands were purchasing war service homes. If a widowed mother, with the assistance she may receive from members of her family, is able to pay the amount required, she will be able to retain the  home, but if that amount is not forthcoming she will have no security whatever. Apparently the small amount received from her family will be regarded in the same light as under the Permissible Income Relief Act of New South Wales, and it will, therefore, be taken into account. If the amount which the commission demands is not paid- </para>

                            <para>- Yes, she will be evicted. That is one of the points which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister. If the Government would adopt the provisions of the Queensland act relating to workmen&#39;s homes, the widows of returned soldiers would derive some benefit. Under that act the person who undertakes to purchase a home in 30 years takes out a life assurance policy on which he pays the premium. When the purchaser dies all further payments cease, and the home becomes the property of the widow. The average life of the purchaser, after effecting the purchase is fifteen years, so that repayment of interest and principal extends on an average over a period of fifteen years instead of 30 years. Even if the purchaser dies at the end of, say, four or five years, the widow receives the property free of all debt. That is an infinitely better scheme than that embodied in the bill which provides that if the widow cannot continue to pay the amount demanded by the commission she has to vacate the property. If a widow is in possession of a property on which &#163;600 is owing she will, in ten years, have paid &#163;337 off the principal, but she will still be owing &#163;263 to the commission. If she is unable to pay the weekly instalment of &#163;1 and is assisted to that amount from the trust fund, she will in ten year3 have incurred a debt to the fund of &#163;520, plus &#163;114&#34; for interest. She will still owe &#163;263 to the commission ; thus, her total liability will have increased to &#163;897. In addition, she would also have paid rates and taxes and maintenance costs. Instead of receiving some relief her indebtedness will have increased. The capital debt on the property will be increasing all the time. If the widow should die no other member of the family can assume responsibility for the indebtedness; but, if she should remarry, the husband may take over the liability if he so desires. If he should decline to do so she loses all that she has paid. In committee I propose to move that, after section 36a of the principal act the following new section be inserted : - 3fin. The purchaser shall effect and until the contract of sale is fully performed keep in operation an insurance upon his life in an amount sufficient to pay to the Minister, in the event of the death of the purchaser, the full amount of the unpaid purchase money and other moneys secured by the contract of sale and this act. Such policy of life assurance shall be assigned to and held by the Minister: Provided that the Minister in his discretion may accept in lieu of the policy of insurance aforesaid any existing policy of life assurance which is in the Minister&#39;s opinion a sufficient security. </para>

                            <para>- Prom the Queensland act. If that provision were embodied in the bill there would be some security for the widow and the home would revert to her children, and not to the Government. The Government is always safeguarded, because whatever amount may be paid prior to the death of the purchaser, the Government can repossess the property if the widow cannot continue the payments. We speak sometimes of the action of unscrupulous landlords who &#34; take people down &#34; ; but the Government is putting over the same trick. </para>

                            <para>- It is in &#39;so far as the Government loses nothing, and may eventually obtain possession of a property which was being purchased by a returned soldier with his war gratuity and any other money he was able to raise. If the widow is unable to continue the payments the equity of the purchaser is gone, and the Government does not lose a penny. Under the Queensland homes purchase scheme the purchaser insures his life, and on his death the home becomes the property of the widow without further payment. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but that is not dealt with in the section which I have quoted. Under the Queensland act the occupants of homes and their widows are protected. Is the &#163;5,000 to be expended the limit of the Government&#39;s liability? </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see how the purchaser&#39;s equity in the home is to be safeguarded, as the indebtedness will increase. The debt on a property costing &#163;600 may increase with trustfund payments, water and sewerage rates, and charges for painting and repairs, &#38;c, at the rate of &#163;100 a year, so that in ten years the property may cost over &#163;1,500. The Minister also said that, following the death of the widow, the members of her family would be able to realize on the home and thus discharge the debt due to the commission; but, as I have shown, the value of the home will be far below the amount of the indebtedness. The Minister also said that under this scheme payments would be made from the trust fund to meet the instalments, and that the accrued debt, including interest on the amount advanced from the trust fund, would be a first charge against the home. It seems to me that it would not matter much whether the debt was a first or a, last charge on the home, because the debt would be constantly increasing, and at the end of ten years, on an original debt of &#163;600, the liability would be at least &#163;897. Then the Minister went on to explain that, if the widow remarried, the husband would accept the full responsibility for any payments made from the trust fund. I doubt that, in the circumstances mentioned, the husband could reasonably be expected to take a double risk - the widow and the indebtedness on her home.  His  position would be analogous to that of the fly, invited by the spider to walk into her parlour. </para>

                    <para>I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to the amendment which I have suggested, together with the reasons given for its acceptance, and that even at this late hour, he will incorporate in the bill liberalizing provisions of the nature indicated, so that the scheme may be of some real benefit to war widows.The original war service homes scheme was drawn up very hastily. </para>
                    <para>The home endowment scheme established by Arthur Rickard and Company Limited, of Sydney, is one which I commend to the Minister. Under that scheme the purchaser takes out a life insurance policy for the amount of the debt on the home, and should he die before the expiration of the term fixed for repayments, his widow is given a clean discharge of the debt. The weekly payments in respect of a home of a value equal to that of a war service home are, I think, only about 2s. a week in excess of the payments under the State Government scheme which are again far lower than the rate paid under the war service homes scheme. The homes of the soldiers have been over-capitalized. </para>

It is apparent that, in order to disarm criticism and perhaps also to silence public outcry, following evictions of widows, the Government has brought forward this scheme. </para>

                        <para>.- I congratulate the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> and the Government on the measure, and I wish at the outset to correct a wrong impression caused by the remarks of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden),</inline> who said that all the agitation for liberalization of the provisions of the War Service Homes Act came from one political party. Ever since I have been a member of this House, I have consistently advocated relief along the lines of this bill. By invitation, I have attended many meetings to consider the difficulties of purchasers of war service homes, and on no occasion have I heard my political opponents advocate the adoption of a life insurance scheme. To-night, for the first time, we have had honorable members opposite urging that the Government should include such a provision in the bill so that, in the event of the death of the soldier purchaser, the widow would have her home free of all charges. </para>

                    <para>The bill contains provisions which will be of substantial benefit to the widows of returned soldiers, and it should command the support of every honorable member. Under the Government&#39;s scheme, should the husband die, the widow will be entitled to live in the home at a nominal rental, but if she is unable to meet this charge the house will not be taken from her. An honorable member referred to the ejectment of a widow because she was in arrears with her rent to an amount of &#163;50. If that happened, all that I can say is that her representative in this Parliament did not look after her interests very well. I am acquainted with the case of a woman who has paid no rent for two years and is still in occupation of the premises. She has a child sis years of age, and out of her income of 32s. 6d. a week she will be asked, under this scheme, to paya bout 8s. a week. </para>

                            <para>- No proposal of this Government would be regarded by the honorable member as having any value. The Government which he supported destroyed the possibility of a poor man getting anything. He knows that this Government has made steady progress towards the rehabilitation of every class of the community. Under the provisions of this measure, any widow who cau show that she is not capable of earning anything will be allowed to remain in her home without payment until her death. Is that of no value? Will honorable members opposite vote against it? I have always urged returned soldiers to advocate what is practicable. I assure this House that at no meeting within the last three years - and I have attended almost every meeting called by the War Service Homes Purchasers Association, outside as well as inside my electorate - have I heard honorable members of the New South Wa.les State Labour party who sit opposite advocate an insurance scheme. If I cannot see how such a scheme could be adopted by the Government, they will charge me with having refused to support it. That is not my attitude at all. But I do refuse to be led by them, for the simple reason that they have always landed the workers in all sorts of difficulties. That will be the experience of widows of returned soldiers if the beneficial provisions of this bill are not enacted. The Minister has said that if airy widow has been evicted within the last five years she will be permitted to return to a suitable home. Honorable members opposite do not espouse the cause of these widows, but merely advise them to let the Government put them out of their homes. A photographer from the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Truth</inline> is sent to take a photograph, and her difficulties are blazoned throughout the State with the object of obtaining a political advantage. </para>

                        I have several times called the honorable member to order, and asked him to discuss the bill. Bus latest remarks are purely an attack upon certain honorable members because of what they have done outside this House, and have no connexion with the bill. If he will confine his remarks to the measure I shall ensure that he is not unduly interrupted.

                            <para>- I assure honorable members that they will do the right thing if they support the bill, which will prove a blessing to those unfortunate women who have lost their husbands. I have always maintained that the scheme of war service homes is of very little value to the returned soldier. A widow who takes over a property on which there is a liability of &#163;600 or &#163;800 has no chance of ever becoming the owner of it. That applies also to the returned soldier on the basic wage who assumed responsibility for the liability in more prosperous times when he was earning &#163;5 or &#163;6 a week, and has since had his wages reduced. I agree with the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> that the capital values of these homes are too high. A mau upon a very low wage will never own one of these homes although he is given 38 years to complete the payments on it. </para>

                            <para>- The point that I am. making is that a widow with a small income cannot hope to discharge a liability amounting to &#163;800. Even on an income of &#163;3 a week it would take her about  30 years  to complete the payments, and there is grave doubt as to whether she would ever possess the property. I covered my indebtedness with insurance as soon as I purchased a home 30 years ago, but I had only a liability of more than &#163;400. No woman can expect to own a property on which the indebtedness is &#163;800. The bill embodies one of the most humane provisions that for a long time this House has been asked to consider, and I give the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> the major portion of the credit for it. Almost immediately upon his appointment to the Ministry I had an interview with, the honorable gentleman. He then said &#34; If ever I have the opportunity, one of the first things that I shall do is to make provision for the widow of a returned soldier to have her home until she dies. If she is not able to make any payment, she will have it without charge; and any charge made will be in accordance with her ability to pay.&#34; I hope that honorable members opposite will do nothing that might destroy the effectiveness of  this  measure. It is not a trick, as the honorable member for Cook has suggested. The Government is not seeking to injure the widows of returned soldiers, but is honestly and sincerely attempting to afford them relief. This is one of the best measures that this Parliament will ever be called upon to pass. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill may be described as one of the most generous measures ever brought before this Parliament. I, however, do not choose to regard its proposals as an example of generosity on the part of the Government. Rather do I think that they are indicative of a very acute sense of responsibility towards exsoldiers and their widows. But I point out that the widows of another section of returned soldiers who have had consideration extended to them by this Parliament, are not yet similarly covered. I refer to soldier settlers who it was intended should be just as  Well  treated as a reward for their war service. The predecessors of the present Government arranged with  the  different States to cater for these men. but on the basis adopted it was quite hopeless to expect successful results to accrue. It is well known that the soldier settlement undertaken by the States on behalf of the Commonwealth has been a complete failure, and has led  to  a chaotic state of affairs arising. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden.)</inline> has proposed a form of compulsory insurance for the purchasers of  war service homes by which their widow* would receive a clear title to their homes at their death. Worthy as his object is, I believe that his amendment would really defeat its own purpose. The bill is evidence of the Government&#39;s realization of the obligation resting on the people of Australia to provide homes for the widows of ex-soldiers who undertook to purchase war service homes. It proposes that such widows shall be assured of a home&#39; over their heads during their lifetime with no payment whatever in some cases. It even provides for the payment of rates and taxes, and for the maintenance of the homes. This legislation places on the shoulders of the whole community the responsibility for providing homes for widows of ex-soldiers. The proposal of the honorable member for Cook really means that ex-soldier purchasers of war service homes who still live would have an additional burden placed upon them, in that they would be required to provide homes for the widows of their deceased comrades. The honorable member&#39;s proposal is only half-baked, because any scheme of compulsory insurance which does not provide for a medical examination would probably lead people not in good health and with only a short expectation, of life to become home purchasers, as a means of assuring a home for their dependants, thereby placing an undue burden on the insurance fund. The honorable member&#39;s proposal is, however, worthy of consideration in the case of homes for other than ex-soldiers. Any sound scheme of insurance must stand actuarial investigation ; but although the honorable member for Cook has not suggested any actuarial investigation of his scheme, it is not on that ground that I differ from him in regard to it. The honorable member suggests that the responsibility for caring for the widows of ex-soldiers should be borne by the purchasers of war service homes who are still living. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 compliment the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> on having introduced a measure which will receive the approbation of all organizations of ex-soldiers, as well as of other organizations in the community which are concerned with the welfare of the dependants of ex-service men. Although no legislation can compensate women for the loss of their husbands, the bill will help the widows of ex-soldiers to face problems which would not have been theirs in other circumstances. The object of this legislation is to give security of tenure to war widows whose husbands, if they had lived, would have been able to support them and place them in more affluent circumstances than those in which they find themselves to-day. The provisions for the payment of rates and taxes, and for the repair of the home in certain circumstances, will be of great assistance to them. I doubt whether any association of returned soldiers would consent to a compulsory scheme of insurance. Possibly the Minister can enlighten us regarding the views of the soldiers&#39; organizations, with whom he has, no doubt, discussed the question. The bill, which should be received with general approval, contains no contentious clauses, and I hope that it will have a speedy passage through the House. It legislates to help the women whose men paid the great sacrifice for Australia. &#39; </para>

                        <para>.- Seeing that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> has assured us that the bill is acceptable to the purchasers  of war service homes, and that they have refused a scheme of compulsory insurance, the Opposition will not oppose it. Already about &#163;29,000,000 has been invested in homes for soldiers throughout Australia, the total number of such homes being 36,895. The  reason why the returned soldiers&#39; organizations, as we are told, have rejected a scheme of compulsory insurance may be that the youngest exsoldier in possession of a war service home would be about 35 years old. Under the Workers&#39; Homes Act of Queensland, repayments are spread over 30 years, with the result that the annual payments are comparatively small. The premiums depend on the value of the house and the age of the purchaser. A  deposit of 5 per cent, on the value of the homes is required. In the case of a house worth &#163;600, the deposit would, therefore, be &#163;30, whereas under the War Service Homes Act, the deposit was originally 10 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The great thing, about the Queensland legislation is that immediately the home purchaser signs the contract he is insured, so that should he be killed in an accident within an hour, the home is built and handed over to his widow free of debt. Should he remain alive during the full 30 years provided in the act, he obtains the freehold of his home and also a life insurance policy valued at about &#163;600.  He  may, however, take advantage of the &#34; disappearing policy &#34; under which he pays a lower rental and at the end of 30 years owns his home, but the policy then lapses. </para>

                    <para>The war service homes erected in different parts of Australia are greatly over-capitalized. In Queensland it is not difficult to find in close proximity to war service homes, workers&#39; homes which although built at a lower cost, are superior to the war service homes. Largely because of excessive prices paid, for land, most of the homes built for ex-soldiers are valued at too &#39;high a figure. Because of illness, probably due to war service, or broken time in employment, or the smallness of their pensions, many purchasers get into arrears with their payments. At the end of every five years or six years they have to repaint the homes and effect various repairs. This entails borrowing until the majority of purchasers find themselves faced with a rate of repayment for interest and redemption which they cannot meet. This bill gives some concession to the widows of returned soldiers, but where occupants of a war service home are in employment and earning income, and are expected to make contributions towards repayments on the home it should be possible to insure, say, a young member of the family, about 23 or 24 years of age, and arrange for the purchase of the home at a rental rate which would be inclusive of the amount of a premium on that insurance policy. </para>

                            <para>- In Queensland, a son, aged about 24 years, who is the main, support of his widowed mother would, in respect of a house valued at &#163;600, pay about 16s. a week for 30 years. The rental he pays is a rate assessed as being sufficient to cover, not only purchase instalments and insurance, but also repainting and depreciation over the full period. Where the son of a returned soldier can do this he and his mother are much better off, and the anxiety of the mother to receive the benefits of the repayments already made by the deceased husband is met. </para>

                        <para>. - Although I studiously avoid bringing up matters of a district nature in a debate of this character, I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister in Charge of War Service Homes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby),</inline> a purely South Australian matter, which was considered to be of such importance that a few years ago the Hill Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into it. Like many other royal commissions this one made certain recommendations, but as yet not one of them has been given effect. My remarks concern the town of Murray Bridge in my electorate, where subsequent to the war a large number of war service homes was built, not only by the War Service Homes Commission, but also by the State bank, acting in co-operation with the commission. At that time Murray Bridge was an important railway centre. However, following the importation of an American, who was appointed Railways Commissioner in South Australia, these men were transferred to Tailem Bend, some fifteen miles away. At this place the Railways Commissioner built houses and the men were compelled to rent them, whether they required them or not. The result was that these men, all of whom were wage-earners, were placed in occupation of houses for which they had to pay rent at Tailem Bend whilst they were under a liability in respect of houses at Murray Bridge. </para>

                            <para>- I understand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that when a bill is introduced to amend the War Service Homes Act the only limitation to a second-reading debate on the measure is the scope of the act which it is sought to amend. I should like to know if in this debate we are confined merely to what is contained in this measure, or whether matters although actually outside the measure, but nevertheless within the scope of the act. can be discussed? </para>

                            <para>- The matter I desire to discuss is of considerable importance from my point of view, and has been the subject of correspondence between the Minister and myself; but, as I still feel that the Minister is not yet fully seised of the facts as I know them, I crave this opportunity to place them before him. These facts are relevant to the case with which I am dealing, and I am putting them forward with a view to securing redress for certain people to whom I owe responsibility. I repeat that the South Australian Government viewed this case so seriously that it gave to a royal commission which was then inquiring into railway matters additional power to report upon the conditions and responsibilities of these particular men at Murray Bridge. </para>

I should be very much obliged to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> if you could give the House a definite ruling as to whether the Crown only has the right to suggest amendments of this legislation. I understand that, once a bill is brought down, in order to effect an amendment of an act, there is no limit to which honorable members can go in order to amend that act still further. I should like to know whether you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> rule definitely that honorable members are allowed to discuss only those grievances which the Government desires to have redressed. </para>

I wish to be patient, and I think honorable members will agree that I have been very patient with the honorable member. The meaning of the bill is clear. It seeks to amend the War Service Homes Act in certain respects, which are very definitely set out. An honorable member may move an amendment to the bill, but, the rule of relevancy must always be observed in respect of either amendments or debate. </para>

                        <para>.- I am pleased that this bill has been introduced, for although it will not afford very much actual assistance to the widows of exsoldiers, it will at least assure them of continuity in the occupation of their homes, and give them a sense of security which hitherto they have lacked. Public opinion has, no doubt, compelled the Government to introduce this measure. </para>

                            <para>- I have many occupiers of war service homes living in my electorate, and I know that an active agitation has been on foot for two or three years to obtain relief for ex-soldiers&#39; widows from the burdensome conditions that at present apply to the occupancy of their war service homes. The honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(-Mr. Lane)</inline> knows that this is true. I had not been a member of this Parlament for very long before I had occasion to bring under the notice of the Government the case of a widow who bad been served with an ejectment order in respect of the war service home which her husband, who had been dead for only a few weeks, had been purchasing. This man had paid his instalments over a number of years, right up to the time of his illness; but nevertheless the Campsie court was asked to issue an ejectment order against this widow. The circumstances of this lady were pitiable in the extreme. She was absolutely penniless, and was in grave danger of finding herself and her young children without a roof over their heads. I instructed my own solicitor to appear in court on her behalf to obtain an extension of time for her. Meanwhile the Minister in charge of &#34;War Service Homes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> withdrew the summons. I think he will admit that this is true. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; also the fact that such a scheme of insurance would not affect those who are already widows. I agree with the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> that there <inline font-style="italic">&#38;re</inline> other phases of the purchasers&#39; difficulties, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will not permit them to be discussed in this bill I must refrain from doing so. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> has made some very good promises which, if carried out - and I have no doubt they will be, and that the provisions of this bill will be sympathetically administered by the department - will result in great benefit to the soldiers&#39; widows. However, this measure does not touch upon the greatest difficulty under -which the war service homes purchasers labour. The ideal aimed, at when the original war service homes legislation was introduced was that every soldier should be able to purchase a home which he could leave to his widow and children. Nothing in this measure gets us any closer to that objective. As a matter of fact, it definitely ends any possibility of the widow getting possession . of her home. But inasmuch as it ensures her at least a roof over her head as long as she lives it will do some good. If however her income - only on paper - is to be taken into consideration without having regard to the circumstances of the home and family, justice will not be done to the widow. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see how an insurance scheme could be successfully embraced in the bill at this stage; it would not be fair to impose it on the soldier except on a voluntary basis, and, in any case, it would not affect the widows which this bill is designed to assist. I cannot help expressing my disappointment that the bill does nothing to help us in the efforts which we on this side have made for many years to try to retain for the soldier&#39;s widow the home which the soldier endeavoured to pay off. As I have said, I can see in this measure a vanishing of the last possible hope of reaching that objective. The mere fact that the Minister has to resort to the methods which he has outlined in order to maintain a roof over the widow&#39;s head removes the last possible chance the widow has of paying off her home. All that is proposed in order to help her stay in the home will merely increase the liability to the commission. But as I cannot suggest any way of overcoming that particular difficulty I intend to support the bill as a means of assisting the soldiers&#39; widows. </para>

                        <para>.- It is not my intention to oppose the passage of this bill, because I realize that at  least some one somewhere will gain advantage from it, hut the vast majority of widows will not. The proposal we have before us is merely a tinkering with one of the big problems which the Government has to face. The Government has provided 36,895 war service homes, which means that there are practically an equal number of families depending upon it to do something to extricate them from the difficulties in which they find themselves to-day. Out of the total number of homes provided only S,565 have been paid off up to the present time, and according to the War Service Homes Commissioner&#39;s report, 2,602 have reverted to the commission, a very large proportion because those who were endeavouring to pay them off have been evicted by this Government and its predecessors </para>

                            <para>- I believe the bill does not go far enough, and that there should be incorporated in it a measure of assistance not only to widows, but also to the many soldier purchasers who find themselves in impossible circumstances, and who, like the 2,602 purchasers already evicted from their homes, are waiting for eviction to come their way. Unless we get right to the root of this problem it will be difficult to appreciate how we can best help the widows, those who have been evicted, and those who, in the near future, are faced with the prospect of eviction. The commissioner&#39;s report discloses that, out of a total of &#163;1S, 000,000 due in instalments up to, the 30th June this year, the arrears amount to over &#163;1,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has made many promises, and has claimed that widows will benefit as the result of this legislation. I feel that I am entitled to examine the value of his promises by referring to some of his performances. During the last twelve months, more war service homes purchasers have been brought before the courts for the purpose of eviction than during the regime of any previous Minister in charge of War Service Homes. </para>

                            <para>- When I called the honorable member for Dalley to order, he was saying, in effect, that he proposed to challenge the sincerity of the Minister by referring to his past performances. That remark was irrelevant to the subject-matter of the bill. The honorable member then referred to the number of evictions from war service homes, although I had already ruled that that phase of the subject might not be discussed, except so far as it related to the occupants of war service homes affected by the bill, which deals with certain phases only of war service administration, and contains specific amendments to certain sections of the act. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister thinks it unfair, let me point out to him that more purchasers have been evicted from their  home3  while he has been in office than during the regime of a previous Minister. He has authorized more prosecutions for the purpose of securing eviction than has any previous Minister who occupied his position. From the 1st August, 1932, to the 31st July, 1933, 08 applications were made in the courts of New South Wales for ejectment orders against war service homes purchasers. During the succeeding twelve months the number was 127. while from the 1st August, 1934, to the 30th September. 1935, during which time the present Minister has been in control, there were 121 applications for ejectment orders. </para>

                            <para>- When the soldiers were  going  off to fight, they were not told that the courts  would  examine their affairs  upon  their return to determine whether or not they should be evicted from their homes. I presume that the Minister cannot guarantee that widows will be placed back in the homes they left. That being so, the question arises who is to determine the suitability of the homes placed at their disposal. Is the matter to be determined by the department or by the widow herself ? I assume that the widow will have to sign a new contract for the purchase of the home, and, if that be so, she should he entitled to choose the home she <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> to buy. </para>

                    <para>The Minister suggested ;hat, through the creation of a trust fund, war widows would be relieved of some of their obligations. Hb cited as an example the case of a widow who owed the commission &#163;S00, and said that the monthly instalment on that amount would normally be about &#163;4. If, however, the widow was able to pay only &#163;1 a month, the other &#163;3 would be paid out of the trust fund. I point out to honorable members that, in such a case, the widow would owe the trust fund, at the end of twelve months, &#163;36 for instalments, and &#163;1 10s. for interest, a total of &#163;37 10s. The trust fund would have paid &#163;36 on behalf of the widow, but &#163;32 of that would represent interest, and only &#163;4 would be paid off the capital cost of the building. At the end of twelve months the widow would still owe &#163;796 principal, and, in addition, she would owe the trust fund &#163;37 10s., making a total of &#163;833 10s. That is, assuming that she was able to pay her rates and taxes, but if she were not, and they were paid out of the trust fund, at the end of twelve months she would probably be indebted to the trust fund, and in respect of capital indebtedness, to the amount of &#163;850. It docs not matter to the widow whether her debt to the War Service Homes Commission is charged to the original capital indebtedness or to the trust fund ; the debt would  accumulate  at the rate of &#163;50 a year, if she were not able to pay the rates and taxes and they were met from the trust fund. </para>
                    <para>The next question to be settled is the income of the widow. The view taken by the Minister is that everything that comes into her home is to be regarded as her income, but an every-day view of the situ ation should be taken. Everybody, I think, will appreciate the fallacy of the argument that, if three or four children of a widow are each earning a couple of pounds a week, their earnings should be classed as part of her income. Apparently, the same formula will be applied by this Government as is being applied by the Government of New South Wales, which, in assessing the income of a relief worker, takes into consideration the earnings of every member of his family, from the youngest to the oldest child, irrespective of whether or not the parents receive the full benefit of those earnings. Invalid and old-age pensions and every other source of income are also considered. Does the Minister who is the final arbiter in this matter really consider that the war widow or any other widow, for that matter, can be deemed to be in possession of the whole of the earnings of. her family? An every-day view of the facts will lead us to believe that when the children reach ages between 18 years and 24 years, the parents are very lucky if they receive board money. From the remarks of the Minister, however, it is not a question of board, but of the whole of the earnings. He might possibly have used the wrong words, but the implication to be taken from his interjection in reply to the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy)</inline> is that he is going to assess a widow&#39;s earnings on a scale which will involve consideration of the earnings of her family. I ask him to state whether he believes that a war widow, whether she receives it or not, should be credited with the whole of the earnings of her children. </para>
                    <para>I am glad that the question of equity has been raised. When the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gander)</inline> made representations to the War Service Homes Commission on this point, it was decided that a person for whom he was acting who was about to abandon a war service home contract had &#163;80 worth of equity in the home. But, when he made application to have that amount paid over to the retiring occupant, he was informed that it would not be available until the person who signed the new contract had paid the whole of the money due to the commission. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Reid, I think, will bear out what I say. When he wanted the &#163;80 equity after the contract had been handed by one party to another, it was declared by the commission that the &#163;80 would not be paid over until the new contractor had met his commitments. A continuance of that policy will place widow occupants of war service homes in a difficult position. If a widow finds herself not in a position to continue her contract, or is forced by some other circumstances to abandon her home when she has &#163;50 or &#163;60 worth of equity in it, she should be entitled to the money immediately after vacating the premises. She might abandon the home in order to get the money to start in some small business or to enter some new sphere of life. If the commission decides to continue its policy that, until the new contractor pays the whole or portion of the money, the widow is not entitled to it, she should be warned beforehand. When a widow abandons her home in the circumstances I have mentioned, it is natural to assume that she desires the use of the equity at once. The Minister should give a definite indication of what the policy is to be, especially as he made so much of the matter of equity in his speech. He should give an assurance that any widow who abandons her home and has an equity in it will be paid that equity immediately. She should be told that the commission is prepared to take the risk of the new tenant defaulting in payments. The equity is there and the widow who leaves the premises should not be burdened with the risk that the new occupant will not meet the instalments. It is unlikely, however, that many of the widowed occupants of war service homes will have a great deal of equity in the homes, because the average accupant has great difficulty in maintaining payments. Many widows are saddled with arrears at the time of their husband&#39;s death. Although when alive, the husband was able to keep up the payments, very often the widow, when she takes over the lease, gets in arrears to the commission. It is most difficult to see how an equity can exist for long in the case of a widow who owes &#163;800 to the commission if the indebtedness is to be increased by &#163;33 a year, which will mean that any equity which might exist will rapidly disappear. </para>

                    <para>I appreciate the difficulty facing the Government in considering the formula- tion of any equitable form of insurance to meet the desire of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> to devise some scheme -whereby people who have contracted to purchase war service homes might get additional protection, but I realize the enormous risk which would be involved in any insurance company insuring the returned soldier occupants of those premises, the youngest of whom would to-day be middle-aged. The risk of insurance is accentuated by the fact that it has been reliably stated that the reasonable expectation of life of returned soldiers has been greatly shortened by their war service. Accordingly, even if an insurance scheme were promulgated, the premiums would be so high that they would be beyond the means of the average purchaser of the homes. But there is a scheme under which the homes are insured, and I understand that the Minister is already giving some consideration to the question of insurance. </para>

The assurance given to-night to the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> may relieve the situation, because I understood the Minister to give an undertaking that, if an ex-soldier&#39;s widow had a young son or daughter, he would be prepared to allow the commission to arrange insurance on his or her life instead of that of the father or mother. If that be so, the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> has not made his representations to-night in vain. </para>

                        <para>.-This measure 13 the outcome of a good deal of agitation on the part of honorable members, and I am pleased that it has been introduced. It represents a forward step, although it does not give all the assistance tha t could be desired. One would imagine from the remarks of certain honorable members that the Government desired to evict the ex-soldiers&#39; widows who are in occupation of war service homes; but, after perusing the mass of correspondence on my own files, I cannot find one case in which eviction has occurred. I quite realize that a Minister devoid of humane instincts could, if he chose, evict in certain circumstances, yet the bill before us gives more protection to the occupants than they have enjoyed in the past. I may remark parenthetically that I am not altogether satisfied with the past administration of war service homes generally. In South Australia some of the returned soldier occupants have suffered hardship owing to lack of employment, with consequent arrears of rent, and unfortunately a few have suffered eviction. This bill does not approach the general question of war service homes, but deals with war widows. We have heard to-night many assertions that evictions of war widows have taken place, but I believe that the Minister will be able to inform the House that in no instance has this been the case. This bill is designed to help both the widows and the widowed mothers of ex-soldiers. It is along right lines, and has my support. </para>

                        <para>. - I have in my constituency a large number of occupants of war service homes, and as I have no doubt that many of them will look to the reports of the parliamentary debates for ah explanation of the purpose of this bill, the very sanguine and exaggerated estimates of what it will do should be corrected. It has been said by honorable members on both sides that it will confer rights upon widows, but, of course, it will not. It merely empowers the Minister to decide which widow or widowed mother, if any, shall have whatever the bill has to offer. It gives no rights to anybody. No widow or widowed mother has any legally enforceable claim to anything under this measure. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> and several other honorable members have said that the widow and the widowed mother will hold their houses for life, free of disturbance, but it is not proposed under the bill to confer any such right. The Minister, in the first place, will decide whether the benefits of this legislation will be given to this or to that woman. He can refuse them to one, and grant them to the other. The question arises as to what are the benefits to be conferred under the bill. It does not release the occupant of any obligation to pay purchase money or interest, nor does it release her from her obligation to repay any advance by way of insurance money, or rates and taxes that may have been paid on her behalf by the commission, or advanced out of the trust account. She remains liable to pay these amounts, and the bill makes provision for this at the outset. Sub-section 2 of the proposed new section 29aa provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">Under section 34, &#34; advance &#34; includes insurance, rates, and taxes, &#38;c, that may have been paid on behalf of the occupant. All she gets, if she receives the Minister&#39;s consideration, is the privilege for the time being of making smaller payments than she would otherwise be called upon to meet. Nevertheless, there remains the power of the Minister, under section 36 of the act, to cancel a widow&#39;s contract at any time upon default for the prescribed period. I do not suggest that the Minister would arbitrarily use that power, but it is vested in him. Another point is that the widow, or widowed mother does not receive the title of the house until she has completed the payments on it. If she falls into arrears, no provision in this bill exempts her from the exercise by the Minister of the powers conferred upon him, under the act. I welcome the measure as it allows the Minister a certain degree of discretion which he appears not to possess at present in dealing with such cases. But it goes no further than that. It merely states that the Minister may, whenever, in his opinion, the demanding of instalments from a widow or widowed mother would be a hardship, reduce the amount of such instalments. But that does not reduce the amount of her debt. She continues to be liable to pay the whole of the debt, and if she falls into arrears for the period of three months prescribed by section 36, legal proceedings to enforce payment may still be taken, and the cancellation of the contract follow. It is a great mistake and a great pity to exaggerate the benefit which this bill confers on widows and widowed mothers. It does not give them, as a right, any security, and it does not provide for their remaining in their houses -without anxiety during the remainder of their lives. At least, one honorable member, apparently, considers that the bill does provide for the widows and widowed mothers to remain in their houses during their lifetime without fear of eviction if they fail to keep up their payments, and that no payments will be required until after their death. </para>

While not doubting the Minister&#39;s good-will and sympathy, I am merely endeavouring to correct false impressions of the bill in the minds of honorable members. The unfortunate part of it is that such, false impressions may be communicated by the press and the parliamentary debates to the widows and widowed mothers who may be led to believe that the measure confers rights upon them, which it does not. Possibly the bill goes as far as is practicable, and probably it is necessary for the Minister to possess this discretionary power, which he may or may not exercise, to reduce the instalments payable by a widow or widowed mother. </para>

The Minister or honorable members cannot deny that this measure has been introduced because of a constant and persis-  tent agitation against the hardships imposed on the widows of soldiers.

                        <para>- The Minister took credit for the withdrawal of a summons issued against the occupant of a war service home. As a matter of fact, the returned soldiers threatened to surround the home, and deal with any person sent there to carry out the instructions of the Minister to evict the widow and children. As a result of that threat, the Minister withdrew the summons. Apparently a soldier must die before his wife or children can receive any consideration. While the husband is alive the woman receives no consideration. In my opinion this is a misguided policy. The struggle of a family for existence is often more severe when an infirm returned soldier is living than after his death. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> referred to a certain eviction, and the Minister asked, by way of interjection, whether the woman was a widow.  His  interrogation proves my assertion; no consideration is given until a soldier is deceased. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, this bill confers no benefits whatever on the widows and widowed mothers. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> explained the position very clearly. If the unfortunate widows and their children are to be dependent on the Minister&#39;s discretionary powers, my experience warns me that they will receive little consideration from the present Government. The object of the bill is to vest in the Crown certain war service homos at present occupied by widows. The harsh and inconsiderate methods of the department have resulted in the throwing of thousands of these homes on the .market. This bill is an attempt to retain a remnant of them in the possession of the commission. The Minister stated that the principal purpose of the bill was to introduce a scheme - a very good word ! To my mind the scheme is designed to &#34; rope in &#34; as contributors to the War Service Homes Commission the children, relatives, and future husbands of widows and widowed mothers, in order to retain the few remaining homes within the power of the commission. To contend, as the Minister did in his second-reading speech, that the bill makes provision for the widows, and at the same time secures the revenues of the Crown, is futile. In most instances, if the widows were not in straitened circumstances, there would be no necessity for this measure. The bill obviously postulates the penury of a large section of the widows of returned soldiers, and cannot both secure the home to the widow, who is unable to meet her commitments, and at the same time secure the revenues of the Crown. The debt is being merely transferred from the war service homes accounts to a trust fund and the rate of interest now charged by the Commissioner will be charged on all the accumulated indebtedness. It is simply pretending to do something which cannot be accomplished. The Minister is to have power to take into consideration the amount of income received by widows. </para>

As the Minister is to arrange for such inquiries to be conducted, honorable members will have an opportunity to ascertain what action is being taken in particular cases; but there is no appeal from the decision of the Minister. I shall oppose clause 2, which provides that the Commissioner shall be appointed foi- a term of seven years instead of three years, as has been the custom previously. If this proposal were referred to the purchasers of war service homes, I know that they  would not favourthe re-appointment of the Commissioner for such a long period. </para>

                            - I should like to reply be some of the criticism levelled against this hill, which is designed deliberately to provide relief to returned soldier purchasers of war service homes,to widows, widowed mothers, and wives of war service homes purchasers who are temporarily or permanently insane. The Government has gone out of its way in an honest endeavour to provide a fund from which to pay any amount by which the widow&#39;s contribution is short of her liability to the Commissioner. The honorable member for Werriwa
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline>
                            said that the returned soldier has to diebefore  his  widow can receive any consideration ; but that is entirely wrong. I have already circulated amendments, following upon suggestions made by the honorable member for Hume
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collins),</inline>
                            who directed attention to a particular case which I have used as a basis. The case cited by the honorable member was that of an unfortunate woman whose husband is in a mental hospital, and who is in an infinitely worse position than the widow of any returned soldier. I have always believed that the wife of an insane man is in a worse position than any widow. The amendments circulated definitely provide that the wife of a returned soldier who has become insane will be treated as if she were the widow of the purchaser. I should also like to reply to some comments made by some honorable members, whose sincerity I very much doubt. For instance, the honorable member for Cook
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline>
                            said that this bill is a trick, similar to that played on returned soldiers before. There is no suggestion of trickery. The bill is a plain piece of machinery to provide a trust fund to make up the deficiency that may be assessed from time to time in connexion with the liabilities of any widow, and to pay to State governments or municipal authorities arrears of taxes or rates, fire insurance on properties, and the cost of repairs.  The  . honorable member for East Sydney
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline>
                            said that the measure does not confer any benefit upon widows.

                            <para>- Butthe honorable member for Cook said that it is a trick. Some honorable members opposite misconstrued even my remarks in moving the second reading of the bill. Some said that this measure is not likely to confer any benefit whatever upon those unfortunate persons who are unable to meet their commitments. The honorable members for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> and Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> ridiculed the amount of &#163;5,000 mentioned in the bill, and said that it would be impossible to do anything with such a small amount. They know that the bill definitely provides for allocating to a trust fund that amount, and &#34; such other moneys as are from time to timeappropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of relief to widows and widowed mothers of Australian soldiers.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and, judging by the speeches I have heard to-day, Parliament will not refuse to make the necessary funds available. I cannot imagine Parliament refusing to grant to the Minister in charge of war service homes the funds necessary to cany out the provisions of this bill. It is impossible for anyone to say how much money will be required in the trust fund to meet the obligations of widows who are not in a position to make repayments. I appreciate the criticism of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn).</inline> He was essentially fair in all that he said. I agree with the honorable member that the bill confers no rights upon widows, in that it does not give them the right to demand relief. As I explained in ray second-reading speech, it is almost impossible to lay down a schedule of payments because the financial position of war widows must necessarily vary. I have on my official file a considerable number of cases from all the States in anticipation of the passage of this bill. In respect of many of them there is a definite recom- mendation  that no payment whatever is to be asked. Because the persons concerned have no income, the whole of their instalments, as well as the current amounts owing for municipal rates and taxes will be paid from the trust fund. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care how many are received. Every application will be dealt with on its merits. In every case it will be necessary to take into consideration the income of the widow, whether it is in the form of war or ordinary pension, from the letting of part of the home, from boarders, or from board paid by members of her family. Furthermore, consideration will be given to the number of dependent children, and the &#39;condition of their health. In one case that has come under my notice the widow is suffering from a malignant disease, and has an invalid son 45 years of age. No honorable member will say that payments should be required of her. These facts will, I am sure, impress upon honorable members the need for the most sympathetic administration of the act. I have deliberately refrained from thrusting this responsibility upon the commission, because, in what must prove to be a distasteful matter, I have no desire to shelter behind the commissioner or his deputies. This legislation will, I hope, be on the statute books for many years and successive Ministers will be charged with the responsibility of its administration. &#39; </para>

                    <para>I regret that any honorable member opposite should have attempted to misconstrue any of the provisions of the bill, or endeavoured to make political capital out of it, by suggesting that it was brought forward as a result of the pressure of public opinion. I say definitely that it is the fulfilment of a promise made to members of the War Service Homes Association and members of the Returned Soldiers League that legislation to liberalize the War Service Homes Act would be introduced as soon as possible. Shortly after I was appointed as Minister in charge of War Service Homes, I discussed this subject with a deputation which waited upon me, and gave an undertaking then that the representations which they had made would receive the early consideration of the Government. As honorable members are aware, I was absent from Australia for six months on important public business, and therefore was unable to bring down this bill as early as otherwise would have been possible; but I assure honorable members that no widows have suffered from the unavoidable delay. Arrangements have been made for them to receive the benefits which this bill will confer upon them immediately it is passed by Parliament. I resent the unfair criticism by the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden),</inline> and the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> who suggested that the Government is endeavouring to mislead the people, and that it will refrain from honoring its pledges. The honorable member for Cook went so far as to say that the introduction of this bill was merely another trick. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I would expect from the honorable member for East Sydney, who, by his interjections while other honorable members were speaking sought to cast ridicule upon the Government&#39;s&#39; proposals and my administration of the act. The point I wish to make clear is that whilst no widow will be relieved of her obligations, she will have the right under this bill to make application for relief, and her application will receive sympathetic consideration. If her position warrants it, payments on her behalf will be made from trust fund, and although the money so advanced will be a first charge against the home, she will not be exposed, to any risk of the amount being called up so long as she honours the small obligation which may be imposed upon her. Every case will come before the Minister for review from time to time because the financial position. of a widow might alter. For example, the number of dependent children will, in the course of time, be reduced, and it is hoped that members of her family will be able to contribute to the income of the home. In some cases widows have unemployed sons up to 23 years of age. It is hardly fair to make a claim on their behalf, but  even such claims will be taken into consideration because I prefer to keep an unemployed son in the home in the hope that when he does secure employment he will be of some assistance and protection to his mother. The honorable member for Cook in an attempt to ridicule the bill spoke slightingly of the responsibility of the new husband in cases where a widow remarries. The honorable gentleman jokingly suggested that the new husband should not be expected to accept full responsibility for the liabilities which the widow had incurred. I say definitely that a soldier&#39;s widow is in exactly the same position as any other widow who marries a second time. </para>

                            <para>- There is no spider&#39;s web associated with this bill. I resentthat of insinuation when the Government is making a conscientious effort to provide a measure of relief for an unfortunate class of women in the Commonwealth. The suggestion that should a soldier&#39;s widow remarry her husband will walk into a spider&#39;s web and be asked to sign any sort of a contract, is definitely wrong. The widow who will then become another man&#39;s wife is the party to the contract, and will have to face her financial responsibility. It will, however, be an obligation on the husband to provide his wife with a heme. It is not reasonable to suggest that because she was a soldier&#39;s widow her second husband should be entitled to some concession or consideration at the hands of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. This bill represents a definite, genuine effort on the part of the Government to provide financial relief for those unfortunate women who are unable to meet the commitments into which their husbands entered prior to their death. Considered in conjunction with the circulated amendments, it will make provision for widows of deceased ex-soldiers, widowed mothers of exsoldiers, and wives of purchasers who have become insane. I ask the House to agree to the motion for the second reading of the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Minister who is in charge of the House whether the Government has adopted a new procedure in making known the contents of proposed legislation prior to its introduction to the Parliament. Honorable members are aware that from time to time the reply of Ministers to questions seeking information in relation to projected legislation is that it is not customary to make pronouncements of government policy in reply to questions.  A  very important matter that is agitating the minds of many honorable members is the amendment of the Repatriation Act. From time to time information in relation to it has been sought, and quite a number of interested organizations have endeavoured to learn what is in the mind of the Government. I direct attention to the fact that a report which appeared in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> of the 5th November last discloses the nature of the contents of a measure dealing with this subject, which we are told is to be placedbefore Parliament The report reads - </para>

                <para class="block">It would be interesting to learn whether honorable members of the Government party have been advised of this proposal. Apparently they have not, for I believe that they are as anxious as we are to ascertain what is intended. If the facts stated in the newspaper paragraph are correct, an unusual practice has been adopted. I should like to be told whether the customary procedure of governments in relation to the legislative programme is to be varied in the future, and whether the present Government considers desirable the publication of information through channels unconnected withthis Parliamentbefore the Parliament itself is advised. I do not regard the new practice as a good one. If it is to be followed, honorable members will probably try to obtain information by writing to Ministers who may be willing to furnish it outside the Parliament. I have not entire faith in newspaper paragraphs; but this paragraph appears to be authentic, as it gives details of the proposed measure. The House, I believe, will be interested to learn whether the information was supplied contrary to the wishes of the Cabinet. </para>

It is, of course, inevitable that, in the ordinary course a government will disclose toits own supporters the contents of measures which it proposes to introduce. I take it that nothing that has been said to-night by the honorable member for West Sydney challenges the propriety of that course. Unfortunately, it occasionally happens that information is given to other persons; but that is inevitable. In so far as it is suggested that the Ministry has made some public statement as to the contents of a bill to amend the Repatriation Act, all I can say is that it has not done any such thing. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has based his question on wrong premises. It has not been stated in reply to a question that no persons or bodies in Australia have been declared unlawful associations. The honorable member was distinctly informed on the 6th November that section 30a (1.) of the Crimes Act declares certain associations to be unlawful associations. I have doubts as to the information the honorable member requires, but if he is referring to the registration of <inline font-style="italic">War, What For</inline> as a newspaper, I refer him to the reply given to the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> on the 23rd October. If the honorable member desires to know why the transmission of the publication through the post is prohibited, I refer him to section 30e of the Crimes Act. </para>

                        <para>- The board constituted under section66 of the Land Tax Assessment Act is not subject to ministerial or governmental control in the exercise of the discretion vested in it by Parliament. I am informed that in its consideration of applications for relief, the board has regard both to the present ability to pay and to the ability to pay at the time when the tax was actually due and payable. In the past, many cases in which the board has granted relief would have been refused if the board had taken into consideration only the ability to pay at the time of assessment and had ignored subsequent losses which had seriously affected the financial position of the taxpayer at the time when the application was actually dealt with by the board. It is undesirable that, and would be productive of anomalies if, the board should he compelled to ignore any relevant factor in its consideration of the question as to whether relief should or should not be granted in any particular case. It is pointed out that the relief granted by the board, as shown in its annual reports, during the year ended the 31st December, 1934, amounted to &#163;155,497, as compared with &#163;57,558, during the year ended the 31st December, 1933, and &#163;48,772 during the year ended the 31st December, 1932. </para>
