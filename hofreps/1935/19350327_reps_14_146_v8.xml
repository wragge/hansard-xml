                        <para>- The matter to which  the  honorable gentleman has referred is of the very greatest importance, but I am not yet in a position to make a statement in regard to it. As honorable members may know, Sister Kenny visited Canberra, where she exhibited her film before members of the Health  Council.  She subsequently returned to Sydney, and has now proceeded to Townsville. On Friday last 1 made arrangements with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Galbraith,</inline> superintendent of the Orthopaedic  Hospital, Frankston, Victoria, to proceed to Sydney to witness the screening of the film, investigate Sister Kenny&#39;s claim, and report upon her treatment and its effects. This <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Galbraith</inline> did. I have since received from him a letter to the effect that, accompanied by another orthopaedic  expert, he had a long interview with Sister Kenny, saw the film, and is preparing a report on the evidence which he will let me have in the course of a few days. I shall let the honorable member know when I have received that report, and with the permission of the House will then make a statement in regard to the matter. </para>

                        <para>- A similar question was asked last week. The application is for a by-law admission, which means that it involves the waiving of the duty on these chairs. Such an application is granted only where it can be proved that the article cannot be supplied by local or British manufacturers. The application ref erred to by the honorable member has been received, but it has not yet been considered. I assure the honorable member that when it is dealt with due regard will be paid to every aspect of the subject, including the rights of suppliers and the benefits that might accrue, if it were granted, to the patients and to the institution. </para>

He works the mine only when orders for ochre are received. In the past seven years he has sent away only about 100 tons of ochre. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harvey</inline> holds a licence to employ aboriginals, but he employs male aboriginals only. The mine was abandoned on the 5th January, 1935, when the aboriginals were told not to work in it. Two aboriginals were left at Rumbalara to cart ochre already raised to the railway by camels. The lubras were apparently used in assisting the male aboriginals to fill the bags. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harvey</inline> was in Alice Springs when the accident occurred which resulted in the death of a lubra. The  female aboriginal in question was the lubra of one of the aboriginals employed on the mine. No information is available as to why she -was in the mine. </para>

                        <para>- About a week ago I asked the Acting Treasurer a question regarding the losses sustained by the Commonwealth through the purchase of British sterling with Australian gold reserves, and he informed me that the Commonwealth Bank had been asked to furnish a reply. Has any great difficulty been experienced by the Commonwealth Bank or by his department in obtaining particulars of a matter which officials should have at their finger tips? </para>

I propose to conclude my speech by moving that the writer be adjudged guilty of contempt. The letter followed my recent remarks in the House concerning the Arnheim Land Gold Development Company&#39;s affairs, during which I made some comments on the behaviour of the Stock Exchange. You will notice that it contains  a  threat to use newspaper publicity if I do not apologize for my remarks, and is as follows :  - </para>

                <para>My attention has been called to a speech made in the House of Representatives on Thursday last, the 14th instant, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> Macalister Blain, member for the Northern Territory, with reference to mining in the Northern Territory, and more particularly to the Arnheim Land Gold Development Company. </para>
                <para>He is reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> dated 16th March, 1935, page 50, to havesaid that &#34; at present nobody is making anything out of mining in the territory except a few go-getters and scoundrels, and members of the iniquitous 324 <inline font-style="italic">Privilege.</inline> &#91;REPRESENT ATI VES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Privilege.</inline></para>
                <para>Sydney Stock Exchange, who appear to have no morals when there  is  a  commission to be  earned &#34;. </para>
                <para>I take the very strongest exception to his remarks as applied to the Sydney Stock Exchange: they are grossly insulting to a reputable body ofmen, quite unjustified and wholly without foundation. </para>
                <para>The Arnheim Land Gold Development Company was registered in May, 1933, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blain&#39;s</inline> first letter to the Sydney Stock Exchange was a year and eight months later. No member of the Sydney Stock Exchange was concerned in the flotation. </para>
                <para>In October, 1933, the company applied to the committee of the Sydney Stock Exchange for quotation on the official lists of the stock exchanges of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane. Before a company is admitted to quotation on the Sydney Stock Exchange it has to comply with certain requirements, a. copy of which is enclosed herewith. </para>
                <para>The Arnheim Land Company complied in every respect with those requirements, and was granted quotation on 31st October, 1933, and subsequently the other exchanges similarly granted quotation. </para>
                <para>It will be obvious to you that the stock exchange cannot send an expert to inspect a company&#39;s property when an application for quotation is made; the insistence that all our requirements be complied with affords protection to the investing public which is the sole purpose of those requirements. </para>
                <para>Further, the stock exchange serves a useful purpose in making a daily market in listed shares, thus enabling holders to sell if they so desire at a fair market price. </para>
                <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blain&#39;s</inline> speech was made in the House, and under cover of privilege, I had no opportunity of replying to his slur on the Sydney Stock Exchange and its members. I therefore intend sending a copy of this letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> with a request that it be published. </para>
                <para>Upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blain</inline> reading the copy of this letter to you and reading the requirements of the Sydney Stock Exchange, prior to the listing of a company, it may possibly be his wish to make the <inline font-style="italic">amende honorable</inline> on the floor of the House. I will, therefore, for a few days delay sending a copy of this letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> with a request that it be published.

                        <para>Inreply to your query  why  I did not take action in regard to Arnheim Land Gold Development Company, I was elected a member for the Northern Territory only in time to attend the last three days&#39; Sitting of Parliament before Christmas last. I had no time before Parliament rose over the New Year to fully investigate certain phases of the Arnheim Land Company&#39;s business. The moment I had done so, I did not wait for Parliament to meet. I wrote you immediately on 3rd  February last.  X gave you sufficient facts in my letter to seriously alarm any body of men handling shares in the company, and cause them to make searching inquiry for the sake of their own reputations. You did not reply to my letter or even ask me to substantiate my statements. </para>

                <para>Your members, since my first letter to you, have continuously dealt in the shares of  the  company. It appears that, from 1st  February  to 24th March, 145,000 shares  have  been sold on &#39;Change alone by your members, irrespective of vestibule sales and private dealings. Since the first exposure of the company&#39;s affairs, therefore, your members have apparently been earning over &#163;275 per week average in commissions on the  sales  of Arnheim Land shares on &#39;Change alone. </para>

                        325 should no more be allowed to threaten members who do their duty than to intimidate judges of the Supreme Court. A judge would soon clap the writer of a letter such as this into gaol for his pains. I do not believe that the privilege of Parliament should be abused, and in this case I did not abuse it. What I said badly needed saying in the public interest - that the stock exchange has lent itself to a wild gamble in the shares of this dishonest company. Since February last, on &#39;change alone, 145,000 shares have been turned over, irrespective of vestibule and private sales.

Though my allegations were the gravest that could be made against a company, my letter was not even acknowledged. I made further and most serious information available on the 9th February, and again there was no reply, and the Exchange showed no interest in either substantiating my statements or discovering whether its members were dealing in the shares of a crooked concern. On the 19th February I wrote specifically asking for an answer, and saying that I proposed to take certain steps in Parliament. After a week had elapsed I received a reply saying that my letters had been made available to members; but the dealing in shares still continued on a large scale, and it is still going on, to the detriment of real mining and of Stock Exchange reputations. Under the circumstances, it was my duty to say what I said. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> has correctly quoted the Standing Order governing this matter; but, as the Acting Prime Minister has said, it has been the practice of this House to adjourn the debate on motions of this nature. I interpret the Standing Order to mean that when a matter of privilege is brought before the House it shall take precedence over every other question, but not that it must be finalized. I therefore rule that the point of order cannot be sustained. </para>

                <para class="block">I take this action because of the growing public importance of the matter with which the motion is moved to deal. That there is a large volume of public opinion dissatisfied with the present censorship I do not think can be gainsaid by any honorable member of this House. Recent conferences of scientists and other bodies have carried resolutions expressing dissatisfaction with the manner in which the present practice is working out and intimating that, from their point of view, that practice is too dictatorial. This dissatisfaction has been growing for some considerable time. I believe it is safe to say that to-day this is a burning public question throughout Australia. </para>
                <para>I wish to make it quite clear that I draw a line of demarcation between the two groups of books and literature which come under the purview of the Censorship Board or Committee, or the Minister for Trade and Customs. With the written word or the pictorial advertisement which comes under the head of pornographic, indecent, or obscene, I am not nearly so greatly concerned as I am with the other volume of literature which deals with all branches of political economy, economic problems, philosophical essays, arts and methods of government and the changes that occur  in them from time to time in different countries, and sociological questions or studies generally. I consider that the han upon the introduction of that type of literature into Australia constitutes a Very great inroad upon the mental liberty of our people. All students and thinking people generally in the community should strongly resent the determination with a mental tape measure by a Minister or a committee of the number and range of literature dealing with clean, modem, economic problems, that the people should read, study, and try to understand. All that I have to say concerning literature which is alleged to be indecent is that, to allow a Minister for Trade and .Customs, whoever ho may be, or even two or three persons, to be the guardians of public morals, imposes rather too much upon a people. Even in regard to that range of literature a method having much greater virtue  should  be adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I want the House quite clearly to understand that my main protest is against the censorship of literature dealing with questions and problems associated with the many changes that have taken place politically and economically since the immediate post-war days. I suggest that the powers conferred by the Police Offences Acts of the different States, if used in conjunction with the advice of an officer of the Customs Department as to the types of literature he considers should be inquired into, would be quite sufficient to safeguard the people of this country from the indiscriminate circulation of indecent or obscene literature. Under the Police Offences Act all books, periodicals and magazines come within the purview of the police authorities, who are given the power to prosecute and have a fine imposed upon or imprisonment meted out to an offender. The matter complained of may be confiscated and declared unfit for circulation. The exercise of these powers has enabled Australia to be kept clean up to date. Compared with all other countries in the world, Australia is the cleanest. I make that statement deliberately, and do not think that it will be contradicted. In my travels I have seen exhibited for sale on the counters of shops in Prance, Egypt, Switzerland and other countries, books and pictorial matter that would be immediately seized and confiscated, and rightly so, in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have not suggested breaking anything down. I have said that the present State laws, plus the assistance of certain officers of the Trade and Customs Department, are sufficient to safeguard the general public from unwholesome literature of the kind to which I have been referring. Our people have been safeguarded in this respect in the past. I do not think that people should have indecent literature thrust upon them, any more than that they should be forced to listen to blasphemy and cursing; but I object to any interference with their liberties in regard to any publications on current economic, historical and governmental developments in various countries of the world. Neither the Minister for Trade and &#39;Customs, whoever he may be, nor any two or three individuals who may be appointed by the Government for the purpose, should be allowed to deprive the people of the opportunity to read modern historical and economic literature, and no juggling on the part of customs officers or others should be permitted to prevent the circulation of such literature. Some appeal should bc allowed before any permanent ban is placed on the free circulation of such literature. We must remember that the ideas and outlook of people are always changing. Books that would have been regarded as filthy yesterday become historical gems to-morrow, and, similarly, statements regarded as treason a few years ago may, to-morrow, be regarded as pearls of wisdom. Dictatorial powers, the exercise of which may have the effect of preventing the free circulation of literature in this country, should not, therefore, be given to any individual or small group of individuals. I remember that a wise old Roman senator  328 <inline font-style="italic">Book</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Censorship.</inline> made a statement long ago to the effect that no person was wise for each hour of the 24 in every day. The power to censor the liberty of the people is too great to be placed in the hands of any individual, or small group of individuals. A court of appeal should be open to authors and distributors in the case of books brought under any kind of ban. </para>

                        <para>-An enormous quantity of general literature dealing with modern economic movements and their historical background, and with new experimental systems of government and their operations, has come from the printing presses of the world since the war, and such publications should not be subjected to any form of censorship. The people of Australia are sufficiently intelligent to judge the quality of their reading matter, and they may be relied upon to thrust aside that which is undesirable and to accept only that which is sound and for the common good. Never in the world&#39;s history have such remarkable changes occurred as those which we have witnessed since the Great War. To set up a small censorship board to determine what is truth and falsehood, what is dangerous and helpful, and what is evil and good, is entirely wrong. The weighted average of the intelligence of the community generally may be trusted to determine such matters. The weighted average of intelligence of any small body of individuals set up as a censorship board could not possibly be very different from the weighted average of the mentality of the people. We should be egotistical, indeed, if, for instance, we were to argue that the mentality of members of Parliament was very much higher than that of the populace generally. No Minister of the Crown should have the right to measure the area of the mental development of the people or of books or periodicals which they should be allowed to read, apart, as I have already said, from books regarded as obscene, indecent or blasphemous, concerning which I hold no brief whatever. I hold a brief, though, for works on economic and historical subjects which come from reput able authors or groups of authors, or from universities, whether of Moscow. Leningrad, Berlin, or elsewhere. The people of a comparatively new country are generally regarded as being progressive, and the Australian people should be so regarded; but unfortunately we are to-day trailing behind the older countries of the world in our treatment of historical, economic and educational literature. Books which are freely admitted into the United Kingdom, and afforded distributing facilities by the British Postal Department, are not allowed admission into Australia. Our people should, in this matter, be allowed at least equal facilities to those of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. I do not suggest that we ought to follow the United Kingdom blindly in everything. We have made mistakes sometimes in the past in doing so; but at least we should give our people unhindered access to educational literature of the kind that I have described, which is freely admitted into and distributed throughout Great Britain. Because I believe in freedom of thought and freedom of speech, I naturally ally myself with the growing army of people in every capital city of Australia who are gravely discontented with the censorship exercised to-day in respect of economic and historical publications. I propose to quote the views of three organizations, representative of the great majority, of the people of Australia, which have recently carried resolutions of protest against the present censorship policy of the Government. The Science Congress, which met early this year in Melbourne, and consisted of representative scientific men from every part of Australia and New Zealand, and from some countries overseas, declared itself, I think unanimously, as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">The Australian Natives Association, as the Minister is doubtless aware, represents a very large number of Australian citizens. It is a larger body, I think, than any other similar association in Australia. </para>
                <para>The next resolution to which I shall direct attention is that of the Trades Hall Council, of Melbourne, an organization of outstanding importance in Australia. The Minister may disagree with  me  in this regard, because the political outlook of this organization is different from his own. Through its affiliated bodies, the Melbourne Trades Hall Council represents more people than 99 per cent, of the organizations in Australia. While I had the honour to be  president  of that council, I was selected to take the chair at a meeting held in the Melbourne Town Hall to welcome the International Science Congress at the opening of its first conference in Australia, and I was selected solely because the council was so thoroughly representative of the citizens of Melbourne. Its resolution on the subject of the censorship of books and publications is described in the following statement published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> on the 8th February, 1935 :- </para>

                    <para>Condemning the policy of banning books dealing with social and political problems, the Trades Hall Council, in a resolution passed lust night, contended that such books were allowed to circulate freely in England. The executive was instructed to take whatever action it might consider necessary, with the object of having the ban removed. The council declared that the censorship of books was a reflection on the intelligence of the people of Australia. </para>

                <para>The Melbourne Trades Hall Council, the Australian Natives Association, and the Science Congress are thus, it will be seen, unanimously of the opinion that books and publications on historical, economic and political subjects should not be subjected to censorship, but should be obtainable in Australia at least as easily as in England. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Leave to continue given.&#93;.</inline> The fact that some of the 150 to 160 books on the banned list were available to the public 20 or 30 years ago is responsible for a good deal of the discontent which now exists. Many of the banned  books  are the text books of universities all over the world. For instance there are the works of Karl Marx. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and there are, perhaps, 50 other books in the parliamentary and other libraries which are also on.the list. I have books in my home, the importation of which is prohibited. Certain literature and books on the banned list are sent to me regularly, but I do not know from whom they come, which shows that the present method of censorship is ineffective. I also receive a paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Man,</inline> advocating anarchy,but I do not know by whom it is sent. This shows the foolishness of the present system, and the necessity to review our methods of censorship. Apparently some books are banned because the author has a Russian name, or because the censor is opposed to the present system of government in Russia. At present we are denied the right to read economic essays written by some of the most brilliant professors. I have before me a volume entitled <inline font-style="italic">Moscow Dialogues,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. J.</inline> E. &#39;Hecker, which has not been banned and is in the Parliamentary Library. I should like to read what an English professor has said concerning the. author, who is a leading, economist in the Moscow University and who writes a good deal of literature for the Russian University. What Professor John. Macmurray says concerning this author shows the typeof man whose books may be banned by a censor simply because the censor may be biased against Russian names,, or because of the attitude which Russia adopted during the war. Professor John Macmurray states - </para>

                        <para>had the pleasure of meeting <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hecker</inline> at a summer school held by the Society of Friends in Birmingham during the past summer. He was engaged in collecting material for a course of lectures on recent religions movements in Europe to be delivered, at the request of one of the institutes of the Communist Academy of Moscow. For this task he was eminently suited. Though Russian by birth he has spent a great part of his life in the United States, where he was engaged in social and literary work. He returned to Russia after the revolution as a member of a Famine Relief Mission, but owing to difficulties about his nationality he left the mission and joined the regular educational service of the Soviet Union, in which he is still employed. During his short stay in England his simplicity and frankness, his obvious sincerity and humanity, endeared him to those who met him. It was usual to hear people express their astonishment that a man with such religious sympathies and such a patently Christian character should support the Soviet system in Russia. These qualities of sympathy, simplicity and humanity, reveal themselves in his book and make it, in my opinion, by far the most satisfactory account of the theoretical aspect of the Russian revolution that we yet possess. </para>

Surely we can be trusted to examine the contents of such books and publications. There: has never been a time in history when the need: for the free circulation of literature of this type has been greater. Since the war, we have been passing through a transition period!, and the experience of other countries under different forms of government should be available to us. Twenty years ago,, a nation consisting of 160,000,000 persons was suddenly thrown upon <inline font-style="italic">its</inline> own resources and compelled to face important  economic problems; arid although it was thought that it would not be able to surmount the difficulties then confronting it. the world is to-day fascinated with the efforts it is making. Many students of high standing consider that another two or three decades will see a complete system of common ownership in operation. Numerous books have been written explaining its activities, and the information they contain should be available to us. </para>

                        <para>- I may have in mind some books which are taboo, but I might destroy my argument by mentioning one. I do not propose to do that. There are five or six hooks which I should like to read, one of which is entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Colonial Policy of British Imperialism,</inline> by Cox. Moreover, the present system is unfair to reputable booksellers who have to provide sufficient capital to order books from London and elsewhere for sale to Australian readers and who cannot ascertain from the officers of the Customs Department whether such books are or are not on the banned list. The books arrive in Australia and sometimes months elapse before the importers are able to get a definite reply from the Customs Department as to whether the books can be offered for sale. If they are prohibited the booksellers have to incur the expense of returning them to Europe. I am sure that, a better method than that at present in operation could be devised. I know that the Minister will say that there is a Censorship Board of three persons who have been selected because of their experience and knowledge. I have nothing to say against the present Censorship Board. I have the greatest respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran as a gentleman and a scholar; but in the end the board has the final say. </para>

                    <para>My attention has been drawn to the remarks to which the honorable member refers. Section 52 of the  Customs  Act prohibits the importation of blasphemous, obscene, or indecent literature or works. There has been drawn up by the department a fairly long list of prohibited literature, and from time to time recommendations in the direction of prohibition come to the department, and are generally acted upon. The department will welcome any help in connexion with the administration of this very difficult matter, as books and publications to the value of over ?1,000,000 are coming into the Commonwealth 332 <inline font-style="italic">Book</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Censorship.</inline> every year.

                <para class="block">Before that date, however, my interest had been aroused in the admission of obscene literature or publications of any kind into Australia. In 1923, when I was at Geneva as a delegate to the Assembly of the League of Nations, a conference was called by the Government of France, to which were invited representatives of nations who were members of the League of Nations, and also other nations. It was held under the auspices of the League, and its purpose was to deal with the circulation and traffic in obscene publications. The Government of the Commonwealth had accepted the invitation and appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> L. Shepherd, who was then Official Secretary at Australia House, to represent it at the conference. Unfortunately, it became necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> to return to London, and at <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook&#39;s request, I took his place. This conference spent several weeks deliberating on this problem. By the way, I have always thought it is a good thing for any public man occasionally to test the ambit of his usefulness or celebrity, whichever way one. may describe it. Quite recently, for instance, I saw an official announcement by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department that Australia was not represented at that particular convention. </para>
                <para>I stress the tremendous difficulty of arriving at any useful decision at such a conference on a question of this nature. The convention agreed - </para>

                </quote>
                <para>Those of the contracting parties signing that convention whose legislation was not at the time adequate to give effect to it, undertook to take, or propose to their respective legislatures, the measures necessary for this purpose. The point I stress is that it was not possible really for the delegates at that conference to come to any decision as to the meaning, from an international stand point, of the word &#34; obscene &#34;. The representatives of some countries considered certain literature, pictures and other publications as entirely proper, whilst the representatives of other nations considered the same publications of an obscene nature. This convention was my first experience of an international gathering and it proved to me that it is a very difficult thing for the representatives of the various nations in the world to come to any common decision upon any point. I believe the Australian Government now has signed the convention, or at least is about to sign it. </para>
                <para>As the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, I believe, admits, there is no doubt that the Government should have power to prohibit the admission of certain literature into this country. I should be glad to know, however, what the Minister has to say regarding the banning of certain books in Australia which are not prohibited in Britain. I could never quite understand why books which are not banned in Britain should be banned in Australia. Mentally and morally, Australians, as a people, can claim to be equal to the people of Britain. I contend that when a book which has not been banned in Britain is banned in Australia, the general effect of the Australian ban is to createimmediately a far greater interest in the banned book than would be the case were it not banned. I could mention the titles of one or two books to illustrate this point, but honorable members are well aware of such instances. Undoubtedly, if the people are determined to read a book they are able to get it. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has referred to the committee composed of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, Professor L. H. Allen, lecturer in English at the Canberra University College, and Professor J. F. Haydon, lecturer in French at the Canberra University College. These gentlemen form an honorary committee, but so far as I have been able to gather, it is only on occasions that books are referred to them for an opinion. </para>

Often, I understand, a book, solely because it bears a nighty name, is submitted to an official of the Trade and Customs Department.

                        <para>- All books written on Hitler and Mussolini, and which detail methods for the formation of fascist governments, and how to overthrow existing governments for the purpose of establishing a fascist dictatorship are allowed uncensored into this country. At any rate books of this type are to be found in the Parliamentary Library, and in every public library throughout the Commonwealth to-day. I ask the Minister to name one book on the banned list that deals with fascism. </para>

                        <para>- I prefer to put the onus on- the Minister. I ask bini to name one book on the banned list which deals with fascism. There is not one to be found on the list, although many of such books actually advocate the forcible overthrow of governments and the  sub.stitution  of democratic governments by another form of government. Among the books which have been banned I find one which deals with the historical development of England, and another dealing with the class struggle in England. The former is a history of the development, of England before 1834, that is before the industrial revolution, up to the present time. The latter book has been banned because it is written from the point of view of the working class. The Minister might as well ban Green&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">History of England.</inline> Ralph Fox in his <inline font-style="italic">Glass Struggle In Britain in the Epoch of Imperialism,</inline> which describes the historical development of the working class in England, simply goes further than Green and gives in greater detail the incidents lightly touched upon by Green. </para>

                <para>I agree with the mover of the motion that indecent or blasphemous literature should not be allowed into this country. I do not think it should be admitted into any country. That is my opinion on books of that nature, but I do not agree with the Government&#39;s policy so far as economic works are concerned. I challenge any honorable member opposite to produce a finer work on the world position than Professor Varga&#39;s quarterly statement which is published in the International Press Correspondence. It&#39; is praised .by Professor Giblin and others. </para>

Surely the Minister does not say that the people of Australia are not to read historical books? He may, or may not, be justified in refusing to allow the people of Australia to discuss what may happen to-morrow ; but, surely, what happened in 1905, and other events of the past, should not be kept from the people.

Although it is merely a book dealing with theories, <inline font-style="italic">Founda~ tions of Leninism and Problems of Leninism</inline> is banned, as is also <inline font-style="italic">Germany, Hitler and the Trade Unions.</inline> Strangely enough, there is no censorship of books dealing with German or Italian fascism, It would appear that the Commonwealth Government favours fascism, because books favouring fascism are permitted to circulate freely in this country, whereas those which are opposed to fascism are banned. Lenin&#39;s books entitled <inline font-style="italic">Karl Marx</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Socialism and War</inline> are barred, as is also Stalin&#39;s publication, <inline font-style="italic">The Task of the Working Glass in Mastering the Technique of Production.</inline> That book merely shows factory workers how to deal with the problems they meet in industry, but it is banned- We are told that before coming to a final decision in regard to the banning of books, the Minister submitted the books to a board consisting of three gentlemen, resident in Canberra.

                    <para>.The subject raised to-day by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> is by no means unimportant, because a; great many highly-educated and well-meaning people are giving seriousthought to the present censorship ofbooks.So far no honorable member who has spoken has expressed disagreement with the principle of censorship. On the contrary, each  speaker  has admitted the necessity for a censorship of books, with a view to banning publications which are indecent, obscene or blasphemous. It is clear, therefore, that it is in regard to the degree of censorship, not the principle of censorship, that any difference of opinion exists. Honorable members who have spoken have referred principally to books of political, historical or religious nature. In regard to such publications a clearcut decision as to the degree of censorship which should be exercisedis most difficult to obtain. It may be that a book which is chiefly historical, may contain passages which some people would regard  as blasphemousor indecent, offensive to their sense of morality, or opposed to their views regarding religion. A book dealing with conditions in Russia may, possibly, advocate moral standards or views in regard to Christianity which are repugnant to most people in this country. At first sight, the books mentioned by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> appear to be more or less harmless, but it may be that a perusal of them would reveal that they advocate the overthrow of governments by force or violence. If that be so, they are properly banned, in accordance with a principle which has operated in Australia, and, indeed, in most countries, for many years, irrespective of the political party which happens to be in power. I take it that every honorable member, irrespective of party, stands definitely for evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, means of accomplishing reforms, and agrees that any person who, on the public platform, expounds doctrines designed to cause violence and revolution is justly liable to punishment. I see no difference between advocating such doctrines from the public platform and advocating them in books. </para>

                <para>Some honorable members contend that we should allow to circulate freely in Australia books which have a free circulation in Great Britain; but I do not agree with them. It may be that in many things Australia would do well to follow the lead of Britain; but in other matters we may be wise to depart from the methods of the Old Country. In determining the degree of censorship, we should: be guided by Australian ideas of what is right and proper, rather than by the views of people in other countries. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> said that, while all honorable members agree with the principle of censorship, they hold different opinions regarding the degree of censorship which should be exercised. I agree that it is difficult to say what is indecent, or otherwise objectionable. Judged by some standards,  336 <inline font-style="italic">Book</inline> (REPRESENTATIVES. &#93; <inline font-style="italic">Censorship.</inline> many classical works would be regarded as indecent, and the language of the aristocracy of not many years ago, if used in this House, would be disallowed. I have read quite a lot of those works, and I do not know that I am any the worse for it. The post office in this country is in itself a very strict censor. I have here a copy of a book called <inline font-style="italic">Red Medicine,</inline> which may be had from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library. The book was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Newsholme, K.C.B., M.D., formerly principal medical officer of the local board of England and Wales, and John Adams Kingsbury, L.L.B., Secretary of the. Milbank Memorial Funds, and formerly Commissioner of Public Charities, New York. Those two men were given the right to visit Russia for two or three months in order to investigate social conditions in that country, and to observe what was being done in the way of public health work. Many of the photographs published in the book have appeared in the Australian publication <inline font-style="italic">The Soviets To-day.</inline> The Commonwealth censorship cannot interfere with that publication, because it is printed in Sydney, but the post office has refused to allow it to be transmitted by post, and any one attempting to use the post office for its distribution may be prosecuted and fined. Nevertheless, I challenge any one to point out how anything in that publication can injure any one. It is freely printed and published in Great Britain, where censorship in regard to such matters is much less strict than here. Are we to conclude that it is the desire of the Government to prevent the people, and particularly the women of this country, from learning of the work which is being done in various institutions in Russia for the people by the Government? In regard to most publications I think that we may rely upon the good sense of the public to determine what should be read and what should not. Certain Sunday newspapers are permitted to be sent unhampered through the post office, and are sold openly in the streets, though they contain more filth and indecent matter than a great many of the publications which come under the official ban. Censorship in this country works in peculiar ways. For instance, </para>

                <para class="block">Boccaccio&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Decameron</inline> may be had from the Parliamentary Library here, and from most other libraries throughout the country, but it is not permitted to be sold in cheap paper editions. The idea evidently is that while it is all right for those who can afford to buy expensive editions, it should not be read by the great bulk of the people. Another book upon which there is no censorship at all is Fielding&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Tom Jones,</inline> in which there is more filth than in any other book I can think of. Yet it is supposed to be a classic. </para>

                        <para>- No, but we might at least have a logical one. I have read a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran that the Censorship Committee does not see a great many of the books that are banned. I can believe that, because I cannot see how any intelligent person could take exception to some of the books that come under the ban. In some cases, books that would be of real educational value to the people of Australia are prohibited, although they circulate freely in England. In respect of many things we are told that we should be guided by what is done in England, and I think that we might very well follow England in this instance. There is much greater freedom of speech and of publication in that country than there is in Australia, although I do not think it can be said that the English people are, compared with Australians, more intelligent, or more capable of excluding the bad and absorbing the good from what they read. They are good citizens, even though they are subject to these influences from which our Government so carefully protects us. Most of us in this country are the descendants of British people, and &#39;I think we are also entitled to be trusted in regard to these matters. </para>

                    337 against the same things. The preservation of morals is the function of the States, as is also the prevention of the distribution and sale of indecent literature. I refer to immoral publications and books purporting to be medical publications which may fall into the hands of young people to their moral hurt. I do not suppose that any one who is now critizing the Commonwealth censorship would ask the States to relax their laws in regard to publications of that kind, and it does assist the States in the enforcement of those laws for the Commonwealth to take steps to prevent the entry of such publications into the country. The action of the Commonwealth supplements the action of the States.

                    <para>- No member of the Commonwealth Parliament should say that. &#34;We have been authorized by the people of Australia as a Parliament to exercise those powers. I think everyone will agree that the complete abolition of censorship is impossible. Some control must be exercised over the sale of so-called historical and other works and quasi-scientific publications which do as much to undermine morals as anything else. Ever since Federation the Customs Department has been exercising its powers in this regard without there being any serious complaint, or any suggestion that the law should be altered. </para>

                <para>It has been suggested that the powers of censorship should not be exercised in respect of works which possess literary value, no matter what their nature. J have heard it said when the morality of a work was questioned - &#34; But see how beautifully it is written !&#34; Beautiful writing does not justify indecency underlying any work. Literature to a greatextent depends for its merit on its purity, truth, and beauty, and upon the nobility of thought which inspires it. No literary dressing up of immorality can make it into literature that is worth while. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard the titles read, and I have seen the list in part. If a man steps beyond the bounds of fair and reasonable criticism as regards existing law, and advocates straight-out revolution and the overthrow of constituted authority by force, he brings himself within the law, and is liable to prosecution. Therefore, it would be ridiculous if we prosecuted such a man, and yet freely admitted to our shores literature which advocated the same thing. Accordingly, the censorship is justified, even if only designed to protect Australia from publications advocating the use of violence. </para>

                <para>Nor do I think that the administration of the law is to be condemned. We have in our library dozens of books which freely discuss and criticize the so-called capitalistic system - which is the system that has grown up over a prolonged period - and other works which describe and criticize the Soviet system, Fascism, Hitlerism, &#38;c. We may disagree politically with those systems, and yet we admit books dealing with them. Every system of government of any value at all should stand the test of criticism, and stand or fall by the judgment of the people. It is better to err on the side of admitting a book if there be any doubt about it, than to err on the other side. The test comes when the principle is set up that, if one cannot get what is desired by argument, it should be obtained by force. That is contrary to the system of government generally accepted throughout the British Empire. As regards the basis of administration, it. rests with the Government to see that the claims of every literary work receive fair consideration. After all, a book is often an expression of the life-time experiences of an individual, and is entitled to a fair trial. Every inquiry should be made to ascertain whether the circulation of particular books would be injurious to the community before they are condemned. If the Minister finds that the present method is not working satisfactorily, let it be improved ; but it seems to me that the general principles upon which the law on this subject has been administered in the past are sound and wise in the interests of the Australian nation. </para>

                    <para>. - I endorse the opinions expressed by other honorable members as to the need for banning indecent and obscene literature; but, so far as the discussion has proceeded, it has been demonstrated that some relaxation of the law is necessary to prevent the banning of books that deal with economic problems, the forms of government prevailing in various countries and criticisms of their political economy, and that every opportunity should be afforded to honorable members and the public to peruse works of this nature. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> has challenged a number of speakers in regard to particular books to which they have referred. Not only have these works been banned; honorable members have also the greatest difficulty in obtaining from the Ministry even a list of the books that are prohibited from time to time. I attempted to obtain a list, and was told that the only person who could give authority for supplying such information was the Minister himself. We have the spectacle of 74 members, the elect of the Commonwealth, being prevented from reading certain books, presumably because of the effect it may have upon their political views. We cannot even obtain a list of the books that are banned. </para>

                        <para>- On numerous occasions, members of this chamber have pressed for a list of the names of banned books, and for the reason why their circulation has been prohibited. I disagree with some honorable members as to what comprises revolutionary action. I claim that every honorable member is entitled to study books, dealing with political happenings in other parts of the world, and the methods adopted in endeavouring to change forms of government and reconstruct society. If we believe that certain changes are necessary to give the people the right to determine their own destiny, we are at least entitled to ascertain, by the reading of books, the experience of the inhabitants of other countries, and whether in Australia, by means of subterfuge, the masses are induced to believe that they enjoy real democratic government, based on the authority of the people. By studying the particular forms of political economy operating in various countries, we may probably come finally to the conclusion that in Australia, where we claim to have a democratic form of government, the authority of the government is supported only by armed forces of the State. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. If the people were given the opportunity to change their system of government, and obtain real political power, without the use of force, I agree with honorable members opposite that anybody who advocated other than peaceful methods should be treated as a lunatic and imprisoned. But there are members of this community and of others who believe that the existing form of government, here and elsewhere, serves a privileged few, and does not operate in the interests of the people. It is maintained by force and can be destroyed only by force. If we find that, although the people are given the right to record their votes at the ballot-box, they have no opportunity to obtain real political power through their representatives, it cannot be said that they&#39; enjoy democratic government. We on this side, who believe in the platform of the Labour party, are entitled to read of the experiences of people in other parts of the world, and to examine the methods which they have employed for the purpose of securing political power. No sane member of the community approves of bloodshed, unless there is a necessity for it. Honorable members opposite, during the last war, supported a policy which meant bloodshed, on the ground that there was no alternative for it. The same principle is maintained by many persons in regard to changes in forms of government. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister happens to be a member of a government which, at least, has the support of a majority in this chamber. The Government could alter this state of affairs, if it believed in the necessity for a change. I do not desire to make this a personal matter; but why should the Minister, or anybody else, set himself up as an authority to decide what literature an honorable member of this chamber shall have access to? Although the Minister may claim to be the author of an obscure book which has not been widely circulated or read, I suggest that he is not qualified to decide which books should be banned. </para>

                <para>If we examine the activities of reactionaries in Australia and other countries, whether members of governments or other public men, we find that the reactionary elements have always opposed the spread of education amongst the people, because they realize that knowledge is power, and they desire to retain power for themselves. When they could no longer prevent the people from being educated, they attempted to control education. In the various States this matter is supervised by the State governments. Ministers controlthe curriculum of State schools, and the pupils are taught only the subjects believed to be good for them. They are never allowed an opportunity to examine political happenings from the working-class view-point. The history taught in schools to-day deals largely with battles that have been won, in which many people were slaughtered; but the children are not taught thereal meaning of the struggles that have taken place. </para>

                    <para>. -  The subject under discussion is  a most important and delicate one. I am in favour of the censorship of literature of all kinds, -whether imported or published in our own country. I do not believe that the law on this subject should be as lax in Australia as it is in the United Kingdom. When we compare our own regulations in regard to aliens with those in operation in Great Britain, it is seen that we cannot afford to follow the Old Country in all respects in permitting the inculcation of ideas which may be promulgated in certain foreign countries. I have no objection to plain statements regarding political developments in other countries being circulated in Australia, but I definitely object to literature which has a seditious or blasphemous purport or intent. Any government is obliged to comply with the demands in this respect of probably 9S per cent, of the population. Literature affords many examples of some of the statements which should not be circulated. I propose to give one or two illustrations of the contents of some books on the subject of religion. Statements such as the following should certainly not be published in this country : - </para>

                    <para>The idea of Cod which stands above all religions is also becoming dim with time, even in religions minds. They find it impossible to reconcile the hard  facts  of life with the idea of a heavenly Father, and each year sees a new system of apologetics, the object of which is to rationalize thu God idea. But all the theology is futile. God has gone west, and no amount of theology will ever resurrect Him in the minds of the toilers. The God idea to-day is of propaganda value only: it lives in the minds of our masters because of its utility in the class struggle. Men have ceased to  believe  in God, but they continue to use Him. </para>

                        <para>- In the first place, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has not raised a fresh point of order. He has simply argued that my ruling is not correct. I and others who have preceded me in this chair have ruled from time to time that the mere fact that a statement is not correct is not a valid ground for asking for its withdrawal. Honorable members understand perfectly well what has happened. The honorable member for Barker has quoted certain literature, and has named the author, who, he says, is a member of this House. </para>

                        <para>- All these statements can be checked in the library. They are taken from <inline font-style="italic">The Communist</inline> of the 10th February, 1922, the 24th February, 19:22, and the 26th May, 1922. There are quite a number of others which I have no time to read now. Stuff of the type I have already  read  proves  the necessity for  some  form  of censorship in this country.  I do not suggest the  exact degree of censorship to be applied, for I do not claim to be a great authority on books and literature; but I do urge that that authors of literature  of  this description, coupled with incitements  to civil war  and to armed opposition to the forces  of  the British Crown in the event of this country again becoming involved in war, should be put behind prison bars. </para>

                        <para>-  I did not leave the articles behind me either. As regards religion, I perhaps attend more to my religious duties than the honorable member for Barker has ever done in his life. At the time he was referring to, I was holding a mission in the North of Scotland, and for doing so I have been condemned by members on the opposite side of the House. I do not object to other people having and expressing their own views, but I do object to an honorable member attributing to me views which are diametrically opposed to the training  of  my whole lifetime. The honorable member for Barker has been trying to bring forward these statements ever since he entered the House. They are a complete tissue of falsehoods. It would be possible for a man to be a publisher and not  to  see all the matter that he publishes ; but,  342 <inline font-style="italic">Book</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Censorship.</inline> as regards editorials, I have had the courage to sign my name to every article I have written, and I challenge any one to prove the contrary. I suffered the penalty imposed by the law for signing my name to articles in which I believed. The honorable member for Barker has introduced these matters simply for the purpose of using them as political propaganda against myself and the party to which I have the honour to belong. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am pleased that the adjournment of the House has been moved to discuss the book censorship; but I regret that the time for my reply is so short. I wanted to hear a full debate, and if, after I conclude my remarks, the House will agree to extend the time for the debate, an opportunity will be given to other members who are opposed to the censorship to express their views. I think every one will admit that this is a contentious and difficult matter, regarding which there has been a good deal of misunderstanding, and some misleading propaganda in the press. I have listened carefully to all the arguments put forward to-day, and have asked questions to obtain further information. It appears to me from this debate, and from the discussions and objections outside, that the criticisms of the censorship group themselves under the following heads: - </para>

                <para>I want to state at the outset, definitely and emphatically, that book censorship is not a repressive measure usable at the whim of the particular Minister for Trade and Customs of the moment, but is the law as embodied in section 52c of the Customs Act. Some form of censorship operates in most civilized countries, and it remained for one of the founders of our Constitution, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> C. Kingston, to embody this provision in the first Customs Act. Almost precisely similar provisions exist in the statutes of New Zealand and the United States of America. Under this section of the act, goods considered indecent, blasphemous or obscene are prohibited imports, and these goods can include books and films. In addition, a proclamation and regulations under the same section have been set up to prohibit the importation of seditious and revolutionary literature. The actual wording of the section is as follows :  - </para>

                <para class="block">Surely the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> who talks freely on the subject, would not assert that all articles should be admitted. Would he say, for instance, that imitation bank notes, hypnotic and gazing crystals, dangerous weapons, opium, pistols and other objectionable goods, which, though desired by the few, would be detrimental to the many, should not be excluded? It may be argued that no one wants things of that kind to be admitted; but the act prohibits their importation, and certain gentlemen who work at night would like pistols to be more freely obtainable, whilst other gentry would be glad to have imitation bank notes put more freely into circulation. All these matters have to be covered by the Customs Act. Honorable members will remember the outcry which took place when the censorship of films first came into operation under the same section of the Customs Act; but who will now deny that the film censorship has not only been accepted, but is also universally approved? If it were not for the censorship provision in the Customs Act it is certain that the films which are now being exhibited in Australia would not be of their present high standard. On first thought the proposal that all books and periodicals published and circulated in England should be admitted into Australia without censorship might sound reasonable and a fitting Empire gesture, but the fact is, that in the enormous output in Great Britain there are produced some of the worst examples of obscene and indecentliterature. </para>
                <para>Realizing that a decision as to what constituted indecent and seditious literature was a matter of great national importance, requiring careful and broadminded consideration, the Lyons Government, in 1933, set up a board with scholarly and enlightened men of broad reading and wide knowledge to examine books held by the customs and to recommend whether or not they should be released. Consideration since then has therefore been given under a broader basis than previously, and the board, presided over by that very eminent citizen, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, is doing onerous work voluntarily. It takes into account the theme of the book and gives every credit, if any, to the book as literature, so that now it is only when obscenity and indecency are the dominant note that prohibition is recommended. In view of the number of advanced and audacious pseudo-modernist writers who claim to write a new morality and a new psychology, which Matthew Arnold described as a &#34; new licence to commit old sins &#34;, it will be realized what an unenviable public duty these gentlemen carry out in wading through the foul pages of pornographic and salacious books, often containing the coarsest language and the vilest obscenity, or in interpreting the message of weak-eyed and maudlin writers who plead the special case of the vicious, the depraved or the criminal. I would not defile <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> by quotations from such books as these, but if honorable members for their own satisfaction care to peruse excerpts from these banned books, I shall make them available.

                    <para class="block">But worse than these publications are those with innocuous titles which are frequently a disguise for some of the most disgusting . writings of modern times. Simple titles such as <inline font-style="italic">The Scene is Changed; Boy;</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">&#39;The Partners</inline> would deceive bookseller, librarian and public alike, so that these books written for the degenerate and prurient-minded find their way unwittingly into the circulating library and the home. The principal booksellers and librarians are grateful to the Customs Department that there is a. censorship which limits the spread of these moral pollutions and poisons in the written word ;in the same manner as legislation restricts the free sale and distribution of deleterious drugs. Recently, in New South Wales,  a man was  sentenced to four months imprisonment for having sent an indecent letter through the post, yet there is a tendency on the part of a minority, consisting in part of self-styled intellectuals, to regard the writer of a vile book as being in some way sacrosanct, and different from those who utter obscenities or portray them in films, and to say that the law should not be carried out. </para>
                    <para>That all books and periodicals published in England should be admitted into Australia without censorship, is the objective of the Book Censorship Abolition League, and the first question in the questionnaire which the league is circulating has led astray quite a number of people who do not know that this protection against the dumping of depraved literature in Australia has been in operation since federation, and is fairly and reasonably administered. It is  a  debatable point whether satisfactory censorship could be exercised through the State laws. It will be realized that, as Australia is a greater importer than a producer of books, control by the Customs at the point of entry is an infinitely better way of dealing with this matter than to leave it  to the six separate  police forces of the States after the books have been distributed. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members have asked why  it  is that books which have failed to pass the censor in Australia are permitted to circulate freely in Great Britain. In Great Britain the prevention of the sale of obscene books, pictures, prints, and other articles, is governed by an old act of 1857. Stage plays come within the province of the Lord Chamberlain, a court official, who may refuse to licence a theatre for the production of such plays. The censorship in regard to plays is stricter in England than in Australia, though the prohibition is sometimes circumvented by the production of a play in a private theatre. In Great Britain, films are censored by the trade itself with a network of regulations * concerned with fire, licensing, music, and quota, but with no actual law governing the film. The English act relating to literature is intended to give powers for the suppression of the trade in obscene publications. But the procedure there is not what we in Australia would relish. A complainant who has reason to believe  in the existence  of such books has only to swear before a magistrate or two justices of the peace ns to their existence, and upon satisfying the magistrate that his belief is well founded, the magistrate issues a search warrant. This empowers the police to enter such house, shop,  room  or other place with such assistance as may be necessary, to enter in the day time, and, if necessary, to use force by breaking open doors or otherwise, and to search for and seize all such books, papers, writing, prints, pictures, drawings, or  other representations,  and to carry all the articles so seized before the magistrate issuing the warrant, after which the occupier of such house or shop must appear within seven days to show cause  why the  articles so seized should not be destroyed. Honorable members can see that our own system is the better. </para>
                    <para>It  is amazing to find that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who, as a former Minister, was apparently satisfied with the law, should  now  take exception to it. The honorable member finds difficulty in placating both the watersiders  of Port  Melbourne and the citizens of Williamstown, but his difficulties will become  greater  when a large part of St. Kilda is  added to  his electorate. But that is merely by the  way.  With  a  very slight amendment, the wording of the proclamation and regulation has been the same since 1921. Except for the deletion of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">f &#34;</inline> where  a  seditious intention is expressed or seditious enterprise is advocated &#34;, the same clauses of the proclamation prohibiting the importation  into the  Commonwealth of literature which advocated the overthrow  by  force  or  violence of established government of the Commonwealth,  or  of any civilized country, remain. It is difficult  to  separate the censorship of general literature prohibited under section 52c of the act  from  that which falls under the proclamation  and  regulations of  that  section, for sometimes both indecency and incitement  to  violence  are  combined. An example  of  this is  to  be found in a hook printed  in  England under the title <inline font-style="italic">SS. Utah,</inline> written by Mick Pell,  which,  although containing certain vulgarities and obscenities,  which the  hoard  did not consider  sufficiently indecent  or  blasphemous  to  warrant its prohibition,  was  judged &#34; undoubtedly seditious, tendentious in character, and an incitement to unlawful violence&#34;, and accordingly prohibited. As much literature falling under the proclamation and regulations is printed in foreign languages and takes the form of pamphlets, books and Communist propaganda, it will  be  seen how difficult it is to decide what should  be  excluded. In deed, there is a good deal of communism behind the whole agitation for the abolition of censorship. The Book Censorship Abolition League, which has apparently been responsible for the greater part  of  the agitation against the present censorship,  has  for its immediate object the securing of  the  right of entry into Australia without censorship of all books at present published and circulated freely in Great Britain. </para>

He said &#34; For several days  I  have asked a question regarding the removal of the embargo upon certain literature, and have been promised that something would be done.&#34; On the very next day, the then Attorney-General drafted a  new  proclamation which placed complete power in the hands  of  the Minister, and from that day the proclamation prohibiting the entry of certain literature became a dead letter. Although the people  of  Australia believed that the Government of the day stood for the exclusion  of  literature of that type, I have not  been  able to find the record  of  the prohibition of a single publication. </para>

                            <para>- I appreciate the honorable member&#39;s point of view, and said so when he was Attorney-General.  It  may be contended that the good sense  of  our citizens may be trusted to discard what is either harmful or dangerous. But even if that be true, it is beside the point. Laws are made to be carried out, and are framed for the good of society in the aggregate.  I  have no doubt that the majority of the people of Australia are proof against subversive propaganda. There are, however, minds that are capable of being influenced by specious approaches, with results that are injurious, not only to themselves, but also to the State; and it is both the right and the duty of the Government to protect them. The depths to which Communist propaganda would sink - and this applies also to books printed in England, where much of the Communist propaganda  is  produced - is shown in what purports to be a children&#39;s book, wherein religion, the law, the Empire, and every tradition revered in England are held up to ridicule and reproach. The production of  books is so great that much of what is published does not come&#39; under official notice. But there is a censorship in Great Britain. I could enumerate a long list of books that have been banned there. I have here a book containing matter that is intended to be assimilated by children or by childish minds. It contains an alphabet from which I shall make some quotations. According to this alphabet - &#34;E stands for Empire, built upon blood&#34;, opposite which is a pictorial representation of a man being hanged. The next iB &#34; F is for Fascists, a murderous brood&#34;, opposite that letter is a pile of skulls surmounted by a Union Jack, with a British officer with drawn sword standing alongside. It says that &#34; H is the holocaust, we&#39;ll fight to end &#34;, &#34; J is for Jail, where good rebels are held &#34;, &#34; K stands for Kremlin, where our Stalin lives &#34;. &#34; E revolution, we&#39;re going to win &#34; - flags being shown bearing the captions &#34;A &#39;Soviet Britain&#34; and &#34;Workers unite&#34; - and &#34;Y is for you, who will know how to fight &#34; - a number of children being shown shouting &#34; Soviets for Britain &#34;. Does any honorable member defend such a book as that? If the Labour party will not denounce the Communists, we shall do so, and also see that the law is enforced. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens)</inline> evidently misunderstood me when I said that he might speak on behalf of the Italians in the north. I made no reflection upon those people, but merely referred to the Communist propaganda in North Queensland, concerning which Italians had approached me when I was in the Herbert electorate recently. I am sorry that the honorable member is not in the chamber to hear this explanation. I suggest that he should support a policy which aims at the exclusion from Australia of certain literature printed in foreign languages, some of which is intended for Italians in North Queensland and some for Yugoslavs in Western Australia, but all of it definitely revolutionary and seditious. I have mentioned that nobody is forgotten in the Communist approach. There is special literature for Italians, for black races, and for Yugoslavs who are members of the Cultural and Educational Glut in Perth - a body which, I believe, has Communist leanings. It has written to me stating that it supports the protest which has been made against the banning of any &#39; literature. Such action, it says, lowers Australia&#39;s prestige in the eyes of the world, and interferes with Australia&#39;s intellectual advancement. Have we not read similar expressions of opinion in the press ever since the first meeting of the Book Abolition League in November last ? This is a subject of which we want to hear the end, from whatever source it emanates, so that the people will no longer be hoodwinked. The Labour Government, led by the present Leader of the Opposition, banned 147 indecent books out of a total of 294 that had been banned up to the end of 1931. At that time a censorship board was not in- existence, the banning or otherwise of any work being the prerogative of the Minister for Trade and Customs. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> knows what a difficult task it was. </para>

                        <para>.--I should like to have spoken earlier in this debate so that I could have accepted the challenge which the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> threw down when he invited honorable members to attack the censorship on principle and as a whole.  I  disagree with the censorship upon principle, as a whole. I do not think that any self-respecting country can endure a system under which the right of the people to read whatever they like can be taken away from them by men sitting behind closed doors and without examination in public. I believe that canons of judgment change from time to time. Our ideas of what is sedition change; so do our ideas of what is blasphemy and our ideas of what is obscenity. If any honorable member doubts this I invite him to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Stephen&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">A Digest of the Criminal Law,</inline> in which he will find set out under separate headings, first, the old view of the old law, supported by authority, and next the modern conception of the law. The modern conception has been made possible only by the fact that courts of law, particularly courts sitting With juries, have refused to convict men who under the old view of the law would be guilty. An illustration of the change of opinion is found in the fact that at the end of the eighteenth century Thomas Paine was prosecuted for publishing a seditious libel. Had he not fieri to Prance he would have been convicted. To-day the memory of Thomas Paine is revered and his work - <inline font-style="italic">The Rights of Man</inline> - is freely read and has inspired thousands. We have also an entirely different standard to-day for determining what is blasphemy. Men who to-day discuss, decorously and seriously, theological and doctrinal principles would have paid a very severe penalty had they so discussed them not so many years ago. Tho standard of obscenity has changed also. A person may to-day go to almost any bookstall and buy &#39;.Flaubert&#39;s masterpiece, <inline font-style="italic">Madame Bovary,</inline> but in the fifties Flaubert was prosecuted in France for having written it - a prosecution which was so protracted that it was, in effect, persecution. Walt Whitman&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Leaves of Grass</inline> was a book banned by the Post Office of the United States of America. It could not be carried through the mail. A similar ban has been placed upon many other notable books in various countries. Havelock Ellis&#39;s great work <inline font-style="italic">Studies in the Psychology of Sex</inline> was &#34;once a banned book, but every one who has read it knows what a valuable and useful work it is, and how the study of such a book may make life easier and simpler for the rising generation. The fact that standards have changed cannot be doubted. In the circumstances in which we now find ourselves, Ministers and bureaucrats, sitting behind closed doors, should not be allowed to decide what publications are seditious, blasphemous and obscene. Such questions should be determined by courts, preferably courts with juries. No one in England can say to-day what constitutes sedition. We are able to do so in Australia, because the Commonwealth statute has followed the Queensland code in adopting the modern view. But we have been well reminded by a former English Chief Justice. Lord Coleridge, that in the eighteenth century people were sent to gaol, and even transported for having argued dispassionately as to the merits of hereditary monarchy. As to obscenity, I shall give an illustration from our own times to show how views differ. Some honorable members will remember that a man named Chidley was prosecuted and convicted in Sydney for an obscene publication. He appealed to the Full Court, the majority of which upheld the conviction; but &#39;tinminority judge, that learned Chief Justice <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Cullen, held that dudley&#39;s book was not obscene. Chidley attempted to appeal to the High Court, aud actually obtained special leave to do so. The majority of the High Court later rescinded the&#39; special leave to appeal. They held that a conviction should not be appealed from unless the decision involved a grave miscarriage of justice. They did not hold that the conviction was right : they merely held that it was not unreasonable. The dissenting judge was the Chief Justice who thought that the appeal should have been heard. This difference of opinion shows that each man makes his own definition of obscenity. What is clean to one man is unclean to another. What to one man is  350 <inline font-style="italic">Book</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Censorship.</inline> a socially useful discussion of matters of public importance is to another man merely filth. In this connexion I quote the following expression of opinion by an American, who has spent most of his life fighting the Federal Post Office on this matter. Theodore Schroeder says - </para>

                        <para>Obscenity is not a quality inherent in a book but solely and exclusively a contribution of the reading mind, and hence cannot be defined in terms of the qualities of a book. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That may be regarded as a rather extreme statement, but it is a fact that obscenity depends largely upon the mind of the person who reads a book, his training, and the repressions he has been under. I suppose many honorable members will recollect the time when Nathaniel Hawthorne&#39;s book <inline font-style="italic">The Scarlet Letter</inline> was regarded as obscene and unfit for young men and women to read. I recollect an amusing story of Rhoda Broughton, who lived for a very long time. She said that when she was young her books were thought to be almost as dangerous as the books of Zola, but the third generation considered her work as uninteresting and inoffensive as the works of CharlotteYonge. She said, &#34; &#34;When I was young I was Zola, and now that I am older, I am Yonge&#34;. The fact is, of course, that there should be the greatest freedom of discussion of these subjects. Freedom of discussion is always hindered and repression set up by men sitting behind closed doors who give no account of their doings to the public. If the circulation of any book is to be prohibited, it should be done only after a public investigation of its merits by a judge, sitting preferably with a jury, examining the matter and taking evidence upon it. It should not be done by a Minister or any official. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is surely aware that a very large number of books classed as obscene, blasphemous and seditious, and appearing on the Minister&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">index expurgatorius,</inline> are sold every day. At bookstalls in Melbourne and in other cities many books can be purchased which are more obscene and allegedly have a greater tendency to corrupt than many of the banned books. </para>

                    <para class="block">I know this because I have read some of the banned books and a great many others. Those who want to find obscene literature can find it anywhere. I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Windeyer referring to one of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Besant&#39;s</inline> books in 1889, and saying that if people want to read obscene matter, they can find it in Lempriere&#39;s Dictionary or even in the Bible. The honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane),</inline> if he were ever young, would know that this is so. The banning of books should always be a matter for investigation. I am not attacking the Minister or his administration of the law. It was provided in 1902 that blasphemous, indecent and obscene books should not be imported, and regulations have been made to deal with allegedly seditious books. It is the Minister&#39;s duty, no doubt, to carry out the law to the best of his ability, but the responsibility for the condition of the law rests upon Parliament, and Parliament should no longer be satisfied with the law as it is. </para>

                            <para>- I would. I remind the honorable member that we used to allow full reports of evidence in divorce cases to be published in the press. Those reports were more injurious to the young than the prohibited books. The great evil of the present procedure is that the vital part of it takes place behind closed doors. No one really wants to import books which, in fact, are wholly devoted to the objects condemned by the regulations or by the Crimes Act. But, on the other hand, men should be free to read what has been said in criticism of the prevailing ideas of social organization - even though such criticism may lead its students to believe that our social organization should be fundamentally changed. The Minister should not have the right to determine that any book falls within the prohibited categories, and that, therefore, its introduction into Australia will be forbidden. For instance, an English magazine, the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Monthly,</inline> which was on the Library table in our State parliament was at the same time on the Minister&#39;s index. Who prohibited it I do not know. It was stopped at the customs, and came to our house by post. For some years, I had read it regularly, and, while it was prohibited, I read it intermittently. I could not see how it could be brought within section 14 <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the Crimes Act, or within these regulations. It is true that some man might think the magazine could be brought within the section of these regulations, just as at the beginning of federation <inline font-style="italic">Reynolds&#39; Newspaper</inline> was prohibited as a seditious publication, but whether it comes within the section should be the subject of judicial determination after a public investigation. </para>

But it is desirable, I think, that there should be as much freedom as possible. I do not know of any book that ought to be banned, or of any modern novel that is more obscene than books which to-day have an unquestioned place upon the shelves of public libraries and are accessible to all people. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave -</inline> On the question of secrecy to which the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> has just referred, I point out that, so far as ordinary literature is concerned, there is an appeal to a censorship board. That right has operated since 1933. So far as seditious and revolutionary publications are concerned, there is a right of appeal to any court within four months of the date on which any such literature is detained by the Customs Department, and this appeal applies also to any that is deemed to be indecent, blasphemous or obscene. In all cases, the importer concerned may notify the department that he proposes to have the matter tested in a court of law, and if he can prove then that the publication in question is not seditious, revolutionary, indecent, blasphemous, or obscene, the book is admitted and the importer may proceed with its distribution in the ordinary way. I, and, I am sure, any honorable member who happened to be the Minister in office when the application was made, would facilitate access to the court in such cases. This procedure, I contend, is much simpler than that suggested by the honorable member for Bourke in that it does not necessitate action in six different States. The point of entry at the customs is considered to be the best place of stoppage. I submit that the present system is much simpler than that suggested by the honorable member. It has also been constantly asserted that books are confiscated and burned when prohibited by the department. That is not so. Any books that are banned arc returned to the importer who is free to send them back to their source, and receive credit for them. </para>

                            <para>- Some of them are, but the course generally taken is similar to that adopted with regard to other goods which may be inadvertently imported. Where it is known definitely that such books are being brought in surreptitiously then they come within the ordinary category of smuggled goods, and are forfeited to the Crown. I propose now to quote statistics which will be of much interest to honorable members. This debate is important to all of us. Honorable members want to understand fully the reason for the agitation that has sprung up. The position has been largely misunderstood, and very often misrepresented. The course to be followed in respect of seditious and revolutionary literature is laid down by statute, and the Government would practically be guilty of treachery to the people if it did not carry out the statute law. Since federation, only some 400 books, including the pamphlets, newspapers and typewritten statements to which I have already referred, have been prohibited, or an average of one a month. Since 1921, even including seditious and revolutionary literature the average of prohibitions during the most intensive period of censorship has been only about six or seven publications per . month. Having regard to these facts honorable members will agree that the number is comparatively small. Students desirous of reading sociological or political works can secure them. In many cases cheap paper editions are prohibited, but the public may have access to such works in our public libraries. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members will agree that this is an unusual agitation, and it is well that it should be discussed. The debate has thrown a good deal of light on the whole subject, and particularly on the manner in which the art is administered If any change is desirable it can be properly discussed in Parliament. I am ready to confer with any honorable member who thinks he can suggest an improvement of the present system, but I do not think that anything brought out in to-day&#39;s debate, shows that the act is not just and fair, or not properly administered. </para>

                        <para>. -I have listened with a great deal of interest to this discussion, and would not have risen at this late hour, but that I desire to refer to one or two statements made by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn).</inline> Before proceeding to do so, however, I wish to congratulate the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> on the manner in which he presented his case. In this respect, &#91; believe, he has earned the commendation of members on both sides of the House. </para>

                    <para>First of all, the honorable member for Bourke stated that much that in times gone by was considered to be heterodox was orthodox to-day. In that view, I am sure, honorable members will entirely concur. Much that was looked upon in days gone by as seditious has the approbation of most sections of the community at the present time. Those responsible for the censorship of books are sensible of the changing public point of view on various questions, and are not, as the honorable member for Bourke seemed to suggest, of an archaic type of mind. I put it to the House that they take into consideration contemporary opinion, and the change in public thought as time goes on, and consequently, allowing for that outlook, permit such books to enter as they consider to be in the interests of the people as a whole. </para>
                    <para>I rose particularly to comment on statements made by the honorable member for Bourke because he is the only  speaker  from the other side who has dealt particularly with obscene writings. I hold strong views on that phase of the question. While I have what may be regarded as lenient views on writings dealing with economic and political problems, I hold definitely that it is not very difficult, so far as pornographic writings are concerned, for a normal, well-balanced mind to judge what literature may prove harmful to the community. The honorable member for Bourke has suggested that this question should be left to the decision of various tribunals. I think that such a course is unnecessary. It is well known that a certain degenerate section among the distributors of litorature exploit the public, their sole purpose being to profit at the expense of those whose state of mind is not on a par with that of members of this House. There are at all times in our midst people who are decidedly influenced by licentious writings, and to allow any one to prey on the minds of such people is not in the interest of the public. On this matter I cannot do better than read the following quotation from the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> of the 6th March : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Pornography in art means the concentration of the mind on one aspect of life for its own sake, and the exclusion of all other aspects. This concentration finds its extreme expression in the sexual pervert and sometimes ends in thu  lunatie  asylum, a prison or the gallows.  1 agree with that view and consequently 1 hold that the Government should stand &#34; porter at the door of thought &#34; if we desire to resist the evil effects of the circulation qf pornographic literature. Therefore, I do not agree with the view expressed by the honorable member for Bourke. I consider the Government&#39;&#39;; policy in this respect has been justified, and that it can be supported by most of those who have the well-being of the people at heart. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In regard to literature on political and economic problems it might be advantageous if the censorship could be divorced as far as possible from party politics. There is good cause for complaint when members of certain parties consider that the authority of censorship is influenced by the representations of the party to which that authority at some particular time is confined, and therefor&#34; that that authority is prone to view certain works from a &#39;biased standpoint. It is impossible to eradicate such a possibility under the present system. However, if any thing could be done to rectify the position in this respect it would be in the public interest to so change this form of government control. The present system is by no means perfect, but this debate has given honorable members an opportunity to elicit from the Minister a great deal of information previously unknown to them. During the. early stages of the debate quite a number of speakers did not appear to understand fully the policy of the Government, but the Minister&#39;s speech considerably clarified the situation. </para>

                        <para>.- I j I join with other honorable members in protesting against the present method of censorship of publications. The dissatisfaction that has existed for some time was brought to a head very recently by resolutions carried at the Australian Science Congress, and the Summer School of the Australian Institute of Political Science, as well as by the formation of various leagues in Melbourne and in Brisbane for the purpose of protesting against this particular form of censorship. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> concentrated upon two points. The first was an endeavour to deal with the prohibition of indecent and obscene literature, and the second an endeavour to prove a connexion between communism and the organizations protesting against the present system of preventing the entry of literature into this country. Taking the latter point first the position is that the censorship leagues which have been formed comprise many men distinguished in science and literature, whose names are household words in this country. </para>

                            <para>- The point is not the question of origin; but rather that these persons who are being sneered at by honorable members opposite are in many instances distinguished in science and literature throughout Australia. The Minister in endeavouring to connect communism with these organizations adopted the course usually followed in this Parliament when sound argument is lacking. The fact that two or three communists support an organization, whatever its objects may be, does not, prove that such organizations are wrong. It is common knowledge that quite a number of worthy organizations, such as those opposed to war, have communists among their members, but that does not prove that the objects of such organizations are entirely wrong. I believe that every man, whether ho be pro-communist or anti-communist, is entitled to give expression to the opinions that he sincerely holds. It is traditional British policy that within very wide limits every person should be entitled to ventilate his opinions in writing or verbally, and that the observance of tills principle is in the nature of a nation nl  safety valve. It is &#39;because of this that the British Empire has not suffered from revolutions, as other nations have suffered, and it is in accordance with the traditional British love of liberty. Nothing is prized more than liberty of thought. With the exception of a few words towards the close of his speech the Minister made very little reference, to the prohibitions of political literature; yet so far as we can discover by far the greater proportion of the literature prohibited from entering this country deals with political subjects. I say &#34; so far as we can discover &#34; advisedly, because the whole system is shrouded in mystery. That is one of the fundamental objections to it. If the Minister would let us know what is happening there might not be so many objections. At present we do not know what is going on. The Minister, by interjection, asked various speakers to name any book to the prohibition of which he objected. Th&#38; difficulty is that we are working in the dark. Almost all the information on the subject which we can obtain has been gathered by pressmen and published in the newspapers. It would appear that the Minister and the department have made every effort possible to prevent information reaching even those who represent the people in this Parliament. </para>

From the information which the press has been able to obtain, despite the mystery surrounding this subject, it would appear that a greater number of books dealing with political subjects are banned than all other types combined.

Every person interested in the welfare of the nation should be given the opportunity to read of what other countries are doing.

            <para>In the principal act, paragraph c of section 17 debars a person from receiving a pension unless he is of good character. While I do not hold a brief for bad characters, I claim that once a person has been sentenced by a court for an offence, and has served that sentence, lie should not be further punished by the Pensions Department. An old man may have a few drinks, not necessarily with his pension money, but at the invitation of a friend, and, having the misfortune to become drunk, he is picked up by the police, and is subsequently convicted. Such a man may lose his pension for six months or twelve months, and, in one case of which I know, the pension was lost for two years. That is the worst form of punishment that could be inflicted upon him; it is sentencing him to starvation because he is unable to work owing to age and infirmity. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member has moved an amendment, the effect of which is that the possession of good character shall no longer be a qualification for an old-age pension. I* has frequently been held in this House, and not least strongly by members of the Opposition, that a pension is a reward for good citizenship. If the honorable member&#39;s amendment were carried, a pension might be payable to any person, whether or not he had been a good citizen. This paragraph, as is the case with all other provisions of the act, is administered with a good deal of sympathy by the Commissioner aud  Deputy  Commissioners. I can best illustrate this by quoting one example. In 192S, a man was charged with the murder of his wife in peculiarly disgusting circumstances. Owing to the evidence being largely circumstantial, the man was not convicted of murder, but of manslaughter. He was sentenced to seven years&#39; imprisonment, but, after serving a part of that time, he was released on licence. He had had a good character while in gaol, and when he came out, being qualified by age, he applied for the old-age pension. The </para>

                <para class="block">Commissioner learned from the prison authorities that his conduct in gaol had been excellent, but, being somewhat in doubt about the matter, he discussed it with me, and it was decided that the man&#39;s application for a pension should be accepted. It was held that he had redeemed his character, and that he was qualified to receive a pension. </para>

                <para>There are other cases, however, in which the Commissioner cannot be lenient. I refer particularly to cases of confirmed drunkards, men who are being repeatedly convicted on charges of drunkenness. In one case that was brought under my notice a pensioner was convicted of drunkenness and lost his pension. After a sufficient time had elapsed he applied for his pension again, and it was restored. He was again, convicted, and lost his pension. Again he applied for it, and while the matter was still under consideration he was convicted no fewer than three times for drunkenness. In such circumstances, it would be a waste of public money to continue paying him a pension, because it would bc spent on drink. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to know in what State the man mentioned by the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> was sentenced for manslaughter, and subsequently received a pension. I am fairly certain that it could not have been Queensland. The Acting Treasurer said that the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> wanted to make pensions payable to persons of bad character, and he added that it was never intended that that should be done. I do not think it was the contention of the honorable member that pensions should be paid to murderers. The point is that the man had paid the penalty for his crime by, serving a term in prison, and should not thereafter be pursued. Reference has been made to the payment of pensions to persons convicted of drunkenness. I have in mind the case of a man at Hughenden, Queensland, concerning whom the local Church of England clergyman wrote to the Commissioner of Pensions. That man was penalized for practically twelve months because a policeman found him drunk. He was an old bush worker, who had met a number of his mates, who paid for soma drinks for him. Unfortunately, after he emerged from the hotel, he met a young policeman, who was looking for promotion. I know of other policemen, not so keen on gaining promotion by such means, who take pensioners to their homes if they find that they have indulged too freely in spirituous liquors. That is a more humane way to treat such persons. Many men who have been bush workers all their lives have little enjoyment in their declining years other than an occasional drink with their friends. &#34;With liquor at present prices, they are not likely to drink themselves to death on a pension of 17s. 6d. per week.. It is claimed, on behalf of offending pensioners, that it is difficult to get the Pensions Department to take a lenient view of their offences. The department contends that the taxpayers&#39; money should not be granted to men who will squander it. In the cases that I have presented to the department the men concerned  have not squandered their pensions. A pensioner living at Camooweal has to pay 5s. 6d., -or practically one-third of his week&#39;s pension, for a bottle of beer. Similar prices prevail at Burketown, and through the Gulf country generally. Pensioners in those areas are not able to buy large quantities of liquor with their pensions.. The administration should not penalize a man if he is found intoxicated once, but should give him a chance. I hope that the Minister will see that a more lenient view is taken in these cases. I have in mind the case of an old man at Herberton, who is not on friendly terms with the local policeman. Every time he indulges too freely in drink the policeman arrests him. I believe that I was partly responsible for his last lapse, by giving him a couple of drinks, which resulted in the loss of his pension, which has not yet been restored to him. Honorable members may say to me, &#34; Shame on you for inducing him to drink,&#34; but I say, &#34; Shame on the Minister and his officers for depriving the old man of his pension.&#34; </para>

                    <para>.- I have a good deal of sympathy with the case presented by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James).</inline> The pension legislation passed by this Parliament has been administered in a way to which I strongly object. A pensioner who is found guilty of a misdemeanour loses his pension, and has to accept the dole and obtain food relief in order to live. In some cases the administration has shown leniency to offenders. I cite the case of an old man who was deprived of his pension for a month ; but, after he had been to the Salvation Army penitentform and the captain had testified to his change of heart, the pension was restored. Unfortunately, such cases are not so general as they might be. I have interested myself in another pensioner who has been convicted on five occasions. Representations have been made to me by worthy citizens that this pensioner is practically crippled in his legs, and has occasionally to sit on the kerbstone, although he may not be drunk.  His  pension has, however, been stopped on the ground of drunkenness. The magistrate who convicted him recommended that the administration should pay his pension to some one who would use it on his behalf. As a result of investigations which I instituted through a member of the State Parliament, after I was refused the information, I ascertained that the same policeman had always arrested this man. On one occasion he arrested the old man when within 50 yards of his home. The local baker who witnessed the arrest said that the old man, who was driving a sulky, did not constitute a danger either to himself or any one else, because his horse would have taken him home. The same constable not long before bad arrested for drunkenness a man who sat on the kerbstone because be was ill, as was proved by the fact that he died of haemorrhage later in the cell. Although a man sitting on the kerbstone can do little or no harm, there are officious constables who seem to take a delight in arresting him, whereas had they an atom of human kindness in their nature, they would take the unfortunate man by the arm and lead him home. The administration takes a lot of convincing of the reasonableness of requests by members of Parliament that pensions should be restored to persons who have been found guilty of misdemeanours. No one likes to see an old man the worse for liquor, but it takes very little to throw a man of 65 or 70 years of age off his balance. Honorable members who interest themselves in these cases are probably quite as good judges of the . men concerned as is a magistrate who reads their records on paper. There is need for a change of attitude on the part of the administration, for, as things are, members of Parliament have practically to become investigating officers for the department in order that pensioners may be treated justly. </para>

I got in touch with the Controller of Prisons, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinchley,</inline> who appealed to the Pensions Department to grant the man a pension. The Prisoners&#39; Aid Association also made similar representations. This man cannot obtain the dole; he cannot work because of his infirmity; he cannot get food. What is he to do? If it is contended that he was guilty of an offence, the reply is that he has paid the penalty for his crime. I hope that the Minister will consider such cases. </para>

                    <para>.- I have a good deal of sympathy with the principle involved in the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James).</inline> I&#39; see no reason for providing in a statute, as a condition precedent to the granting of a pension, that a man must be of good character to entitle him to receive it. I hope that no one will assume from that statement that I am necessarily advocating that men of bad character should be paid pensions out of the revenues of the Commonwealth ; but I point out that it is quite a novel procedure to provide that a man, whose right to a pension is otherwise sustained, must prove to the satisfaction of the commissioner that he is of good character. This Parliament should not set itself up as a censor of the people&#39;s morals. There are abundant laws in this country to ensure that the conduct of its citizens conforms to certain standards, and there is ample provision within the law for punishing those who depart from those standards. Those laws are not invoked with hesitation against the poor in the community; certainly they are not invoked with discrimination in their favour. There is no just principle upon which we may employ this vague term &#34; good character &#34;. It is not necessary to prove good character to become a member of Parliament. Indeed, it may be difficult of fulfilment in the case of some of us. The possession of good character is not stipulated as a condition for membership of the Public Service, and in fact is- not usually specifically set out anywhere. Good character is assumed until something is proven against a man to establish that he is of bad character or unworthy to receive a benefit to which he is otherwise entitled. It is a very vague phrase. There are other clauses relating to convictions for drunkenness and repeated convictions for other offences, to which I can make only the most casual reference. I maintain that in every one of those cases the pensioner, having suffered the penalty which the law imposes upon him, should not be further punished. What is meant by good character? Why appoint a tribunal which, behind closed doors, may decide that one man is of good character and another is not of sufficiently good character to receive a pension? We should not be concerned with these moral considerations, except in so far as moral offences </para>

                    1935. 359 constitute a breach of the law. One commissioner may have exceedingly strong views on intemperance ; another may take the saner view that intemperance is very often, if not always, a &#34;disease in respect of which the patient should be pitied rather than condemned. We are too often told that the pension is an act of charity, and that we, as a benevolent institution, bestow the money upon people who, having no right to it, yet receive it as the result of the taxpayers&#39; generosity. The qualifications of a pensioner are set out in the law, comprising his length of residence, capacity to maintain himself, the extent of his property, and a variety of other things which make it not too easy for any old person to get the pension. Apart from that, the man or woman is, like any other citizen, amenable to the strict laws of the land. We should not allow this vague phrase regarding goodness or badness of character, which may moan anything - one thing to some persons and quite another to others - to be adopted as a qualification, especially as the decision must depend upon &#39; the varying views of different persons upon moral questions. Those persons will form their opinions in secret, and without being called upon to justify their decisions.

In two instances I have known the persons concerned for some time and consider that they are justly entitled to the pension. Any person who loses his pension under this clause cannot work, and must find himself facing starvation. One man who was convicted of theft many years ago has been refused a pension because of that conviction. Another case which came before me last week is that of an old woman who was refused a pension on the ground of bad character. Both these are cases of real hardship.

                    <para>.- This section of the act very often brings about serious hardship, owing to the severity with which it has to be administered. In one case the man was convicted on circumstantial evidence in a court in Adelaide, and served his sentence. He proved a most exemplary prisoner, and came out with the best of records. He sought the restoration of his pension, but the department says that no further consideration can be given until June next. He is an invalid, and finds it increasingly difficult to secure the necessities that he requires. He has come to me several times in a state of desperation. Is not such a man likely to be driven to do things that he should not do? Any man who tries to rehabilitate himself should be encouraged, instead of being further penalized by being deprivedof his pension. I realize that this section deals with claimants rather than those persons who have their pensions suspended, but it is closely related to that section dealing with undeserving cases. People should not be deprived of the pension on account of acts of intemperance. It cannot be said that such people are of bad character or undeserving. Many of them are most deserving by reason of the services they have given to their country, yet if a man or woman is convicted of drunkenness on two occasions the pension is suspended for six months. </para>

                        <para>- My experience has been that the pension has been suspended after two convictions. This is unfair, because the offender is not only fined &#163;1 or &#163;2 by the police court for the second offence, but is also deprived by the department of &#163;22 10s. representing six months&#39; pension money. That is not fair. I ask the department to remember that if an aged or invalid person is regarded as unable to exercise proper custody of his pension money, the Deputy Commissioner may issue a warrant entitling another person to receive the money on the pensioner&#39;s behalf. I therefore support the amendmnt. </para>

                    <para>.- I also support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James).</inline> It is unfortunate, from the Government point of view, that the Minister, instead of combating the argument advanced by the honorable member for Hunter, sought to cloud the issue by insinuating that the real intention of the amendment is to make the pension payable to criminals. To support his contention, the Minister cited the case of a man who had been convicted of manslaughter. I take the strongest exception to the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions in any State being set up virtually as a censor of morals, with power to superimpose additional penalties on persons who have already been convicted and dealt with in accordance with the law. A number of such cases have been brought under my notice by persons who may be regarded as disinterested, in that they are not relatives of the individuals concerned. In. a country town, a conviction for inebriety was recorded against the oldest resident. He was almost a total abstainer, but during the Christmas season, he was given drinks by a number of well-wishers, and, for his first offence, his pension was stopped. I venture to say that it would have remained unpaid up to the present time had it not been for representations made to the department through me at the request of business men in the town. The magistrate who tried the case merely sentenced him to be imprisoned until the rising of the court, but the department, by stopping his pension, fined him at the rate of &#163;45 a year ! </para>

                <para class="block">In the early stages of food relief in that State, the invalid&#39;s pension was regarded as income; but subsequently it was not so treated. For the purpose of food relief, a man, who has three or four children, is ignored as a unit in the family. He neither receives food relief, nor is his income taken into account in calculating the income of the family, although previously an invalid pensioner&#39;s money was regarded as permissible income of a recipient of the dole. The invalid&#39;s pension iu this case, and the small sum earned by his wife and children, totalled a few shillings a week more than the permissible amount of income, and because of that fact he was summoned before the court. He was not fined the difference between the permissible and actual income, but was called upon to repay the value of the whole of the food relief which he had received over the period. This amounted to a penalty of &#163;20, although there was no previous conviction of any kind against him. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to  say  that when this case is settled the Minister will not be prepared to see that the back money is paid to this pensioner, if it can be proved that it has been taken from him contrary to section 51. These decisions are never reviewed without outside pressure. I do not know one invalid or old-age pensioner - and there are hundreds of them in my electorate - who has had his pension stopped, and has had it subsequently renewed without outside pressure, yet the Minister persists in saying that the act lays down the period for which persons may be disqualified  for  the receipt of the pension. If these unfortunate individuals have nobody to make representations on their behalf, the department gives them a life sentence. Once an invalid pensioner is struck off the pension list he is practically left to starve. The dole regulations in New South Wales, which are presumably similar to those in operation in other States, classify an invalid pensioner, not as unemployed, but as unemployable. If the department sees an elderly and sickly unemployed person seeking the dole, it advises him to apply for the pension; but once he becomes an invalid pensioner and is marked down as permanently  incapacitated  for work, he is no longer regarded as unemployed. He is classed as unemployable and not entitled to the dole. If he commits some paltry offence, the departmental censor of morals,  in  the shape of the State Registrar, decides that the penalty usually applied to other citizens is not sufficient for the invalid pensioner. When a man who is not a pensioner is arrested for drunkenness and is fined fi, society is satisfied. If, however, he happens to be an invalid pensioner and commits a similar offence, in the view of the censor of morals something further should be done. Why should differentiation be shown in the treatment of these two classes of individuals? The federal department stops the pension, and the State department refuses to recognize the invalid pensioner as unemployed. Of course, he is not prepared to starve, and he can hardly be blamed if he takes part in criminal adventures in order to feed himself. So the treatment of invalid pensioners under this precious section- </para>

                        <para>- Let it apply to old-age pensions, and the position is the same so far as food relief is concerned. I have outlined the treatment which is given to these old people under the pretext that the department is trying to secure a moral community, and refuses to pay pensions to persons of bad character. The stopping of their pensions, however, is conducive to criminal practices. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Although that man committed manslaughter, his pension was restored, probably as the result of certain representations. But take the case cited by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden),</inline> that of a man who, while an inmate of a gaol, became paralysed right down the right side. Even the Controller of Prisons in New South Wales made representations on his behalf, yet his pension was not restored. There is also the case of the man who, through lack of knowledge of the dole regulations, fell foul of the law, was penalized to an amount of &#163;20, and in addition has had his pension stopped for two years, which represents a further penalty of &#163;90. </para>

                    <para>.- I consider that this section of the act is applied improperly to persons who may have offended against the law in their early years. I have had to fight cases of that kind, involving both women and men. It is a scandal and a disgrace to refuse a pension to a woman of 60 years of age because of some misdemeanour iu early life. We should not set ourselves up as judges of the morals of the people. If every person had imprinted on his or her face a record of sins committed, not many would be granted a pension. Those who adjudicate in such matters may have committed greater sins against society than the pensioners upon whom judgment is passed. A conviction for drunkenness should not be regarded as justification for the withdrawal of a pension. By such action the Commonwealth shirks its obligation and throws on the States the responsibility of keeping those who are deprived of the pension, because it is a crime to allow any individual to starve. If the application of this principle were widened I might be disqualified in the future from drawing an old-age pension because of my membership of the Labour party. The administration in Tasmania is fairly liberal, but there have been cases in which it has  been  necessary to appeal to the Minister. Seldom is a man locked up in that State on the charge of drunkenness. The police are actuated by humanitarian instincts, and when a pensioner is found to be suffering from the effects of alcohol he is either sent home in a cab or placed in a quiet spot where he may recover. The police force of New South Wales might well act a little more sympathetically in such cases. I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with much of what has been said in support of the amendment. The proposal of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> is directed largely to cases in which distinct hardship has been caused. I wish to give one or two instances of the application of the law which have come to my knowledge within the last few months. They relate to in mates of benevolent homes. A remarkable case occurred only the other day. The medical evidence, and that of practically everyone concerned was in favor of the pensioner, who is universally regarded as of excellent character. Unfortunately, however, he sometimes loses control of his limbs and falls down in the street. On the day in question he had not had a drink. When returning to the homo with a. bottle of wine in his hip pocket for a sick inmate he met an acquaintance. While talking to this man he collapsed and fell. The bottle broke, and his clothes became saturated with its contents. The impression that I have received from conversations with the inmates of this home is that the superintendent comes down on them with a sledge hammer and immediately reports them to the department with a view to having their pensions discontinued. These old people receive only 5s. a week out of the pension, the remaining 12s. 6d. going to the home. Some of them are almost on their last legs, and one glass of beer or other alcoholic liquor practically makes them intoxicated. But the small quantity that they imbibe does them no harm. The invariable reply of the department, when a case is brought to its notice, is that the man is of &#34; vicious habits &#34;. Some of those who pass judgment drink as much in a week, without showing any effects, as these old people do in a month. I say nothing against their having a drink ; it does them no harm. The point that I make is that, from the inception of pensions legislation, the pension has been regarded as a right, and not as a charity. The attitude adopted by the department, however, is, &#34; If you are a good boy you will get it, but if you dare to overstep what we regard as the border line between decency and viciousness, or if you happen to have a glass of beer, it will be withheld from you.&#34; The position appears to have become aggravated within the last year or two. Since my recent return to this Parliament I have dealt with more cases of the discontinuance of pensions than I handled in my previous membership of twelve years. I do not know whether the Minister is sheltering behind the  Deputy  Commissioner. It would be interesting to know whether the officials have been given the quiet word to tighten up and save expenditure wherever possible, in order that budgets may be balanced. It seems to me that some influence is behind this filching of the pennies from the old people. If they can afford to have a glass of beer, it is little recompense enough in their old age for having pioneered this country and helped to build up the huge incomes of persons who are financially able to enjoy champagne suppers and. the like. The Government adopts a miserable- attitude when it says that they may not have a glass of beer if they are able to afford it out of the few shillings that they get. If any honorable member met in the streets one of these old men who wanted a glass of beer he would buy it for him. Why not see that that spirit actuates the Pensions Department? I hope that the present practice will be discontinued, and that the taking of a glass of beer will not be made an excuse for the withholding of a pension. I trust that the Minister will advise the department to be a little more lenient, and that, if instructions to economize have been given, they will be withdrawn, so that these old people will not be further persecuted. The withholding of a pension in the case that I have mentioned is an absolute shame. The doctor who attended this man gave evidence in regard to his bodily infirmity, and every one in the institution who knows him gave him a good character. The department insinuates that he was lying, and that he had purchased the bottle of wine for his own consumption. I trust that, as an act of simple justice, the pension of this old man will be restored to him. and that the other cases referred to will be given favorable consideration. </para>

                    <para>.My experience is that pensions have not been discontinued because of the inclusion in the act of the provision which the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> seeks to remove. However, I do not propose to discuss the discontinuance of pensions. I point out that sub-section c of section 17 is used to deprive applicants of their claim for pensions because of a conviction for a misdemeanour committed, in some cases, many years prior to the date of the application for a pension. I remind the committee - and the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> will, no doubt, recall the occasion - of the case of a man whose personal record in Australia was beyond all question, but whose political associations had landed him into difficulty which resulted in his conviction for a misdemeanour.  His  application for a pension was refused because of the provision of the act insisting that an applicant for a pension should be of good character. I would agree with this provision if, in broad outline, the general conduct of the applicant were taken into consideration, but the act is very definite. Under it no person convicted of a serious misdemeanour, no matter how long ago, is able to say that he has always been of good character. There are classes of offences in Australia punishable by severe sentences which are not of the usual type of criminal offences, but are related to offences political in character. Convictions under the Crimes Act may bc regarded as criminal offences, but there are a large number of provisions in the Crimes Act which would convict persons of utterances in a time of stress which were their honest expression of opinion in respect of matters of supreme importance to the individual liberty of citizens. I think this clause is very dangerous in that it does prevent a certain class of applicant from receiving an old-age pension because of offences which, whatever their character, have long been expiated and fully atoned for and, therefore, should not be held against them. I point out to the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> that this provision applies only to applicants for old age pensions, and not to applicants for invalid pensions. </para>

I say that more emphatically because it appears that, increasingly, the State is conjuring up as offences what really amount to the exercise by a citizen of his right of public expression. It could quite easily happen that, under the Arbitration Act, members of trade unions could be convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for participating in strikes. I submit to the Minister for Health that certain statutes of the Commonwealth are not comparable with the ordinary police offences acts or the criminal codes of the States. They are entirely distinctive, because they do not involve ordinary considerations of criminal conduct. The right honorable gentleman will remember that a very distinguished Australian was refused an old-age pension for a long time because of the existence of this provision in the statute-book, and that it was only by subterfuge that a Commonwealth Treasurer was able to circumvent it and provide him with a pension.

If the definite period and amount are excised from the act, we may find the Commissioner of Pensions deciding that a person shall not receive a pension if he has within, say, ten years deprived himself of property, of a value of even considerably less than &#163;100. For this reason, I ask that a specific statement be made on the point by the Minister in charge of the bill. </para>

                <para class="block">I intend, at a later stage, to move a similar amendment to clause 3, which deals with section 22 of the act, and relates to invalid pensions. This discussion, therefore, can cover both old-age and invalid pensions, and the vote may be taken as a test vote covering the two cases. Severe hardship has been inflicted upon some people because it has been ruled by the Pensions Department that certain relatives are adequately maintaining the claimant for the pension. I have in mind the case of a father with an invalid son 28 years of age, and three other children, two daughters and a son, whose ages are twenty years, eighteen years, and fourteen years, respectively. The invalid son applied for a pension, but his claim was rejected on the ground that his father was receiving &#163;5 a week, and was, therefore, able to support him. I interviewed members of this family at Greta yesterday, and learned that the father&#39;s income is now only &#163;4 5s. a week. Surely it would not be contended that that is adequate to meet the needs of the six members of the family, including the invalid son. Section 52m of the Pensions Act has been inoperative since last June, under that provision which is repealed by a later clause in this bill, liberal allowance was made to pensioners&#39; relatives who were required to. make contributions towards the cost of the pension. In the case of a married couple the income allowed was &#163;312 per annum - &#163;6 a week - with a further exemption of &#163;50 for each child, and an additional allowance for the education of children as well as for interest payable upon a mortgage and for contributions made towards the maintenance of unemployed relatives. The allowable income for a single man was &#163;208 per annum, equivalent to &#163;4 a week.  In  the case to which I have just referred the father has an income of only &#163;4 5s. a week - only 5s. a week more than the allowance provided for a single man under section 52m. I, therefore, hope that the Minister will accept my amendment. As the result of the inquisitorial questionnaire sent recently to relatives of claimants for invalid pensions, the department was informed of. the income of the father, and rejected the claim on the ground that the invalid son was being adequately maintained by his father, when, as a matter of fact, he was not living in his father&#39;s house, but in Lang-street, Kurri Kurri. His claim having been rejected on this ground, the lad returned to live with his father, and I submit that he is not being adequately maintained. </para>
                <para>If the Minister will not agree to the repeal of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">fb,</inline> surely he will approve of the continuance of the allowance provided for under section 52m. I make this appeal because the case which I have just cited is typical of many others that have come under my notice. In one, an invalid son, aged 28 years, living in Paxton, has had his claim rejected because his father&#39;s income is &#163;5 10s. a week. Another case is that of a man 73 years of age living at Weston. Having been thrifty during his working years, he accumulated a little money which he invested in property, from which he is now collecting a small amount by way of rent. Because he has this&#39; source of income the department has rejected the claim of his son, aged 44 years, for a &#39; pension, on the ground that he is being adequately maintained. In still another case, the father of a claimant for a pension at Aberdare gets 17s. a day, but the pit in which he is employed works, on an average, only three- days a week. Yet the department considers that his income is adequate  for the maintenance of his invalid son. There is ample evidence that great hardship is undoubtedly being inflicted upon these people. </para>
                <para>I received a letter, dated the 18th March, 1935, from the Pensions Department regarding a claim for an invalid pension, informing me that the claim had been rejected on the ground that the father was employed at the Pelton colliery ; was earning at the rate of &#163;290 a year ; that he owned the home in which the family resided, and in addition to his wife, had only the claimant to maintain, there being no children under the age of sixteen years. From inquiries which I have made I learn that although there are no children under the age of sixteen years, two of the sons are unemployed, and, consequently, have to be maintained by the father. In view of the cases which I have mentioned, showing that the act operates so harshly in many instances, I hope that the Minister will accept my amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">fb</inline> of section 17, which the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> desires to have repealed, deals with applications for old-age pensions. It enacts that no person shall receive an old-age pension unless his relatives, namely, husband, wife, father, mother or children, do not adequately maintain him. This is part of the special legislation passed in 1932, and is unnecessary for the satisfactory administration of the pensions law. Any contribution by the wife is already provided for in another part of the act, and, therefore, any earnings by the wife or husband are actually taken into account in determining the right to a pension. Contributions try sons and daughters towards the assistance of parents are also provided for in another part of the act. It is apparent that this section of the act was originally inserted, and is now being maintained with the object of proving a detriment to parents with children in a fairly good position in life applying for pensions. A father I know is earnestly desirous of a pension, but he has a son who is a doctor, and in view of the present provisions of the act which would advise the son of his application he will not apply for one. He does not desire that his son should be so advised, but he feels that because of his own citizenship he is surely entitled to a pension ; that his own position in life should be considered apart from that of his son. As the act now stands it imposes upon many fathers and mothers a condition requiring them to disclose to their sons or daughters a circumstance which they do not desire to so disclose, as they may feel it humiliates their children. As the act elsewhere provides for taking into account all the income of a parent there is no need for this section, and seeing that it was originally inserted as part of the emergency legislation, and actually used as a detriment to prospective applicants for pensions, it should not now be allowed to remain to continue to work against this section of the people, and possibly deprive them of a right. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#39;&#93;</inline></para>

                    <para>. - On two or three occasions I have endeavoured to elicit from the Minister something definite on a particular point which is working to the detriment of some of the people whom I represent. I asked the Minister a question in connexion with a person, no longer a child but an adult, who wanted an invalid pension - whether that adult has still to be brought under that section of the act under which an invalid pension is refused if the parent adequately maintains the invalid. I always thought that that provision applied to juniors and not to adult invalids. Such a position means that if a father or mother refuses to maintain an invalid son who may be, say, 27 years of age, the son could apply to the department and get a pension ; but so long as his parents do not let him starve, then he is not entitled to the pension. In my opinion, the act was not meant to be interpreted in that way. Will the Minister inform me whether the sub-section applies to an adult invalid who is adequately maintained by his parents, or only to child invalids, so long as these are dependent on their parents? If the act is to be interpreted in the way I have described, a man or woman who happens to be stricken with paralysis can no longer feel independent of his or her parents. It would also mean that an invalid child living with his or her  parents and maintained by the parents would not be entitled to a pension. There would be no need for a pension in a case of that kind, but when the child becomes an adult and still remains an invalid, perhaps at the age of 30, and does not desire to be a burden on his or her parents, can that invalid get a pension? I know that he or she could get a pension if the applicant. and the parents could just so order things that I could approach the Commissioner and prove that the invalid was not being adequately maintained  by  the parents. Consequently, under such circumstances, the parents have to enter into a conspiracy in order that their invalid adult child may receive a pension. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister is not too sure about the interpretation of this clause, will he make inquiries about it so that in such cases as I have described honorable members can secure a ruling one way or another ? I am notasking for this explanation simply out of curiosity; I have been worried with special cases. For instance, I know of the case of an invalid man, 35 years  of  age, who is smarting because he is still dependent on his mother and father. The father who is an engineer by profession, and can keep his son, does not complain, but the son complains about his dependence. The parents have said to me that they do not begrudge keeping their son, but that- the latter continually inquires about the position, feeling that, being a man, his parents should no longer be forced to keep him. I understand that invalid parents are entitled to a pension irrespective of whether or not their children can afford to keep them. Therefore, I contend that the law should cut both ways. Again I ask the Minister to look into this matter, and to make sure of the position. </para>

Under this amending measure that provision is abolished, and the transfer of property will not now be an absolute bar in an application for a pension. </para>

In future, the deprivation of property, whatever the intent, will not be a bar to an applicant receiving a pension. If the commissioner so decides the value of the property so divested may be held against the amount of the pension granted. </para>

                <para>As the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> has intimated, that the vote on section 17 <inline font-style="italic">fb</inline> will guide him as to whether or not he will move an amendment on section 22 <inline font-style="italic">h,</inline> I may speak briefly upon the two points raised. One deals with the adequate maintenance in respect of an old-age pensioner and the other the adequate maintenance of an invalid pensioner. In both cases the revenue must be protected. As pointed out by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> in respect of old-age pensions, in actual practice this usually applies to the maintenance by a son or a daughter; but I maintain that it is necessary to retain in the act some provision whereby the Government shall not be called upon to maintain a pensioner whose children are in affluent circumstances. Section 17 <inline font-style="italic">fb</inline> must be retained for that reason. </para>

                        <para>- It is difficult to canvass the matter of individual cases across the floor of the chamber, particularly when the whole of the facts are not before us. The honorable member for Hunter, with the best possible intentions, finds it difficult to put all the circumstances before the committee. Individual cases should be dealt with departmentally, but in a general way I should say that the maintenance of unemployed members of a family living in a home is taken into account in calculating a pension. </para>

                        <para>- Sub-section 22 <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> was not an integral part of the provisions relating to property or contributions by relatives. It stands by itself. It has been embodied in our pensions acts in respect of invalid pensions almost since it was first introduced. It has been amended once or twice, but is now, I believe, in the actual verbiage of the original act. In 1932 a similar provision was introduced in&#34; respect of old age pensions. After full consideration of the matter, I regret that the Government cannot see its way clear to accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It is a question of fact whether the applicant is being adequately maintained. This provision has been humanely administered by the department in the past. In one case that came under my notice the father was in receipt of what appeared to be a fair income, but a pension was applied for in respect of a child. At first it did not seem as if the pension would be granted, but when inquiries were made into the man&#39;s financial and family position, and his obligations, a case was placed before the Commissioner, who was satisfied that the man could not adequately maintain the child, and  a  pension was granted. Under the act the Commissioner is given discretion&#39; in such cases. </para>

                    <para>.- The Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> said that these provisions were in the act to protect the revenue against abuse, and the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> seems to think that their purpose is to prevent the children of wealthy parents from obtaining invalid pensions. As a matter of fact, it is not necessary for the parents to be wealthy for the department to refuse a pension. I have one case in mind which I have repeatedly brought before the department, and which I intend to persevere with until I get a ruling. It concerns a couple and their invalid daughter, an imbecile who is 30 years of age. The father&#39;s income consists of his superannuation pension of &#163;14S a year. The department, when assessing the pension payable to the daughter, divides the father&#39;s income into three parts, and allots a third to each member of the family, so that the daughter is presumed to be receiving a third of &#163;148. She is then given a pension sufficient to bring her assumed income up to &#163;78 10s. a year. Actually she is receiving only a half pension. Under the Financial Emergency Act the permissible income of a pensioner couple is fixed at &#163;156 a&#39; year, which is &#163;8 more than the income received by the father in the case I have quoted. The department was supplied by me with all the information relevant to the case, including the fact that the father, during the last, twelve months, has had three major operations, and was .preparing to undergo a fourth, while the mother had been  for a considerable time an inmate of a hospital. Those facts were known to the Commissioner, because I made it my business to1 acquaint Mm with them. But even then: he would not alter his decision ; he stuck to his precious formula, under which be divided the father&#39;s income into three parts. He agreed, however, that if I could produce the bills for medical attention to the parents and the daughter, and evidence that money had been paid for assistance in the home, he would reconsider the case. I produced that evidence, and the Commissioner at last decided to grant the full pension. I maintain that he should have done so in the first instance. If this case is typical of others, then every invalid pensioner ii-: New South Wales, whose  circumstances  are similar, has been deprived <inline font-style="italic">&#39;.ti</inline> his pension. The act is not being  administered  for the purpose of protecting the revenue against abuse, or of preventing wealthy people from allowing their children to become pensioners ; it is being administered in defiance of the financial emergency legislation, which gives the permissible income of the parents, from all sources, as &#163;3 a week. I maintain that anything less than that amount should not be taken into account. When the income of a husband and wife falk below &#163;3 a week the Pensions Department should not compel them to maintain an invalid child, either wholly or partly, particularly when that child is over 21 years of age. I am not telling the committee&#39; a fairy story. The Minister has all the information in regard to  these  cases. From the Commissioner himself I ascertained the method adopted by the department. I asked whether these things were done by regulation, and he replied, &#34; No ; i t is just the department&#39;s&#39; method.&#34; There is nothing in the act to justify that action ; no regulation sanctions it. It is merely a formula decided upon by the pensions officials themselves, in defiance of the Pensions Act and of the financial emergency legislation. I am confident that, not one honorable member would&#39; support the amendment of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> if he thought that he Was doing something which would result in wealthy parents allowing their children to draw the pension. If the experience of the honorable member foi Hunter has been the same as mine - and&#39; the  particulars included in the Commissioner&#39;s letter are now in the hands of the Acting Treasurer - there is justification for the amendment which has been moved, and all honorable members ought to support this attempt to bring about <inline font-style="italic">sr.</inline> improvement of the position. The Minister said that the action taken by the department was actuated by a desire to prevent abuses. I challenge him to find as many persons who have abused the pensions law as we can find persons who have been deprived of their right to . pension by the operation of the scheme or regulation which is being enforced by the Pensions Department. There is protection for the department agains: the applicant for a pension whose parents can keep him; but there is no protection for other applicants. It is not a. matter of people abusing their privileges, but rather, is one of pensioners being robbed by the department. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not see the necessity for section 17 <inline font-style="italic">fb</inline> for the reason that there is nothing to stop a parent from getting the pension, if he leaves his son&#39;s home. I have come across scores of cases in which parents could not get the pension while residing with their children, but there was nothing to prevent them from getting it if they lived in their own homes. I know of a man who received &#163;200 a year from his wealthy daughter in India, and, in addition, was paid &#163;1 a week by the Pensions Department for years. Provision was made to prevent such things from being done. The law was amended, not because the children would not support their parents, but because the parents claimed the pension, although they were supported by their children. </para>

                <para>Section 22 raises an entirely different matter. I have in mind a case of a girl 31 years of age suffering from Parkinson&#39;s disease, whose parents have an income of only &#163;4 5s. a week. Two other children are out of work. I appealed to <inline font-style="italic">the Commissioner</inline> three times on their behalf, but without success. Like the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> I cannot understand why the department regards as children invalids 21 years of age and over. I know of one case in which a parent whose income is &#163;4 5s. a week is getting half payment for an invalid child, whereas another parent, with the same income, is refused a pension for a. child over * 21 years of age. I confess that the interpretation of these provisions by the department has always been puzzling to me. I have not encountered the same difficulty in connexion with old-age pensions. Should difficulty arise in the case of old-age pensioners, it is sufficient that they get into their own home for them to receive a pension. If they are not receiving sustenance from their children, nothing can prevent them from getting a pension; but the position is different in the case of invalids. </para>
                <para>In a <inline font-style="italic">motor</inline> accident some time ago a son 25 years of age became dependent on his parents, whose income was &#163;4 5s. a week. It is unfair for the department to say that son was adequately supported by his parents. Being over 21 years of age, he should have been treated as an invalid for whom his parents were not responsible. According to our laws, a parent has no jurisdiction over a child after it has attained the age of 21 years. Why is it that a person over 21 years of age is regarded by the department as being adequately maintained by his parents, when that is not so? I was pleased to hear the case mentioned by the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom),</inline> and shall approach the department in the matter from the other angle of adequate maintenance in the home. I sometimes think the administration makes a differentiation between certain members of the House, because, apparently, some can get things done and others cannot. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Minister has not accepted the amendment, the arguments against which have been very weak. The Government has decided to repeal another section of the act, thus exempting people in affluent circumstances from, the obligation to contribute towards the pensions of their relatives, although a liberal allowance up to &#163;312 a year was already made. In a letter which I have here, dated the 18th of this month, it is shown that the father&#39;s income is only &#163;290 a year, yet his invalid son is refused a pension. The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> said that there was no compulsion, but no parent w&#39;ill order his child out of his house and refuse to keep him simply because he is not granted an invalid pension. Yet one infers that that is intended to he done. This boy at Greta is in such a state of health that he absolutely can only crawl about the floor. He is intelligent and well read, and said to me, &#34; I am only an encumbrance on my parents. When my pension was refused me, my parents&#39; income was &#163;5 a week, and they have three other children - two sisters and a brother - to keep. The only property they had was the home in which they lived. They had a 5-acre piece of ground which they cultivated, but they could not afford to pay the rates of &#163;1 ls. lOd. a year on it. They did not get a sufficient return from the citrus  fruit they grew on it to pay the rates.&#34; I pleaded with the lad not to regard himself as an encumbrance, because his parents loved him, and his attitude would only cause them further unhappiness.&#39; At one time, to test the assertion that if he were living somewhere else he could get the invalid pension, the boy went to a relative in Lang-street, Kurri Kurri, yet his pension was refused him there, because the father&#39;s income was considered adequate maintenance. Those are the facts, no matter how much the Commissioner may deny them. The father&#39;s income is now only &#163;4 5s. a week. Under section 52m, &#163;6 a week was allowed for a married couple and &#163;50 for each child, and a liberal education allowance was made as well. That section is being repealed, yet the Government refuses to repeal section 17 <inline font-style="italic">fb</inline> and section 22 7?. The Government must have a motive, which is, I think, that very few people are affected by sections <inline font-style="italic">17fb</inline> and 22/t, whereas thousands are affected by section 52m. Very few votes are involved in the one ease, whereas thousands of children received those iniquitous questionnaires under section 52m. It is a scandalous shame that the Government, should refuse to do justice to a few poor people who have invalid children. The Government is callous and brutal in its administration, if it allows injustices like these to be inflicted without granting a remedy. </para>

                        <para>- I absolutely believe that the Government is agreeing to the repeal of section 52m because it affects so many votes. The department stated in the other case thai the father had a wife and no children under sixteen, apart from the claimant, to maintain, yet I am informed by the Mayor of Cessnock, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnny</inline> Brown, who brought this case under my notice, that there are two other sons unemployed, who are not allowed to work for the dole because the father&#39;s income is above the limit fixed in the State of New South Wales. They, and the invalid child, and the husband and wife, have all to be maintained out of the &#163;290 a year. There are so few cases of this kind that nobody makes a fuss about them, but a big hueandcry was raised about the questionnaire sent out to relatives under section 52m. Threats were made by some who were in affluent circumstances, including members of Parliament in New South Wales, absolutely challenging the Government to take them to court and compel them to pay, but the Government was not game to accept the challenge. I do not wish to give the impression that those people were not willing to contribute to their parents&#39; support; they did that voluntarily, but they strongly objected to being forced to do it. Many of us would take up the same attitude. The Minister in his second reading speech said he was taking away the compulsory character of the act by repealing section 52m, yet he is actually imposing compulsion  under sections 17 <inline font-style="italic">fb</inline> and 22 <inline font-style="italic">h.</inline> Therefore, if a father were callous enough to say to his invalid son - &#34; Get out of my home &#34;, the department would give him a pension ; but it forces an injustice upon the parent by reason of the love which he has for his son. Seeing that a disability of a larger number of pensioners is being removed, I appeal once again to the Minister to do justice to the smaller section in whose interests I am now pleading. The cost would not be more than &#163;2,000 a year throughout the Commonwealth. 374 <inline font-style="italic">Invalid and Old-age</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Pensions Bill</inline> 1935. </para>

                            <para>by adding at the end thereof the following  sub-section :  -  (3.) For the purposes of an invalid pension, a person who is afflicted with a permanent injury or invalidity shall be regarded as permanently incapacitated, if, by reason of the nature of his injury or invalidityhe cannot reasonably be expected to maintain himself by his own labour,&#34;. </para>

                <para class="block">Clearly the intention of the act was, that a man who by reason of permanent injury or disability was prevented from earning his own living should receive an invalid pension. But it has not been administered in that way. It appears to me that the administration gives the go-by to the words &#34; for work &#34;, which occur in one of the earlier sections, and says, &#34; If, as a matter of fact, this person could do work if he could get it, he shall not be entitled to the invalid pension.&#34; I shall give two illustrations that have come within my personal knowledge of the way in which the section is applied. The first is the case of a man in a very advanced stage of consumption. He was told that he could work, that he was not totally and permanently incapacitated, and that he must apply for sustenance. The sustenance authorities rejected his claim, and said that his was a case for the benevolent societies. It is to these societies that a man is sent who is considered unfit to work for sustenance. He again applied for the invalid pension. I drew the attention of the department to the position that had been taken up by the sustenance authorities. The department said that it would take up the matter with them. It did so, with the result that the local foreman of the sustenance department suggested that, in order to save further trouble, he would place the man on his pay roll. The foreman says that he is incapable of doing any class of work. He attends the job every day, but merely potters about, and for this he draws sustenance. I think it was clearly the intention of the legislature that in such a case the man should have been granted an invalid pension. The difficulty is that the departmental doctor examines the man and says &#34;I cannot certify that you are permanently and totally incapacitated, if you are able to undertake some class of work. After all you have two hands and two legs.&#34; </para>
                <para>Another case is that of an epileptic woman who was refusedan invalid pension because the doctor certified that she was not totally and permanently incapacitated. I suppose that if she were living in her own home, she would be able to do housework. But the woman could not get employment because no employer would know when these fits might come upon her. This woman has made repeated efforts to secure employment, but has been unable to do so. These persons, by reason of their invalidity, cannot reasonably be expected to maintain themselves by their own labour. My desire is to make the act express clearly the intention of the legislature. </para>
                <para>The amendment leaves to the Commissioner the decision of the matter. He takes into account all relevant circumstances, and if he decides that the applicant cannot be reasonably expected to maintain himself by his own labour as a result of his infirmity, he will grant the applicant an invalid pension. </para>

                        <para>- The word &#34; totally &#34; does not appear in the act. The act uses the phrase, &#34; permanently incapacitated for work&#34;. The word &#34; totally &#34; is introduced by regulation. It may be said that the intention of the legislature was that, as a condition pre cedent to the granting of a pension, a person should be permanently and totally incapacitated. I am concerned in putting into&#39; effect the real intention of parliament. I think that formerly before the need for economy was impressed upon the Pensions Department the section was interpreted in this way, but with the pressing need for economy persons who, in the opinion of the departmental doctors, were capable of doing any work at all were excluded from eligibility for an invalid pension. I propose this amendment in the belief that it will give a new orientation to this part of the act. It is fair and reasonable and will give effect to the real intention of parliament. </para>

                    <para>. -  If the amendment of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> were accepted, it would mean that the &#39;whole of the administration of the invalid pensions would be radically altered. The honorable member has clearly of design left out the word &#34; totally &#34;, because, obviously, he meant to cover cases not only of total invalidity, but also of some unspecified degree of partial invalidity. I submit to the committee that the honorable member&#39;s amendment brings into one&#39;s line of vision partial incapacity for work, and I suggest that if we once get into that field, the whole of the invalid pensions provisions will become unworkable, or will entail very heavy additional expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth Although it is very difficult to arrive at an estimate of what this additional expenditure would be, &#163;1,000,000 is the lowest estimate, the upper limit, being about &#163;2,000,000. The honorable member himself admitted that the acceptance of his amendment would mean taking economic considerations into account, including the location - whether town or country - in which the applicant resides. </para>

However, I say that it would be impossible to avoid considerations such as those I have mentioned if his amendment were accepted. For these and many other reasons it is regretted that the Government is unable to accept the amendment, and I move - </para>

                <para class="block">The acceptance of this amendment will make the provisions of the bill retrospective as from the date when these sections were incorporated in the act. They were inserted in October, 1932, but did not become operative until the 1st January, 1933. The amendment has been circulated sufficiently long for the Government to have given consideration to it. If it is carried,the Government will have no claim whatever on pensioners&#39; property. The amount of money involved is insignificant compared with the measure of injustice that has been inflicted upon those who, perhaps, were without any means of making refunds, but voluntarily agreed to accept the demands of the Pensions Department. In isolated cases, persons upon whom demands were made were forced to raise the amount involved by way of mortgage on properties which had been left to them. As members of the Country party, and particularly their&#39; leader, who is now Acting Prime Minister, were strongly opposed to the incorporation in the act of the provisions relating to the claims on the property of pensioners, we on this side can very well expect them now to support this amendment, the effect of which will be to make retrospective the repeal provisions of this bill. The amendment is entirely in accord with the spirit and intention of the Government in introducing this bill. One of the arguments advanced by the Minister responsiblefor the inclusion in the act of these provisions was that their effect would be to discourage applicants who, in other circumstances, might lodge claims for pensions. Because of the sentimental value attaching to the old home, many persons in every respect eligible for the pension resolved to suffer inconvenience and hardship rather than do anything to jeopardise their equity in the home. The Government has realized that the provisions then inserted in the act did not achieve their purpose, and were of no real value. Consequently, it has decided to repeal them. I, therefore, submit that is is not asking too much to make the repeal provisions retrospective. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment moved by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> leads one first of all to consider the refunds that would have to be made under section 52 o, which provides for the recovery of pension payments after the 31st December, 1932, from pensioners who own property exceeding &#163;400 in value. In some cases, claims made under this section related to winners of lottery prizes, or those who had received fairly considerable sums of money under wills. &#39;I am sure that honorable members would not suggest that the Government should not persist in its claims in respect of such cases. The principal section under discussion is, I think 52 e. I am glad to note a change of heart on the part of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley).</inline> Previously he suggested that the enactment of this section would involve considerable hardship. Now he claims that no cases of hardship were involved. I think the simplest plan for me is to state the amounts that were due to the Government&#39; in respect of pensioners&#39; property, and the amounts actually collected. An amount of &#163;140,000 was claimable on the estates of pensioners, but only &#163;42,000 was actually collected by the Government, &#163;50,000 being in course of collection. The whole of the balance was either waived or arrangements were made for deferred or time payments. </para>

                        <para>- The &#39; facts disclosed amply justify the attitude of the Government, which has been extremely liberal in its interpretation of the provisions relating to claims on pensioners&#39; property. It collected money only in cases where the estates of pensioners could very well afford to pay without inflicting hardship upon relatives. In no case has the Government sold up any property of deceased pensioners. In more than 60 per cent, of the cases the Government has not insisted on its claims, ot it has allowed payments to he deferred in some way which will, in effect, result in the money not now being paid. </para>

                        <para>.The Minister said that there has never been any hardship inflicted on pensioners iri this matter and that the Government made a claim only in cases where people could afford to pay back the money. I have had a case of the death of an oldaged pensioner who had been insured for between &#163;50 and &#163;60, out of which, after funeral expenses amounting to &#163;25 or &#163;30, and other expenses, had been paid, his daughter, who was an invalid pensioner, had left only &#163;9 10s., for which amount the Minister sent her a bill. Had that girl not had a good representative in this Parliament the Government would have taken that money. </para>

                    the report being accompanied by an admirable inset photograph of the honorable member. In that case the Government did not make a demand as the honorable member claims. It merely presented a statement setting out the amount that was due to the Government and asking whether hardship was to be pleaded. Hardship was pleaded on the part of the person concerned, and, consequently, the Government made no claim on that estate.

                    <para>.I wish to deal briefly with a point raised from time to time with reference to the money received in the form of contributions by relatives. The reason given  380 <inline font-style="italic">Invalid and Old-age</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Pensions Bill</inline> 1935. by the Government for the repeal of this provision has been stated to be that the cost of administration was unwarranted. I submit that that is incorrect. I contend that after having brought this legislation into operation the Government did not dare to enforce it. Honorable members on this side of the chamber opposed it from the outset, and consequently were not keen on its being brought into effect. We are pleased that that was not done; but it is only fair to state what has actually happened, and in order to do so I propose to quote from the Auditor-General&#39;s report of this year which bears out the point I have endeavoured to make on several different occasions during the past months in regard to relatives&#39; contributions.

                    <para>The legislation, which came into force on the 13th October, 1932, contemplated both voluntary and compulsory contributions. There appears to have been delay in giving effect to Parliament&#39;s intention as regards these contributions. Little had been done when, in September. 19.33. the Commissioner of Pensions directed that investigations were to be confined to pensions granted since the 13th October, 1932. However, in March. 1934, the commissioner authorized a complete investigation, and this was in progress when in June, 1934, Cabinet decided to suspend the operation of the section. It has been stated in the press that the Government&#39;s effort to induce relatives of pensioners to contribute towards cost ofpensions were ineffectual, but when the operation of the section <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> suspended, preliminary investigations were far from complete and little, if anything, had been done to enforce compulsory contributions . . . Notwithstanding the delays in investigation, contributions amounting bo &#163;2,345 were received during the year, and whan investigation ceased the approximate annual income from contributions was &#163;6.433. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is trying to do that. On several occasions he allowed a definite misstatement of facts to be published in the press throughout Australia. I asked questions from time to time, and it was only at the third attempt that I was able to obtain information to prove that I was right and that the Minister was wrong. The Auditor-General points out that when investigations ceased the approximate annual income from contributions was &#163;6,433. I am not suggesting that we wish this legislation to be enforced, but that after passing it the Government did not dare to enforce it, and caused false and untrue statements to be published in the press throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to give the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> a final opportunity to move the closure, inasmuch as I have not had an opportunity to discuss this bill at any stage. In principle, the bill is one with which the party of which I am a member naturally agrees, inasmuch&#39; as its persistent agitation has resulted in this belated measure being brought before the House - a measure designed to remove a number of injustices heartlessly imposed by this Government upon the poorest people in the community. But it is a matter of great regret to me that the bill has been forced through in a manner which has prevented me from expressing the views which I strongly hold regarding the restitution of moneys to those persons who have already made payments to the Government, and by reason of their prompt payment are now penalized, whereas those who resisted the law are relieved from any further obligation. I make my protest on this third reading against the conditions which made it necessary, and against members having been denied an opportunity to discuss, it with a view to making it what it ought to be - a measure to make full restitution for the wrong which this Government has done to invalid and old-age pensioners. With that protest, I leave the matter, and I do not thank the Minister for having at this late hour taken the final opportunity to prevent members on this side from expressing their views. </para>

I told the honorable member that I would make a statement setting gut the facts in regard to it. I now wish to inform the honorable member that the Government has not purchased, nor does it intend to purchase, any King&#39;s Jubilee medals for distribution to the children of Australia. In addition to a medal which will be struck in England for official distribution by  His  Majesty in commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his accession to the throne,  His  Majesty has approved of medals, with Their Ma jesties&#39; effigy on the obverse side and a view of Windsor Castle on the reverse side, being struck by the Royal Mint, London, for sale to the public-. These medals are of two sizes, and the Royal Mint, London, has arranged to make available quantities for sale in Australia through the Melbourne and Perth Mints at prices of 25s. and 3s. respectively. </para>

                            <para>The market for citrus fruits in India was investigated by the Department of Commerce during 1932, when the possibilities were brought to the notice of Australian exporters. There  is  a limited market available in India for oranges, lemons, and grape fruit. Australian exporters have not participated in the trade to any extent, owing to intensive competition in these markets, supplies being obtained from South Africa, Rhodesia, Palestine, Spain, United States of America, and Japan. The absence of direct shipping facilities between Australian ports and  ports  on the Bay of Bengal also hindered exporters in  their  efforts to participate. </para>
